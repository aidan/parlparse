 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. The report is an important document, which points to the changing role of the IMF and, indeed, other international institutions. The emphasis must now be on crisis prevention rather than crisis resolution, the transparency that is necessary for countries to report what is happening in their fiscal and monetary policies and, therefore, for programmes of proper surveillance, whereby we can examine at first hand what is happening not only to countries&#146; fiscal and monetary but their corporate positions. That is why the proposal for extending article IV reports to cover those issues, and for an international form of surveillance as well as national reports, is important. I applaud the report.

 I suspect that middle east issues will form a big part of the G8 agenda in St. Petersburg, but I can assure my hon. Friend that African issues will be discussed. I can also assure him that the Germany presidency of the G8 next year fully intends to make development a central part of what it does. The IMF and World Bank meetings in September are focusing heavily on issues of development and providing finance for it. There is also a UN reform commission that is looking into how the UN can play a far more effective role in development in future. Far from those issues being off the agenda after Gleneagles, they are definitively on the agenda, and I believe that the public action by non-governmental organisations, Churches and faith groups, which have kept it on the agenda over the past year, will also keep it on the agenda in future years.

Is that responsible? Should not something be done about it? The citizens advice bureau in my area wrote to me recently about growing debt among the elderly, because they are encouraged to borrow. What can the Government do about it?</p>

 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns, and join him in praising the work of citizens advice bureaux. I met them a week or so ago, and they are in the process of hiring 350 personal finance advisers, precisely to give that kind of advice. It is often the case, however, that people fall into debt because they suddenly and unexpectedly face unemployment, family break-up or ill health. In those circumstances, going into debt would be the wrong thing, and we need to give people proper advice and support. In general, I do not think it right to say that banks should discourage people from taking out loans or credit cards, which in fact play an important part in our economy. The fact that so many more people in our society have mortgages and are home owners is a good thing, but we need to make sure that people have proper advice and support, especially at times of crisis, and I commend the CAB for all its work.</p>

 Is this empty document really what the Prime Minister called the vital foundation stone of his spending review and announced at the Labour party conference last year?

How can Labour have spent &#163;4 trillion over nine years and have an NHS that is sacking doctors and nurses and a Home Office that is not fit for purpose? Surely a serious attempt to find savings would have addressed soaring public sector construction costs and falling public sector productivity, but the document does none of those things.

which should be supported on an all-party basis. My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) is right that in addition to health, education, policing, security, and our defence responsibilities, housing has a priority in the future spending round.</p>

 Can the Chancellor explain why, in the Home Office section of the report, identity cards are not even mentioned as one of the Home Office spending priorities? Is that because the Treasury was responsible for the leak by David Foord of the Office of Government Commerce, who talked about the unaffordability of the ID card project and a &#147;lack of clear benefits&#148;? He said:</p>

 Sometimes I think that the hon. Gentleman lives in a completely unreal world. Identity cards are the policy of this Government. I should have thought that the more that people see the chances of their identity being stolen by organised crime, the more they would support identity cards. The Opposition parties have made a very big mistake in opposing identity cards, which are part of the spending settlement for the Home Office.</p>

 As someone who has never wanted cuts in hospitals and schools, but wants to reduce waste and inefficiency, I obviously welcome the Chancellor&#146;s latter-day conversion to the idea that we can achieve efficiency gains in the public sector. This time, has he consulted with the staff in advance and how many posts will have to go to meet these new, interesting targets?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is chairman of the Conservative party&#146;s economic competitiveness policy group, so there will be an interesting debate in that group between those who believe that we are doing something serious, as he does, and those who do not take seriously the fact that a major change is taking place in administrative budgets. As for the numbers, 80,000 civil servants, particularly at the DWP and the HMRC, will be replaced. As a net figure it is nearly 40,000, and as a gross figure it is over 40,000 now. We will reach the 80,000 figure by 2008, and we will introduce further proposals for the next spending round, so that we can ensure that we provide the most resources for the front-line caring services, which are the priority for the Government and, I know, are the first priority for the people of Britain. I welcome the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s support in this case, but can he inform and educate the shadow Chancellor on these matters?</p>

If the Chancellor has a statement to make, he should come to the House and make a proper oral statement, which would give a proper opportunity for all Members to question him on it. Perhaps his unwillingness to do so has more to do with the fact that the fundamental savings review was an idea announced by the Prime Minister at the Labour party conference, not by the Chancellor.

Before the right hon. Gentleman prepares his standard response to me, which is about how many more nurses there are in my area, perhaps he will let me know instead why respite care at St. Mark&#146;s hospital, Maidenhead is under threat, Townlands hospital is under threat of closure and maternity services have been cut at Wycombe hospital&#151;all affecting my constituents.</p>

I entirely accept that, wherever possible, it is better for oral statements rather than written statements to be made to the House, and we will not keep her unsatisfied in that respect this week, next week or the week after. However, many statements have to be made by way of written ministerial statements. It is a characteristic of all Governments at all times that many announcements tend to be delayed until the last minute before recesses. Written ministerial statements were an innovation that we introduced because they are better than planted parliamentary questions, but I am encouraging my colleagues to ensure that, whenever possible, written ministerial statements are published before the last day.

Nor will I mention the fact that between 1997 and 2005 the number of doctors in the health area that covers the right hon. Lady&#146;s constituency increased by 1,400. I will mention, however, that overall waiting lists have fallen by 370,000 over the past nine years. The average wait for in-patient treatment is now 7.7 weeks, and waits of more than nine months are down by more than 118,000 since 1997. I am grateful to the right hon.

 I can take such criticism from the Liberal Democrats, who have consistently expressed their concerns about the Extradition Act 2003.

We debated the matter at great length, not only yesterday but during the passage of the 2003 Act and when the matter was debated Upstairs under affirmative resolution procedure, which designated the United States as a part 2 country, notwithstanding the fact that it had not ratified the treaty. The Liberal Democrats voted against the order when it was presented on the Floor of the House on 15 December 2003. We voted in favour of it. The right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para6"><a name="06071354000404">People cannot escape poverty if there is war and insecurity. We will therefore increase our efforts in fragile states and invest more in at least 10 countries where security is a major issue. That will mean help with reintegrating ex-combatants, supporting access to justice, monitoring human rights and reducing the spread of small arms, including through an international arms trade treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para7"><a name="06071354000405">Peace and good governance are also essential for the economic growth needed to create jobs and raise incomes. We will support the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa&#151;which has already helped to secure investment of &#163;1.4 billion in a range of projects&#151;and the investment climate facility. We will double our funding for research in science and technology, agriculture, adapting to climate change and new drugs and vaccines. We will help poor people to get better access to markets to sell their goods, and to finance to support their livelihoods. We will also continue to press for a trade round that enables developing countries to earn their way out of poverty, while meeting our pledge to provide &#163;100 million a year in aid for trade by 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para8"><a name="06071354000406">Everyone should have decent health care, education, water and sanitation, and social security when times are hard, and UK aid is already helping Governments to bring those to more of their citizens. With our aid rising to meet the UN 0.7 per cent. target by 2013, we will increase our spending on these public services to at least half of our bilateral aid budget. We will make long-term-commitments through 10-year plans, so that countries can make long-term decisions to hire staff, build schools and clinics and abolish user fees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para9"><a name="06071354000407">We will increase spending on education to &#163;1 billion a year by 2010 and, having doubled our spending on water and sanitation in Africa to &#163;95 million a year by 2007, we will double it again by 2010, because clean water saves lives and helps more girls to go to school. We will also significantly increase our spending on social security in at least 10 countries in Asia and Africa over the next three years, because we know that one of the most effective ways to break the cycle of destitution that affects the poorest and most vulnerable is to give them a hand up to get them back on their feet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para10"><a name="06071354000408">All that will need to be done in a world that is changing&#151;in which there is population growth, rapid urbanisation, the depletion of natural resources and climate change. That will be the ultimate test of global good governance, so we will work to secure international agreement on a long-term stabilisation goal; seek to ensure that developing countries are able fully to participate in any international negotiations; and support countries in adapting to climate change while generating the investment needed for clean energy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para11"><a name="06071354000409">We will also need an international development system fit for this century, not the last. We will push for reform of the United Nations, so that there is centrally pooled funding and a single plan in each country; an integrated UN humanitarian system that responds faster when crisis strikes; further reform of European  <br>

aid, so that the European Union can play its full part in international development; and a better system for holding all of us&#151;developed and developing countries alike&#151;to account for the promises that we have made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para12"><a name="06071354000410">Finally, because this is a task for all of us, but particularly for the next generation, we will double our investment in development education so that every child in the UK has a chance to learn about the issues that shape their world. We will set up a new scheme to help UK groups to build links with developing countries and expand opportunities for our young people and diaspora communities to volunteer in those countries and to undertake internships with development charities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para13"><a name="06071354000411">Madam Deputy Speaker, there is much for all of us to do. We have listened to the voices of people in developing countries, who have told us all what they want. We listened to the British people as they campaigned to make poverty history and, with their and the House&#146;s support and the proposals I am setting out today, the UK will play its part in helping people to eliminate poverty and to change their lives, and thus our world, for the better.</p>

<p><a name="st_o182"><a name="06071354000412"><a name="60713-0007.htm_spnew14"><a name="06071354000904"><b>Mr. Andrew Mitchell (Sutton Coldfield) (Con):</b>
 I thank the Secretary of State for his customary courtesy in giving us advance sight of his White Paper this morning and of his statement on it. The whole House will understand that it is a White Paper of more than usual importance&#151;not only to the hundreds of thousands, indeed millions, of our fellow citizens in Britain who care very deeply about these matters, but also to those living in a dangerous world where poverty and conflict breed anger and deep disaffection. We must demonstrate that Britain has the determination and the leadership to make the contribution that both our self-interest and our moral duty demand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para14"><a name="06071354000413">I very much hope that the Secretary of State will feel that he draws strength from the fact that this is not a Labour or a Conservative agenda, but rather a British agenda. All mainstream parties in Britain are committed to the 0.7 per cent. target by 2013. On this side of the House, we are as determined as the Government to ensure that the British contribution to lifting the living standards of the poorest, combating disease and illiteracy, promoting good governance and improving multi-national institutions is effective and successful. We may have differences of opinion about how best to deliver some of the noble aims and objectives set out in the White Paper, but those aims and objectives have our wholehearted support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para15"><a name="06071354000414">We look forward now to studying the White Paper and note that the House will have an opportunity to debate it next Thursday. At this early stage, I should like to ask the Secretary of State a number of questions. First, he has said that good governance is at the heart of his White Paper. We acknowledge the steps that the Government have already taken, building as they have on the foundations laid by Chris Patten, Lynda Chalker and the last Conservative Government, but more needs to be done. I am pleased that the Secretary of State has said today that he will in future regularly assess the quality and transparency of government. I would like to ask him, though, what form that monitoring will take, who will do it and, most importantly, whether it will be independent of his Department?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para16"><a name="06071354000415">Secondly, the Secretary of State mentioned in respect of good governance a new unit to investigate money laundering. That is of interest to other Departments and agencies of the Government, so what discussions has he had with colleagues to ensure that the process is properly joined up and co-ordinated?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para17"><a name="06071354000416">Thirdly, the Secretary of State has rightly spoken up for an international arms trade treaty, but he will be aware of the deeply disappointing conclusion and lack of progress at the recent international conference. What is he doing to re-energise this important effort ahead of the UN General Assembly later this year?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para18"><a name="06071354000417">Fourthly, the Secretary of State set out his plans to spend more in fragile states, but how does he intend to ensure that such help gets through to the most needy on the ground? What steps will he take to work through deeply committed and effective non-governmental organisations such as Oxfam, working, for example, in Darfur? The shadow Foreign Secretary and I recently saw the work it does there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para19"><a name="06071354000418">Fifthly, the Secretary of State spoke of the importance of securing a successful trade round that enables countries to earn their way out of poverty. He will know that the next few days are critical in persuading the key parties to the talks to give a little more to avoid the calamity of failure. What steps are the Secretary of State and, in particular, the Prime Minister taking to reinvigorate the negotiations in the margins of the G8 and beyond? Do not recent developments in China and India, where millions have been lifted out of extreme poverty, demonstrate that access to markets and trade are a vital component of prosperity?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para20"><a name="06071354000419">Sixthly, the Secretary of State rightly spoke of the need to update and reform the international institutions on which international development depends. In particular, he mentioned the United Nations. In my experience, it is an organisation that attracts people of the highest calibre and idealism&#151;people like Mark Malloch Brown, the Deputy Secretary-General&#151;but it is floundering because of an outdated organisational structure. What ideas does the Secretary of State have to make the much-vaunted &#147;responsibility to protect&#148;, enthusiastically embraced by all nations at the UN summit last year, meaningful to people suffering in Darfur, Burma or Zimbabwe? How far should it impose on the international community a responsibility to intervene?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para21"><a name="06071354000420">In his statement, the Secretary of State mentioned future reform of EU aid. As he knows, we have reservations about the fact that aid channelled through the EU does not always reach the poorest or those who most need our support. What can he tell the House about his plans for leading such reform within the EU, which would bring EU aid closer to the ideal that we both share?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="60713-0007.htm_para22"><a name="06071354000421">The Secretary of State has made clear the potentially disastrous effects of climate change, particularly for the developing world, whether in the deserts of Africa or the flood plains of Bangladesh, which I am visiting on Monday. Will he tell us what structural changes his Department is making to address that problem and the interface between development and climate change?</p>

<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>13 July 2006 : Column 1496</b><br>
adequate and rigorous attention to the independent evaluation of aid effectiveness, particularly to outputs and outcomes, we welcome what the Secretary of State has said and applaud the emphasis that he has placed today on the importance of good governance.</p>

<p><a name="st_o183"><a name="06071354000423"><a name="60713-0008.htm_spnew0"><a name="06071354000905"><b>Hilary Benn:</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for supporting the White Paper. It is indeed, in the broadest sense, the product of politics and of our own form of good governance. As the hon. Gentleman mentioned two of my predecessors from the Conservative party, who occupied the position that I now have the privilege to hold, let me say that part of the reason why I am able to announce increased spending on education and on a doubling again of investment in water and sanitation is that we have a rising aid budget. While I welcome the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman approaches his job and what he has said today, it has to be said that, in the end, we should all be judged by what we do when we have the chance to do it, rather than by what we say when we are not in power. People will have memories about what has happened in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para1"><a name="06071354000424">To deal with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific questions, we will undertake the assessment ourselves, but we will draw on a wide range of sources. It will include others who are looking at the quality of governance and we will obviously talk to the Governments of the countries concerned. The fact that we will publish that will mean that there is transparency, and if others have a different view of our assessment they will no doubt be able to speak up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para2"><a name="06071354000425">On the new unit to fight corruption and money laundering, I have, of course, discussed it with my right hon. Friends. I believe that it is absolutely right and proper that, in addition to the contribution of officers from the Met police and City of London police, DFID should contribute. As the hon. Gentleman knows, if we can be more effective in fighting corruption, the development benefits will be enormous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para3"><a name="06071354000426">On the arms trade treaty, the short answer is that we will continue our efforts to persuade others in the international community that that is the right approach to take. If my memory serves me correctly, about 50 countries in the world support the principle of an arms trade treaty, and the consequences of the unfettered flow of arms are always to be seen in conflict, death and destruction. We are making the case and we are working hard to encourage other countries to support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para4"><a name="06071354000427">It is, of course, important to do more work in fragile states and the answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is that we will work with a variety of partners. Where it is possible to work with a country&#146;s Government, we will do so in the right circumstances, and we will also work with NGOs and other international partners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para5"><a name="06071354000428">On the trade talks, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Prime Minister has been working very hard since the failure of last year&#146;s Hong Kong talks to try to get the discussions back on track. He is doing so as we speak in the run-up to the G8 summit this weekend. The question is how the logjam between the three big blocs can be broken. The Prime Minister has done as much, if not more, than anyone else in the world to try to break that logjam, but it requires all parties to recognise the need to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para7"><a name="06071354000430">On the responsibility to protect, we need a combination of political will and the Government have demonstrated that&#151;as the hon. Gentleman referred to Darfur&#151;in pressing very strongly in the UN Security Council for sanctions, for the UN force to be allowed to come in and for referring what happened in Darfur to the International Criminal Court. That is one aspect of the responsibility to protect. The other thing that we need to do is to build the capacity to act. That is why we have been such a strong support of both AMIS&#151;the African Union Mission in Sudan&#151;in Darfur and building an Africa stand-by capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para8"><a name="06071354000431">On EU aid, it is a question of both European Community aid&#151;which has undoubtedly improved in recent years, but still has some way to go, particularly in ensuring that the EC has the right skills in-country&#151;and the quality of aid of other EU members states, because almost all the growth in aid over the next five years will come from Europe. Therefore, part of what we will do is to talk to our partners about ways in which we can work more effectively together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para9"><a name="06071354000432">On climate change, the permanent secretary is undertaking a skills review in DFID precisely to do what the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para10"><a name="06071354000433">I hope that the hon. Gentleman can rest assured that I will continue to be determined to ensure that we keep an eye on aid effectiveness, because in the end all that work and all the policies laid out in the White Paper are for a purpose, which is to demonstrate to people that our international development effort makes a difference&#151;and to do that, we must show results.</p>

 I strongly commend my right hon. Friend&#146;s statement, as well as the White Paper that underlies it. He will have widespread support for the whole concept of capacity building, which is absolutely vital not simply in the fight against corruption, but in building strong societies. In that context, we as the United Kingdom have a special role in increasing the capacity of the legal and courts systems, which are absolutely fundamental to the whole concept of good governance, precisely because the English legal system is still the dominant system in large parts of the world. Will he tell the House how exactly we can enhance our role to ensure that the courts and the general legal framework are central to his own capacity building for good governance?</p>

to enforce a legal contract&#151;their court case will be dealt with fairly. With a good, functioning and effective legal system, people are more likely to invest their money in those countries and therefore create jobs and generate the wealth that they need to pay for improvements in health and education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para11"><a name="06071354000436">We already do a great deal of such work, as my hon. Friend knows, but what has been most striking in the past year is the keenness with which my Cabinet colleagues have said that they would like to do more of this work together. That is why we are now moving to the next stage of the Africa capacity-building initiative, which is to find a mechanism to match the desire to help with the demand for assistance from developing countries, so that we can draw on the great well of expertise and good will in the UK to work with legal professionals and others in developing countries to share skills&#151;indeed, to learn from one another&#151;because that is absolutely fundamental to making progress.</p>

 I, too, thank the Secretary of State for presenting the White Paper and for the courtesy of supplying me with an advance copy of both the White Paper and his statement. The White Paper deals with issues that are literally matters of life and death for many of the most vulnerable people on the planet, many of whom are not only suffering from poverty, but from hunger and thirst, in some of the most dangerous parts of the world&#151;with natural and man-made disasters combining to add to their misery. These are complex issues and the detailed response set out today in the White Paper is a good milestone on the journey towards the end of that misery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para12"><a name="06071354000438">Only a year ago, we witnessed not only the Make Poverty History march through my home city of Edinburgh and the Gleneagles summit, but the claims that, if only the G8 leaders would act on aid, trade and debt, we could make poverty history. However, I believe that such claims alone are simply not true, because other important issues, which are set out in today&#146;s White Paper, must also be tackled fully to make poverty history. Conflict is detailed on page 46 of the report, and the crisis that often follows the availability of natural resources in many of those fragile states is dealt with on page 35. Corruption is highlighted, as is global warming and the problems of disease&#151;AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis&#151;and access to clean drinking water supplies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para13"><a name="06071354000439">The title of the report highlights the importance of good governance, and corruption dramatically affects many of the fragile states that we have talked about. Corruption is not just an issue at the lowest level, where people on starvation wages might take a bribe as a way to feed their children; some people at the top are skimming millions of dollars into overseas bank accounts, and action on that both in DFID and in the City of London is absolutely vital. I look forward to hearing what the Secretary of State can do in conjunction with the banks and other institutions in the City to tackle that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para14"><a name="06071354000440">Democracy is also highlighted in the report, but we must remember that elections are simply not enough on their own if they give legitimacy to corrupt regimes.

will do to empower citizens to hold their own Governments to account and to work with other Departments, such as the Foreign Office and the Department of Trade and Industry, and parliamentarians here and abroad to ensure that that problem is tackled at all levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para15"><a name="06071354000441">We have also heard that aid must be effective. It is good that DFID&#146;s aid budget is increasing, but the Secretary of State is under pressure to reduce staffing levels. It is more important than ever for his Department to monitor the effectiveness of the spending to ensure that it is effectively delivered. Where DFID has taken action&#151;for instance, in Malawi, where the World Food Programme was charging more than $240 a tonne to deliver food aid, when DFID could deliver it for $100 a tonne&#151;much more aid was delivered, and I hope that reducing staffing levels will not reduce the ability to monitor where the money is effectively spent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para16"><a name="06071354000442">Does the Secretary of State agree that DFID will be judged not on how much it spends, but on how effectively that money is spent? The Department has a good record on delivering humanitarian assistance following disasters. I recently witnessed its excellent response following the earthquake in Pakistan, but one interesting issue that cropped up on the ground there and stimulated debate is that of flag flying and the awareness of exactly what aid DFID is funding and delivering. An example was that the temporary shelters provided to help some of the 2 million to 3 million homeless in Pakistan had the Norwegian Government&#146;s brand on them, but they were more than 50 per cent. funded by DFID. Although I do not say that the flag should be waved in a colonial manner, we must ensure that two things happen. First, people must not be misled into not being aware of what DFID is funding. Secondly, when we are trying to build bridges with the Islamic community here at home, it is key that we make clear exactly what is happening in areas such as Pakistan and in other communities throughout the world, where good work is being done that is sometimes not fully recognised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para17"><a name="06071354000443">I have not had time to read all the report, but I should also like to hear from the Secretary of State whether more will be done on remittances. He will know that massive sums of money are flowing into the poorest countries of the world, but some of them have significant transaction costs, which reduce the money&#146;s impact at its final destination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para18"><a name="06071354000444">Page 7 of the report refers to the number of people living in the poorest countries of the world. Although we know that the poorest of the poor live in Africa, most of the world&#146;s poorest live elsewhere. I should like to know what the Secretary of State will do to reconsider how best to focus DFID&#146;s attack on poverty to catch those missing millions who live on less than $1 a day in Asia and Latin America.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="60713-0008.htm_para19"><a name="06071354000445">The Secretary of State rightly highlighted&#151;again, there are details on page 93 of the report&#151;the more erratic weather conditions that are affecting more of the poorest of the poor in places such as the horn of Africa.

 I welcome the White Paper and commend the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s Department for the leadership that it gives in setting standards for how aid should be delivered. I also welcome the fact that he is concentrating on good governance, which is essential if the money is to get to the poor rather than to corrupt elites. How effectively will he be able to deliver his objectives in the light of his recent cuts in budget support, particularly in Ethiopia and Uganda? Despite the fact that $200 million of international aid is going to northern Uganda, the Ugandan Government are failing adequately to deliver health care, education and policing. How will the Secretary of State ensure that they deliver those services and that we get an international settlement that will allow people to return to the region? Does he believe that he can deliver his budget with reduced staffing levels? If he has to go down the multilateral route, how will he use his role as the British member of the World Bank to make it more effective and follow DFID&#146;s world-class example in delivering aid more effectively? Is he aware that the International Development Committee will publish its report on private sector development before the recess? Will he explain what he proposes to do, through his Department, to unlock foreign investment and, in particular, domestic indigenous investment from entrepreneurs in poor countries? That is an essential means of expanding the private sector and delivering growth, which will bring down the levels of poverty.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his work in chairing the International Development Committee and for his kind words. In the case of Ethiopia, we have found another route for our aid, through the basic services grant, so that poor people are not punished because of the problems of governance there. In Uganda, a political settlement is needed. In my view, that requires the five indicted leaders of the Lord&#146;s Resistance Army to be hauled off to the International Criminal Court where they belong, because that would unlock an end to the terrible crisis that has affected so many people there.</p>

 The Government will achieve that by publishing more information about the work that we are doing, including the new commitments that I set out today in the White Paper, as well as what we are doing already. We will also achieve that aim through the support that we shall give to civil society, whose members can not only hold their Governments to account but talk to us about the way in which we provide support. In relation to the multilateral institutions, we are publishing for the second year in a row a report on the stance that we have taken in our discussions at the World Bank. Indeed, we have been pushing for greater transparency in the way in which the World Bank runs. It is right and proper that people should be able to see how these multilateral institutions work and make their decisions, because they receive a very large amount of our money.</p>

He rightly referred to the importance of parliamentarians, and the civil capacity fund for Africa is obviously very good news. However, is there not also work there for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association?

 The Secretary of State reminded us that the millions of people who die from AIDS, TB and malaria do so as a result of poverty. Is it not also the case that they do so as a result of weak health care systems in developing countries? What balance has he struck between delivering vital drugs through the health care systems of those countries and through non-governmental organisations?

 The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely good point. That is why long-term commitments of support to enable developing countries to build their health services are needed. One benefit of a rising aid budget and a 0.7 per cent. commitment is that we can enter into more long-term arrangements with Governments. If they know that they have money coming in, from our contributions and from debt relief, they can plan to train nurses, build clinics and buy drugs that will help to beat those diseases.</p>

 The short answer is, not enough. Despite the agreement reached in Hong Kong in December to end export subsidies by 2013, which would help the agreement on aid for trade, we are stuck on the central question of access to agricultural markets, with the three big groups&#151;including the larger developing countries, the United States and the European Community&#151;all saying that they have made a good offer and will not move unless others do so. However, that is the key to unlocking opportunities for prosperity for farmers and others in developing countries, and that is why we must keep up the pressure to try to break the logjam and give them the chance that they want&#151;to trade their way to a better life.</p>

 One of the legacies of badly given aid is that donors turned up and built schools and clinics, and went away and said, &#147;Hey, we have brought something good to the community.&#148; However, there was never any connection to the capacity of the Government of that country to fund and put in staff to maintain the buildings.

We do not give money directly to the Government of Zimbabwe. We have an AIDS programme, because HIV and AIDS are a big problem in Zimbabwe. We work through non-governmental organisations and others.

 I am sure that the Secretary of State will agree that Africa possesses incredible tourist attractions in its history and natural beauty, yet fails to realise its assets. That is partly because of poor facilities&#151;poor transport, for instance&#151;but also because of the negative messages that emerge from African countries. People do not think that they should visit Africa, and they do not know what they are missing. What can the Government do to help those countries promote tourism in their areas?</p>

 I have described the steps that we will take and the work that we are already doing to help countries improve their governance. The best way to put tourists off is to have a war, because no one will visit a country in those circumstances.

The same applies to other developing countries. Africa is not one continent; it is 54 countries. Ghana, Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa are making real progress, and many people visit those countries. We want people to visit as tourists, we want people to invest and we want people to trade, because ultimately that will bolster the countries&#146; economies and provide the money that they need to invest in saving people&#146;s lives and educating children.</p>

 With permission, I wish to make a statement about the publication of Lord Carter of Coles&#146;s Review of Legal Aid Procurement, following a statement by my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs in the other place earlier today. Copies of Lord Carter&#146;s review have been placed in the Printed Paper Office, the Vote Office and the Libraries of both Houses. A joint consultation paper on his proposals has been issued simultaneously by the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Legal Services Commission, copies of which have also been placed in the Printed Paper Office, the Vote Office and the Libraries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="60713-0009.htm_para6"><a name="06071354000495">Lord Carter&#146;s report is the product of a year of engagement between a number of stakeholders. The Government, the Legal Services Commission, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the judiciary, individual practitioners and others all played a full part in the discussions that led to his recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="60713-0009.htm_para7"><a name="06071354000496">In his report, Lord Carter identified the importance of publicly funded legal services to ensuring proper access to justice for those in need of advice and representation, and for those who are charged with criminal offences. He rightly refers to the high quality of our legal system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="60713-0009.htm_para8"><a name="06071354000497">At a time of finite public resources and ever-increasing pressure on the legal system, it is vital that we review our arrangements for the provision of legal aid. For some time, under successive Governments, they have not fully served either the public or the clients of the system. Changing the way in which we purchase legal advice services is a key element of our desire to reform the criminal justice system and provide better outcomes in civil and family justice. I know from experience the difficulty of balancing all the competing factors to ensure that legal aid is fair to the vulnerable, fair to taxpayers, fair to defendants and fair to practitioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="60713-0009.htm_para9"><a name="06071354000498">Lord Carter concluded that there must be a fundamental change in the way in which legal aid services are procured, so that clients have access to good quality legal advice and representation, so that a good quality, efficient supplier base thrives and remains sustainable, so that the taxpayer and the Government receive value for money, and so that the justice system is more efficient, effective and simple. He recommends a new system for the provision of criminal legal aid in which the professions ensure proper quality control over their members and lawyers are as far as possible paid on the basis of completion of a case rather than according to the number of hours for which they have worked, and are encouraged to be as efficient as possible by being able to compete for work on the basis of price.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para0"><a name="06071354000499">Lord Carter proposes that the criminal legal aid market should be restructured and suggests a timetable. April 2007 should see the introduction of a new fixed fee scheme in police stations. It should also see changes to standard fees for magistrates court cases, changes to the advocates&#146; graduated fee scheme in the Crown  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="13 July 2006">

<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>13 July 2006 : Column 1510</b><br>
court and an extension of the graduated-fee scheme to litigators in the Crown court. For very high-cost cases, the Legal Services Commission should introduce an enhanced quality threshold and use a higher level of in-house expertise and closer management to secure greater control over the individual case contracting regime. Lord Carter proposes that that be achieved by the end of the financial year 2007-08 through the LSC contracting solely with a panel of suppliers. Panel membership would be determined through demonstration of an appropriate enhanced level of quality, as well as through competition. Price competition should be introduced in 2009, with quality assured suppliers bidding for multiple units of cases in police stations which they would usually take to the magistrates courts and/or Crown courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para1"><a name="06071354000500">The transition to a more market-based approach comes alongside changes to the regulation of legal services, as outlined in the draft Legal Services Bill. Taken together, those developments will mean change for the profession&#151;a degree of restructuring for solicitors and barristers alike. The changes must be managed in a way that ensures continuing quality and choice for the public, while giving the professions time and, if necessary, support to adjust to the new model.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para2"><a name="06071354000501">Lord Carter recognises the need to ensure that providers of legal services continue to serve black and minority ethnic communities and those in less densely populated and rural areas. He strongly acknowledges that one size does not fit all, and makes detailed proposals to ensure the continued improved provision of high quality legal services for all those communities. His report contains detailed recommendations that will help us to devise the criminal justice system that the public expect: one that is simple and speedy, and makes the best use of summary justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para3"><a name="06071354000502">For civil and family legal aid, the report provides for a more efficient, client-focused service, concentrating on meeting different local needs. Lord Carter suggests that that will be achieved through the establishment of community legal advice centres and community legal advice networks, which is in line with the Legal Services Commission&#146;s strategy for community legal services. Best value tendering for the new centres and participation in the networks should begin in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para4"><a name="06071354000503">New forms of contracting are expected to promote greater links between civil suppliers and, where possible, greater links with family law suppliers, so that clusters of problems can be dealt with earlier and more effectively to avoid the risk that they multiply and lead to people falling into the social exclusion trap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para5"><a name="06071354000504">The Legal Services Commission also proposes to move to fixed and graduated fees from April 2007 for a wide variety of civil and family work, and also for most immigration work. That will promote and reward the most effective working by suppliers. The consultation document published alongside Lord Carter&#146;s report contains full details.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para6"><a name="06071354000505">Lord Carter estimates that if the reforms had been fully in place in 2005-06, criminal legal aid spending would have been &#163;100 million lower, and that does not take account of the potential further savings from best value tendering. In addition, there would have been a greater proportion of legal aid spent on civil and family matters. By the end of the implementation period, because the reforms will also control unit costs far  <br>

better than many elements of the current scheme, spending will be lower than it would be without the changes proposed. I also welcome and accept Lord Carter&#146;s recommendation for better management and control of spending, including through greater transparency and shared problem-solving between the DCA, the LSC, other Departments and the professions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para7"><a name="06071354000506">In conclusion, the Government strongly welcome Lord Carter&#146;s findings and we have today issued a consultation paper to which I encourage everyone to respond. I look forward to the challenges that are ahead and working with all stakeholders and the Legal Services Commission, the dedication and commitment of whose commissioners and staff will be critical to success. I am immensely grateful to Lord Carter for the work that he has done.</p>

 I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for her courtesy in giving the Opposition early sight of her statement today, and I thank Lord Carter for his meeting with me. We welcome the publication of the report and will study the proposals in detail. We hope that it will spark a debate that can provide the basis for a consensus on reform of the legal aid system that is built to last.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para8"><a name="06071354000508">Legal aid remains the cornerstone of our criminal justice system, providing access to justice for millions of people, but today it is in crisis. In 1997, the Government promised to reform legal aid in order to</p>
<a name="60713-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="06071354000689"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;achieve value for money for the taxpayer and the consumer&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para9"><a name="06071354000509">Instead, we have seen a 35 per cent rise in the overall legal aid budget, while at the same time spending on civil legal aid, excluding asylum, is down by a quarter. That in turn is damaging access to justice for many of the most vulnerable people in society. So we all agree that reform is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para10"><a name="06071354000510">We endorse Lord Carter&#146;s emphasis on the need to tackle very high cost cases, which account for around half of current criminal legal aid budget. In that context will the Under-Secretary tell us what steps the Crown Prosecution Service, the Serious Fraud Office, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the British Transport police intend to take in order to respond to the challenge of managing the prosecution of cases more efficiently and effectively? Does she agree that in addition to the measures proposed by Lord Carter, more effective case management by courts is essential if costs are to be kept down?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para11"><a name="06071354000512">Much is made of the fees earned by barristers at the top end of the scale in very high cost cases, but the Under-Secretary will be aware of the concerns among barristers and solicitors about many more in the profession who rely on legal aid work, yet who barely earn enough to get by. Does she accept that that has already resulted in fewer lawyers choosing publicly funded legal aid work as a career, which in turn is placing huge strains on the civil legal aid system? The Under-Secretary will know that the Bar Council is concerned by the further delays before help is provided for those doing those shorter cases. The London Criminal Courts Solicitors&#146; Association has said today that Lord Carter&#146;s proposals:</p>
<a name="60713-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="06071354000690"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will stop the recruitment of able and passionate solicitors to this area of legal practice&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para12"><a name="06071354000513">How does the Under-Secretary respond to such concerns?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para13"><a name="06071354000514">There are other parts of the statement, and Lord Carter&#146;s report, that give rise to concerns&#151;in particular, the likely impact on the network of high street solicitors and law centres, such as the one that I visited in Tower Hamlets recently. In particular, will the Under-Secretary respond to the fears expressed by many that Lord Carter&#146;s proposals on procurement sound the death knell for small high street solicitors undertaking legal aid work? This morning, the vice-president of the London Criminal Courts Solicitors&#146; Association said that the proposals were:</p>
<a name="60713-0010.htm_brev2"><a name="06071354000691"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;an enormously bureaucratic and costly re-organisation of the supplier base which is the high street solicitor that will lead, perhaps, to many of them closing&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para14"><a name="06071354000515">What steps do the Government intend to take to deal with those concerns and to allay fears that advice deserts will emerge?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para15"><a name="06071354000516">Page 52 of Lord Carter&#146;s report refers to the needs of vulnerable black and ethnic minority clients. She will be aware that many small high street solicitors tailor their services to the needs of black and ethnic minority clients. However, under Lord Carter&#146;s plans, those are precisely the types of firm that risk being squeezed out of the system and, in the process, significant role models of success in the legal world for minorities will be lost. Does she agree with the Criminal Law Solicitors&#146; Association, which has said that such firms will be &#147;disproportionately disadvantaged&#148; by Lord Carter&#146;s plans?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para16"><a name="06071354000517">Finally, the Minister referred to the publication of a consultation paper on Lord Carter&#146;s report. Will the Under-Secretary confirm, therefore, that valuable as his report is, it does not represent the final word, that there is some scope to refine his plans and that the Government will address the genuine concerns of many in the legal profession who want a system that combines both value for money and proper access to justice?</p>

<p><a name="st_o227"><a name="06071354000518"><a name="60713-0010.htm_spnew1"><a name="06071354000949"><b>Vera Baird:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his welcome for the report and his hope, which I share, that it will spark a debate on those important issues. I agree wholly that we need to build a system that will last. The increase in legal aid expenditure since 1997, to which he alluded, is not an isolated example. This morning, I looked at the tables in the fundamental legal aid review document, which show that spending also went up exponentially between 1991 and 1996, so it is clear that successive Governments have not managed to control that elusive budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para17"><a name="06071354000519">The hon. Gentleman raises the issue of very high cost cases, and I urge him to read with care&#151;I accept entirely that he has not had the slightest opportunity to do so&#151;what Lord Carter proposes for closer management of such cases, with a higher level of expertise in the LSC to ensure that they are controlled as well as they can be. I accept entirely the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that all that cannot be done through legal aid alone: there is a serious need for the CPS and the other public agencies he mentioned to consider case management. The Carter review contains a quotation from Sir Igor Judge, which gives the judicial attitude to the urgent need for powerful case management. The judiciary are anxious that judges should be free to do  <br>

that, and of course we entirely encourage it. We are seeking, with the consultation document that will build on Lord Carter&#146;s report, to use the new fixed fee regime that he proposes to try to enhance the ability of the judiciary to manage cases properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para18"><a name="06071354000520">The hon. Gentleman also referred to the frequently expressed criticism of fat cat barristers who earn enormous amounts of money. I have never been fat myself<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>Neither metaphorically, nor physically, but I am not sure that the House is interested in that. There is some interesting information about lower level members of the Bar in Lord Carter&#146;s review. He found that 5 per cent. of those with between one and five years&#146; experience at the Bar were earning &#163;90,000 a year. That seems to be a fine starting salary, although many others do not earn that much. However, that is an issue for those who structure the Bar, and not one that legal aid can tackle directly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para19"><a name="06071354000521">I accept that the Bar Council would prefer not to delay the catch-up that it thinks should follow from the fact that graduated fee schemes for one to 10-day cases were fixed in 1997. However, a letter from the council this morning states that, as a result of its negotiations with Lord Carter, it acknowledges that process should occur from 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para20"><a name="06071354000522">I do not agree with the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) that the London Criminal Court Solicitors&#146; Association is right to suggest that the proposals will end recruitment to the public sector. Not a bit of it: he was present at the recent Legal Aid Practitioners Group awards for legal aid lawyer of the year and, like me, can only have been impressed by the calibre of the many excellent young practitioners there. They are fighters, every one of them&#151;much of the time they are fighting us!&#151;and they are coming into the public sector, so I do not think that what the hon. Gentleman said is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para21"><a name="06071354000523">I do not agree either that we are about to hear the death knell of high street solicitors. Much concern was aroused by the interim report, which did us all a huge favour by making us refine our thinking. The process of implementation will need a great deal of consultation and care. It is proposed that I should spend a sizeable part of my summer going around providing exactly that, although of course people will also be able to correspond about other matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para22"><a name="06071354000524">I heard Greg Powell say on the radio this morning that he thought that the proposals would involve a huge amount of bureaucracy, but the LSC is looking to make savings in that regard worth tens of millions of pounds. It is anxious to have a lighter touch, and of course practitioners want to escape from bureaucracy. The whole point of having fixed fees at the front end of cases across the board is so that there will be no thorny questions about whether a particular mention, application in court or piece of travel and waiting was justified. It seems to me that the fixed fee will mean less bureaucracy.</p>

 I thank my hon. and learned Friend for her statement and welcome her to her post. I am concerned about accountability in how neighbourhoods provide advice and representation, on legal matters and on issues that at least at first may not involve the law. In my constituency, partly as a result of the behaviour of the local authority, there is a real shortage of competent advice on debt, immigration and other matters. I have not read the report, but will she clarify what accountability mechanism will be put in place to make sure that advice is provided in a neighbourhood?

Neighbourhood accountability may go beyond Lord Carter&#146;s remit, but she is right to say that there is a need for an audit process to establish what advice is available for people. I attend the Cabinet Office Committee on social exclusion established by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Social Exclusion. My input is based on the belief that there is a need for advice to be included in the social exclusion agenda. That goes beyond legal advice, but the LSC is in a good position to ascertain what advice is available and to co-ordinate it more efficiently than has been the case in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para27"><a name="06071354000532">The importance of legal aid is worth underlining yet again. It is a key part of the welfare state, although we probably talk about it less than any other. The squeeze on legal aid budgets over recent years is not the result of inefficiencies in the system&#151;it is largely due to the increase in business caused by the wide panoply of new offences and the increased number of prosecutions taking place. That is what is driving the increase in criminal aid, which in turn has squeezed the availability for legal aid in the civil and family courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para28"><a name="06071354000533">The squeeze on legal aid is causing great concern, as access to legal aid is an essential part of a fair and free society. I hope that all hon. Members will agree with that, and that the report&#146;s proposals will increase access to legal aid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para29"><a name="06071354000534">The Minister said that she felt there would be no deterioration in the position of high street practitioners. I hope that she is right, but legal aid in the more rural areas&#151;and in some cities too&#151;is in a parlous state, with those practitioners who offer criminal legal aid, for instance, being very few and far between. For instance, it is common for there to be only one criminal solicitor available to deal with a particular magistrates court. We therefore have to do something to encourage more practices to release practitioners to do criminal legal aid and to undertake work in the family courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para30"><a name="06071354000535">I have a few quick questions for the Minister. First, she was right to emphasise the need for better organisation in our courts, and one factor in that is the court&#146;s proximity to the people attending it. Travel to court is a key part of the costs incurred by practitioners, defendants, witnesses and victims. Centralising court facilities leads to an apparent cost saving, but there is a real cost to the people seeking justice. The two need to be in balance, as justice is being taken away from people in many rural communities because courts are being closed down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para31"><a name="06071354000536">Will the Minister ensure that the financial incentives to finish cases quickly do not prejudice the standard of justice in courts? That is an obvious point but it is terribly important, so it is necessary to make it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para32"><a name="06071354000537">Will the Government guarantee that defendants can be represented by the same good local lawyer from the beginning to the end of proceedings? That may or may not be implicit in the arrangements as they develop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para33"><a name="06071354000538">Can we make sure that lawyers undertaking publicly funded work have sufficient recompense to attract them to such posts rather than going into private practice? The hon. and learned Lady may have partly answered that question already.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="60713-0010.htm_para34"><a name="06071354000539">Lastly, to pick up the point made by the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart), a process of audit of advice and legal services is needed and Members of Parliament have a critical part to play in it. Often, advice deserts are not in the most deprived communities. The worst thing of all is to be a poor person in a rich community, who does not have access to transport and to high-cost support and will be very much excluded if we are not careful. The hon. and learned Lady&#146;s Department needs to work closely with the Minister for Social Exclusion to ensure that a proper audit system is in place. MPs could play a useful part in that process, so will she consider that?</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his welcome and for his praise of the process that has led us to where we are today. I agree that it has been a good process, and I assure him that it will continue to be genuinely consultative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="60713-0011.htm_para0"><a name="06071354000541">The hon. Gentleman said that the increase in criminal legal aid derived from an increase in business. I assume that he meant that more cases are going to court; nor can I exclude the fact that there has been more legislation, so there are more offences and increased complexity. He is right up to a point, but notwithstanding all that, and quite separately from it, the amount of money being paid out to lawyers has increased. I am sure that he is aware of the Cape and Moorhead research, which considered the inevitable impact of more legislation on legal aid, but concludes that there is more to be said on the subject. Everybody wants more business in the criminal courts in the sense that more people should be brought to justice.</p>

 Indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="60713-0011.htm_para1"><a name="06071354000544">A point was put to me about the demise of high street solicitors. I cannot say that they will be unaffected by the review, but Lord Carter&#146;s proposals do not mean a big is beautiful situation; they are about tuning the new system to ensure that efficient suppliers of a variety of sizes and structures who have been satisfactorily peer-reviewed&#151;I cannot emphasise enough the point that quality is up-front in Lord Carter&#146;s proposals&#151;ought to be able to succeed under the best tendering model. So, as I said, high street solicitors will not be unaffected but there is no reason to forecast their demise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="60713-0011.htm_para2"><a name="06071354000545">The hon. Gentleman referred to local courts and accepted the need for a balance. Of course, local justice can be good justice, but appropriate facilities are needed, too. Some local court buildings are very old indeed and cannot accommodate modern needs; not only for disabled access, but also for defence witnesses to be kept away from prosecution witnesses and so on. Various moves are afoot. Last Friday, I had the pleasure of visiting the Liverpool community justice project, in which justice simply could not be more local. The project is having a superb impact because it is so well knitted into the surrounding community. Such initiatives are to be praised and encouraged. As ever, we are trying to do everything at once.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="60713-0011.htm_para3"><a name="06071354000546">The hon. Gentleman asked that financial incentives should not compromise cases and that the need to fix fees would not undermine a decent pay rate for lawyers. I think that was implicit in what I said. There is no intention to do that; it is everyone&#146;s intention that good quality lawyers should continue to be recruited to the public sector. Our courts simply cannot work without them&#151;the hon. Gentleman can rely on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="60713-0011.htm_para4"><a name="06071354000547">The hon. Gentleman asked whether a defendant could be represented throughout the proceedings by a good local lawyer. Solicitors will bid for a quantity of police station cases, and the usual model would be that they would take the case through from the police station to the magistrates court and to the Crown Court, if appropriate. There is provision in Lord  <br>

Carter&#146;s recommendations, which I applaud, for consultation on own-client work; that is, somebody who comes under the duty rota scheme by virtue of being locked up at a particular police station but who has another solicitor elsewhere with whom he has some faith. If he were able to rely on that person it could assist the system. There is scope for consideration of such ideas, but the broad intention is that the person who picks up the case at the police station should take it all the way through. High cost cases are the exception. It is proposed that a panel of experts be set up and when it is clear at the police station that the case is a specialist one, it would go directly&#151;as an escape route&#151;to the panel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="60713-0011.htm_para5"><a name="06071354000548">I agree entirely that although it is bad to be poor in a poor area, it is just as bad to be poor in a rich area. The hon. Gentleman will have appreciated from my previous answers that I am very engaged in how advice can assist in dealing with social exclusion. As he understands, a major thrust of the legal aid review is the intention to move money, where and when possible, over to civil sectors so that people can be prevented from going into social exclusion by timely advice about their problems in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="st_o234"><a name="06071354000549"><a name="60713-0011.htm_spnew3"><a name="06071354000956"><b>Mr. Michael Wills (North Swindon) (Lab):</b>

She may be aware that I have written on several occasions to her Department about the problems with immigration advice in Swindon. Will she keep a careful eye on making sure that appropriate services are available throughout the process? She will be aware that bottlenecks in immigration advice can have considerable consequences down the line, and clog up the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="60713-0011.htm_para7"><a name="06071354000551">Secondly, I noted the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) about the importance of advice. One way of bearing down on the costs of legal aid is to give proper advice to those who need it, especially the most needful members of our society, before they get into the legal process. However, is my hon. and learned Friend aware that the LSC has withdrawn its support for a potentially valuable project in Swindon&#151;an advice centre co-ordinating all the advice bodies in the borough in one building? I understand that the LSC feels that the project is no longer part of its purview, but as a result of its withdrawal, Swindon borough council has been left on its own to deal with it. I should be grateful if my hon. and learned Friend will confirm that as part of the review she will look at ways in which her Department can support the council in developing that valuable project.</p>

 Does the Minister agree that small market town solicitors are often the lifeblood of local communities and that many small towns could not survive without them? Today&#146;s announcement is not good news for many of those small solicitors, particularly paragraph 7, which points out that they will be paid on completion of their case rather than the number of hours they have worked. That will affect incomes. Obviously, large commercial firms will not suffer, nor will many of the larger regional partnerships, but what discussions is the hon. and learned Lady planning with the Law Society about the impact of the proposals on smaller solicitors?</p>

 I sympathise with my hon. Friend&#146;s comments. There was of course auditing of advice by the community legal service partnerships when they were set up, but I think that he is right; not only is there a multiplicity of agencies but there is also a large number of core lines of one sort or other that give advice on debt, housing or consumer affairs. They are lodged in various Departments of Government&#151;the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Education and Skills and our own Department. Clearly, the expertise for coordinating the availability of such advice probably lies with the Legal Services Commission, and yes, it is imperative that they are consolidated so that they work in a coherent way, without duplication, and provide an adequate service.</p>

proceedings can be finalised. The new clause appears to be quite general, bit I think it can be very powerful, because it is an enabling measure that gives force to all the other amendments that have been made, here and in another place. Crucially, it would mean that where the NHS scheme member&#146;s initial conclusion is not to offer redress but the patient feels, having received independent, specialist legal advice to that effect, that they should be eligible, consideration would have to be given to the use of joint instruction of medical experts as a means of seeking resolution, because&#151;the Minister looks at me quizzically, but I know that he will agree with my &#147;because&#148;&#151;all possible instruments within the scheme would have to be examined and eliminated before having recourse to civil proceedings. In some disputed cases, that might well result in bringing independence to bear on the assessment of eligibility for redress, rather than just establishing the facts of what happened, as others, not least on the Opposition Benches, have sought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="60713-0011.htm_para19"><a name="06071354000575">In some such disputed cases, it would mean that the patient was empowered through specialist legal advice and representation jointly commissioned from independent sources, but within the scheme. If an independent medical expert assessed that there was negligence and causation, the expectation would be bound to be that there would be an offer of redress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="60713-0011.htm_para20"><a name="06071354000576">The new clause and the amendments&#151;largely the Government amendments&#151;made here and in another place would help to ensure that patient safety lessons were learned and implemented if the independent medical expert identified in the report the salient risk management issues. In other words, the positive experience from the resolve pilot in England and the speedy resolution pilot in Wales would be put to good use, just as I argued&#151;with some sympathy across the House&#151;on Second Reading and throughout the Committee stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="60713-0011.htm_para21"><a name="06071354000577">The crucial point is that the original ethos of the scheme&#151;putting the emphasis on the NHS itself and recognising where it has been negligent, and the NHS proactively putting things right and offering redress within its own owned NHS scheme&#151;would be safeguarded, empowered and furthered by the new clause. The process that I have described of joint instruction would be necessary only if and when the NHS&#146;s assessment did not tally with that of the patient and the legal adviser. That is my interpretation of the overall effect of this enabling new clause and of the combined effect of my new clause with the various Government amendments that it seeks to enable. I would be grateful for a few words from the Minister&#151;I have no doubt that they will be forthcoming&#151;about how that tallies with his interpretation. Kindly, he has already written to me about that so I have an idea of what he might say. Given the effect of the new clause and the amendments that it seeks to enable, I believe that we have the framework of a scheme that could enjoy public confidence and deliver real benefits to patients and the NHS.</p>

saying. It could be argued that that raises the question of why it has to be included in the Bill. The Minister will be fully aware that we welcome and support the good intentions underlying the redress scheme. Our problem is that we have difficulties with some of the detail and content of the operation of the Government&#146;s proposed scheme.</p>

If the Government have their way, the redress scheme will replicate the difficulties of the civil litigation scheme instead of representing a genuine alternative to litigation. That is anything but desirable. The Government are proposing that the role of lawyers be extended to any stage prior to the offer, including the joint instruction of medical experts. However, the redress scheme is not conceived as a judicial process, so the question of legal representation should not arise. Legal rights are not being asserted or defended. Thus there will be lawyers involved in a process that is non-determinative and non-binding. The scheme will not ensure the closure, certainty or finality of a court process. It will attract the problems of civil legal proceedings, such as expensive lawyers, protracted cases and complexity, without the good aspects of the judicial process, such as finality and independence. It is, in many respects, a lose-lose situation.</p>

It does not bring anything new to the Bill or to the present situation as it stands. The NHS Litigation Authority, for example, has always had the power to settle cases. The health service has always had the power to resolve claims without recourse to civil proceedings. In short, because the provision will have little basis in reality if the Government have their way, we suggest that the new clause is unnecessary. It is a bit of waste and so we will not waste the House&#146;s time in forcing a vote on it.</p>

Under the new clause, a duty will be imposed on scheme members and the scheme authority to have regard, when carrying out their functions under the scheme, to the desirability of settling the case. Scheme members and the scheme authority should have particular regard to the desirability of settling under the scheme, rather than leaving cases to be pursued through the courts.</p>

Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley), that we have listened between the Committee stage and the Report stage. We have taken on board comments made by hon. Members on both sides of the House and we believe that the Bill will be strengthened through making those amendments. In my view, the new clause reinforces the positive front-foot spirit that we want the Bill to encourage.</p>

Under the new clause, if providers of NHS services believe that there might be a case of negligence, they would be expected to take cases forward. An active approach to redress will be required under the scheme. To be effective, it is important that the NHS is not defensive. The NHS must do all that it can to identify and, where appropriate, resolve cases falling under the scheme.</p>

I urge him to see the Bill in the context of other reforms that the Government are making in the national health service to ensure that it is a service that focuses on the individual patient and that patient&#146;s experience of the health service, and on ensuring that, when things go wrong, redress to the patient is the thing that matters. I am confident that the NHS redress scheme has the potential over time to effect culture change in the NHS, although I readily acknowledge that that is never an easy thing to achieve. There will be scheme members who are already taking an active approach to complaints and to clinical negligence cases. Some organisations will be prepared to be open and honest, and will embrace the principles of the redress scheme, but there will be others who may continue to be defensive, drag their heels and have a less than positive approach to these matters. We need to do all that we can to ensure that that does not happen.</p>

 My hon. Friend sums up the new clause extremely well. It is not at all empty or superfluous, as the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron) sought to claim. It does indeed involve a wide, general duty, but it sets the whole tone for how scheme members should carry out their duties and use the measures and avenues that the scheme puts at their disposal. In making decisions, they are at all times legally required to consider the desirability of concluding matters under the scheme. I emphasise to the hon. Gentleman the word &#147;concluding&#148;, because there is a need for finality, and for giving patients an early apology and explanation of the steps being taken to prevent incidents from happening again. All that is enshrined in the new clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="60713-0012.htm_para6"><a name="06071354000590">I am anxious to avoid cases being brought under the scheme, only for some of the old thinking to prevail so that at the point at which they may be settled they are pushed into the legal process. That would lead to duplication of expense and resource, which would not be in the interests of the taxpayer. I believe that we will avoid that by having a clause that promotes the desirability of settling. I am sure that hon. Members in all parts of the House can think of cases, not only in the NHS but in other parts of the public sector, in which individuals have been stonewalled and pushed into pursuing a legal action against a public body, possibly in the hope that they will get fed up and give up, having been ground down by the seemingly interminable process in which they find themselves. That process, which comes about because individuals in organisations will not accept that they have made mistakes and apologise for them, can be extremely wasteful of public resources. It can also ruin people&#146;s lives because they become consumed by a case that ultimately has to be pursued through the courts. As I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s new clause, it is precisely that situation that it seeks to avoid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="60713-0012.htm_para7"><a name="06071354000591">The new clause signals that the redress scheme is not simply a process parallel to that in the courts but is intended to be the primary means by which disputes arising out of NHS hospital services are, where reasonably practicable, to be resolved, rather than leaving cases to be pursued through the courts. It is drafted in general terms, imposing a general duty to promote resolution. My expectation is that at each stage of the proceedings, the scheme member and/or the scheme authority, if they are considering giving up on the scheme for a specific case, must have regard to the desirability of settling under the scheme. At that point they should consider the means that they have at their disposal, such as the joint instruction of medical experts, and positively consider whether it would be right to take that course of action given the desirability of settling and the awareness that the case may continue by the legal route.</p>

 In Committee, the point was well made, particularly by the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) and my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher), that patients harmed during their NHS care often say that they do not want it to happen to anyone else. I have never been at odds with that statement. Those are normally the first words out of the mouths of people presenting at our constituency surgeries when they seek to pursue a case and confront the NHS with the harm that they have suffered through its failings. For many individuals, redress and closure&#151;to use that terrible word&#151;may often mean being clear in the knowledge that measures have been or will be taken to ensure the mistake does not happen again.</p>

<p>As was accepted in Committee, there will be occasions where mistakes can simply be ascribed to genuine human error&#151;mistakes where no procedural changes need to be made and where a report of this type will not be appropriate. As I said in Committee, we must be careful about placing extra administrative burdens on the NHS. I believe that the hon. Lady accepts that caveat. In these specific types of circumstance, the scheme may provide that a report will not be necessary, although ordinarily such a report will now be provided. Therefore, not only will scheme members publish an annual report about lessons to be learned from cases under the scheme, under clause 10, but the redress offered to individuals under the scheme will now ordinarily include a report on the specific  <br>

Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon), about the reasons why investigation reports should be provided to individuals if requested. He focused on the importance of providing the full facts, not only to those to whom offers are made under the scheme, but to those to whom an offer is not made and whose case is terminated. He spoke about the sense of grievance that people may experience if they are not eligible for redress and he explained why they should, if they so wished, be provided with the facts and the outcome of the investigation, so that they could understand why they were not entitled to the redress that they sought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="60713-0012.htm_para15"><a name="06071354000602">Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 require the scheme to provide for the findings of an investigation to be recorded in a report, and for the report to be made available to the individual seeking redress on request. As I stressed in Committee, clause 3(2) already ensures that an explanation will ordinarily be provided under the redress scheme. It will be a full explanation, and we envisage that in a number of cases&#151;particularly the more straightforward&#151;the patient will be satisfied with that explanation. We want to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy for scheme members, and we do not wish to impose on them the extra burden of providing the investigation report in every case. In some&#151;perhaps many&#151;cases, an explanation may be adequate, but our amendments ensure that, if it is requested, the investigation report will ordinarily be provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="60713-0012.htm_para16"><a name="06071354000603">The amendments enable the scheme to provide that the report need not be made available before an offer is made, or before proceedings are terminated. That, too, is intended to reduce the administrative burden on scheme members. Providing investigation reports at an earlier stage may result in increased correspondence and delay. It is envisaged that when the offer of redress is made, a copy of the investigation report will be sent to the individual, if they request it. That will give the individual a complete set of documentation that they can consider with their legal adviser when the offer under the scheme is assessed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="60713-0012.htm_para17"><a name="06071354000604">The amendments enable the scheme to specify other circumstances in which reports need not be provided. That covers rare cases, such as those in which the person seeking redress is not the patient, so it is considered appropriate to withhold certain confidential health information. Including in the Bill an explicit requirement that investigation reports generally be provided to individuals is in the spirit of openness that the scheme seeks to engender. That will reinforce our messages about more open apologies and explanations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="60713-0012.htm_para18"><a name="06071354000605">In Committee, the Bill was criticised because it was said that the investigative process could not be transparent if its findings were not open.

addition to the explanation provided to the individual complainant. I would like to make it clear that the investigation report will not be kept back on the ground that it is privileged, nor will it be claimed that investigation reports are &#147;without prejudice&#148; and inadmissible in any subsequent legal action. That matter was raised in Committee by the hon. Members for Billericay (Mr. Baron) and for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien), and I am happy to give an assurance on that point.</p>

Under the scheme, no report need be provided until an offer is made, or until proceedings under the scheme are terminated. As I have said, the intention is to reduce the administrative burden on scheme members, but in clause 15 we have a specific power to make different provision for different cases, and to exercise powers &#147;subject to exceptions&#148; or</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="60713-0012.htm_para20"><a name="06071354000607">The power to restrict the provision of investigation reports may therefore be exercised only in relation to particular cases or a class of cases. Our intention is that the power will not be exercised in cases in which it is appropriate for a joint medical expert to be instructed. However, it does not prevent investigation reports from being provided until the final stage. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington was concerned about that problem, but I can assure him that the Government amendments do not require reports to be provided at the end of the process in all cases. There is flexibility in the Bill so that investigation reports can be provided to individuals at an earlier stage if that is deemed necessary. He was right to press me on the issue, because if people are to make an informed judgment on the instruction of a joint medical expert they need to see the contents of the investigation.</p>

The actions of scheme members in conducting the investigation, the scope of the investigation and the processes followed will be open and subject to scrutiny. We have introduced a general duty to promote resolution by accepting new clause 1, which deals with the desirability of settling, and the amendment clarifies the need for openness and transparency.

Members will realise from my earlier comments that I agree that investigation reports should generally be made available to individuals. I am afraid to tell the hon. Member for Billericay that I reject his proposal for a number of reasons, although I accept that it attempts to achieve a similar goal to our provisions. First, Government amendments Nos. 10 and 11 go further than his amendment, which enables the scheme to provide for reports to be made available but does not require it to do so. If the power is not exercised, the scheme could not make provision for the publication of investigation reports. The Government amendments require the scheme to provide for reports generally to be made available when requested.</p>

Investigation reports deal with an individual&#146;s health care and contain personal, often confidential, information. It is right that they should be made available to the individual whose health care has resulted in harm, but it is not right that they should be more widely available. Even if anonymised, some scheme members will have so few redress cases, or so few cases of the kind described, that the individual patient could be identified in a published report.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to raise that point. I can reassure him that there is provision under the Bill for such a report to be compiled on an annual basis by scheme members. Under clause 10, duties are imposed on members of the NHS redress scheme. Subsection (2)(j) contains a requirement to produce an annual report and the lessons to be learned from it.

However, in response to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Billericay, we argue that it would be wholly inappropriate for the report on an individual&#146;s health care to be placed in the public domain by an NHS trust. An individual may choose to do that following the receipt of such a report, but that could not be mandated under the Bill. The general point made by the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="60713-0013.htm_para0"><a name="06071354000618">I was asked in Committee by the hon. Members for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) and for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) to accept that there should be a guarantee written into the Bill that annual reports will be provided. Being a partisan soul and one who, in very rare circumstances, considers himself likely to accept Conservative amendments to any Government legislation, I find myself in an extraordinary position. The hon. Gentlemen made a reasonable suggestion, and the amendments that we have tabled are a response to their sensible argument and the constructive discussions that we had.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="60713-0013.htm_para1"><a name="06071354000619">Indeed, it is desirable that such a report should be a requirement under the Bill, as suggested by the hon. Member for Northavon and the two Conservative Members. We are happy to amend the Bill to make that a requirement of membership of the NHS redress scheme. The word &#147;may&#148; has been replaced with &#147;must&#148; and the scheme must now require scheme members to publish annual reports on cases dealt with under the scheme and lessons to be learned from them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="60713-0013.htm_para2"><a name="06071354000620">I have covered all the Government amendments. We will resist amendment No. 4.</p>

 As we know, the amendments deal with the publication of reports and the limitation on their disclosure. We have no problem with Government amendment No. 9. It is important that lessons are learned, so a report to that effect should be produced and encouraged. Our concern is with Government amendment No. 11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="60713-0013.htm_para3"><a name="06071354000622">Our approach to the preparation of reports and their disclosure is relatively simple. We propose that the investigation should be limited to a fact-finding exercise. That is a discussion that we will come to later on a different group of amendments. We propose that in every case a report should be made of such an investigation and made available to the person concerned in any event, whether or not compensation is sought and whether or not an offer is accepted. If we believe that the culture of the NHS needs to change and that we need a more open, transparent and robust investigation of the facts, it is logical to expect that reports in all cases should be made available to the patients. That is what our amendment No. 4 aims to achieve.</p>
<a name="06071354000669">
<p>When the stage is reached at which any offer is made, then in any reports concerned with assessment of liability the usual professional practice in respect of privilege would apply. In other words, the practice where a client and a lawyer consider the client&#146;s legal liabilities remains confidential to the client and the lawyer. This solution is a logical consequence of separating fact finding from fault finding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="60713-0013.htm_para4"><a name="06071354000623">The Government&#146;s solution to that is partly set out in amendment No. 11. It refers to an investigation report, but it is not clear whether that report is fact finding, fault finding or both. I ask the Minister to reflect on that as it creates a functional incoherence that was described in another place as a dog&#146;s breakfast.</p>

 I thank the Minister for that clarification, which prompts a further question. The Minister says that the report would be produced in any case because it would be the report on which the NHSLA would base its assessment, as opposed to its determination, of liability. Under amendment No. 11, the report need not be shown before an assessment is made, where proceedings are terminated, or in other as yet unspecified circumstances. If the report is going to be produced anyway, why should not it be made available to the patient, given that we are trying to encourage a culture of openness within the NHS and that no added bureaucracy or cost would be involved? The Government&#146;s proposal does not guarantee the disclosure of the report in every case. It is the opposite of the openness and transparency that we propose, which is needed if we are to transform the culture of the NHS. What does the Minister have to fear from patients receiving a report at the end of the fact-finding stage regardless of whether an offer is subsequently made?</p>

<p><a name="st_o259"><a name="06071354000626"><a name="60713-0013.htm_spnew3"><a name="06071354000981"><b>Andy Burnham:</b>
 I think that I have made this clear, but I am happy to do so again. In providing an offer of redress, at the end of the process the scheme would seek, if appropriate, to give the individual an apology, an explanation, a statement or a report of what action will be taken to prevent similar adverse incidents happening again, as well as a copy of the investigation report. That is ordinarily what would happen. Were a financial offer to be appropriate, that would be included too. That would be the package of redress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="60713-0013.htm_para5"><a name="06071354000627">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon) has raised certain points privately and in Committee. He asked whether in the more complex cases, particularly where the instruction of a joint medical expert might arise, the patient would need to see the investigation report at that point. I take his point. However, in order to minimise bureaucracy and correspondence, the general intention is that all that information will be disclosed and provided to the individual at the end of the process. We believe that that is ordinarily the right way to conclude matters.</p>

<p><a name="st_o260"><a name="06071354000628"><a name="60713-0013.htm_spnew4"><a name="06071354000982"><b>Mr. Baron:</b>
 I thank the Minister for that, but ask him to re-examine Government amendment No. 11(2B), which says:</p>

for example, when the person who seeks redress is not the patient and it is considered appropriate to withhold some confidential health information. I want to emphasise that the scheme is flexible. There is provision for investigation reports to be released earlier in the process to individuals when the merits of the case require it. However, they would generally be provided at the end. There is, therefore, flexibility, but the Bill sets out what will happen in the normal course of events.</p>

 Doubtless we will revert to the matter later. There is no point in questioning the Minister further. He has attempted to clarify the position, but a few questions remain about when and under what circumstances a report would be withheld from the patient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="60713-0013.htm_para7"><a name="06071354000632">It goes without saying that we support the proposal to prepare and disclose the report, but we oppose any unspecified and undefined overriding discretion to refuse to disclose such a report. That would not reflect patient priorities or help to change the culture of the NHS to make it a more open and transparent investigation. It would not help patients in their search for not only an explanation and an apology, but a simple and honest investigation of the facts. I am sure that we will revert to the point later.</p>

<p><a name="st_o263"><a name="06071354000633"><a name="60713-0013.htm_spnew7"><a name="06071354000985"><b>Sandra Gidley (Romsey) (LD):</b>
 I welcome especially amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10 and other consequential amendments. As the Minister said, we discussed the subject at some length in Committee. He seemed genuinely engaged and said that he would reconsider the matter. I therefore thank him for doing that because it is the first time that that has happened to me in my six years in this place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="60713-0013.htm_para8"><a name="06071354000634">I am delighted that the Bill includes a clear statement that a report should be produced on action to prevent a recurrence of similar cases. As the Minister says, people mainly want to know that the likelihood of what happened to them recurring will be reduced. Many people&#146;s prime motivation is not money. We need to be clear about that in our discussions today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="60713-0013.htm_para9"><a name="06071354000635">I, too, am concerned about Government amendment No. 11, especially proposed new subsection (2B) to clause 6. The Minister claims that there is some flexibility and that the general aim is to provide a report, but it is still not crystal clear in what circumstances the report will be provided when the scheme is about to be terminated or an offer has been made. Some guarantees about that would be welcome because, although I do not doubt the Minister&#146;s good intentions, the Bill now includes a clause that will enable future legislators and Governments to take a step back from what the Minister appears to claim. That is worrying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="60713-0013.htm_para10"><a name="06071354000636">I, too, regard it as fundamental that a copy of the investigation report is available to all parties, bringing together the facts of the case as soon as possible so that everybody can reach a clear decision about what has gone wrong and the action that needs to be taken.

acceptability of the scheme. Sadly, there will probably be further disagreement about that, but I shall not repeat the arguments at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="60713-0013.htm_para11"><a name="06071354000637">I am worried that the report is available only on request. Although the ability to ask for a report is a step forward, I believe that the emphasis is slightly wrong. As has been said, it is not clear what extra bureaucratic burden making available a report, which has already been prepared, puts on the NHS. What reassurances will there be that patients under the scheme will even know that they have a right to ask for the report. Will that be part of the explanation process? How will they become aware of that? There is a host of legislation, but there is also a great deal of ignorance among the public about what is and what is not available. At the very least, there needs to be a clear procedure for informing a patient about any report. Perhaps there should be an opt-out rather than an opt-in, because I fully accept that there might be a small number of cases where patients, for a variety of possible reasons&#151;they might have had a mental health problem associated with the report, or they might not want to be reminded of things&#151;are not interested and do not want to see it. However, everybody should know that such a measure is available and be able to access it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="60713-0013.htm_para12"><a name="06071354000638">Amendment No. 4 has cross-party and independent support. It makes it clear that there needs to be an independent investigation and that a report of any such investigation needs to be published. It also makes it clear that that needs to be an integral part of the process, rather than merely of the end of the proceedings. The Minister has clarified that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="60713-0013.htm_para13"><a name="06071354000639">Although I welcome the Government amendments, there are still a few small areas where refinements could be made to make the final version of the Bill clearer.</p>

 I, too, welcome the Minister&#146;s comments on openness, which is essential. I welcome the fact that the report will be available, if requested, and I echo the comments of the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) that the right to get that must be widely publicised and known. The need for a report of the fact-finding investigation has been emphasised to me several times recently. Healthcare Commission reports have been seen by the claimant and have been very definitely disagreed with for gaps and errors, and that has led to discussion, so it is crucial that this report is available.</p>

to me&#151;unlike at the current moment. The amendment might change only one small word&#151;&#147;may&#148; becomes &#147;must&#148;&#151;but that is the right thing to do, because it sends a stronger signal about the Government&#146;s intentions and, as the Minister probably recognises, the central challenge here is how to generate trust in the Government&#146;s proposals. Central to that is the perception of transparency and the sending of a signal that the Government understand what motivates people in this context. The Minister and other Committee members were very clear that a large part of people&#146;s motivation is to try to make sure that what they suffered is less likely to happen to other people. An annual report will play a part in that process. I also congratulate the Minister on listening to the arguments made in Committee&#151;principally by the hon.

As the Bill makes clear, a scheme must provide for investigation reports to be available on request, as the hon.

In our view, to adopt a rigid approach in primary legislation would be a mistake, but as I said in response to the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron), the intention is that the report that the scheme member makes available to the NHS Litigation Authority would ordinarily be the self-same report provided to the individual patient, on request, at the end of the process.</p>

It would be a mistake to make the Bill so rigid as to increase the potential burden on individual scheme members, which is why we have sought to retain some flexibility. Some of these matters will indeed be dealt with through the regulation-making process, but I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there will be further consultation with Members and within the NHS to get the balance right. The balance that we seek is openness and transparency for the patient and the right to see the details of their case as provided to the NHS Litigation Authority, while at the same time not creating a scheme that is so rigid that it churns round paperwork and is unnecessarily bureaucratic.</p>

 Can we be absolutely clear about this point? I and other Members have tried to question the Minister on it and we are having a little trouble pinning him down. We all agree that an investigation report will be produced at the end of the fact-finding stage.

 Of course, the report is not independent, as the hon. Gentleman just claimed, but the report of the scheme member to the NHS Litigation Authority. The purpose of proposed new subsection (2B) is to address the point that I made a moment ago. Ordinarily, most cases will not deserve a flurry of paperwork as the investigation goes on; many will be relatively straightforward. At the point at which redress is offered, the package that the individual receives will include: an explanation; if necessary, an apology; as other amendments that we have tabled make clear, an explanation of how lessons will be learned and action taken to prevent similar events from happening again; an offer of financial compensation; and, on request, a copy of the investigation report.</p>

My guess is that the number of such cases would be small, but there may be occasions when it would not be appropriate for investigation reports ordinarily to be provided. It is right to seek in primary legislation to create the flexibility to allow for such circumstances.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for listening to the representations made in Committee about the production of an annual report.

 Possibly, but that is why I would tell the hon. Gentleman that the Conservative amendment should be fiercely resisted. To publish such a report and put it into the public domain would be extremely detrimental and could damage the whole process that we are trying to construct. I believe that I made the point in Committee that there is an important balance to be struck between the wish to be open and transparent and the desire for candour and frankness in the reports. We would not want punches to be pulled in the construction and writing of these reports and we would like things explained as openly as possible, so there is a balance to be struck.</p>

Indeed, that is the spirit of the scheme and it explains why we tabled the Government amendments to make it clear that the report should ordinarily be provided to the individual. The hon.

 Words such as &#147;ordinarily&#148; need clarifying, particularly with respect to the Government amendment. May I ask the Minister a simple question, to which I would appreciate a simple answer? If patients want to see the investigation report&#151;he has admitted that it is going to be produced, so we are not talking about added bureaucracy&#151;will they be able to see it under all circumstances? I am talking about the patient seeing the report.</p>

 Obviously, there is no &#147;ordinarily&#148;. The proposed subsection (2A) makes it clear that on request a report should be provided to the individual seeking redress. Then we have proposed subsection (2B) because, as I have already explained, it would be inappropriate in some cases to provide the report on request. The individual seeking redress may not be the person to whom the health care was delivered and, in rare cases, patient confidentiality may be breached or it may be inappropriate to release sensitive information.</p>

He is right to challenge, but he should not interpret the provisions with such suspicion.</p>

Indeed, I hope that, rather than on request, the report will always be provided to the patient because, as I have said all along, that will facilitate the process of finality and closure. That will be a good thing in my view. In no way are we taking away with one hand what we appear to have given to the hon. Members for Billericay and for Romsey. I hope that he will understand that it is appropriate to include flexibility in the Bill, given that, as was just mentioned by the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart), such reports could contain highly sensitive information that it would be inappropriate to disclose in every case.</p>

consultation on that point, so that we can be precisely clear about where providing the report would not be appropriate. It is impossible to give a 100 per cent. guarantee that that will happen in every case, because that is not how the Bill is drafted. Proposed subsection (2B) has been drafted using the word &#147;may&#148;. It states that a &#147;scheme may provide&#148; to delay the provision of a report or to provide that a report need not be provided in rare cases. It simply gives flexibility.</p>

She said that a report will be compiled, so it is right that the patient should have access to that report. If it is accepted that a case should proceed under the NHS redress scheme, those provisions are laid down in the Bill, so the patient is left in a strong position, and the patient will be in an even stronger position as a result of the amendments.</p>

 This group of cross-party amendments reflects our concern that the NHS redress scheme, as envisaged in the Bill, lacks independence. This represents a missed opportunity to create a mechanism that will have the full confidence of patients and therefore provide a meaningful alternative to going to court. This is the key dividing line between the Government and the Opposition. I speak also for the Liberal Democrats and for the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) when I say that we believe that the fact-finding stage of the investigation must be independent. The Government do not agree. The Minister explicitly conceded that in stark terms in Committee, when he said that the scheme &#147;is not independent&#148;. In other words, the investigation will be conducted internally by the NHS. The very trust being investigated will be investigating itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="60713-0014.htm_para7"><a name="06071365000012">We believe that to be fundamentally wrong for a number of reasons. The first relates to the principle of natural justice. The NHS should not be its own judge and jury, as that represents a clear conflict of interest. Independence is a basic principle of natural justice enshrined in the rule against bias that no man or woman should be a judge in his or her own cause. We have consulted widely on this issue, and there is widespread concern outside this place about the lack of independence in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="60713-0014.htm_para8"><a name="06071365000013">There is also an issue of credibility. Independence is a pragmatic necessity, in the sense that an investigation without the badge of independence would lack credibility and fail to inspire the confidence of patients.

 The Minister makes a reasonable point. We believe that it is absolutely wrong that the trust being investigated should conduct that investigation. As is normal practice in coroners&#146; courts and the like, we suggest that the person who would oversee that investigation, who would be totally independent of the trust, could sign a disclosure of conflict of interest to ensure that there was no connection with the trust in question. Let us be clear: this is enabling legislation. We are trying to establish the principle of independence, which the Government will not even acknowledge. In our view, the best way of establishing that independence is to ensure that the person overseeing the investigation by the trust is independent of that trust.</p>

 It is very straightforward, and I am sorry that the Minister is having trouble with it. We are suggesting that whoever oversees the investigation should be independent of the trust in question. I hope that that is a simple concept to understand. That is the best way of importing independence into the scheme. We are trying to avoid the situation where the trust being investigated conducts the investigation itself. As this is enabling legislation, we are trying to import into the Bill the concept and principle of independence, something to which I think that the Minister&#151;certainly, he suggested this in Committee&#151;is totally opposed.</p>

<a name="60713-0014.htm_brev5"><a name="06071365000058"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are concerned that if the organisation which is responsible for defending trusts and hospitals is also charged with running the scheme, there may be a perception (whatever the reality) of a conflict of interest.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="60713-0014.htm_para11"><a name="06071365000020">That is terribly important. A change of culture within the NHS is desperately needed. At the moment, too many patients are frustrated by their inability to get to the truth, because they see themselves as fighting a bureaucracy that is not willing to co-operate. However, one cannot change the culture of a massive organisation such as the NHS by flicking a switch in Whitehall or through exhortation, as long as the trusts and individuals involved have an organisational and professional interest in the case&#151;a conflict of interest. Patients want an independent fact-finding investigation, in which they have faith because of its independence. There can be no substitute for that. In patients&#146; eyes, independence will guarantee an honest assessment of the facts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="60713-0014.htm_para12"><a name="06071365000021">To illustrate the point, I briefly beg the House&#146;s indulgence&#151;I am sure that all Members will have examples of constituents who have struggled&#151;to recount a very sad case from my constituency. A daughter of the family in question suffered brain damage as an infant but survived into young adulthood. Sadly, she died unexpectedly, shortly after abdominal surgery. Even to a layman&#151;it is a matter of common sense&#151;there was a striking temporal relation between the occurrence of the operation and the occurrence of her death. It required some explanation. However, the cause of death certificate made no mention of the recent surgery. There has been a post-mortem examination, but the pathologist made no mention of the recent surgery in determining the cause of death. The death had apparently not even been reported to the coroner immediately following its occurrence.</p>

But that is not the same thing as an independent scheme. Participation by independent lawyers in a process does not transform a non-independent process into an independent one.

The suggestion of joint instruction would add nothing that would not be available to the independent person overseeing the investigation. If the hon.

The Secretary of State and the Minister have made great play of the fact that the patient can always complain to the health service ombudsman and ask for a review to be undertaken by the Healthcare Commission.

 May I make a suggestion that may go at least half way towards answering the Minister?

 I am happy to intervene again. At the start of his contribution, the hon. Gentleman made it clear that he does not believe that the NHS should investigate itself. In Committee, his proposal was for independent and suitably qualified patient redress investigators, but now he is proposing something different. He needs to give the House an explanation of that, and not evade the question that I am about to ask. Will the people holding those posts be employed by neighbouring trusts, or by PCTs, or by a body such as the Healthcare Commission? If I am to answer him, he needs to be specific.

He seems unable to accept that we are trying to push for the principle and concept of independence. He has not refuted my earlier suggestion that he does not believe that the redress scheme should be independent, so there can be no merit in going into detail about how we would secure that independence.

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="60713-0015.htm_para3"><a name="06071365000050">In addition, the Minister has contrived the idea that an independent fact finding process would be adversarial, accusatory or finger pointing, but that makes no sense at all. There is a basic legal distinction between an adversarial process and an inquisitorial one. An inquisitorial process is concerned with fact finding, not fault finding; there is no sense in which such an investigation would reinforce a blame culture in the NHS. Indeed, our proposal for an independent fact finding process would ensure that the proceedings were not adversarial, as no lawyers would be present and no legal rights would be asserted or defended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="60713-0015.htm_para4"><a name="06071365000051">The Minister talked about promoting a culture of openness and honesty, in which the NHS takes responsibility for its own mistakes. He implied time and time again that because our proposal would require an independent outsider to go in and consider what went wrong&#151;he referred to that point again earlier today&#151;it argued against a culture of openness in the NHS and would encourage NHS staff to close ranks and clam up. But that is absurd. If the openness the Minister is talking about is all in-house and not exposed to outside scrutiny, it is not openness at all. There is a fundamental contradiction between the Government&#146;s desire to promote openness and the Minister&#146;s reluctance to allow an independent person to oversee the investigation of the facts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="60713-0015.htm_para5"><a name="06071365000052">In Committee, the Minister tried to ridicule our suggestion for an independent fact-finding process by talking about people &#147;snooping&#148; on trusts. He criticised the Opposition for not trusting NHS professionals to carry out an investigation into their own case, but that is a matter neither of snooping nor of trust. What exactly does the Minister believe that the NHS has to fear if his intention is to promote openness and honesty?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="60713-0015.htm_para6"><a name="06071365000053">I fear that the Minister has taken the problem at the heart of medical error&#151;the blame culture and the reluctance to admit mistakes&#151;and institutionalised it. Instead of challenging and confronting the problem, he has built his system around it. His non-independent scheme seeks to insulate the NHS from outside investigation even when such investigation is of a fact-finding rather than a fault-finding nature. He has set his heart on a non-independent scheme and will dredge up as many bad arguments as he can to support it. Saying that lessons should be learned, but only if they are the lessons the trust wants to learn, is not a genuine commitment to learning lessons or to changing the culture of the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="60713-0015.htm_para7"><a name="06071365000054">In conclusion, I return to my theme: independence is right both in practice and in principle. It complements the culture of openness the Minister is trying to promote. It would not be accusatory because we would separate fact-finding from fault-finding; we would keep the lawyers and the finger pointing out. It would allow lessons to be learned and would reassure the patient. That is the most important point, because without independence, the investigation of facts, which will eventually give rise to an assessment&#151;not a determination&#151;of liability and a possible offer of  <br>

There is broad consensus that we want a spirit of openness and honesty in the NHS; it needs to be part of the NHS culture. I know that attempts are being made to engender and promote that, with the emphasis on the reporting of incidents, which has quite a depressing effect because we then read reports that there are a million adverse incidents in the NHS in a year. Actually, it is good that any near miss&#151;any slight problem&#151;is reported, because we learn from those mistakes. We are moving towards a culture of openness and honesty, because people realise that in many instances there is no blame attached.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="60713-0015.htm_para9"><a name="06071366000016">Disagreement has arisen, however, because the Government seem to be wedded to the idea that in-house investigation will promote further openness and honesty.

For that reason, there seem to be a number of people who strongly support the concept of independence.</p>

 I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying and I appreciate the sincerity of his intent, but, in common with hon.

I was not saying, in any shape or form, that we should go from the patient having problems and needing redress straight to the ombudsman. However, as the Bill stands, we still have the trust investigating itself. We have moved away from that in other areas of government. The police used to investigate themselves. They do not do that any more because the public did not trust the methodology. We have moved away from that. I am not saying we should move straight to the ombudsman; I am saying that trust and natural justice should be addressed, which I am sure was the intention of the Bill at the start.

 We have heard a very powerful speech that goes to the heart of the issue, which is the patient experience. It is not possible for the House to focus too much on the position of someone who has been wronged by the system and has a great sense of grievance. In the system today, as the Government have described, such people all too often feel that their complaint is not taken seriously, they feel that an explanation has not been provided and they do not receive an apology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="60713-0015.htm_para19"><a name="06071366000035">Like my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning), I recognise that the Government and the Minister are sincere in their desire to create a decent redress scheme. Unfortunately, the more I have seen of the Bill and its proceedings, the clearer it has become that it is fundamentally flawed. Fault and fact finding will not be separated. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon) is right to challenge the notion that the NHS investigates itself. It has been used by Opposition Members to sum up the issue, and it is technically correct. I put it to the hon. Gentleman&#151;I know that he takes a great interest in this matter and is sincere in his views&#151;that the problem is not that the NHS investigates itself but that the trust that is responsible for letting down the individual patient ends up investigating the case.</p>

Where the local community feels that that is the case, where individuals have been negligently treated by the trust, the justice that they will receive under the Government&#146;s golden new system is that that trust will investigate itself. That is at the core of our objections to the Bill.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making an important point. Is it not important that we look at this matter through the eyes of families of constituents such as mine, who are trying to find any way they can to avoid having to go to court and employ expensive lawyers? They support the principles behind the Bill, but what they really want is a patients&#146; champion, or a families&#146; champion, separate from the trust. That is the key point.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I ask the Minister not to nit-pick at the concept of independence. It is not a failure on the part of the Opposition to fail to specify precisely which authority will oversee this. Doubtless there are various organisations that could do so, and a contribution from the Government to the discussion on how that could better be done would be useful. Rather than challenging the Conservatives to tell them how to run the Government, as this Government, in an intellectually bankrupt way, too often do, the Minister should tell us why he feels that no such body exists or could be created.</p>

Although he says&#151;and I welcome it&#151;that in nearly all cases the report into an incident will be made available to the patient concerned, unfortunately there are no guarantees on how often that would happen. The trust at fault could investigate itself, then refuse to present the report to the patient who has been wronged. When the Minister goes to sleep tonight, he must accept, in all good conscience, that he is a long way from the position that he wanted to secure when he first sought to provide a fairer system of justice for patients who have been wronged.</p>

 I cannot think of any reason. The Minister implied that he would like patients always to be provided with a copy of the report.

Imagine that, in a trust such as the one that I have described, there was a clinician who was not too popular with the trust&#146;s management, and a complaint was received. Who investigates it? Does an independent fact finder who is experienced in such investigations, and to whom we can look for an objective assessment of the facts, come in from outside? No, the trust&#146;s management, with whom the clinician may have a fractious relationship, decides on the facts of the case, writes up the report and may conceivably release it to the patient. Quite possibly, that patient&#146;s first act will be to stop at the local newspaper office on his way to the lawyers.</p>

 I will not respond to that, but I want to ask the hon. Gentleman a question. Does he accept that it is standard practice, not just in the public sector but in the private sector, that when a complaint is brought against an organisation, the first stage should be an investigation carried out by the organisation itself? Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that that does not happen in the private sector? If someone sought to escalate a case before such an investigation had happened, they would normally be told to take the matter back to the organisation for investigation and response.</p>

 The Minister makes a point with some power to it, but the Government introduced the Bill precisely because the NHS is not investigating itself in that way. It is because the matter is critical, not only to the patient but to the country as a whole, that independence is needed. The police have similar status, and it is similarly important that they should conduct themselves fairly, but it has been decided that they should not investigate themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="60713-0016.htm_para4"><a name="06071366000051">The Minister said at the beginning of his contribution that there will not be an independent investigation.

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for calling me to speak in this important debate. In Committee I thought that, by and large, this was a good Bill. There were some flaws in it, but on the whole it was facing in the right direction. However, I am becoming concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="60713-0016.htm_para5"><a name="06071366000053">The Bill raises the question of who is in charge of a hospital trust when a mistake is made. The answer, of course, is the chief executive. The buck stops with him. If a pattern of mistakes emerges, there is a danger that vested interests will begin to take hold. Would a chief executive therefore begin to take a much closer interest in the investigation process, perhaps to make sure that the full implications of the mistakes made do not see the light of day, or that if they do, they are kept well away from his office?</p>

constituents and others, a degree of independence would be wholly justified. Perhaps a complaint against a trust should be investigated by another trust. We see that happening in the police, where one force may investigate a complaint against another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="60713-0016.htm_para8"><a name="06071366000056">I know that the Minister is a hugely decent and honourable gentleman and I would not wish to waste his time by making puerile suggestions. I join my hon.

 I shall add one brief point. The Minister and the Government are deluding themselves in their claim that the Bill will transform the culture of the NHS. I say that for two reasons. First, we on the Conservative Benches are learning a little about culture change, and we know that it requires strong management and strong signals of change. The more I look at the Bill, the more it strikes me that it does little more than formalise what already happens. I cannot see that that is a strong signal of change to the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="60713-0016.htm_para9"><a name="06071366000058">Secondly, because necessarily at no point in the process is the legal threat removed&#151;it remains as a sword potentially hanging over the situation at all times&#151;I cannot see how that will make the NHS any more welcoming of a breathing space to face up to its failings or become more active in identifying problems. That is a delusion&#151; it would be much better to focus, as we do, on how the patients will respond to the opportunity. They will have two questions&#151; first, who will find out the facts? The Government say that will be done by the very trust that made the mistake. Secondly, who will define liability? The answer is the very agency whose priority is to defend the NHS. It is very difficult to see how patients will have any more confidence in the new system. It would be far better to focus on a guarantee of independence, as we propose, to find the facts.</p>

<p><a name="60713-0016.htm_spnew10"><a name="06071366002018"><b>Dr. Richard Taylor:</b>
 I am passionately on the side of those who want complete independence in the process. The Government have a short memory. The old NHS complaints procedure was not independent, in that the complaints convenor was time and again an employee of the trust or very often a non-executive director of the trust. That happened in my area. Only a minuscule number of complaints got through that trust employee. The Government then changed the NHS complaints procedure. Certainly, the first stage is the internal investigation, but then it moves on to the wider, completely independent part supervised by the Healthcare Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="60713-0016.htm_para10"><a name="06071366000059">I will give an example from personal memory. Rather a long time ago, I was a doctor doing my national service in the RAF. I had just got married. Within weeks of that, I was posted unaccompanied to Christmas Island. My commanding officer, who was the same sort of lovely, helpful, avuncular figure as Mr. Speaker himself, told me that an officer had the right to appeal to the Secretary of State for Air. So I came up to London in my best uniform to appeal to him, but who did I see? It was merely the lowly squadron leader who had given me the posting.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that Opposition Members again fundamentally misunderstand our constituents&#146; position? It is not the case that they do not want to complain to the relevant trust, that they do not want the trust to investigate itself or that they want immediate redress through an independent arbiter. My constituents want to complain to the trust that has done what they perceive to be wrong. They want the people responsible to take them seriously, consider the complaint in depth, find the solutions and provide some answers. The Bill simply creates a process and provides a huge array of tools to enable trusts to do that. That is the purpose of the measure, which Opposition Members have fundamentally failed to understand throughout our proceedings.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right and there is probably no point in my saying more, but I shall say a little. He has expressed exactly what our constituents want when they come to our advice surgeries. They want their local trusts to see for themselves the mistake that has been made, acknowledge it, apologise, explain and take steps that will stop that happening to other local people&#151;their neighbours who live in the same community. That is what they want.</p>

The hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) said that he could not take those complaints to trusts because they would not have the trust of the public; he used words exactly to that effect.</p>

 No, I will not, because I listened to the hon. Gentleman at length. <i> [Interruption.]</i> Well, that was the distinct impression that I got when listening to the points that he made.</p>

 Let us be absolutely clear. There is already an independent structure for the making of complaints; what we are talking about here is qualifying liabilities in tort. The Minister risks confusing the two, so let us restrict our comments to qualifying liabilities in tort. He suggested that independence can be imported in some way. He has clearly stated that he believes that the scheme is not independent and he suggests that importing lawyers&#151;so to speak&#151;will somehow make the scheme independent. The trouble is that lawyers do not turn a non-independent scheme into an independent one, because they assert or defend legal rights. I ask the Minister to address that point. In addition, expert medical advice would be available to patients anyway, and that right would be ensured&#151;guaranteed&#151;under our system by the independent person overseeing the investigation. So again, this scheme does not add value.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is entitled to draw his own conclusions from my explanations. Let me say again clearly that he is right in that, for a case to qualify under the scheme, there has to be a recognition of a liability in tort, and that it then follows that there is a likelihood that compensation or other recompense might be due under the scheme. That is the qualifying gateway for cases dealt with under the scheme. However, we are proposing the breathing space of an out-of-court settlement scheme, so that it is not necessary to go through an expensive and polarised legal process in which people dig in for a long and complicated battle, often to the great frustration of individual patients who are kept waiting for a long time. In many instances, those cases are abandoned or do not come to court.</p>

more quickly to individual patients. The national health service will thereby be encouraged to take a positive approach to identifying mistakes and accepting and acknowledging problems by offering an apology and an explanation to such individuals, and by making financial recompense where necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="60713-0017.htm_para1"><a name="06071366000081">There is no doubt in my mind about the scheme. I resist amendment No. 1 because it would import the independent legal process into the scheme and turn it into something different by replicating the rights that the patient gets under the second stage legal scheme. If this scheme fails and cannot satisfactorily give redress to the individual concerned, they will still have the right to take forward an independent legal action outside the scheme; they sign nothing away by allowing their case to be proceeded with under the scheme. The scheme does something different.</p>

 I appreciate the Minister&#146;s generosity in taking interventions and I thank him for that. He and we agree that this scheme should be an alternative to going to court; that is the Government&#146;s and the Opposition&#146;s stated aim. However, does the Minister accept that the scheme&#146;s credibility therefore becomes very important? There is more likelihood of patients not going to court if they have faith in the scheme being presented to them. The best way of having faith in the scheme is ensuring that it has credibility, and the best way of ensuring that is to ensure that it is truly independent. Otherwise, many patients will come to the conclusion that it is not independent and that there is no change from the present situation. They have had the internal system many times before and now they want something different. The difference that they want is independence.</p>

 There is a built-in incentive for trusts to settle under the scheme because if they fail to do so, they face the prospect of duplicating effort and going through a further legal battle. The fact that the scheme contains a built-in incentive for trusts to settle will help to build faith in it. That is precisely why my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington tabled his new clause, putting a positive duty on seeking resolution, thereby avoiding the need to go to the courts. He was absolutely right about that, but we have provided for independent oversight of the scheme through the ability of individuals to take their case to the parliamentary ombudsman. People can ask the ombudsman to ascertain whether or not a case was adequately investigated and the process handled properly&#151;a responsibility that the ombudsman has welcomed.</p>

I would like to see a substantial reduction  <br>

of cases going up to the Healthcare Commission level or on to the courts. It is precisely because the first stage of the investigation is inadequate that people feel that they have to go up to the higher level and it has to be right to encourage the NHS to do a better job at that first stage. We will thus avoid the need for cases to be passed up to the Healthcare Commission or the courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="60713-0017.htm_para4"><a name="06071366000088">We have had a long debate about the scheme that we propose and the costly, bureaucratic, complicated scheme that the Opposition are seeking to impose on us. They are asking us to accept a bunch of amendments that, quite frankly, have not been thought through and are completely chaotic. I will not go there, so I ask my hon. Friends not to accept such a proposition and to resist the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="st_o338"><a name="06071366000089"><a name="60713-0017.htm_spnew4"><a name="06071366002034"><b>Mr. Baron:</b>
 It will not surprise you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to learn that I am somewhat disappointed by the Minister&#146;s response. I do not deny his good intentions in wanting to create an alternative to going to the courts. The problem is that the scheme in the Bill does not reflect patient priorities. What patients want more than anything else is an explanation, an apology if due, and an honest assessment of the facts. Very often, compensation is a secondary consideration, but the Minister&#146;s proposals risk putting compensation in front of explanation when it comes to the operation of the scheme.</p>
<a name="06071366001956">
<p>Patients want to ensure that the lessons have been learned for the benefit of others. I am sure that the Minister would not disagree with that, but if we are to achieve it, we need an open and honest examination of the facts. There can be nothing more open and honest than having an independent person from outside the trust coming in to oversee the investigation of the trust itself. I do not understand why the Government are so worried about someone coming in from outside to investigate the facts. If we are serious about changing the culture within the NHS, ensuring that it learns from its mistakes and that investigations are open and transparent, there is no better way than ensuring that the person overseeing the investigation is independent. Otherwise, what does the NHS have to hide?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="60713-0017.htm_para5"><a name="06071366000090">Again, with regard to the Minister&#146;s comments about bureaucracy&#151;it was a throwaway line, but he referred to it again&#151;he was very wide of the mark. We are not proposing to create a bureaucracy. The Government have admitted that they are suggesting a two-stage process, and we accept that it is a two-stage process: the examination of the facts and then an assessment of the liability by the NHSLA. The infrastructure for the first, fact-finding stage is already in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="60713-0017.htm_para6"><a name="06071366000091">All we are suggesting is that the person who oversees the investigation must be independent of the trust. We are not suggesting the creation of a massive bureaucracy, and I suggest that the Minister does not understand that fact and that it is a question of who oversees the investigation itself. For those reasons, I am afraid that I have not been persuaded by the Minister&#146;s arguments and I will press the amendment to a Division, to test the opinion of the House.</p>

have faith in the system, it is important for them to have confidence in that medical expert and in the expert&#146;s independence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="60713-0017.htm_para12"><a name="06071366000547">Amendments Nos. 12 and 15 make it clear that, if the scheme provides for the services of medical experts in certain circumstances, and if an individual case falls within those circumstances, the medical expert will be jointly instructed by the scheme authority and the individual seeking redress. Therefore, when the services of medical experts are provided for under the scheme, the medical expert will be an agreed independent expert and the services of that expert will be provided without charge to the individual. For the avoidance of doubt, I repeat that the expert will be independent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="60713-0017.htm_para13"><a name="06071366000548">As the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh), who has now joined us, said in Committee, it would not be reasonable to expect a lay person to instruct a medical expert on a complex issue. That is a fair point. I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that we have the existing power in clause 8(1)(a) to enable legal advice to be made available to individuals when it is needed at an earlier stage under the scheme. Legal advice is not restricted to the stage at which an offer is made. We specifically have in mind that legal advice may be appropriate to enable an individual to be fully informed and involved in the joint instruction of an expert.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="60713-0017.htm_para14"><a name="06071366000549">Although amendment No. 15 makes specific reference to medical experts</p>
<a name="60713-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="06071366001960"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;instructed jointly by the scheme authority and the individual seeking redress under the scheme&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="60713-0017.htm_para15"><a name="06071366000550">I can reassure Members that it is our firm intention that the individual seeking redress will have access to appropriate legal advice without charge. However, amendment No. 5 would remove the flexibility to provide free legal advice earlier. We want that flexibility: by rigidly excluding free legal advice, the scheme will not assist patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="60713-0017.htm_para16"><a name="06071366000551">The argument for removing clause 8(1)(a) produced in Committee was that legal advice was not necessary during the fact-finding process. Investigation ascertains what happened, and for that no legal advice is necessary. I have to say that I do not agree with that assessment. For example, there will be circumstances in which it will be appropriate for there to be instruction of medical experts to help ascertain the facts of a particular case. Government amendments Nos. 12 and 15 clarify that, where provision is made for the services of medical experts, the medical experts are to be jointly instructed by the scheme authority and the individual seeking redress. I consider it entirely reasonable, where the patient wishes it, for legal advice without charge to be made available in those circumstances. Many patients will be unaware of the issues involved in jointly instructing a medical expert and it would be unreasonable to expect a lay person to do so without advice. If the redress scheme is to be effective and to gain the confidence of patients, there needs to be appropriate support throughout the process. The aim behind the legal advice is to assist individuals seeking redress. I therefore reject amendment No. 5.</p>

are providing advice. It was suggested that clarification was required to make it clear whether the legal advice that may be provided under this clause was to be provided to the person seeking redress or to the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="60713-0018.htm_para1"><a name="06071366000553">The amendments make it clear that, in relation to clause 8(1)(a), the client is to be the individual seeking redress, rather than, say, the redress scheme. Legal advice may therefore, without doubt, be provided to individuals seeking redress under the scheme. However, I think that it is important to make clear the intention behind clause 8(1)(a). We want to ensure that patients going through the redress scheme can make a genuine, informed choice when presented with options. Clause 8(1)(a) will enable legal advice to be provided to patients, where appropriate, during the scheme&#151;for example, to assist with the joint instruction of medical experts. However, I confirm that the intentions behind this clause are to facilitate fact finding and resolution and, equally importantly, to ensure fairness within the system by better enabling patients to make an informed choice. Clause 8(1) provides the flexibility for the provision of services that may help to reach an agreement to settle. The advice provided to the individual remains the property of the individual and would not be disclosed to the scheme authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="60713-0018.htm_para2"><a name="06071366000554">Amendment No. 7 would remove the explicit power in clause 8(3) enabling the scheme to provide that free legal advice has to be supplied by a provider included in a list held by a specified person or body. As drafted, clause 8(3) enables the scheme to provide that free legal advice, whether provided when an offer is made or at an earlier stage, has to be supplied by a provider included in such a list. It is envisaged that the scheme may provide that the list of solicitors firms that will provide legal advice under the NHS redress scheme will be those firms that are authorised by the Legal Services Commission to undertake publicly funded work, and that have agreed to provide advice under the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="60713-0018.htm_para3"><a name="06071366000555">Any organisation undertaking clinical negligence work under an LSC contract must hold a specialist quality mark in clinical negligence. The LSC awards the quality mark to individual offices. To gain the mark, the firm or office must have a solicitor who is on either the Law Society or the Action against Medical Accidents panel to ensure the work undertaken will be under the supervision of an experienced individual solicitor. We intend that approved providers of legal advice under the redress scheme will be restricted to firms that have achieved the quality mark status in clinical negligence. Clause 8(3) seeks to guarantee that the legal advice offered under the scheme is of a suitable and high standard, and I therefore oppose the amendment.</p>

 The purpose of our amendments is to restrict the role of lawyers, except where legal rights are affected&#151;that is, at the offer stage. The Minister has accepted that the policy underlying the Bill is to provide a genuine alternative to litigation. Under the redress scheme, offers may be made on the basis of the NHSLA&#146;s internal assessment&#151;not its determination&#151;of liability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="60713-0018.htm_para6"><a name="06071366000559">Legal rights are not determined but remain intact, as the person concerned can resort to litigation at any time. Accordingly, it is difficult to see why lawyers need to be involved before an offer is made or a settlement is considered, when legal rights may be waived as part of a compromise agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="60713-0018.htm_para7"><a name="06071366000560">The Secretary of State agreed with that sentiment on Second Reading. She said:</p>
<a name="60713-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="06071366001961"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am quite certain that lawyers will argue...that much more legal advice should be made available all the way through the process. If we do that, however, we might as well stick with the existing situation in which people seek legal advice and go to court.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 5 June 2006; Vol. 447, c. 33.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="60713-0018.htm_para8"><a name="06071366000561">However, the Government amendments show that the Government have changed their position. They now want to involve lawyers, in a misguided attempt to enhance the scheme&#146;s credibility. I believe that that will make the process more adversarial. Involving lawyers risks causing whoever is involved in the fact-finding investigation to clam up. We do not want lawyers asserting or defending legal rights, as that will import into the process considerations of fault and defensiveness, whereas we believe that the investigation needs to be open and transparent. The Government proposals are the worst of all worlds, and will add to precisely that blame culture that the Minister says that he wants to avoid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="60713-0018.htm_para9"><a name="06071366000562">In addition, there is the question of cost. The more lawyers involved in the investigation, the greater will be the cost&#151;to the scheme and to the NHS and at the expense of patient care. In other words, if more money is soaked up in lawyers&#146; fees, less will be available for patient care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="60713-0018.htm_para10"><a name="06071366000563">The NHSLA annual report for 2006 came out a couple of days ago and made reference to the problem. The Government may think that only the Opposition are concerned that ever higher costs will divert resources away from patient care, but the report states:</p>
<a name="60713-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="06071366001962"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Authority remains concerned about the relatively high legal costs which are often incurred in clinical negligence claims, and which do not benefit either injured patients or the NHS.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="60713-0018.htm_para11"><a name="06071366000564">Yet the Government want to involve more lawyers earlier in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="60713-0018.htm_para12"><a name="06071366000565">The added costs might be worth while if it could be shown clearly that they added value, but the evidence suggests that they would not. The objective measure of the performance of so-called specialist lawyers is worth considering. In a letter to a member of the public dated 7 November 2002, the Legal Services Commission stated that, since August 1999, only specialist lawyers had been able to start new cases on legal aid. In 2000-01, the overall success rate in clinical negligence cases was 23 per cent. for specialist lawyers, and 24 per cent. for non-specialist lawyers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="60713-0018.htm_para13"><a name="06071366000566">According to a written answer to me on 17 January 2006, in the last year for which figures were available, the overall success rate for legally aided clinical  <br>

<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>13 July 2006 : Column 1565</b><br>
negligence cases had remained at 23 per cent. The figures are revealing. First, they show that about five or six years ago, when ongoing legally aided clinical negligence cases had specialist and non-specialist lawyers, the performance of both categories of lawyers was roughly comparable. Secondly, even though legal aid was made available only to specialist lawyers in 1999, the figures show that there has been no improvement since then in excluding opportunistic and unsustainable claims.</p>

Involving lawyers would replicate the problems of the adversarial litigation system. It would add to the cost of the redress process and subvert its functions, with the focus on compensation rather than on explanation. In many cases, involving lawyers would be the worst of all worlds; it would import the bad aspects of the judicial process&#151;expensive lawyers, protracted cases and complexity&#151;without the benefits of finality and independence. It would certainly add considerably to the cost of the scheme&#151;&#151;money that would be better spent on patient care&#151;</p>

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para0"><a name="06071366001016">I am pleased to be able to send the Bill back to another place, and I hope that their lordships will give it their blessing. Although there remain some differences between ourselves and Opposition Members that we have discussed today, there is a good measure of consensus on the Bill. There is a belief that this is a good Bill that will change for the better the lives of patients who have been harmed during the course of their NHS health care. I am pleased with the Bill and firmly believe that it has benefited from the scrutiny that it has received. During its passage through this House, we have given it a thorough examination. The Government have listened and responded to points raised in debate, and we have amended the Bill accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para1"><a name="06071366001017">Importantly, following debate in another place, the Bill was amended to enable the scope of the redress scheme to be enlarged. The scheme may now extend to services over and above hospital services. That addressed concerns that the scheme would be incapable of adapting to the increasing diversity of NHS health care provision, as the NHS moves towards the greater provision of what have traditionally been secondary care services in primary care environments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para2"><a name="06071366001018">Following debate in Committee, we accepted that redress will now ordinarily include not only an offer of compensation, an explanation and an apology, but the giving of a report on the action that has been or will be taken to prevent similar cases from arising. I say again that that is what our constituents overwhelmingly want when they come to us with complaints about their NHS treatment. They want to ensure that people in their locality do not go through a similar experience; they want things to change for the better. We have taken on board the fact that patients often want to know what measures have been or will be taken to ensure that the mistake does not happen again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para3"><a name="06071366001019">We have also accepted that the scheme must now provide for an investigation report to be prepared and given to an individual on request. That was in response to the persuasive arguments that providing patients with investigation reports will better ensure an open and credible investigation. We believe that that will provide additional reassurance to individuals that their cases will be properly investigated, but of course if an individual believes that the investigation by the scheme member falls below the acceptable standard, the ombudsman may ultimately provide an independent review of any complaint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para4"><a name="06071366001020">Furthermore, the scheme must now require members to publish an annual report about cases dealt with under the scheme and lessons to be learned. We have taken it on board that there should be a guarantee that annual reports on lessons to be learned will be prepared and published.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para5"><a name="06071366001021">Additionally, we have accepted the point, made eloquently today by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon), that there should be enshrined in the Bill the principle of the desirability of resolution under the scheme. That is something to which members of the scheme must have regard in carrying out their duties under it. I am sure that the Simon amendment will have a positive effect in creating the open learning culture in our NHS that I believe Members in all parts of the House would like to see the Bill encourage. I am grateful to him for tabling it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para6"><a name="06071366001022">We have clarified that the free legal advice that may be provided under the scheme will be provided to the individual seeking redress, and we have inserted a new provision to make it clear, that if the scheme provides for the services of medical experts, those experts will be jointly instructed by the scheme authority and the individual seeking redress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para7"><a name="06071366001023">I firmly believe that these changes significantly improve the Bill and provide greater reassurance that the scheme established under the powers in the Bill will provide what patients want. As I have said, it is those people who are less articulate and less able to see a case through to the bitter end who may benefit the most from the scheme. In cases where harm has occurred, the NHS will take up the case, investigate it and offer an apology, an explanation and, if necessary, redress. That is clearly in the interests of patients and entirely consistent with the further reforms that the Government are introducing to create an NHS centred around the needs of the individual patient. The Bill will further strengthen the NHS in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para8"><a name="06071366001024">I thank hon. Members for their contributions today and in Committee. I was pleased to give the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) her first success in Parliament. It was a good Committee and, despite differences on the issue of independent investigation, all Members contributed positively and the Bill is better as a result. I particularly thank my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington, who contributed constructively throughout the proceedings, and who has improved the Bill. I thank my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), who did so much work to prepare and introduce a Bill that is excellent in every respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para9"><a name="06071366001025">I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as well as our Chairmen in Committee and the excellent team of officials in the Department of Health who provided support throughout the Bill&#146;s passage. The scheme is excellent, and it will improve the national health service, so I commend it to the House.</p>

 It is with mixed feelings that I rise to speak on Third Reading. We had hoped to support the Bill, which has the worthy aim of providing an alternative to going to court for NHS patients seeking redress, but despite some lively and learned debates, both on the Floor of the House and in Committee, it is significantly weaker than the measure that was brought to the House from another place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para10"><a name="06071366001027">We thank you for supervising our debates and for your customary patience and guidance, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The principles underlying the Bill were at least  <br>

tested and clarified during its passage through the Commons; I accept what the Minister said on that point, to a certain extent. I thank the Clerks for their advice on amendments and procedure, which was extremely helpful. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien), who served as Conservative Whip in Committee. He gave us the benefit of his legal training on a number of points, and I am grateful to him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para11"><a name="06071366001028">The hon. Members for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) and for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor), helped to ensure that our attempts to improve the Bill were pursued on cross-party lines. I am grateful for their support, which built on the amicable partnership established by noble Friends in another place. I, too, thank all Members for their contributions, both in the House and in Committee. I commend the Minister on guiding his first health Bill through the House, although trying to pin him down on some of the issues has been a game of cat and mouse. However, we can save that subject for another day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para12"><a name="06071366001029">The overall objective of the Bill&#151;to provide an alternative to going to court by creating a redress scheme&#151;has been widely welcomed. As we know, clinical negligence litigation is complex, costly and basically unfair. Most people do not qualify for legal aid, yet most cases are legal aid-funded. Most clinical negligence cases fail because legal aid is the fuel for unmeritorious claims. A scheme established under clause 1 could widen access to redress and offer patients what they say they want most: a proper and honest investigation into what went wrong, an explanation and, when appropriate, an apology&#151;there is no difference between us on that. Under clause 3, an offer of compensation might be appropriate, but financial redress usually comes far down the list of patient priorities, as a number of Members have said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para13"><a name="06071366001030">The Minister will know of my great disappointment with the Bill in its current form. I do not believe that the fact-finding stage of the investigation will inspire confidence in patients, because the investigation will not be independent. What is more, the objectivity of the fact-finding investigation is likely to be subverted by the involvement of lawyers under clause 8. Many features of the current disastrous system for dealing with clinical negligence have been imported into the redress scheme, and overall the Bill will not succeed in shifting the culture of the NHS towards one of greater openness and transparency that we all want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para14"><a name="06071366001031">Clause 6 is the offending article, because it would allow the NHS to act as both judge and jury in investigations by the trusts. We have consistently argued that someone independent of the trust should conduct the investigation. Patients go to court because they want compensation and an independent investigation into what went wrong during their treatment. In seeking to provide an alternative to litigation, we should have regard to that basic need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para15"><a name="06071366001032">Clause 6 is flawed because it does not address such a need. Instead, it allows for the investigation to be carried out by the trust under investigation. That will not inspire confidence in patients and without that confidence, the Bill is likely to fail. The Minister is aware of this complaint, which has been raised by many hon. Members and by many patient groups. However, he seems to be more concerned with  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="13 July 2006">

reassuring NHS staff than he is with reassuring NHS patients. He has insisted that under the scheme an investigation of facts should not be independent of the trust. He has argued that trusts should have ownership of the process in order to bring about a cultural shift towards greater openness and transparency, but to most people that is entirely contradictory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para16"><a name="06071366001033">After all, what could be more open and transparent than inviting an outsider&#151;somebody independent&#151;in to consider all the facts? As we have heard, it is a basic principle of natural justice that no man or woman should be a judge in their own case. The same goes for investigation of cases of possible clinical negligence. Because patients understand this principle, our pragmatic complaint against the Bill is that clause 6 will not satisfy those seeking redress. It will not provide an independent exposition of the facts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para17"><a name="06071366001034">The Opposition have similar reservations about clause 8 which, as amended, will import into the scheme the very feature of litigation that has fostered a culture of finger-pointing and blame&#151;that is, lawyers seeking to assert or defend rights. Lawyers are costly but add limited value to a fact-finding investigation. They have no place in the scheme because individual rights are not being contested. Liability is assessed, rather than determined. They are likely to soak up resources originally intended for patient care, with every incentive to push claims beyond their merits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para18"><a name="06071366001035">Lawyers need to be involved only where legal rights are being determined&#151;that is, in relation to an offer of settlement. Specialist legal representation under clause 8 will not guarantee the independence of the investigation. It will merely encourage confusion between fact-finding and fault-finding within the scheme. Accusations of blame will contaminate the objective consideration of facts. That will lead to a more closed and defensive culture among NHS staff. Important lessons will not be learned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para19"><a name="06071366001036">Again, the Bill works against the stated aims of the Government. It contradicts the opinion expressed by the Secretary of State on Second Reading that lawyers should be kept out of the early stages of the investigation. It also flies in the face of the recommendation of Sir Liam Donaldson, who argued for a move away from the adversarial culture associated with tort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para20"><a name="06071366001037">My deepest frustration with the Bill is that it adds almost nothing to what can be done already. It is unnecessary, in many respects. NHS trusts already have the power to investigate themselves where cases of possible clinical negligence are identified. The Litigation Authority already has the power to make an assessment of NHS liability and offer compensation accordingly. The Bill simply formalises these existing powers. One of the few new things that it provides is free legal advice. That sounds good, but it could be a costly mistake, as experience of legally aided clinical negligence litigation suggests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para21"><a name="06071366001038">As amended, the Bill provides for a report on the investigation to be made available to patients, but it then goes on to establish reasons why the report can be withheld in some cases, although I appreciate the Minister&#146;s attempt at clarification on the matter. That was revealing, for it shows how the Government&#146;s  <br>

priorities are focused on the interests of the NHS Litigation Authority, rather than on the needs of patients, in some respects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para22"><a name="06071366001039">In conclusion, we were happy to vote for the Bill on Second Reading, but since then we believe the Government have greatly undermined its potential. The whole direction of travel has been towards a scheme which leaves the trust acting as judge and jury in its own case while simultaneously importing the bad features of clinical negligence litigation. Having damaged the Bill, the Government do not deserve our support. For this reason and with great disappointment, I shall ask my Conservative colleagues to vote against Third Reading.</p>

 I rise to speak on Third Reading with mixed feelings, because I felt at many stages during the Bill&#146;s progress that there was a lot of genuine consensus based on honesty and openness, on trying to ensure that patients could have a means of redress, and on facilitating that in as many ways as possible. Unfortunately, we have reached a point where there is a fundamental difference between Members on either side of the House on how we achieve those ends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para23"><a name="06071366001041">The Committee stage of the Bill was unusually short, which was a first for me. I thank the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron) for his co-operation, the Committee Clerk for his forbearance, and the Chairs. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh), who supported me in Committee. I also thank the Minister. It is somewhat unusual to put forward arguments and find them genuinely listened to and accepted. I pay great tribute to him for that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o348"><a name="06071366001042"><a name="60713-0019.htm_spnew3"><a name="06071366002914"><b>Steve Webb:</b>

 Well, I think that we are sometimes too quick to criticise and not to give credit where it is due. I am hoping to start a new trend, although I do not think that I will succeed. The amendments that the Minister accepted were welcome because they have strengthened what the patient can expect under the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para24"><a name="06071366001044">The Bill was better when it came from the other place, which is why we were happy to support it on Second Reading. Sadly, the principles of independent investigation have in effect been removed. It is a struggle to balance the importance of that against the importance of all the good things in the Bill. A big part of me does not want to vote against the Bill, because it is a step forward, but losing the fundamental principle of an independent investigation will lead patients to not have the faith in the Bill that they otherwise could and should. It is with some regret, but to underline the importance of the strength of feeling on the matter of independence, that Liberal Democrats will vote alongside the Conservatives.</p>

legal advice, save to say that the whole tone of their remarks was so ill-judged as to be irresponsible and dangerous, and stems from a fundamental lack of understanding of what the Bill is about and a failure to understand the subtleties and complexities of clinical negligence and surrounding issues.</p>

<p><a name="st_o351"><a name="06071366001046"><a name="60713-0019.htm_spnew6"><a name="06071366002917"><b>Mr. Baron:</b>

 No. Hardly anybody gave way to me in Committee or this afternoon, so I will just make my brief remarks and sit down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para25"><a name="06071366001048">I spoke more than once on Second Reading and in Committee about different ways in which the Bill could have been dealt with from the beginning and different ways in which it could have been improved throughout. Most fundamentally, if I had designed the Bill, I would not have based it on the rather limiting test of liability in tort, but tried to develop a more modern, flexible and patient-centred avoidability test. For me, that is the key remaining weakness, although there is no reason why such issues should not be considered in future. My hon. Friend the Minister said that the operation of the Bill and the scheme will be reviewed. I urge him to examine those matters in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para26"><a name="06071366001049">On the whole, the scheme and the Bill are good. It could make a genuine difference to people&#146;s lives at times of sickness, and to their relations with the NHS when it lets them down and they try to deal with that. I am pleased with and proud of the way in which the Bill has developed and changed. I sincerely recommend it to patients and patient consumer organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para27"><a name="06071366001050">My hon. Friend the Minister has provided a masterclass in listening government. He has trodden carefully and chosen wisely. He has done that with tolerance and good humour and won grudging plaudits from some Opposition Members. He has my wholehearted admiration and thanks. Until today, albeit on occasions, most Opposition Members had made a good fist of it, and my thanks and congratulations go to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para28"><a name="06071366001051">The Bill was basically good all along. It is now immeasurably better for having been through Parliament. One cannot say either of those things about many measures. Having been involved with a Bill that satisfies both criteria, we should count ourselves lucky and commend it to our constituents and concerned organisations.</p>

 I shall not keep the Whips from their tea for more than a few moments, but I cannot resist telling the Minister that he is in danger of making me change one of my after-dinner speeches. My limited experience of Standing Committees has been uniformly depressing and frustrating. When I served on a Committee a long time ago, a senior Member whispered in my ear that he had tabled 600 amendments and not one was accepted. Yet an amendment to the Bill has been accepted. That is absolutely brilliant and I commend the Minister for that. He will be known as a listening Minister, and I  <br>

hope that that will not be perceived as a sign of weakness and that he will continue to listen and take points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="60713-0019.htm_para29"><a name="06071366001053">Having said that, I still have two genuine worries. Sadly, I do not believe that we conveyed clearly what we meant by independence. I hope that the involvement of legal representation in the fact-finding part of the investigation will not increase the complexity of the process, make it adversarial or increase the stress levels for patients, relatives and staff. The medical profession abominate the involvement of the legal profession, as I am sure hon. Members realise.</p>

 I rise to present the petition of Respect for Animals, a seal protection organisation, and UK citizens opposed to the brutal slaughter of seal pups by Canada. The petition is signed by J. MacManus and more than 31,000 other citizens, and will be followed by further petitions. It is dedicated today to Tony Banks, whose memorial has just taken place in the Robing Room.</p>

The Petitioners further declare that they are appalled by the cruelty of the hunt. They note that a team of independent veterinarians who observed the Canadian seal hunt in 2001 found that 42 per cent. of the seals examined were likely conscious when skinned; are concerned that the current level of killing is unsustainable for the harp seal population; and that trade data shows that thousands of seal skins were imported into the UK between 1995 and 2003. The Petitioners further declare that the US banned imports of all seal products in 1972 and that Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy currently have initiatives to ban such trade.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of protection for children who run away or go missing from home or care, especially as I have a ten-minute Bill, supported by many Members, which has not yet secured time for a Second Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="60713-0020.htm_para10"><a name="06071366001906">The Children&#146;s Society, the National Missing Persons Helpline, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ChildLine, Parents And Children Together, Railway Children, local charities such as Talk Don&#146;t Walk in my constituency, the children&#146;s lead of the Association of Directors of Social Services and the missing persons lead of the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Metropolitan police and the Police National Missing Persons Bureau have all contributed to the Bill&#146;s preparation. The Bill&#146;s main purpose is to establish a simple co-ordinating mechanism to identify and implement best practice, monitor what is happening and make sure that it works. In particular, the Bill would place a duty on the Secretary of State to promote the establishment of a national strategy, safeguard runaway and missing children and provide for the collection and reporting of information about runaway and missing children. It is not about creating a bureaucracy; it is about putting someone in charge and making someone responsible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="60713-0020.htm_para11"><a name="06071366001907">What is the current position? Research by the Children&#146;s Society indicates that an estimated 77,000 children and young people under the age of 16 run away for the first time every year. It also states that there are around 129,000 incidents of children running away overnight every year.</p>

Anecdotal evidence suggests a range of circumstances in which children and young people choose to leave home or care. I have been given evidence about very vulnerable children out on their own with no one to help them. In the House, we do not know the nature of the problem or have the information. I asked how many children on the child protection register from each local authority area have been reported missing to the police, and received the reply that the information is not collected centrally. I asked how many children in local authority care were reported missing from care to the police in each local authority area, but the information is not collected centrally. I asked which local authority children&#146;s services have agreed joint protocols with their police authorities for the management of cases of children reported missing from home or care. Again, the information is not collected centrally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="60713-0020.htm_para13"><a name="06071366001909">The &#147;Every Child Matters: Change for Children&#148; programme, is making a huge impact on the well-being of children in local communities. We must have a mechanism, however, to ensure that children who run away or go missing, and who have nowhere safe to go, have help that meets their needs where they are. Protection and services for young runaways must become a priority. Those children can become invisible, and we must not let that happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="60713-0020.htm_para14"><a name="06071366001910">The police have given me anonymous case histories, and I shall share just a few with the House to describe how hard life can be for some of our children. One is of a young boy living with his mother, stepfather and two older children. At home, his parents, who were heavy drinkers, neglected him, and his sisters bullied him. He was also the victim of bullying at school. He was frequently reported missing to the police, spending nights at the homes of his friends, riding buses or sleeping rough, often with other children who had run away. On two occasions, he presented himself to the local police station, saying that he did not want to go home. Eventually, he was placed in care in October 2003, when he was 13 years old. He has continued to go missing from his care placement, and 220 missing-person reports were recorded between October 2003 and June 2006. While missing, he has been a victim of crime on five separate occasions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="60713-0020.htm_para15"><a name="06071366001911">In 1996, aged six, a young girl first came to the notice of police when her teacher discovered that her mother had assaulted her. During 2002 and 2003, aged 12 and 13, she was reported missing on numerous occasions, and 20 separate incidents were reported on police intelligence records. While missing, she was having relationships with older men who were exploiting her. On one occasion she was interviewed by police, and stated that she was having unprotected sex with her boyfriend with the intention of becoming pregnant. He was 25. She also stated that her boyfriend encouraged her to have sex with other men, in return for which she received favours such as alcohol, cigarettes or money. She was 12 years old at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="60713-0020.htm_para16"><a name="06071366001912">The girl was placed in care, but continued to be reported missing on a regular basis. Her foster carer reported to police on one occasion that she was claiming to be carrying drugs from one place to another for dealers. On one occasion, she was found in the flat of a 45-year-old man to whom she was not related; also sleeping in the flat was a known prostitute. The girl was placed in a care home in another county, but has continued to be reported missing from there. Between August 2002 and September 2005, between the ages of 12 and 15, she made 12 allegations of serious crimes, including very serious crimes against the person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="60713-0020.htm_para17"><a name="06071366001913">Another child first ran away from home at the age of 13. She was missing for five days, and it transpired that she had spent most of that time sleeping rough, sometimes in telephone boxes. She disclosed to the police that the reason for her running away had been sexual abuse by her mother&#146;s partner. She was placed in a local care home by social services as a temporary measure while police dealt with the allegation. She provided credible evidence of continuing sexual abuse, which had begun when she was 11 years old. Because she was aware of the strength of her mother&#146;s feelings for her partner, she never told her mother. Her mother&#146;s partner denied the allegations, and her mother refused to accept her daughter&#146;s word or to support her. It was decided that she should be placed with a foster carer. Unfortunately, that was in another county. She next came to notice in October 2005, by which time she had been placed with a different foster carer in yet another county. She had run away from foster care, and was found in London. It transpired that she had been engaged in prostitution while she was missing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para0"><a name="06071366001914">Another child, 11 years old, is on the child protection register as a result of violence in the family home. His father is an alcoholic, and his mother has a drug problem. The parents are together intermittently, and the child has been caught in the middle of a volatile and violent situation for a number of years. He was placed in foster care. He is described as shy and introverted. He remained at school, but his foster carer lived outside the borough, so he had to make the long journey to school in a taxi every day. He is frightened of the dark.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para1"><a name="06071366001915">The child ran away from foster care, taking all his belongings. He was found the next day back with his parents, but because of the situation to which he had returned, he was taken into police protection and was debriefed by the police. He explained that he was frightened all the time, especially when coming home from school, and that he had been bullied at the foster carer&#146;s house. Apparently two older teenage boys were also in care at the address. They had been bullying him. He had been locking himself in his room each night, and going to school in the morning without any human contact as such. He was taken by social services back to the foster carer&#146;s house, but he promptly ran away again within an hour. He was found very quickly wandering nearby, and has now been placed in alternative care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para2"><a name="06071366001916">Those are far from isolated cases. Although some young people find that running away can provide a relief from pressure, a large minority find themselves lonely, hungry and frightened. Children on the run are at high risk of abuse, and face both immediate and long-term dangers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para3"><a name="06071366001917">Across the country, I have encountered some exceptional individuals and statutory and voluntary organisations. They are working incredibly hard to put things right. An example is the &#147;mountains into molehills&#148; project organised by Lancashire constabulary, who work with all the other key local stakeholders to establish effective advanced problem-solving measures. It is a beacon of best practice. The computerised missing persons case management system allows analysis of missing persons data, which make it possible for problem solving to intervene at an early stage. Lancashire found that of 6,200 missing persons investigations undertaken annually, more than 4,800 involved children under 18. Lancashire tracked children who had been missing more than twice and found 300 children who accounted for almost 3,200 of the missing persons investigations. The majority of those cases involved children in care. One had been the subject of 78 missing persons investigations in a single year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para4"><a name="06071366001918">Following Lancashire&#146;s example, Leicester constabulary has recently carried out work with its key local partners, which revealed that of the 4,241 reports to the police of missing persons, 6 per cent. were reports about the same 10 young people. All were in local authority care, all were reported missing more than 10 times, and one individual had been reported missing more than 53 times during the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para5"><a name="06071366001919">It is significant that in the Met police, Lancashire and Leicestershire, very senior police officers, and people at director level in other stakeholder organisations, are taking a lead role. Someone is taking  <br>

responsibility at the top of the organisations to get action. A common thread identifies a particularly vulnerable group of &#147;cross border&#148; children with serious social, domestic and behavioural difficulties. They are placed by the local authorities responsible for their care into private care homes in different areas of the country. For a minority of children who need to be placed away from home to protect them from particular circumstances, such placements are appropriate. All too often, however, children are placed inappropriately, without sufficient support and without liaison with local services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para6"><a name="06071366001920">For children running away from local authority care, the current system is failing to meet their most basic needs&#151;a safe place to stay and someone safe to talk to. Children&#146;s services, police, the voluntary sector and health services have vital roles to play in ensuring that runaways are known about, found and their problems appropriately addressed. Making sure that the agencies know how to work together effectively is a key dynamic of the &#147;Every Child Matters: Change for Children&#148; reforms. The need for co-ordinated action was also a central feature of the recommendations made by the social exclusion unit in 2002, and the accompanying guidance issued by the Department of Health. But the co-ordinated action, backed up by effective information collection and sharing, clear strategies and leadership, is not happening everywhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para7"><a name="06071366001921">In October 2003, The Children&#146;s Society conducted a survey to see how local authorities were getting on with protocols and services for runaways. Some 91 of 150 local authorities replied, of which just under half had developed protocols for runaways. Only seven authorities could say that they had implemented all three of the recommendations. In 2005, a new survey showed that 89 local authorities have all recommendations in place, and a further 25 have committed to fulfilling the recommendations. That is too slow and piecemeal, and is letting vulnerable children down. Children are still running away from danger into danger, which is why we must have national leadership and national accountability to ensure that things happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para8"><a name="06071366001922">National voluntary organisations such as The Children&#146;s Society, the National Missing Persons Helpline, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and Childline have been seeing the problems and taking action for years, providing places of refuge and someone to talk to. Local projects such as Talk Don&#146;t Walk in my constituency are having a real impact, but their funding is uncertain&#151;even though for some children they are the only place the child trusts enough to turn to for help, like the 12-year-old boy who came to a refuge run by a charity, alleging physical abuse and that his dad locked him up at home. The refuge contacted children&#146;s services, who returned the boy home with social work support. A month later, he turned up barefooted at the refuge with a fractured arm, saying that his Dad had hit him, taken his shoes away and locked him up. He escaped and could only think of the refuge as a safe place to go. He has since been accommodated and remains accommodated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para9"><a name="06071366001923">The National Missing Persons Helpline set up a runaways helpline two years ago that took 57,000 calls last year&#151;funded by the charity. It is an essential  <br>

 My hon. Friend supports my Bill, and knows that one of the things that we are calling for is a 24-hour helpline. That is essential, as children on the street need someone to talk to, whenever they feel the need to talk.</p>

At 3 o&#146;clock in the morning, she found herself with a group of older men, who threatened her. She was scared about repercussions and contacted the helpline.

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para11"><a name="06071366001931">For such children, the runaways helpline is a lifeline, and the voluntary organisation Refuge the only safe place to be. Non-statutory services are often the key to engaging young runaways, gaining their trust and helping them to resolve the difficulties that cause them to leave home or care in the first place. We have to make sure that such organisations are part of a national strategy and that they continue to provide their services. That is vital, because runaway children depend on those services absolutely.</p>

 I begin by congratulating the hon. Member for Warrington, South (Helen Southworth) on securing this debate. Straight away, I want to acknowledge her efforts and hard work on behalf of young runaways. She has worked with all the organisations that she mentioned, and I am delighted to be a co-sponsor of the Bill to which she referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para14"><a name="06071366001935">We are talking not about bad children, but about children running away from bad situations. When they do that, they find themselves in even worse difficulties, in circumstances where they risk suffering harm, abuse or exploitation. The hon. Lady was right to say that we must get our act together at both local and national levels. I had the privilege recently of going to Chicago with The Children&#146;s Society, to look at how the US deals with the problem. It was a fascinating visit and we published a report, through the society, setting out some of lessons that we as a team learned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para15"><a name="06071366001936">I first became interested in this issue while sitting in a church pew listening to a sermon. I was approached by my constituent Janet Little, who works locally for The Children&#146;s Society. She raised her concerns with me, and that led me to ask questions of my local authority and to submit a number of parliamentary questions on the subject. I am pleased to say that more than 400 hon. Members of all parties have signed early-day motion 393 supporting The Children&#146;s Society campaign to secure safety for young runaways and to provide a national network of facilities for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para16"><a name="06071366001937">When I was in Chicago, I was struck most by the fact that people there have been working on the problem for 30 or 40 years. Through federal funding, they have managed to establish a network of shelters that provide a basic minimum&#151;a first safe harbour&#151;for young people. Ultimately, those shelters create a pathway that will lead those young people back home. We need a similar national network in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para17"><a name="06071366001938">In Chicago, one shelter had more beds for young runaways than the total number of such beds currently available in this country. The scale of the problem here is different, but the need is still great. That is why I very much support what the hon. Lady has said today and I agree with the examples that she has given. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond positively to the debate and, if she has not already done so, I trust that she will look at the report published by The Children&#146;s Society about the trip to Chicago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para18"><a name="06071366001939">In conclusion, we need a clear legal framework with long-term political backing, as there is in the United States&#151;which has stable and long-term core funding with a secure service infrastructure and a co-ordinated approach locally and nationally. That is what we need in the UK to create safe pathways home for those who run away.</p>

me and my ministerial colleagues and departmental officials. I know that Members on both sides of the House share our deep concern for the well-being of all young people at risk, including runaways. I also pay tribute to all the local and voluntary organisations who work with vulnerable children and to national bodies such as The Children&#146;s Society, whose vigorous campaigning helps to keep these important issues high on the public agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para19"><a name="06071366001941">In these debates, it is always frustrating to have only a relatively short time to do justice both to the issues that have been raised and the importance of the subject, but I shall do my best. First, I recognise that all vulnerable young people need specialist help when they need it&#151;whether in respect of teenage pregnancy, drugs, alcohol, care or home life, or when they are running away or go missing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para20"><a name="06071366001942">Thankfully, running away from home is not an issue for most children; they are well looked after, grow up in decent homes and receive good care from their parents or carers, but for some children life reaches a crisis point. For a small but significant number, running away seems at the time to be the answer to their problems. They do not do so lightly; it is usually a last resort and it is a cry for help of some sort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para21"><a name="06071366001943">It is important to bear in mind that running away is not an end in itself; it is not a problem in its own right, but an indicator that other serious things are going wrong in the young person&#146;s life, as the cases described by my hon. Friend graphically illustrated. It is a symptom rather than a problem in its own right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para22"><a name="06071366001944">Our information about young people who run away comes mainly from a social exclusion unit report and The Children&#146;s Society research, which tells us much about who runs away, where they go and why. The Children&#146;s Society estimates that about 100,000 young people run away every year; the SEU estimate is a little less, but the issue is not about numbers. Some marked differences emerged between runaways from birth-parent families and step-families and between boys and girls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para23"><a name="06071366001945">My hon. Friend described some harrowing cases and a minority of runaways are certainly seriously at risk, but there are big differences between the young people who run away. The majority return overnight, 80 per cent. return with 48 hours and almost all return home within a week. Most of those who run away are not sleeping rough and without a place to go; the vast majority&#151;about 86 per cent.&#151;go to family or friends. That may not be an ideal solution, but at least they get on with their lives. However, as my hon. Friend illustrated, some do not and, what is worse, their problems may be magnified by other risks to their well-being: drugs, prostitution, exploitation of terrible kinds and, sometimes, life-threatening situations. Their main problem is not that they are running away; they are running away because they have other serious problems. I am determined that, in tackling those problems, we generate practical solutions for young people that address those multiple root causes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para24"><a name="06071366001946">Two fundamental questions arise from the reports that I mentioned: first, how do we best prevent young people from running away in the first place, and secondly, how can we best ensure their safety and safe  <br>

return and address the underlying problems? It is true that runaway young people need someone to talk to and somewhere to go, but crucially they also need help with the underlying problems that cause them to run away in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="60713-0021.htm_para25"><a name="06071366001947">My hon. Friend called for a national strategy, and I think that she meant a national strategy for runaways. In fact, I would say to her that we do have a national strategy&#151;it is called &#147;Every Child Matters&#148;. Since the social exclusion report, it is the &#147;Every Child Matters&#148; programme that is driving improvements, and the better and more comprehensive response from agencies for all young people, but particularly for those most vulnerable young people, including runaways. All the measures within that programme, including improved information sharing, a common assessment framework to assess young people&#146;s needs, and identifying a lead professional who can coordinate that support, are equally relevant to the needs&#151;often multiple needs&#151;of young people who run away, and together they provide the sort of help that young runaways need in meeting some of those problems. I firmly believe that it is through the universal strands of &#147;Every Child Matters&#148;, not a separate strategy for runaways, that we shall best meet the needs of these young people.</p>

 I entirely agree with the point about the universal strands being the best way to deliver these services. The key question is, how do we ensure that commissioners can look beyond their own boundaries to commission services for their residents who have run away and are miles away, in another part of the country?</p>

 I agree that although &#147;Every Child Matters&#148; is the relevant framework, there is more to be done in ensuring that all local authorities and all local organisations, including those working in the voluntary sector, have the issue of runaway young people on their radar screens as an issue that must be addressed in the context of their wider &#147;Every Child Matters&#148; work. At a recent meeting with my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South, we discussed with her and with The Children&#146;s Society the possibilities for furthering the work that we have been doing by updating existing guidance about best practice for local authorities, and discussing how else we can help local authorities to articulate, understand and address the needs of runaways, to spread best practice, and to ensure that the elements in their existing architecture, such as the children and young persons plan, include measures that they need to take locally to address the needs of runaway young people, whether it is their own young people running away or young people who have run away into their area from elsewhere.</p>

Friend mentioned related to lookedafter children, the vast majority of whom&#151;about 64 per cent.&#151;go into care because of abuse or neglect at home. It is really important that they receive high quality services, are kept safe and helped to reach their potential. I know and accept that children who are looked after by the local authority cause considerable concern, not only because some go missing, but because across the board their general outcomes are falling behind those  <br>

of other children and young people. That is unacceptable. If children go into state care because their home care is inadequate, they should not emerge from that state care in a worse situation than they were in before. Their wellbeing should have been improved.</p>
<a name="06071366001957">
<p>For that reason the Government, across a number of Departments, are working very hard to identify the barriers to helping lookedafter children progress. We are working hard to ensure that young people who come into care, because of a multiplicity of really serious problems and often serious abuse and neglect, are actually helped, and not allowed to experience a lack of controlled care and a lack of careful dealing with their problems in the multiagency approach that we want.</p>

protocols with the police and measures to monitor missing-from-care incidents. In fact, I think that compliance is rather greater than my hon. Friend was able to inform us. None the less, these measures are not enough. That is why we are publishing a Green Paper later this year, hopefully in September, in which we want to make sure that we can introduce measures with local authorities that really stop looked-after children from drifting. We want to make sure that the kind of cases that we heard about today do not happen. In the context of the national strategy of &#147;Every Child Matters&#148;, it is, at the local level&#151;</p>
