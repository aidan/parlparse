 Of course the loss of any civilian life is to be regretted. That said, I heard from the servicemen and women of the United Kingdom whom I met the extent to which we rely on effective co-operation with our allies in the United States. Let me place on record my gratitude for the continuing efforts of all 38 countries, who are clear that they stand together in solidarity and in support of the democratically elected Government of Afghanistan. The people who have the greatest number of questions to answer are those insurgents who seek to frustrate the democratic will of the people of Afghanistan and who still seek to burn schools, behead teachers and drive women back into a previous era, when they were not allowed to enjoy the opportunities that are available to them in Afghanistan today.</p>

 I can assure the hon. Gentleman that significant resources are going into Helmand. It was to examine that that I took the opportunity to visit Helmand, not simply seeing Camp Bastion, the main United Kingdom base, but moving out to forward operating base Delhi and seeing for myself the work being done there. When one goes to communities such as Garmsir and sees smallholders who are now able to open shops, or visits a clinic where midwives are being trained or a school that there are plans to develop in the months ahead, one sees the practical difference that is being made. However, that is contingent on the security environment. That is why the service and the sacrifice of our men and women are so important.</p>

 During a recent visit to Afghanistan, my hon.

Does the Secretary of State agree that although building capacity is important in Afghanistan, it is equally important that we have greater flexibility in delivering aid and support to provincial ministries, rather than to national ministries?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises an important question. When we look at the progress that Governor Mangal has made in Helmand just in the past few months, it is reasonable that we should look at what support can be offered to the governor&#146;s office and to those provincial authorities working in Helmand. That said, although the challenge of counter-narcotics is complex, at its heart is a simple equation. Where one has the rule of law and security, it is easier to enforce an opium-free environment than where that security is  <br>

lacking. That is why, regrettably, there was a rise in opium production in Helmand previously, given the insurgency and the security situation. However, on the basis of the visit that I paid the week before last, I can say that there is a quiet optimism that we will see progress not simply on the number of poppy-free provinces but, potentially, in Helmand. We will have to wait for the official figures, and there is a long way to go&#151;it took neighbouring countries years to rid themselves of opium production&#151;but I assure the hon. Gentleman that work is under way to ensure that we make progress there, too.</p>

 May I associate myself and my hon. Friends with the tribute paid to our armed forces in Afghanistan and to the many brave officials in the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s Department, in other Government bodies and in British non-governmental organisations who put themselves at great risk for long periods? Recent reports from the World Bank and the agency co-ordinating body for Afghan relief have been highly critical both of the failure to deliver on previous pledges of assistance and of the nature of the assistance provided. Following the recent donor conference, what new mechanisms are now in place to ensure that the money gets there and, when it gets there, that it is used effectively?</p>

 The foundation on which the discussion took place in Paris was the Afghan national development strategy, which provides a framework within which aid can be disbursed. That is why the conversations that I held with Kai Eide were so important. They were an opportunity to impress on him the urgency and importance that the Government attach to more effective international co-ordination. I have of course seen the reports to which the hon. Gentleman refers. It is therefore worth reminding the House that 80 per cent. of our development support to Afghanistan is provided through the Government of Afghanistan. One of the principal criticisms was that a significant proportion of aid from other countries was being spent outside the country and outside Government of Afghanistan mechanisms. Approximately 90 per cent. of UK Government aid is being spent in-country, so we start from a strong place in both conversations with our other international partners&#151;for example, the conversations that I have been having with Henrietta Fore, the head of the United States Agency for International Development&#151;and conversations with Kai Eide, whose job, on behalf of the Secretary-General, is to try to achieve better co-ordination.</p>

Of course it is to be regretted that there were those who chose not to support the Security Council resolution, although we were encouraged by the terms of the G8 communiqu&#233;, which did make some progress. The opportunity now is twofold. First, we want to see further action through the Mbeki process that is being taken forward on behalf of the Southern African Development Community. Secondly, there will be a further opportunity in the days to come at the General Affairs and External Relations Council of the European Union, where we will press for further European sanctions. I can assure the House that we will continue to be unstinting in our efforts to support the initiatives being taken within Africa&#151;not only in SADC but in the African Union as well&#151;and that we will not miss any further opportunities, not least at the upcoming General Affairs and External Relations Council, to press the case and to say that we want to see real progress so that the voice of the Zimbabwean people can be reflected in their Government.</p>

however, even countries with rising populations can grow enough to feed their own populations if they put in place the fundamentals, including good governance, effective macro-economic stability, improved agricultural productivity and effective trade.

Real progress is being made with 41 million more children in school, 3 million more children surviving every year and more than 2 million people receiving AIDS treatment as a consequence of the action taken by G8 countries. I fully recognise that more work needs to be done, which is why I applaud the global leadership taken by our Prime Minister in urging all G8 countries to recognise their responsibilities and to put poverty so high up on the agenda in Japan.</p>

The decision by the Government of Zimbabwe to ban the work of many humanitarian agencies has added to people&#146;s suffering.</p>

 I have had a number of harrowing discussions with Zimbabweans about the situation, so I have heard descriptions of innumerable atrocities, which are perhaps being underestimated, involving people having their limbs lopped off and being thrown alive into a fire. It is reminiscent of the discussions I had with people who survived the atrocities in Rwanda. Following the so-called election, we hope that the violence will decrease, but it is possible, with Mugabe&#146;s back against the wall, that it will increase. What contingency plans does the Department have if the violence and humanitarian situation worsen?</p>

 It is indeed a very grave situation. What we all want to see is a reforming Government based on the results of the March election, in which the people said what they wanted. Within that, we look to the stabilising of the economy, the upholding of the rule of law and the restoration of human rights. It is worth saying that, despite the ban on non-governmental organisations, we have still managed to help more than 9,000 victims of violence and displacement, many of whom were teachers and election observers. Despite that compromise, we have continued our work. On the issue of contingency, we are making every effort to get the ban on NGO activity lifted, while at the same time pursuing contingency plans to support the people of Zimbabwe in ways that we all want.</p>

 Our job is to get help to the poorest people in Zimbabwe to see them through this extremely difficult time.

That will include full humanitarian access, the rule of law, human rights and democracy. The principles for re-engagement will be agreed by donors, and we estimate that, when it comes to it, there will be about &#163;1 billion a year for five years.

Friend has to face up to one fundamental fact that is true: demand for oil, both now and in the medium term, exceeds supply. It is a reasonable expectation that more oil will be wanted in the years to come, and that is the main factor driving the price up. What we have got to do about this, as he would agree, is lower our dependence on oil. That is why we have made the big decision on nuclear power, opposed by the Opposition. That is why we also believe in renewables, including wind power, often opposed by the Opposition. That is why we want to make cars more efficient, and that is why we have incentives for fuel-efficient cars, opposed by the Opposition.

people who are engaged in planning the dispute to cease this action. I think that it is very important that employers and employees get together to find a solution to these disputes. I must tell the hon. Gentleman that 1.5 million workers in the public sector have already signed, or are subject to, three-year pay agreements, including nurses, teachers, and those who work in the Department for Work and Pensions and in the Inland Revenue. Never before have we had three-year agreements during difficult times such as these, and I believe that there should be support for other groups of workers in the public sector signing up to long-term pay agreements.</p>

 I have looked at the work of the family intervention projects that my hon. Friend is talking about. I have been to see at first hand how families have been brought round, as children who were engaged in vandalism and antisocial behaviour live decent and normal lives as a result of changing their ways. The whole point of the family intervention projects is that families sign a contract to say that they will change their ways in return for 24-hour help in doing better. That is the proper way forward in order to deal with the worst problems of antisocial behaviour. I would have thought that there would be massive support in the country for extending that project to the 20,000 families who will be helped as a result. In the end, if we are to tackle crime we need tougher punishments, better enforcement and action on prevention. Action on prevention will be stepped up over the next few years so that every child is given opportunity but expected to behave properly in our communities.</p>

<a name="80716-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08071688001221"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to impose a duty on public bodies to co-operate with the police and specified local authorities on the use of closed circuit television; to require certain users of CCTV to provide specified information to the police; to require insurance providers to promote the use of CCTV systems; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="80716-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08071688000145">There has been much debate recently about the level of surveillance in our society. The debate is worth having, although much of the dialogue has been conducted in a fit of hysteria that bears no relation to the reality of our everyday lives. Widespread use of photography and film is here to stay&#151;the relevant question is how we regulate its use to provide legitimate protection of the public and property while at the same time ensuring that our citizens&#146; rights and freedoms are properly protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="80716-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08071688000146">Time and again, constituents request closed circuit television coverage in areas where vandalism, thefts, drug dealing or violence have repeatedly occurred. It is not an alternative to proper policing or crime prevention strategies, but decent quality CCTV evidence can certainly make a material difference in bringing forward a prosecution. It often records the type of crime that can be difficult to prove by other means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80716-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08071688000147">Just a few weeks ago in Glasgow, we experienced within one week the tragedy of the murders of two innocent women. The first, Moira Jones, was murdered when arriving back at her home in the south side of the city and the second, Eleni Pachou, was murdered at her place of work in my own constituency. In the same week, there were also reports of five women who were subjected to sexual attacks in broad daylight, all within the space of less than two hours, in the centre and west of the city. Such events are thankfully unusual, but their occurrence over such a relatively short time understandably caused a great deal of fear and alarm. To the credit of Strathclyde police, suspects in all three cases have now been apprehended and it is clear that CCTV evidence played a critical part in the investigations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80716-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08071688000148">The use of such evidence is now a routine part of police inquiries and it is much more common as a means of pursuing a prosecution in the UK than the use of DNA material. Perhaps not surprisingly it results in far more guilty verdicts, leading to a consequent reduction in police time and expense tied up in trials. In the case of random attacks, it can also help to prompt evidence from witnesses who may not have been aware that they were in the vicinity of a crime at the time of the offence, or that their evidence could be material. Importantly, it can also eliminate innocent people as suspects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80716-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08071688000149">However, when police gather CCTV evidence, they have to collect it from a wide variety of sources that currently do not have to follow any compulsory code or minimum requirements. It is estimated that there are around 400 town, public or municipal and city-centre systems in the UK, and perhaps up to 1.5 million privately owned and operated public-space CCTV cameras.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80716-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08071688000150">It is important to distinguish between the two groups. The public systems have a primary purpose to provide  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="16 July 2008">

public safety and, accordingly, they need to include the ability to provide evidential recording for police incidents. In Greater Glasgow, we have the GCASS system, which oversees the use of CCTV coverage in places where the public have unrestricted access and also co-ordinates action by the police, local authorities and the major social landlords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80716-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08071688000151">However, even with that level of organisation, Strathclyde police find it difficult at times to persuade all the local authorities in its force area to contribute to the revenue costs, which run at approximately &#163;3,000 to &#163;4,000 a year for each fixed camera. The force also has to interface with 16 separate public systems that use different equipment and processes. This leads to both police and prosecutor&#146;s staff being tied up in time-consuming evidence gathering and having to spend long periods of time in preparing evidence in a format acceptable to the courts. Regrettably, it is still a requirement in many Scottish courts that such evidence be shown in analogue rather than digital format, despite the fact that the latter is much less costly and is speedier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80716-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08071688000152">On the other hand, cameras on private property that allow for a public presence, such as shops and bars, are much more likely to be primarily a property protection scheme. However, given the scale of private coverage compared with public systems, it is evidence from private cameras that, on the whole, will provide the majority of film evidence in a crime incident. During last year&#146;s terrorist attack on Glasgow airport, for example, I understand that more than 70 per cent. of the film and photo evidence came from such private sources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80716-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08071688000153">When a serious incident occurs, police have to contact all public and private owners in the vicinity, first to check whether they hold such equipment and secondly to ascertain whether film has been kept that is of a quality capable of being of use. The major problems that police face when collecting such evidence is the poor quality of the images and the fact that redundant technology is used because of a failure to invest in appropriate equipment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80716-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08071688000154">Speed is also vital, as some owners routinely destroy film within a couple of days, and others within a few weeks. However, the police do not necessarily know that, and there is no requirement on equipment owners to provide details. In addition, owners of smaller, more basic systems may be unfamiliar with the mechanisms required to download the data. It has not been unknown for it to take several weeks to be able to obtain some film evidence. It is also not uncommon for cameras not to be working at all or to be wrongly positioned so that no relevant evidence can be obtained. All of these problems can have a direct effect on the ability of police to arrest the perpetrator of a crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80716-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08071688000155">If we believe that all of us, as citizens, should take some level of responsibility in relation to the crime on our streets, then I do not consider that it is unreasonable to expect those who operate CCTV systems to have a duty of care to the general public by following best practice and keeping equipment in good working order. Public trust could dissolve easily if there were increasing evidence of misuse, and that is why we need to guard against poor handling of data by persons with little or no training. We also need to guard against the degrading of data to keep costs low by reducing quality for convenience and cheapness of storage, and the use of worn out and redundant equipment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80716-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08071688000156">However, I also accept that, given the scale of their use and the fact that many of these cameras are operated by small business, sometimes as a requirement of their insurers, it is important to avoid undue bureaucracy and administrative expense. The Bill accordingly proposes a proportionate response that builds on the recommendations of the Home Office report issued last year for a national CCTV strategy, and the voluntary code promoted by the CCTV user group that acts as an industry body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80716-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08071688000157">First, the Bill would place a statutory duty on public bodies such as local authorities, transport groups and housing associations to work together with their local police force to achieve a streamlining of public systems. That would give greater efficiency and reduce administrative costs. One example of how such an obligation could be of use at a fairly minimal cost is for all CCTV used only for traffic monitoring purposes to be given basic digital recording equipment suitable for police use, and an image-retention facility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80716-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08071688000158">The Bill would also place an obligation on authorities to contribute to the costs of co-ordinating such systems where, as in Glasgow, the system is maintained by a large metropolitan authority that covers a number of smaller council areas. Secondly, the Bill would require private organisations that control large areas that are open to the public, such as cinemas, hotels, shopping centres or large bars and clubs, to provide the local police force with up-to-date information on the type of CCTV system that they use, on how long they preserve film for, and on how the system is maintained. Given that many such premises are already licensed by local  <br>

authorities in some way, I would argue that the additional obligation should not be unduly onerous. It would allow the police to map town and city centre locations where there is the highest footfall, and to provide information to private users on the best way to maintain and operate their systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80716-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08071688000159">Finally, the Bill would require insurance companies to promote an agreed code of practice with their business customers. That could include requirements relating to: the type and scale of equipment that should be used, and appropriate to the site size; use and location; the training that should be provided to staff; and the adoption of regular maintenance contracts. That would have the benefit of securing an improvement in the overall base quality of the use of CCTV in this country and of providing a platform for minimum standards that can easily be reviewed and altered.</p>

 May I associate myself with the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)?

There is therefore a direct and much under-discussed benefit to the taxpayer in our choosing to buy rather than going into a hotel.</p>

 To correct my right hon. Friend, I did not say that it was not necessary to have a second home, or, as she further implied, to furnish it at the expense of the taxpayer. <i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> .</i><i> ]</i> It is amazing that Labour Members do not seem to have heard of the concept of renting furnished flats, but I will not go into that. My right hon. Friend drew a distinction between the capital element and the interest element of a mortgage. The capital element relates to the fact that the house or flat remains in the ownership of the individual Member of Parliament. The point about furniture and household goods is that they remain in the ownership of the individual Member, who is able to take them on to a further property as opposed to simply possessing them as a Member of this House.</p>

 The right hon.

 The figures that will be published today are based on the right-to-know form that was published earlier this year. I have a certain sympathy with the intention of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, but there are some practical issues involved in implementing it. <i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> .</i><i> ]</i> He says that there are not. He will be aware, however, that there are rules for claiming for a home under the ACA. HMRC has different rules, and there is a choice on whether a house is claimed as the main house for capital gains tax purposes. The House authorities will need to consider those issues in interpreting the amendment in terms of the rules that will be put into the green book. The House took a decision, and I have every confidence that it will be implemented.</p>

 The right hon. Lady&#146;s comments are worth clarifying. Does she understand that new Members entering the House, particularly Labour Members with no inherited wealth whatsoever, may be put off buying a flat because they have no money to buy furniture for it, including basic things such as a bed, and may as a result be shoved into renting a furnished flat or a hotel room that will cost the taxpayer a great deal more money in the long term?</p>

 I take considerable umbrage at the suggestion that everybody on my side came into the House with inherited wealth. There are Conservative Members who would also find it difficult to cope with the arrangements that we are putting in place. It will be difficult for some Members, but it is possible. Hon.

 I said that I would make progress and discuss the John Lewis list, because the hon. Gentleman has a specific question about it. Let me explain the reference in the motion. There has been public dismay about the concept of being able to buy a TV on the taxpayer&#151;that is one of the issues that has most concerned people and about which they have been particularly vocal. I accept that most Members did not know of the John Lewis list before it was revealed in the court case, but it has become symbolic. Several hon. Members have made comments about initial requirements, but it is not just about that. The John Lewis list&#151;that is, the ability to claim through the ACA money for furniture and household goods&#151; continues throughout the time that a Member of Parliament is in this House, so it is not just a question of buying basic requirements from the allowance that is available. I believe that we should, as the MEC report suggested, remove the ability to buy furniture and household goods through the ACA. That is a different position from that taken in the Government&#146;s amendment.</p>

 I became a Member of Parliament in 1992 and I was taken to the Fees Office, where I was instructed that I could spend money anyway I wanted on the additional costs allowance by a Mr. Maskell, who I think was in charge of the Fees Office then. I have never had any guidance since, other than the contents of the green book, which gives no indication of a John Lewis list. I sit on the Administration Committee and such a list has never been debated there. Where did the John Lewis list come from? I can give the right hon.

advice about how to interpret the allowances. Over the years, the House, through the Members Estimate Committee and officers in the Department of Resources, has been tightening up those rules to try to clarify them and to ensure that Members know more about exactly what they can claim. Some Members&#146; past claims will be based on a previous regime, and were entirely appropriate under it, but they would not be acceptable today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="80716-0006.htm_para0"><a name="08071688000254">To answer the question about the John Lewis list, I believe that officers in the Department of Resources, formerly the Department of Finance and Administration, introduced it with a view to ensuring that, when staff considered claims by Members of Parliament, they had a checklist against which they could decide whether the claim was reasonable and whether Members were trying to get more out of the taxpayer than they needed. For example, they would see that Members were buying a fridge for x amount and would try to ascertain whether they could buy a cheaper fridge that was equally functional. The purpose of the John Lewis list was to help staff determine whether claims were appropriate. Whatever the intention at the time, the term has come to cause concern. However, the ability to claim the items, rather than the term and the existence of a list, worries the public.</p>

 I thank the right hon. Lady for giving way again. Her stance does not relate to the fact that hon. Members also have access to an incidental costs allowance for offices. If the Opposition were serious about the matter, they would have included in the motion the same barriers to the incidental costs allowance as to the additional costs allowance. One could buy a mahogany desk&#151;or anything&#151;to furnish an office. Surely it is wrong to be able to do that when one does not have the right to buy the furniture that is required for a flat.</p>

Those will be published in the way we are publishing the expenses and allowances claims for Members of Parliament.

According to my reading of the amendment, we would effectively replace the John Lewis list with the IKEA list. The Leader of the House&#146;s statement does not take us much further because she offers us Government consultation on capping the extent of claims to 10 per cent. of the additional costs allowance&#151;nearly &#163;2,500 every year.</p>

and its remit is purely advisory. Perhaps when the Leader of the House responds, she could say whether she intends to change the remit if she is asking the panel to rewrite the green book rather than simply advise the Members Estimate Committee about it.</p>

I believe that the first part, which tackles what the NAO should do in considering the rules that the House operates, is contrary to the NAO&#146;s legal powers under the National Audit Act 1983, which states that the provisions</p>
<a name="80716-0006.htm_brev1"><a name="08071688001226"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;shall not be construed as entitling the Comptroller and Auditor General to question the merits of the policy objectives of any department, authority or body in respect of which an examination is carried out.&#148;</p>

It already audits on a random basis all the allowances that Members claim and the controls and processes that the Department of Resources uses. That part of the amendment is therefore superfluous.

The requirement on Labour MEPs is to submit themselves to an audit. The results are not published and I do not believe that anyone even has to publish details of who does the audit for Labour MEPs. We are bringing our MEPs&#146; expenses into the open in the same way as MPs&#146; expenses are being brought into the open.

 No, I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. Before the communications allowance was introduced, I used to do an annual report for my constituents, setting out what I had done in the previous 12 months and inviting them to comment on the priorities that I had set for the next 12 months. I probably used the incidental expenses provision outside the rules, but I thought that it was very important to communicate with my constituents. It was to deal with such matters that the communications allowance was introduced. I do not think that it is disreputable for hon. Members from any part of the House to tell their constituents what they are doing. When the public know what MPs are doing, they are more supportive and can get involved.</p>

The Advisory Panel on Members&#146; Allowances will keep the green book under review and advise on any further modifications to the rules that may be required, including in relation to reasonable costs of a second residence. I will consult on including capping furniture costs at 10 per cent. of the additional costs allowance.

Furthermore, the NAO financial audit will be extended to include an NAO audit of the rules and guidance on what is and is not acceptable under the rules, an NAO audit of the management controls and processes used by the Department of Resources to ensure compliance with the rules, and NAO checks and testing of the controls, to ensure that they are adequate and effective.

This includes, among other provisions, an independent financial audit for each MEP&#146;s total expenditure every year, which is then published on their website. For eight years, the UK&#146;s Labour MEPs pressed for other UK parties to follow this example. Until eight years later, when the Leader of the Opposition announced his so-called &#147;deep clean&#148;, nothing was heard from them.

We are not talking about staff earning &#163;30,000, &#163;40,000, &#163;50,000 or &#163;60,000 as part of a staff team; rather, it is a wage that other people with the same abilities working in the private sector would vastly exceed. I hope that we are clear about that and that it is not a matter of dispute. Our staff do a very important job for us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="80716-0007.htm_para12"><a name="08071688000334">We need to clarify what happened in the famous debate of 3 July. Some areas were not controversial and were agreed. There were 14 substantive recommendations from the Members Estimate Committee: they were unanimously proposed by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean), the hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Sir Stuart Bell), my hon. Friend the Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey), the Leader of the House, the shadow Leader of the House and Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="80716-0007.htm_para13"><a name="08071688000335">Of those 14 recommendations, those on constituency offices and communications, of which there were two, and on travel, of which there were two, went through without any dissent. Two substantive issues, emanating from the amendment proposed by the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), were disputed and were not agreed. First, three different recommendations put forward a clear proposal, which everyone here will understand:</p>
<a name="80716-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="08071688001229"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We recommend that, with immediate effect, Members should no longer be able to claim reimbursement for furniture and household goods or for capital improvements&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="80716-0007.htm_para14"><a name="08071688000336">Secondly, it was proposed that</p>
<a name="80716-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="08071688001230"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;new MPs elected to the next Parliament to represent constituencies in outer London should be eligible to claim half of any overnight expenses allowance; and all MPs representing those seats should be restricted to claim half the standard rate&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="80716-0007.htm_para15"><a name="08071688000337">That was to deal with the perceived abuse surrounding colleagues in outer London who were claiming in respect of two homes, irrespective of the fact that they lived just over the line between inner and outer London and were actually able to get home relatively quickly. They received the full allowance on the same basis as a colleague living in Orkney, Shetland, Cornwall, west Wales or the like.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80716-0007.htm_para16"><a name="08071688000338">The third proposal that was not accepted was that</p>
<a name="80716-0007.htm_brev2"><a name="08071688001231"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Additional Costs Allowance be adapted into an overnight expenses allowance, comprising a &#163;19,600 maximum budget for accommodation (excluding furniture, household goods and capital improvements) but operating on the basis of itemised reimbursement and a flat rate of &#163;30 for daily subsistence.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="80716-0007.htm_para17"><a name="08071688000339">That was the proposal and it meant that MPs could have furnished accommodation, stay in a hotel or have the money for the purchase of accommodation as well as a daily rate for subsistence, but that the allowance did not include furnishing.</p>

 Is not all this in the nature of a differential allowance? In such a scheme, there is a always border and a line, and anyone with any experience knows about London weighting allowances.

 No, it is not a rather silly argument and it is not my argument. It is an argument supported by the top salaries review people, by Sir John Baker in his report and by the Members Estimate Committee.

 I think that the hon.

Secondly, on the audit of offices and other aspects, the proposal was not for a financial audit but for &#163;1,500 a day to be paid to consultants for snooping around offices.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who is being generous in giving way. Does he accept the point that I and perhaps others made on the day of that debate? I was concerned about the cost of the assurance, which I think we had difficulty justifying, but will he support me in killing off the myth that the external audit proposed by the Members Estimate Committee was to be made public? It was never to be made public. That was the recommendation. We have this myth growing up that, somehow, what we have done is secretive and that what we could have done would have been transparent.

 On that point, I absolutely agree with the right hon. Gentleman. I am trying to ensure that where there is consensus, we have it. The difference was that it was an audit of everything. I share concerns that we should not have a hugely expensive process with millions of quid going to the private sector, but that would not have been the implication had we voted for the motion tabled by the Members Estimate Committee.</p>

 No, not for a second. Of the Conservatives, 54 MPs voted for the open and transparent system and 21 voted against.

There were 201 Labour Members here and voting. Of those, 52 were in favour of full transparency and 149 against.

 The hon. Lady will have to explain to her electorate her vote on that day, as we all have to do. All I can say is that the external pressure, which arose for reasons that we all know, for us to have the most robust, the most open and the most transparent system has been greater than ever. As a result of consensus recommendations made to us by senior colleagues and endorsed by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, we were given an opportunity to do something about that and we bottled it. That is why the Leader of the House has this morning, out of the blue, produced proposals in a written statement to try to rescue the Labour party from the predicament that its own Back Benchers got it into.

 No, no.

There was no notice of it coming. I honestly believe that the general interpretation is that it is a response to the fact that we are having the debate today.

I had discussions with, for example, the Chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life and the Comptroller and Auditor General long before we realised that an Opposition day debate was tabled, and indeed discussed with them the value of a written ministerial statement. So I had already discussed the timetable of the written ministerial statement with them. I think the hon. Gentleman should withdraw what he said.

There would be an audit, which is what was proposed two weeks ago. So this must be an attempt to scramble back and put things together after what the right hon. and learned Lady voted for was not carried because her colleagues&#151;by a large majority of 3:1&#151;did not follow her into the Lobby on 3 July.

 I am grateful, Mr. Deputy Speaker. You made an intervention a few minutes ago about the value of the House of Commons. We need to keep in proportion the fact that this is a House of Commons debate, and that we are an important part of Parliament. I will return to that in my final remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="80716-0008.htm_para9"><a name="08071688000387">I will not follow the speech of the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) in relation to the European Parliament, which is not my remit. He made some other pertinent points, however, to which I shall refer during my speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="80716-0008.htm_para10"><a name="08071688000388">The hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack), who is still in his place and follows such debates as a great parliamentarian, has a great dislike of the communications allowance. It is remarkable how often that view is reflected on the Conservative Benches. In an age in which we get little from our media and have to deal with our constituents through the prism of the media, I would have thought that an allowance that enabled Members of Parliament to communicate with constituents in a non-partisan way about what we are doing would be welcomed throughout the House. The hon. Gentleman would certainly welcome the fact that the MEC report proposed to freeze the allowance at &#163;10,000 for three years from next April.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="80716-0008.htm_para11"><a name="08071688000389">I enjoyed the speech of the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May), as I did her speech on 3 July&#151;she made the speech that I would have made, so it saved me from making it. I agree with many of her points, certainly in relation to the role of the National Audit Office and the thorough work that it is doing now, which will continue. One of the ironies of today&#146;s debate, and the proposal to extend the role of the National Audit Office to do an audit of 25 per cent. of MPs throughout the whole Parliament, is that that was a recommendation of the MEC. I welcome the fact that the Leader of the House has now taken it on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80716-0008.htm_para12"><a name="08071688000390">The issue that has created the most mayhem among Labour Members is that of practice assurance, which was intended to assist MPs in their roles before they ever got near a National Audit Office full audit. According to our paper, the essence of the scheme was</p>
<a name="80716-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="08071688001233"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to help Members compile and record better evidence of their claims; to check on the uses to which parliamentary resources have been put rather than (as now) verifying only the initial expenditure&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="80716-0008.htm_para14"><a name="08071688000392">There was a system behind that recommendation which enabled Members to put their house in order if need be, without reference to the dreaded Standards and Privileges Committee.

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="80716-0008.htm_para15"><a name="08071688000393">As we go along, we will need to find out what was the purpose of those audits, to what purpose they will be put, and to whom they will refer. My right hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), who is no longer in his place but follows such debates, was perfectly right: the NAO is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act, audits are exempt from that, and there would be no question of reporting to FOI people that there was an audit and what the consequences were.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="80716-0008.htm_para16"><a name="08071688000394">I was not able to speak in the 3 July debate, which was truncated and covered two subjects: addresses and allowances. I do not propose to use my time today to go through all the arguments that took place then. The MEC had a clear view from the beginning&#151;which was 24 January, when the Government gave us the review, rather than February. First, it was to reassure the public, and secondly, to do so in a way that enabled MPs to carry on their jobs in a complex society, which imposes great demands, to which the Leader of the House has referred, in e-mails, the internet and a host of other ways. The question was how do we relate and give confidence to the public, and also allow MPs to continue with their work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="80716-0008.htm_para17"><a name="08071688000395">Many comments have been made about the media coverage. We live in a world in which to keep in touch with civil society, the political society must cross the media bridge. If we cannot do so, there will be a great deal of criticism in the popular press and in our constituencies. There was no greater outrage than in my constituency Labour party when the MEC report was turned down. That was not a happy day for the House. Fewer than half the Members of Parliament voted on the matter, and that would be our criticism&#151;not who voted which way, or which party voted for what, but that only half the MPs thought it appropriate to be here to vote on the question of their salaries and allowances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="80716-0008.htm_para18"><a name="08071688000396">When the MEC report was published, and the members of the MEC&#151;the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean) and the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)&#151;gave a press conference, it was well received by the media, and that converted into being well received by the public. We had begun to restore the reputation of the House. That fell catastrophically, as we knew it would, when the report was rejected, which brought some damaging and serious headlines, which I will not repeat now. However, it was clear&#151;the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey has touched on this&#151;that matters could not be left as they were on 3 July. A number of recommendations had been accepted, including that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann), and other recommendations were hanging in the air. It was not clear how we were to go forward, but the Members Estimate Committee always said that it would fully respect the will of the House.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend not think that it would have been better with hindsight to have produced a draft report and consulted Members on both sides of the House? They could have put forward some suggestions and amendments so that we might have had a degree of consensus about the way forward when the final report was produced.</p>

 I agree entirely with my hon. Friend, although I would point out to him that when the Government sent this issue down to the Members Estimate Committee on 24 January, we said that we would need until October to go through the report with the utmost care, to consult a whole host of bodies, such as the National Audit Office, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Inland Revenue and outside bodies, and then to get the support, if we could, of the 1922 committee&#151;the Conservatives&#146; Back-Bench committee&#151;the parliamentary Labour party committee and then the House. We failed to do that. It is clear that our report had public support through the media, but it did not have the support of the House. The reason for that&#151;I concur with my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) on this&#151;is that we did not have the time. If we had had more time, we could have looked at the issue more carefully, taken other matters on board and explained what we were trying to do, but we were not able to do that in the short time that we had. It would also have been preferable had the House been able to discuss allowances separately from pay, but the two came together on the same day, and things got very confusing and very confused. The result was not what it might have been, and the consequence is that we are here today debating the matter again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="80716-0009.htm_para0"><a name="08071688000399">Although this might be ironic, the fact is that it is a Conservative Opposition day motion that has brought the issue to the Floor of the House and which gives me the opportunity to make the speech that I could not make on 3 July. I am aware that the Leader of the House has had discussions with the Chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life and the Comptroller and Auditor General and that she has been very active since 3 July. I entirely accept what she has said about those discussions, but the fact is that the time scale for this second debate is longer, and we are therefore able to make some points and to take on board what the Government are now saying in their ministerial statement. I would surmise that we would still have had the ministerial statement had we not had today&#146;s debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="80716-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08071688000400">On the ministerial statement, I welcome the commitment of the Leader of the House to bring within the purview of the original decision by the House an extension of the powers of the National Audit Office to cover all the allowances in the green book, as the MEC proposed, rather than just the additional costs allowance, as well as travel, staffing costs, incidental expense provisions for other office costs and the communications allowance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="80716-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08071688000401">I welcome the fact that the green book will be rewritten&#151;another recommendation by the MEC&#151;and that that will be carried out by the Advisory Panel on Members&#146; Allowances. I wish the right hon. and hon. Members on the panel well. We met them and discussed our report with them as we went along, and I know that they are diligent and will seek to equate the interests of Members with those of the taxpayers who fund our Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="80716-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08071688000402">I welcome, too, the statement by the Leader of the House that the National Audit Office should report to the Members Estimate Committee, which already includes three external members. Incidentally, I also welcome the fact that the work of the Advisory Panel on Members&#146; Allowances will also be assisted by two independent members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="80716-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08071688000403">I also welcome the assurance from the Leader of the House that the Comptroller and Auditor General believes that there is an opportunity, given the additional evidence to be provided in support of all claims, significantly to strengthen the assurance that public money has been properly spent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="80716-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08071688000404">The House will decide on the motion and the amendment before it. I have enjoyed the comments of the hon. Member for South Staffordshire and the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg), but the House must bear it in mind&#151;this brings me to your original comments, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;that what was at the forefront of the MEC&#146;s thinking in its review was the reputation of this House, balanced with the interests of Members. We have heard many comments about the role of Members and their heavy work load. On our salary and allowances, I have consistently taken the view that it is a privilege to be a Member of Parliament, and that privilege must be guarded with a sense of responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="80716-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08071688000405">The Leader of the House and the right hon. Member for Maidenhead have referred to the fact that the reputation of the House has taken a battering over these past few months, but the House may soon have the power to declare war and it may take over the royal prerogative. It debates and decides on major issues, such as war and peace, human embryology, radical changes to society, justice and civil rights. It is still the fulcrum of the nation in times of crisis and of debate on national issues. I remember the debate on the Falklands war. I was not in the House at the time, but perhaps other hon. Members were. There was a debate in the House on the Saturday morning after the Falkland Islands had been taken over by the Argentines, and the question was what we should do. The entire nation listened to our debate on the radio&#151;we were not on television in those days&#151;which shows how important the House of Commons is in our affairs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="80716-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08071688000406">Restoring and enhancing the reputation of the House must be a matter for us all. If what we are doing today will add to the reputation of the House in a manner that is transparent and which gains public support, we may find ourselves on our way towards achieving that. I therefore support the Government&#146;s statement and their amendment. I wish the advisory panel, which is in the hands of my right hon. Friend the Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar), well. I also wish the National Audit Office, the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department of Resources, the Members Estimate Committee and the House of Commons Commission well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="80716-0009.htm_para8"><a name="08071688000407">There is a great deal of work to be done in the House between now and the general election to restore the reputation of this Chamber and this institution. If we fail to do that, Members of Parliament&#151;whoever we are and from whichever party we come&#151;will be castigated for failing to get a grip on the matters of perception that so involve our constituents. As the Leader of the House said, we do not live in an age of different regimes. The regimes have changed, and we must change. We must be responsive to public opinion. We have failed up to now. Let us hope that, from this day forth, we begin to re-establish the reputation of the House of Commons.</p>

It would have been more appropriate for us to have debated the issue on another occasion or, if we have to give up time on an Opposition day, we should have had a free vote. Now, as far as I am concerned, this is a free vote&#151;every vote in the House is a free vote as far as I am concerned&#151;so I shall behave accordingly.

 I will not give way because I want to be brief. I deplore the fact that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make party politics out of this. I have made it quite plain that most people here are entirely honourable, and that goes for my colleagues on this side of the House and for colleagues on the other side of the House.

employment of a secretary&#151;I welcome the fact that more young people, and people of all ages, can contemplate coming here knowing that the necessary second home that they must have in London can be honourably and properly provided for. Of course it is right that receipts should be produced. Of course it is right that people should not be prodigal in their expenditure. However, we are talking about expenditure that is within a global limit of &#163;23,000. No one wants the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) to sleep in an empty box; of course they do not. Of course he must have furniture in his home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80716-0009.htm_para13"><a name="08071688000417">I must say to my right hon. Friend the shadow Leader of the House that one inferred from her remarks&#151;I am sure that it was not her intention&#151;that it was not necessary for people to have homes that they could furnish and from which they could establish a base in London and do their job properly in this House. One of the worst developments over the years that I have been here has been that Members have spent too much time away from this House, which is one reason why I was so opposed to many of the changes to our hours. Thursday is now a non-day here. In the old days, it was the busiest day of the parliamentary week. I often quote Duncan Sandys. He had a London constituency but said, &#147;I am the Member for Streatham at Westminster and not the Member for Westminster in Streatham.&#148; If one is going to be a proper Member of Parliament, looking after one&#146;s constituents and constituency when the House is not sitting, but being here to represent them when it is, one does indeed need to have a London base. It is right that there should be proper provision for it.</p>

However, I hope above all that this is the last occasion&#151;it is the first in my experience&#151;when issues of this nature are debated on a party basis, rather than on a cross-party House basis with a free vote at the end. I intend to exercise my disapproval of not having a free vote in the party as a whole by not voting on the Opposition motion. I trust, however, that at the end of the day, the House will come to a collective decision that will enable us to go forward, holding our heads high and getting on with the job that we really should be doing.</p>

makes a good start to my speech, because I rise in defence of Members generally and especially those on the Opposition Back Benches who will have difficulty defending themselves in the face of this last-minute publicity stunt by their leader&#146;s office. It shows considerable disdain for them and is reminiscent of that line from a Tory grandee about Michael Heseltine when he was dismissively referred to as someone who bought his own furniture. Obviously, that disdain for those who buy their own furniture is still around in the upper echelons of the Conservative party, but not even in the Conservative party does everyone come from a family of stockbrokers and merchant bankers and, almost by definition, not all of them are able to marry into the Astor family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="80716-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08071688000422">The Opposition motion also seems to be a heavy smokescreen to obscure some of the internal divisions inside the Conservative party. We all know from the media that the Tory leadership is in trouble with its MEPs, not only on expenses, but also because of considerable policy differences. It may be that it is trying to create confusion, but it is our duty to clear that away and get a bit of clarity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="80716-0009.htm_para16"><a name="08071688000423">Contrary to the assertion by the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May), it is not the Tories who have brought transparency to the expenses of Tory MPs; it is <i> The Sun</i> and other newspapers. Frankly, the Tories should not be blaming the system for that; they should be blaming their own people. Perhaps they should take a leaf out of the book of the leader of their party who, only this week, I think, made a speech in which he said that we should not blame the system and society and that people should take responsibility for their own actions. Perhaps that doctrine should be applied on the Conservative side of the House at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="80716-0009.htm_para17"><a name="08071688000424">I also welcome the fact that the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have caught up with Labour MEPs on this issue. However, I query the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)&#151;I can now put the question that I wanted to ask him when he would not take my intervention&#151;on whether the Liberal Democrat proposals will be retrospective and also include Members of this House who were previously MEPs, and whether they will be publishing their expenses for that period.</p>

 I am not sure that the right hon. Gentleman is going to get a response to that question, so perhaps I can ask him one.

 I will certainly refer the hon. Gentleman to the Leader of the House, who has had discussions with the leader of the Labour MEPs. I am sure that my right hon. and learned Friend will be more than pleased to provide him with the information.</p>

We must ask why the Tories did not do the same. There is, of course, a possibility, which we have to consider, that this is not so much about expenses, but about politics&#151;in particular, given a list system, a desire to purge the Conservative MEPs of those who might be causing difficulties for the party&#151;</p>

 Thank you for that, Mr. Deputy Speaker. But if there are, as we know, attempts to say that those who do not fill in the expenses forms as required by the party leader on a retrospective basis might be removed from the list of prospective Members of the European Parliament standing in the next election, it is possible to query whether that is just to do with their expenses or whether it is an attempt to purge the list of MEPs who might be an obstacle to the Conservative leader&#146;s rather crazy idea of tying them up with a group of very dodgy fringe parties in Europe, which would reveal it as a rather nasty party indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="80716-0009.htm_para19"><a name="08071688000430">There is also a questionable motivation on MPs&#146; expenses. Again, nearly all the complaints about breaching the rules relate to Tory MPs. I stress that that does not apply to the vast majority of Tory Members, who rightly claim what they are entitled to and who are being unfairly tarnished by those who behave badly. I also note the way in which the issue has been stirred up by Conservative Front Benchers in&#151;I presume&#151;a vain attempt to curry favour with the BBC, an organisation that is remarkably reticent about its own salaries and expenses.

 I do not know about the John Lewis list, but the last time I made an expenses claim was when I had to replace my iron and bought a new one for &#163;15.99 from Harry Tuffins. If the media are really concerned about Members&#146; claims, perhaps they should look at the claims of those who have been Members for many years and are still claiming the maximum allowances. When I entered the House in 1992, the mortgage on the first and only flat that I bought was &#163;250 a month, or &#163;3,000 a year. What about Members who are able to pay huge mortgages, some of whom refinance their mortgages by letting out their original properties, buying more expensive ones and claiming the maximum allowances? They do not even have to worry about the John Lewis list.</p>

In view of that, I find it slightly surprising that Conservative Front Benchers should wish to table a motion to embarrass their colleagues further, including some of their Front-Bench colleagues. Why, for example, do they want to embarrass the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman), whose case is being considered by a Committee of the House?</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Is it not slightly odd, however, that&#151;as has already been said a number of times&#151;what is essentially a matter of House business should be raised in Opposition time and thus become a matter of party business, especially given the considerable number of issues raised, quite legitimately, by the Leader of the Opposition at Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="80716-0010.htm_para0"><a name="08071688000436">Is it not also slightly odd that the motion should have been tabled now, given that there are very good Conservative members of both the Members Estimate Committee&#151;including the right hon. Member for Maidenhead&#151;and the advisory panel? The Conservative leadership will know that the Members Estimate Committee is due to meet on Monday to consider a recommendation from the panel for a tightening of the audit&#151;involving the National Audit Committee&#151;and a rewriting of the green book. Is this a variation of the old Liberal Democrat trick of finding out which streets are to be repaired, issuing a focus leaflet demanding that repairs be made, and claiming the credit afterwards? By definition, both those bodies will have to present their findings to the House in the autumn. What was the rush for the motion?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="80716-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08071688000437">The final question that must be asked is &#147;Does this matter?&#148; It is true that the memory of a half-baked motion rather inadequately moved just before the recess will soon fade, although it will undoubtedly revive some doubts in the Opposition ranks about the judgment of the Leader of the Opposition. However, it does not do justice to Members who make reasonable claims arising from the nature of the job. Gone are the days when it was strongly demanded of a Sheffield Member that he visit his constituency at least once a year&#151;although the requirement was waived when he became a Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="80716-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08071688000438">Our constituents rightly want to see much more of us than they used to, and to hear from us as well. That is true not only in the United Kingdom but around the world&#151;throughout the Anglo-sphere. The hon. Member for South Staffordshire was wrong in that regard. The balance has changed: although it is right to say that we have considerable parliamentary duties, constituency representation and constituency duties are an increasingly important part of the job. That is the way things are nowadays, and we must face up to it. It means that the great majority of Members must have two residences, and, as we all know and as was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones), the cost has risen considerably. Indeed, the cost to new Members has probably reached the limit. We sensibly decided not to opt for an eastern-Europe-style barracks block for Members of Parliament, on grounds of cost and security quite apart from any other considerations.</p>

 I think that that proposal should be considered. The Leader of the House spoke of a possible 10 per cent. limit, although I do not know whether the percentage would change according to the initial setting-up expenses. One of the issues that the panel is examining is the considerable up-front cost of setting up an office and a home and what can be done to help with cash  <br>

flow, particularly just after an election when often people have not been paid. I hope that the panel will look favourably on the idea of giving such help. It must also be borne in mind that we have to live in our second residences for a fairly long period, and it is proper for them to be furnished.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80716-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08071688000441">Another aspect that we should bear in mind is the social change that has taken place in the House. Not only are there many more women here; there are many more younger Members. As I said on, I believe, 3 July, for the first time all three leaders of the main political parties have young families. The composition of the House is very different from its composition when I first came here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80716-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08071688000442">As we observed earlier this year, school holidays do not always coincide with the holidays of the House. If we want families to be able to spend a reasonable amount of time together, it is appropriate for them also to have a reasonable level of accommodation&#151;not luxurious, but sufficient to enable them to lead a family life. If we do not build that into the system, only those who have inherited or married into money, or have made some money before coming here, will become Members of Parliament. That would be bad not just for individual Members of Parliament&#151;although it would slowly wear away their position&#151;but for democracy. We must be able to draw on the widest possible pool, not just on those who are prepared either to make sacrifices or, even more significantly, to sacrifice their families in order to represent their constituents in the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80716-0010.htm_para5"><a name="08071688000443">We need to make that case, even at the cost of the cranky letters and e-mails that we will undoubtedly receive. It is rather a shame that, on a day quite close to the recess, Opposition Front Benchers are not acting on behalf of their own Members, which is why I hope the House will support the Government amendment.</p>

of coming up with fundamental root-and-branch reforms to our allowances. I stand by everything that the three of us&#151;along with the other members, the Leader of the House, the shadow Leader, and with Mr. Speaker as Chairman&#151;proposed as a package. I regret nothing we proposed, and I would not rescind any of it. I do have one regret, however: the timing was wrong. We had orders to do our job on such a tight time scale that the House did not have a chance to see the detail of our proposals and to chew them over and consider them, and we probably did not have the time to reassure colleagues in all parts of the House of the content of practice assurance and what it entailed.</p>

We proposed that in recommendations 1 and 2, but we had not spelled out what we meant by practice assurance, and that scared a lot of colleagues, and colleagues also rightly questioned the cost. Given more time, I think we could have come up with more accurate costs, and I hope that it would have been less than &#163;1,500 per person per day around the offices. That argument has now been lost, however, and this matter is now down to the Government and the advisory panel&#151;I wish the right hon. Member for Warley well, as he will have a busy summer rewriting the green book, and the three of us are glad we no longer have that onerous responsibility.

I say to the House, with all the authority I can muster as a member of the House of Commons Commission and the MEC, that no MP had ever heard of the John Lewis list before it was forced into the public domain in court. In defence of the Department of Resources&#151;I know it is not popular to defend it&#151;let us ask why it invented it. I have with me a scrappy copy of the John Lewis list, which I have been carrying since January in case I was attacked or questioned on it, and it is internal guidance to the Fees Office staff. It says:</p>
<a name="80716-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="08071688001235"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Staff are instructed to use the list as a guide when assessing whether purchases are allowable under the green book section 3.14.1&#151;non-allowable expenditure: &#145;furnishings, including white goods or fittings which are antique, luxury or premium grade&#146;&#151;and...allowable expenditure.

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="80716-0010.htm_para11"><a name="08071688000450">The purpose of the John Lewis list was not to help colleagues get better quality white goods or furniture; it was a guide to stop that happening&#151;it was an internal guide to limit the amount. Let me give a hypothetical example. I had to replace my washing machine last year. I could have bought a top-of-the-range machine made by a company such as Bosch for &#163;1,200&#151;although why anyone would pay that much for a washing machine is  <br>

 Yes, that is true; there has been inconsistent advice, and that was one of the purposes of the practice audit teams that we wanted to set up. They would go round to help colleagues get things right. I say to Members of all parties that if we do not have that and instead have only a toughened up NAO going round, I suspect that all it will be able to do is report on our errors&#151;our genuine errors and mistakes. When that is in the public domain, those genuine errors and mistakes will be regarded as crimes against humanity. Our internal practice assurance teams were able to go round and say, &#147;David, you put it in the wrong column,&#148; or as the Fees Office informed me in a note two weeks ago, &#147;You&#146;ve transposed the figures 3 and 5; it should be 53 instead of 35.&#148; A tiny amount of expenditure was involved, but I had made a mistake in transcribing some figures on to my form.</p>

We wanted something intermediary to hold our hands and help us get things right. There are 650 Members claiming the different allowances at different times of the year in different ways. We have our interpretation and, over the years, the interpretation of the Fees Office has changed, too. A Member said that when he arrived here in 1992 he went to the Fees Office, where someone said, &#147;Oh, why haven&#146;t you got a mortgage, old boy? You can claim for it.&#148; The rules have been tightened up only when various things were exposed as wrong, or when genuine mistakes were made, or we had reports from the Standards and Privileges Committee saying, &#147;This was an abuse.&#148; We have been trying as a House to tighten these rules, not on a systematic basis but as problems occurred. Of course, in those circumstances, advice has sometimes been inconsistent.</p>

Let me say with all the authority I can muster that the cheapest and best deal for the taxpayer and for Parliament is for colleagues who are elected to buy a property and have a mortgage on it and get the mortgage interest paid by this House. That is a good bargain for the taxpayer at the end of the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="80716-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08071688000460">We looked at the costs of renting property. If a Member is in this House for a few years&#151;let us say 10, 12 or 15&#151;and they rent a property, the rental costs are likely to increase every single year. There is a higher cost to Parliament in paying for rented properties than in paying mortgage interest costs. We are not here to abolish rented property or mortgage interest. We looked into the matter very carefully and we thought it was perfectly legitimate to let that be claimed. However, as I have said, we came up with a package. There is, of course, a benefit to a Member if they are lucky in the housing market, but I believe that some Members who left this House in 1997 were out of pocket, as property prices go down as well as up&#151;as we are also discovering at present. However, there can be a benefit to a Member in owning their own property; there is the comfort and reassurance of ownership. In those circumstances, we thought we should not allow the additional benefit of &#163;1,600 per year on average, which is the amount claimed on white goods in the so-called John Lewis list.</p>

What would happen if we were to go down the route proposed in the Government amendment? I am not totally opposed to it, although I will, of course, support the Conservative Chief Whip as I like the part in his motion about white goods. If that is lost, I wish the Government well in the procedures that are adopted. I say to them that if the National Audit Office is to be given this task, it will have to invent a list of the reasonable reimbursement costs for furniture and other household goods. The cap might be at 10 per cent., but our studies suggest that that is too high for continuing Members&#151;we do not need &#163;2,400 per annum to replace the essential items in our property&#151;and too low for starting Members. I leave that as a problem for the NAO and the panel chaired by the right hon. Member for Warley to sort out.</p>

Before anyone in the media or elsewhere starts whingeing about it, the Senior Salaries Review Body examined it and concluded that about &#163;24,000 was the essential sum necessary to maintain another residence in London. I hope that the Committee will examine this nonsense of having one property described as the main home and the other as the second home. It will probably have to do so to sort out the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann), which is probably utterly unenforceable&#151;that is a problem for others to sort out.</p>

When I became a Minister, things were automatically transferred without my having any say; I was told that my home in the constituency had become my second home and that London was deemed to be my main residence. When I subsequently entered Opposition in 1997, it all changed back, and it changed again when I was made Opposition Chief Whip. This is nonsense, and I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) is working on a paper, which he will submit to the panel chaired by the right hon. Member for Warley, on how we designate our properties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80716-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08071688000464">Three or four years ago, when I was Opposition Chief Whip, I calculated that in one year I had spent exactly 170 days here in Westminster, 170 in the constituency and 25 on holiday. In such circumstances, MPs do not have a main home and a second home; as Members of Parliament, we are required to have a firm base in London. We are not travelling salesmen, who can live in a different hotel room&#151;a different Travelodge&#151;each week, so we need that firm base. If we have bought a property, it needs to be furnished, and if we are to furnish our property and to keep some form of list, we must make a robust defence of the arrangements. I robustly defend the right of Members who are buying a property to furnish it and to have the proper kit so that they are not sleeping on the floor or on cardboard boxes.</p>

We thought that, taken in the round, robustly keeping mortgages and defending the per diem rate of &#163;30 and the &#163;4,200 of the ACA was a package of measures that fairly compensated colleagues for the costs that they had incurred in maintaining a base in London. I will support the list&#146;s abolition, but if it is not to be abolished, I wish the Government, the right hon. Member for Warley and the NAO success in coming up with a definition of reasonable property and the reasonable kit to have that will persuade our friends and others in the media that we do not have our noses in the trough.

quite rightly, passed, but one of its consequences relates to property accumulation&#151;this answers one of the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones). One used to be able to claim the maximum allowances and, over time, build up a larger and larger property while claiming the allowances, but that is no longer possible. For that reason alone, a sensible decision was made, and I congratulate the House on its wisdom. I trust that none of the three Front-Bench teams will seek at any stage to unravel and backtrack on the House&#146;s wise decision on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="80716-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08071688000467">It is important to break down the three separate elements that confuse this debate, not only in the public&#146;s eye but here.

That seems to me to be a sensible approach, although nobody has yet followed my suggestion. That is their choice, although it may not be a wise one.</p>

 I shall give way in a minute. The second issue, which, of those I have raised in the past year, is the one that I have majored on, is party political advantage. I shall cite the simplest example&#151;the use of the dining facilities for party political advantage. Thanks to the Committee on Standards and Privileges, and to my delight, that is now debarred. It is no longer possible, as the annual report of the Sevenoaks Conservative Association, in respect of which a registration has just been made with the Electoral Commission, makes clear. It states that the patrons&#146; club has been terminated, saying:</p>

It is important that we continue this approach.

This may come as a surprise to some on the Opposition Benches, but I have refused on a recurrent basis over recent months to comment on the so-called irregularities, usually of Opposition MPs, when I have been asked to do so, usually by the media. In these cases, what the individual has done, in essence, is to apply Parliament&#146;s systems. I shall cite no cases, because it would, by definition, be invidious for me to do so, but the issue is not the action of the individual, who has acted within the system&#151;the issue is whether the system is right.

Government are putting forward today, and I hope that they are not in any way backtracking from the crucial principle that the general public have a right to know what we do, what we spend and how we spend it. If they wish to criticise me for anything that I have done in terms of my expenditure, they are free to do so and I will defend myself robustly. I may have a different view from theirs on what is and is not appropriate, but as their elected representative, I do not have a right to hide this information away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80716-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08071688000473">Strangely, in the years for which I have put this information on my website, nobody seems to have been particularly bothered about it. However, people are bothered about their right to know and about the rights of journalists to investigate. I hear many criticisms of journalists and the media in this debate, but I would go in the other direction: we could do with more investigative journalism in our newspapers, because it is a skill that seems to have died a death in this country. Parliament must have systems that are sufficiently robust and defendable, and absolutely transparent, so that we can feel comfortable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="80716-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08071688000474">Our situations will vary. Frankly, I do not care whether people buy a property or not. That is a risk that they take, but they should be open about it. Situations will vary, depending on rental agreements. I read the official Opposition&#146;s proposals with some amusement. In essence, if as a renting MP one had an unfurnished flat but now cannot get one, one has to go back to the same landlord or landlady and say, &#147;Well, I&#146;ll have to have a furnished flat.&#148; The rent will go up in order to provide that furnished flat, so the taxpayer will not necessarily get increased value for money. The different arrangements, which are obscure, mean that some things are more than average and others are less than average. Because I rent a room rather than a flat, for six years I did not have cooking facilities as part of the rental agreement. That meant that the rent was lower, but the situation was different.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="80716-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08071688000475">The issue is that the information is out there. If hon.

 The hon. Gentleman says that they have better things to do, but there is the issue of party political advantage. One shameful thing during this episode has been the attempts by Conservative central office, when someone has had the effrontery to suggest that certain MPs should repay money, to give false briefings to the press to suggest things that are not there. That has been tried in my case over the past three months on three occasions. None of those attempts has got anywhere, because the information is false. The first was so farcical that the individual concerned had to apologise. I was also able to point out that he was in criminal breach of the Electoral Commission regulations when it came to his own visits, and I discreetly and politely corrected him on that.</p>

 All Members, old and new, are equally vulnerable under the existing systems. There is a premise in the debate with which I disagree, although I am sure that I am in a rather small minority in doing so&#151;possibly a minority of one. The basic tenet of the debate, when it is discussed in private, is that MPs are not paid enough. People say to me, &#147;The allowances are your pension, and so on. That&#146;s why we have those things.&#148; That has been said to me on countless occasions. If people feel that MPs are not paid enough, the way to deal with that is to propose that MPs should be paid a lot more. I would disagree. I think that MPs are reasonably and fairly paid, and the comparators used in other debates are rather spurious. Comparisons in my constituency would put me in a rather privileged position, so I do not feel a great need to change the situation. However, if the whole expenses system is meant in some way to compensate for a perceived underpayment, MPs should be prepared to say, &#147;Pay us more, and we&#146;ll spend the money on whatever we want, but we&#146;ll deal with the taxman just as everyone else does.&#148; That would be a way of getting the general public off our back, because they are rightly on it at the moment.</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend. I am concerned about the approaches of the different Front Benchers, who are all attempting to gain party political advantage with the resolutions that they have tabled. That is inappropriate today. The original motion should not have been proposed. It would directly benefit those who claim the maximum, who have bought property and who are paying their mortgage interest on it. We should be open and honest about the fact that that is what the motion does. That is one way in which people can claim expenses, but it is not the only way. It is not the only system. It might not be the best and most affordable system, but that honesty is needed. Three of those in whose name the motion is tabled, including the hon.

Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean) was right to say that it has been a useful guide. However, it has become a sort of totem that has registered with the public.

I accept what the Leader of the House said earlier&#151;that the document that came out today was simply a coincidence, and that the work had been in progress before. That is good. I hope that we do not lose the vote on our motion today, but I suspect that we will. However, even if we do lose the vote, at least the Government will be able to move on in a positive way to resolve the issue. I think that it needs to be resolved as a matter of considerable urgency.</p>

House that will encourage ordinary men and women who carry the normal burdens of life to become Members of Parliament. We cannot have only wealthy people here. The right hon. Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar) is a rather nice, old-fashioned class warrior whom I quite like, but it was nonsense for him to suggest that all Conservative Members are rich and all Labour Members poor. I seem to remember that new Labour was founded by an awful lot of wealthy millionaire socialists.</p>

 I think that the hon. Gentleman slightly misunderstood me. I said that many people are in exactly the same position as the one that he has described on the Conservative Benches&#151;that is, that Back-Bench Members are being let down by their Front-Bench Members, who treat them with considerable disdain and do not recognise that proper expenses have to be provided. I knew that Conservative Members would find it difficult to speak on their own behalf, so I sought to do it for them.</p>

 I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman needs to speak on behalf of Opposition Members, but we should lay the myth that all Labour Members are as poor as church mice. They clearly are not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80716-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08071688000503">My real point is that we need to have proper pay and allowances in this House. We have consistently asked independent people to look at our pay and allowances. When they come forward with recommendations, we are told by Cabinet Ministers&#151;who, of course, get a bit more money than the ordinary Back Bencher&#151;that we should forgo any increase because we would otherwise be setting a bad example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80716-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08071688000504">I voted for the compromise proposal that we should instigate the Baker review, but at a delayed date. That was the right thing to do, but in case anyone thinks that I voted out of self-interest, I should add that I shall not be in the next Parliament, and so will not benefit in any way. However, we need to address this problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="80716-0011.htm_para19"><a name="08071688000505">As was mentioned earlier, when I first arrived in the House new Members were given easy advice by the Fees Office, as it was then known. We were told that it didn&#146;t really matter how we spent the money, although the allowances were of course much smaller in those days. When I first arrived, new Members were asked to divide the entire annual allowance into 12 portions and to put in a claim every month. That arrangement suited both the Fees Office and us, and there was no problem. Most of the money went on rent, council tax or utility bills, and it did not allow anyone to rush out and buy expensive German washing machines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="80716-0011.htm_para20"><a name="08071688000506">The problem arose in 2001, when we voted to increase our allowances from about &#163;13,000 to just under &#163;20,000. That changed the name of the game. In retrospect, we should have re-examined the circumstances of the allowance, because the decision opened up the opportunity for vastly more discretionary payments. In some way, that was the downfall of the allowance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="80716-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08071688000507">I hope that the Opposition motion will be carried today. As I said earlier, it has the advantage of simplicity. The danger is that we do not realise how far behind the pace of public opinion we are on this issue. If we are not seen to be doing something about it urgently, many of us will have a fairly uncomfortable summer recess.</p>

 May I say how pleased I am to follow the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson)? I agree with him that this is a political issue. I do not agree with the hon.

The motion before us, tabled on behalf of the Conservative party, is very party political.

I admit I am talking about a minority in that party, but I should like to remind the House of some of the recent scandals.</p>

In 2006, the right hon. Member for Witney was himself criticised for using his parliamentary office for party fundraising. There was also the report a few weeks ago about the hon.

 I will, and I shall now refer to the changes to the additional costs allowance. They were introduced because the former Conservative Member Michael Trend was abusing the system by claiming an allowance when he did not have a second home.</p>

My party has been doing that for the past eight years. When the shadow Leader of the House&#146;s party publishes those expenses, I challenge her to ensure that the figures go back eight years; it would be interesting to see what Conservative Members have been up to over that period.</p>

They want what they have claimed to be well understood. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw said, it would then be down to the public to judge Members on what they have claimed and how they have used their expenses. This is not a criticism of any individual or set of individuals; the problem is that the system has grown up over time, and that has led to a lot of inconsistencies. I am not criticising individuals in the Fees Office, but different advice is given. Sometimes, the office is given some very difficult jobs to do.</p>

I make no criticism of the individuals involved; they had a very difficult job to do, and with hindsight, if they had published a Green Paper and put in place a consultation, I think we could have come to an agreement and put forward a suggestion. Now that the report has been voted down, it has a sainted, Ark-of-the-Covenant feel to it, but the idea that it would solve all the problems is absolute nonsense. I do not accept that giving me, or any other Member of Parliament, &#163;4,200 a year without any receipts is more transparent than keeping the system as it is, or having more rigorous auditing and publishing the results of that audit.</p>

I am all for the idea of assurance, and people going into offices to give advice, but the idea that he put forward today, with which I agree, is that the public money that Members spend should be rigorously audited. I have no problem with that; if those audit reports are made public, fine. That would give the public the assurance that they want. If there were clear rules laid down, Members could be assured that what they were claiming was correct.</p>

We had a debate on this subject, and Members on both sides of the House had free votes on it, not long ago. It has always been a matter of House business, rather than party business. Both Front Benches remind me of those Governments who hold referendums, and when their citizens give them an answer they do not like, hold them again.

defend what is right. Yes, it is right that we should have better reporting and more transparency, but it is not right that we should make it impossible for hon. Members to carry out their duties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="80716-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08071688000530">The answer that my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead made to my intervention threw up a very interesting question, according to my interpretation of it, at any rate. Her response seemed to suggest that if one is wealthy enough to equip and furnish a second home, one should be able to buy that second home with the aid of state allowances, but if one is not wealthy enough to do that, one must take a furnished, rented place, and therefore get no advantage. It is a rather strange proposition that there should be two tiers of Members in this House, according to whether they can equip and furnish their own home. We should rather be firm, and say that Members do require a second home. As the right hon. Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar) amusingly said, we do not go to our constituencies only once a year now. Unless our constituencies are in London, it is still very difficult, on Monday and Tuesday nights, to get home, even for those whose constituency is in the home counties, as mine is. It is therefore quite right that we should have a second home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="80716-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08071688000531">When I first came to the House, the allowances were somewhat less generous. In my first year of owning a second home&#151;my constituency cottage&#151;I had a box in which I kept my hairdryer, kettle, toaster and sundry other things. That box went in the car and it went between my homes. I could not put a fridge or an oven in the box, or a bed, let alone several beds for a family. I happen not to have had a family, so at least I did not have to face that problem. It is ludicrous to suggest that most people who come to the House, having had an ordinary professional salary or less, can afford to equip and furnish a second home from scratch.</p>

 That is right; I did not need to. That was because I had a very good friend who was not then in the House, but who is now my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis), and he had a spare washing machine, which we put in an estate car and took to my cottage. It lasted for the whole 18 years that I had that cottage, and every year thereafter, in recognition of that benefit, I bought my hon. Friend dinner, and I did not charge the dinner to the allowances. So I never had to buy a washing machine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80716-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08071688000535">That may be a frivolous story, but it is ludicrous to suppose that a Member of Parliament with three or four children can somehow wash and rinse all the washing by hand and run it through a mangle. Such a person needs a washing machine. It is not a luxury. I never had a television. I do not like television, so I never had one in my second home, and I never asked the state to provide one for me. I went 18 years televisionless in my second home, but I can just imagine the response of a Member&#146;s teenage children if he said, &#147;By the way, throughout the summer there won&#146;t be any television.&#148; Therefore, it really does make sense to allow people to get everyday items that one would expect to find in a reasonable home, and if one can do that, someone somewhere has to decide whether an item is reasonable  <br>

The rules say that one cannot whistle up a &#163;10,000 kitchen from John Lewis, or a &#163;5,000 bathroom. If a kitchen or bathroom is replaced, the rules say very clearly that those costs must be divided between genuine replacement and betterment, and the betterment element must be paid for by the Member. But out there, egged on by the press and by the silly, crawling, gutless response of the House, everybody believes that these things can be whistled up with no rules, restraints or accountability. We should have had the guts to defend ourselves, just as we should have the guts to do so when the press talk about our lavish perks and include our secretaries. There have been some hon. Members for whom their secretary has been a perk, but precious few of them. Such is the view out there that Adam Boulton, who is supposed to be politically wise, actually stated on his programme as though it were a matter of fact that our secretarial allowances are paid directly into our bank accounts.

The vast ranks in between&#151;the professionals, those who are paid a reasonable but not excessive amount&#151;will not come to this place, and the press and the media at the moment are doing their level best to ensure that Parliaments of the future will be composed of people of substantially lower quality than Parliaments of the past.</p>

It is therefore right that we should make it clear that up to &#163;100,000 of that money goes towards our staff to help us to do our jobs properly. It would be absurd if somebody were to say to a headmaster that the salaries of his teachers were to be classed as his expenses, or if a manager or director were told that the salaries of all the people working under him were to be classed as his expenses, so it is absurd that the salaries of our staff should be classed as expenses. We need to clarify that in the mind&#146;s eye of the public. <i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> .</i><i> ] </i>A lot of chuntering about directorships is going on from sedentary positions.

The role of the Member of Parliament has changed since the 18th century, when it was a part-time exercise, which those who could afford to fund themselves undertook. David Lloyd George recognised that in 1911, when he referred to the demand from democracy. Voters should choose who represents them and no one should be excluded because they do not have the means to run two offices and two homes&#151;one in the constituency and one at Westminster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80716-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08071688000580">The second and equally important principle is that public money should be properly used for the purposes for which it was voted. We must demonstrate that that is the case to maintain public confidence. The proposals that my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House presented today do that. First, she proposes that the green book rules be rewritten, thus ending the John Lewis list, and that the body to do it&#151;the Advisory Panel on Members&#146; Allowances&#151;be augmented by two external, independent appointees. That has been discussed with the Chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80716-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08071688000581">Secondly, my right hon. and learned Friend proposes much stronger audit arrangements, namely a full financial audit by the highly respected and independent National Audit Office, covering all allowances.

Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean) highlighted the need for a more systematic approach to reform. He is another member of the MEC, and we are grateful to him for the huge amount of effort that he has made. The proposals put forward in the Government amendment build on the work that the MEC did earlier in the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="80716-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08071688000597">My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) spoke about the problems of malpractice and cases where expenditure of public money has been abused for party political advantage, and about the importance of taking a systematic approach. What he said is absolutely right. That is exactly why we want to extend the National Audit Office audit to cover the systems, to ensure that they, too, are robust and that Members can rely upon them and be assured that the records that they hold are accurate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="80716-0013.htm_para21"><a name="08071688000598">The hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) suggested that some sort of deal had been done on the Government Benches on 3 July, so that Labour Members would be free to vote against the MEC if they voted with the Government on pay. In fact, he is wholly wrong about that. No such deal was done; there was a completely free vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="80716-0013.htm_para22"><a name="08071688000599">My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) described a catalogue of problems in the last two Parliaments and stressed the importance of financial audit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="80716-0013.htm_para23"><a name="08071688000600">The right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) said that she wanted to make a robust defence of the position in which hon. Members find themselves. She certainly succeeded. She also pointed to the fundamental weakness in the Opposition motion, in that it will reinstitute a two-tier membership of the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o343"><a name="08071688000601"><a name="80716-0013.htm_spnew12"><a name="08071688001622"><b>Rob Marris:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend look forward to finding out after this afternoon&#146;s vote how many of those who vote for the Opposition motion do not rent furnished accommodation as part of their ACA claim, and therefore hypocritically do not do what the motion says that Members should do?</p>

<p><a name="st_o344"><a name="08071688000602"><a name="80716-0013.htm_spnew13"><a name="08071688001623"><b>Helen Goodman:</b>
 I am sure that there are those who will be extremely alert to the issues that my hon. Friend raises and who will provide us with that information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="80716-0013.htm_para24"><a name="08071688000603">In conclusion, MPs play a vital role in our democracy. They represent their constituents, they legislate and they scrutinise the Executive. To do that they must have adequate resources and they must command the confidence, respect and trust of the public. I believe that the proposals put forward by my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House achieve both those aims, involving independent external members on the panel to review the green book, abolishing the John Lewis list and providing for a full financial audit of all allowances by the National Audit Office. I commend her amendment to the House.</p>

With earnings growth stagnant for the past two years, household debt at record highs, housing asset values sliding, and the price of everything we consume soaring, is it any wonder that families are feeling the pinch? Inflation is at its worst level for 16 years&#151;more than double the rate the Government inherited from their predecessor in 1997. The latest figures published this week show the consumer prices index up 0.5 per cent. in a single month to nearly twice the Government&#146;s target, and factory gate prices rising 10 per cent. in the year&#151;the biggest annual percentage increase since February 1982, and an indicator of potential further consumer price inflation to come. The Governor of the Bank of England warns that inflation is likely to rise still further and to persist at the higher level until well into 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80716-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08071688001159">At the heart of that inflationary pressure is the soaring cost of oil, and the consequential increases in the price of petrol and diesel at the pumps. More than a quarter of the increase in consumer prices over the past year is due to the direct effects of fuel price increases, not counting the indirect impact that increasing fuel prices have on the cost of goods and services throughout the economy.</p>

as prices rise. But that does not mean that the system runs smoothly. Inevitably, there is annual pressure on the Chancellor and the Prime Minister to postpone or cancel increases in fuel duty&#151;a practice that the Prime Minister adopted regularly during his term in the Treasury. That pressure intensifies, as we have seen, if a Government are in trouble or face a tricky by-election. Far from automatic inflation increases in the rate of duty occurring predictably, the level of real duty is the subject of short-term political calculation, year after year, with the inflation increase having been cancelled or postponed in five years out of the last six, creating uncertainty for businesses and families, making the public revenues less predictable, and weakening environmental signals in the tax regime.</p>

reform should reduce the sensitivity of the public finances to changes in oil prices, improving the Treasury&#146;s ability to forecast and budget for the future. Fourthly, despite&#151;or perhaps because of&#151;the immediate challenge posed by soaring oil prices, we should not lose sight of our long-term green agenda. Any reform should provide more certainty about the price of carbon, encouraging the long-term shift towards lower-emission vehicles and alternative methods of transport that will be necessary to meet our climate change objectives.

Let me put it simply: under a fair fuel stabiliser, when oil prices went up, fuel duty would fall, and, in a quid pro quo, when oil prices went down, fuel duty would rise. If our fair fuel stabiliser had been introduced in the 2008 Budget, fuel would be about 5p a litre cheaper at the pump, which would save about &#163;3.50 on a tank of fuel for a Ford Mondeo, and inflation would be not 3.8 per cent. but about 3.3 per cent. Government revenues would not differ from the Budget predictions, which were based on an oil price of $84 a barrel. <i> [Interruption.] </i>It is amazing&#151;is it not?&#151;that the Treasury Whip, the hon.

diesel, but dampening also the downward movement when oil prices fall and duty rises to offset part of the drop. Therefore, on every count the fair fuel stabiliser would deliver a better result than the current system, as well as being more transparent and predictable. A fair fuel stabiliser would help to stabilise family finances, stabilise the public finances, dampen inflationary pressures and improve long-term signalling of the price of carbon. When oil prices rise, family budgets are put under pressure. The fair fuel stabiliser would moderate the impact of oil price increases on families by offsetting about half of the increase with a corresponding reduction in fuel duty, so the pump price would rise by about half the amount it otherwise would.</p>

The Chief Secretary has claimed that our proposal for a fair fuel stabiliser would lead to a &#163;3 billion &#147;black hole&#148; in the public finances. Never mind the fact that she should not be the first person to talk about black holes in the public finances, but this is far from the truth, as I believe she very well knows. The truth is that the only independent UK economic forecaster who has done the necessary work to comment definitively on this issue is the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, and it has concluded that oil price rises generate a positive impact on the public finances, even after taking into account the secondary effects of oil price rises on the economy overall, and thus on non-North sea Government revenues. According to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the net benefit to the Treasury is about &#163;140 million for every $1 dollar change in the price of a barrel of oil. So, when the oil price increases, net Government revenues, after taking into account all the effects across the economy of that oil price rise, also increase. It follows logically that when the oil price falls, Government revenues will also fall, by the amount of reduction in North sea tax revenues, less the positive effect from the increase in activity across the rest of the economy with which an oil price fall would normally be associated. Overall, there is a loss of revenue for the Government when oil prices fall. In other words, there is a spectacular misalignment of interests. An oil price rise, which is bad for families and for businesses, delivers a windfall to the Treasury, whereas an oil price fall, which is good for families and for businesses, creates a hole in the Treasury&#146;s revenues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80716-0015.htm_para4"><a name="08071688001194">The fair fuel stabiliser aligns the interests of consumers with those of the Treasury, and it shares the pain and shares the gain. It makes the public finances more stable, by reducing the impact of changes in oil prices, upwards or downwards, on Treasury revenues, making it easier for it to project what future revenues will be and making those projections less vulnerable to the vagaries of the international oil market.</p>

 I am glad that my hon. Friend is making this point, because it is idiocy to say that there will be a black hole under this scheme when the oil price rises. As he said, there is a 60 per cent. tax at the pump. If the oil comes from the North sea, there is a further tax, which is not included in that 60 per cent. There is an average tax rate of about 42 or 43 per cent. on the economy as a whole, so, of course there will be more revenue when the oil price rises. I find it extraordinary that people go on making these idiotic remarks about black holes when the opposite is true.</p>

 Given that oil prices have risen by more than the Chancellor predicted at the time of the Budget, will the hon.

Does he think that there should be a stabiliser in place to try to balance that part of the economy too?</p>

 Unfortunately, because we have not been given an interim statement from the Government, we do not know precisely what has happened to stamp duty revenues. I hear a whisper that they are substantially down, but that is a different argument, because we are talking about what is happening to oil prices and the impact on the economy of an oil price increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80716-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08071688001199">As we are dealing with the Lib Dems, let me address myth No. 2, which is propagated, surprisingly, by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). For the purposes of shorthand, I shall call this the Lib Dem myth, although there are many Lib Dem myths. The hon. Gentleman, who likes to think he knows a thing or two about oil, says that the fair fuel stabiliser would require the Government to predict the future price of oil. I am surprised at him, because although I do not always agree with what he says, I find that it is usually based on fact, and nothing could be further from the truth than that comment. The stabiliser will mean that Government revenues remain broadly the same, whether oil prices go up or down, because any windfall or shortfall from the North sea will be offset by a decrease or increase in fuel duty. The truth is that the present system requires the Government to predict future oil prices, when they make their revenue forecast in the Budget, thus leaving the public finances exposed to fluctuations in the oil market. Under the fair fuel stabiliser, that volatility in public revenues is removed, and the Lib Dem myth is demolished.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80716-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08071688001200">We are consulting on the precise level of the reduction in duty that should be associated with any given increase in oil prices. The example we have used and published, where the fair fuel stabiliser reduces the price increases at the pump by half, is broadly revenue-neutral to the Treasury on a conservative estimate of &#163;100 million of net revenue gain for each $1 change in the price of a barrel of oil&#151;that is a far lower figure than the National Institute of Economic and Social Research&#146;s model predicts.</p>

She is fond of quoting that highly respected body when it suits her, but on this issue, for very good reason, it has little to say. The IFS correctly says that its modelling leaves it &#147;unclear&#148; about the precise size of the positive impact on the public finances from an increase in the oil price, over and above the cost of the 2p U-turn that the Government have done today. However, the IFS is in no doubt that the impact is positive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80716-0015.htm_para8"><a name="08071688001202">The Chief Secretary has produced the IFS&#146;s statement with a flourish, as though it demolishes the NIESR analysis. It does not. &#147;Unclear&#148; means precisely what it says and the IFS is unclear for a reason. It does not have a dynamic macro-economic model that would allow it to analyse the likely impact of an external shock such as an oil price increase. That is not the business that it is in.  <br>

The NIESR has such a model and is in the business of conducting such analysis. It is the body with the authoritative view on the subject and the Chief Secretary can quote the IFS as loudly and as often as she likes&#151;its position, which we have checked again with it during the past few days, is that it simply does not know the answer to the question because it has not done the work and, what is more, it does not have the tools to do the work.

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80716-0015.htm_para9"><a name="08071688001207">The Labour myth is demolished. A fair fuel stabiliser would stabilise family finances and the public finances, but it will do more than that. It will also help to stabilise inflation. If half the increase in fuel prices over the past year had been offset by lower fuel duty, consumer price inflation would be 3.3 per cent., not 3.8 per cent. The pressure for wage increases and the industrial action behind them would be accordingly reduced. So there would be greater stability in family finances, greater stability in the public finances and lower inflation in a period of rising oil prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80716-0015.htm_para10"><a name="08071688001208">There is one other environmental benefit of the fair fuel stabiliser. Environmental taxes, such as fuel duty, can play an important role in reducing carbon emissions. They work mainly by encouraging a long-term shift towards lower emission vehicles and alternative methods of transport in response to higher fuel prices at the pump. A stable carbon price, as the Stern review argued, helps individuals and businesses to factor environmental costs into medium and long-term investment decisions and behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80716-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08071688001209">The fair fuel stabiliser would allow the average real value of fuel duty to be maintained to take inflation into account, as is supposed to happen now. When oil prices were rising, pump prices would rise, but by less than they do now. The long-term signal to consumers would be maintained. When oil prices fell, the price of fuel at the pump would fall, but by less than it would do otherwise. The incentive to consumers to adopt green behaviour would be strengthened. The risk of the message being undone by a downward movement in oil prices would be reduced. Overall, clearer, less volatile signals would be delivered, creating a stronger, more consistent environmental message.</p>

The fair fuel stabiliser is a practical, deliverable response to the challenges that fluctuating oil prices bring. As an oil producer, Britain is almost uniquely able among the industrialised countries to introduce such a measure and to give ourselves a competitive advantage in the globalised economy.</p>

in 1993. I can tell the House that, had that escalator continued, fuel duty would be nearly 30p higher today, while the petrol price, including value-added tax, would be nearly 35p per litre more expensive. Indeed, had we increased fuel duty each year simply in line with inflation rather than with the escalator, fuel duty would also be 10p per litre higher today.

 The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the figures that we set out at Budget time for increased revenue resulting from fuel duty will not now be as expected. However, the overall impact on the public finances of the increases in the world oil price, and other changes that have occurred simultaneously in the world economy over the past few months, will be set out as part of the pre-Budget report.

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="80716-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08071689000033">I come now to the workability, or practicality, of the proposals of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). The Opposition say that if their proposals had operated since the Budget, fuel duty would be 5p lower today. Their proposal is effectively for a 1p change in duty for every $6 change in the price of a barrel of oil. That would certainly keep Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, and the industry, busy. Over a quarter of a year, we have seen not simply a $6 variation in the price of oil, but a $60 variation. On 6 June, oil prices rose by $10 in a single day. Yesterday they fell by $10 in the space of several hours, ending the day $6 down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80716-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08071689000034">Under the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposals, therefore, fuel duty would have gone up by 1p yesterday alone. If fuel duty changed every time oil prices varied by more than $6 from the Budget forecast, rates would have changed more than 25 times just since the Budget 18 weeks ago: down on 18 March, up again on 19 March; down on 26 March, up again on 31 March; down on 2 April, down on 9 and 18 April. In one week in May, duty would have changed four times in a week: up, down, up, down. This is not a fuel duty stabiliser; this is a fuel duty yo-yo. Oil prices are now not only high, they are very volatile, and right now some of that volatility is absorbed by the private sector, as it does not reflect every change in the price at the pump, but that would not be the case under the hon. Gentleman&#146;s plans. Under his proposals the Government and the taxpayer, rather than the industry, would take the risk and pay the price of smoothing the figures on the forecourts. Ever-changing rates would cause complexity for oil producers and tax collectors, and be confusing.</p>

 May I also point out that the Conservative party&#146;s proposal lacks intellectual bravery? If it was intellectually brave about this, rather than putting forward a mechanism that would see the pump price rise by only half the increase in the oil price, if it arranged its figures differently it could stabilise the price completely, but it is not prepared to do that, because it realises that it would be unworkable. One of the Conservatives&#146; five principles is for certainty, but even under their own mechanism there will not be certainty of pump prices.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. In the end, the point is that when setting fuel duty, it is right to look at what is happening in the markets&#151;at oil prices and at the prices at the pump. That is why we have decided not to go ahead with the increase in fuel duty in the autumn. It is also right to look at the impact on public finances and at what is practical and workable. That is where the Conservative proposals repeatedly fall down.</p>

remain unchanged by the proposal. That claim is simply irresponsible. The proposal claims that windfalls from certain taxes would pay for the Conservatives&#146; plans. Their figures take account of increased VAT from higher petrol prices and of higher North sea oil revenues, but they ignore the fact that fuel duty revenues are likely to fall, not increase, when petrol prices rise, as demand for fuel falls. They ignore the fact that people spending more on fuel will spend less elsewhere, reducing VAT revenues from elsewhere in the economy. They ignore factors such as production levels, capital and operating costs and the strength of sterling.</p>

Will she look at the Government&#146;s own figures from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform? They show that during the first three quarters of 2007, there was a net rise in the fuel price and a massive rise in the diesel price. Notwithstanding the change from petrol to diesel, and that kind of stuff, the figures show that despite a rise in price from 92p a litre to 97p a litre&#151;a 5 per cent.-plus rise in nine months, more than twice the rate of inflation&#151;net demand increased.

 I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for giving way to me.

It does not, for example, take into account factors such as production levels, capital and operating costs, or the strength of sterling, all of which impact on North sea oil revenues and all of which have meant that those revenues have increased by less than we might have expected in recent years, given the rising oil price. The institute ignores the fact that rising oil prices can, through utility bills as well as fuel bills, affect inflation.  <br>

That, in turn, raises tax allowances, reducing revenues, and increases spending on benefits linked to inflation. It is also important to include the impact of higher oil prices on companies&#146; profits, and therefore on the tax that they pay.</p>

All those things will have an impact on the public finances. In the face of a world slowdown, to take any one tax in isolation and claim that there is a windfall available to spend is economically illiterate, irresponsible or just disingenuous. The Conservatives&#146; proposals would have already cost an extra &#163;900 million since the Budget, and would mean an estimated extra cost of more than &#163;2.5 billion, to be paid for by additional borrowing, public spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere. Yesterday morning, the shadow Chief Secretary&#146;s leader said that he would back our spending plans, cut stamp duty and introduce his fuel duty measures.

 No; the hon. Gentleman is talking nonsense. We have always been clear that there will be increases in some taxes but reductions in revenue from others as a result of factors such as an oil price increase. For example, there will be increases in the amount that needs to be spent on benefits as a result of rising inflation, which is in itself linked to rising oil prices. In addition to those factors, there are other pressures on the economy that responsible Governments need to take seriously when they take decisions on the public finances.</p>

 Well, I will make one final effort. Does the Chief Secretary really think that a Minister addressing the House of Commons should go into such copious detail about the likely impact on revenues and the economy of an Opposition proposal but refuse to give any information at all about a decision announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer this morning? Corrections to the last Budget have already cost more than &#163;3 billion in estimated revenues, and the forecasts of revenues from corporation tax and elsewhere given at the last Budget are plainly over-optimistic when one sees where the economy is going. It is no good her saying that every time the Government have changed their mind in the past they have not given those details, and we have had to wait until November. Will she address the question of where we are with the Government finances, and whether the Chancellor is planning to raise other taxes, reduce public spending or simply allow public borrowing to let rip?</p>

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman is long enough in the tooth and has been long enough in the Treasury to know that, as always, we set out the forecast for the public finances at the time of the Budget and at the time of the pre-Budget report. Unusually, we said when we announced the additional increase in tax allowances that we would increase borrowing this year to pay for it. It is right to do that, given the pressures that the economy is under. We therefore set that out, in contrast to the Conservatives, who repeatedly set out policies that would result in huge additional costs yet never tell us where those funds would come from. This is not merely about the &#163;3 billion of additional costs that the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) mentioned in the &#147;Today&#148; programme interview. Little wonder that he also said that he could not rule out tax increases, as he knows that he would need them to pay for his fuel duty plans. The results of the Conservatives&#146; Finance Bill votes alone would cost an extra &#163;3 billion, but they never said how they would fund them. Their promises on Budget day would cost an extra &#163;5.4 billion, but they never said how they would fund them. Their promises throughout the autumn would cost an extra &#163;10 billion, but they never said how they would fund them. At the last election, they promised more than &#163;35 billion in spending increases and tax cuts, but never said how they would fund that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="80716-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08071689000057">The Conservative motion is simply a con. Far from helping hard-pressed families, all that the Conservatives would do is push up their taxes elsewhere. Far from facing up to the serious problems of rising world food prices, they simply hide behind gimmicks, which would risk destabilising the public finances and the economy. Once again, we get showmanship, not substance. That is not what families or the economy need. That is why we should reject the motion.</p>

 Let me finish the argument and then I will take an intervention. It is odd that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) spoke for half an hour but did not deal with the practical problems that arise from the fact that the UK has exceptionally high diesel duty. There is a policy problem because we know that large-scale tax arbitrage&#151;in other words, smuggling&#151;takes place, and there are practical proposals to deal with that, whether through the original Britdisc scheme or some cruder system of taxing European vehicles at the points of entry and exit to account for road use. We should be discussing that because there is a genuine problem in that the current policy&#151;or lack thereof&#151;results in a substantial leakage of revenue. It is a pity that we did not go further into the subject of diesel.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that the leakage to which he refers is particularly severe in Northern Ireland, because of the differences in duty between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland? Indeed, those differences have led to large-scale operations by gangsters, who take hundreds of millions of pounds out of the economy every year through fuel smuggling.</p>

 Yes, I realise that Northern Ireland has special problems because it has a land border. Any system to counteract smuggling is bound to face difficulties because of the small rural roads that exist across Northern Ireland. None the less, we need to stop that large leakage of revenue, which also does great damage to the British road haulage industry.</p>

Germany, Belgium and Italy have higher petrol duty than the UK, as a result of the various postponements to which the Ministers referred. By far the highest rate is that in Norway.</p>

Britain is not unique, because there is another European country with those characteristics. There is a question to be asked of the Norwegians, but to which I do not know the answer&#151;perhaps we should have a charter flight to Norway with the SNP and the Conservatives; I would be happy to go as an observer&#151;as to why they do that. I suspect that one of the reasons is that the Norwegians are conscious, in a way that we perhaps are not&#151;and as the Conservatives certainly are not&#151;that oil is a valuable resource that needs to be conserved. The Norwegians use their tax policy to that end. We should therefore perhaps not be too flippant in dismissing that important history.</p>

 I am all for introducing measures to help if they are practical and affordable. However, I think the hon.

Certainly, my years in the oil industry have led me to believe that these things are very difficult to predict. I am therefore not as comfortable as he is that this is simply a temporary spike that needs to be dealt with on that basis.

This might produce some less friendly interventions. Underlying their proposal is an assumption that it would be sensible to pool oil revenues from one sector of the economy. Their basic underlying idea is that we should have upstream oil windfall taxes and taxes on the product, and that these should be pooled and evened out. I do not understand why that should be the case. Other sectors of the economy have different streams of revenue that we would never dream of pooling in that way. For example, council tax is going up and stamp duty is going down, but we do not argue that we need a property tax regulator. It would be a strange economic arrangement if we were to have such a thing.</p>

 I think the hon. Gentleman is suggesting some philosophical or moral reason for linking the two, but I do not believe that at all. It is simply a practical observation that there is a linkage in that when oil prices are rising, the Government inevitably and necessarily achieve a windfall&#151;from corporate taxes, petroleum revenue tax, North sea production and so forth. It thus provides a pool of revenue that always rises when the international price of oil rises. That is what enables this offsetting mechanism to be introduced.</p>

 I am trying to be not philosophical but practical in asking why this should be pooled with other sources of oil revenue. One of the reasons I ask the question, which concerns the silo approach to taxation, is that a few weeks ago the hon. Gentleman&#146;s colleagues produced a paper on the cost of living that had a different silo and a different box, whereby environmental taxes went into something called a family fund. There is a perfectly good reason for pairing the two, and we believe that environmental taxes should be offset with income tax.

into a box and offset against income tax, but now we hear the argument that they should be put in a separate box and offset against upstream oil tax. Quite where this comes from&#151;other than the fact that it makes a neat fit at a particular point in time&#151;is difficult to say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="80716-0017.htm_para10"><a name="08071689000098">Let us pursue the Conservative argument. The case is that there is a real windfall of revenue from the upstream oil sector. The Conservatives may well be right: we heard the argument last week; they have gone through a model and it is creditable that they have done their homework to that extent. The Government have a different model and have reached a different outcome, and they should perhaps tell us what it is and publish it. I am willing to accept, however, that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge may be right and that the Conservative model is better than the Government&#146;s model. I do not know, but let us assume for the moment that it is and that there is a real windfall here. If we really have a windfall from North sea oil revenue, the question that arises is what is the most sensible way of using it.</p>

Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. Whenever I listen to his interviews, I always hear his phrase about a &#147;hole in the roof&#148;. If there is such a hole in the Government finances, surely that should be the first priority for any windfall gains. That is what most oil-producing countries would do: if they have a windfall in oil revenue from their upstream producers, they put it into a separate sterilised fund in order to stabilise public finances. Surely that is what is required. It should be used either to reduce Government borrowing this year or to pay off Government debt. Either the Conservatives do not believe their own propaganda about holes in the roof or they are not taking it very seriously.</p>

 In terms of oil revenue, I would have thought that the sun was shining. Is that not the whole point? The sun is shining on the North sea, so should not any extra revenue be used to stabilise public finances? I find it difficult to understand why the Conservatives would not give priority to that. I am trying to be sympathetic and to understand their argument. They seem to be saying that fixing the hole in the roof has to wait because there is such pain about and families need to be helped. I understand that argument. They want to introduce some mechanism that spares the pain for families by ensuring that taxation reflects the deteriorating conditions in the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80716-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08071689000102">It is fair to say that a lot of taxation operates on that principle. Income tax goes down if incomes go down, with people moving to a lower income tax bracket. Stamp duty goes down if house prices go down, and people move into a lower bracket. The posh term for this is &#147;automatic stabilisers&#148; and I think that what the Conservatives are trying to do is to turn petrol duty into an automatic stabiliser. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with that, except that what happens with automatic stabilisers is that the revenue is much less predictable and that with a downturn in the economy, the deficits are much bigger.</p>

That produces a revenue-neutral process. It is based on the assumption that oil prices go in cycles. We know that that is probably not the case, and that is what worries me about the proposals.</p>

I am happy to pat that across as part of the Conservatives&#146; consultation exercise. Effectively, they would be running a deficit of &#163;10 billion a year on that aspect of their policies. The assumptions that one makes about the base oil price are fundamental to the revenue projections that the Government assume.

He appears to be under the impression that the offsetting factor is the increase in duty in the future when oil prices go down, but the offsetting factor is the increase in Government revenues in the same time segment as a result of high market oil prices, which enable the Government to offset a decrease in fuel duty at the pumps&#151;not between one period and another, but in the same period.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for the clarification.

However, it creates an entirely different problem: petrol duty would have to be set in response to the predictions of the economic model in relation to the net windfall, which is an even more complicated exercise. May I suggest that there might not be any net windfall at all? The proposal would make tax policy unbelievably complicated and unpredictable, and in view of the Conservatives&#146; long-term commitment to tax simplification I am surprised that they are proceeding with it with such enthusiasm.</p>

 We know that the hon. Gentleman does not like the idea of a regulator, a stabiliser or whatever. What would the Liberals do, therefore, to help the hard-pressed motorist? I do not know whether he has been to Glasgow, but the one thing that is consistent on the street is unhappiness with high fuel prices. Would the Liberals do anything about that?</p>

 I have indeed been to Glasgow and I spent the earlier part of my speech suggesting that there are measures that could be taken. I realise that Glasgow, East is not a remote rural area&#151;I am particularly conscious of that, having lived in the city&#151;but I suggest that we move to a more appropriate system of vehicle taxation. We have vehicle excise duty, which is a blunt way to tax motorists and bears little relation to environmental impact, and we have fuel duty. If we were able to move quickly to a road user pricing system that properly captured the environmental costs of congestion, that would be a much more attractive long-term option for people in Glasgow, East and everywhere else.</p>

 On that very point, the hon. Gentleman has moved his party&#146;s policy along considerably in the past two weeks. Two weeks ago, he was opposing the graduated vehicle excise duty on the existing fleet but supporting it on new vehicles. Today, he is proposing abolishing it on new vehicles. As for using road pricing only on motorways and trunk roads, has he thought through the impact of congestion and pollution on all other roads in rural areas and in urban and suburban areas?</p>

 As we have the vehicle excise duty system, and parking charge systems in certain cities, it seems entirely sensible that an environmental component ought to be built in where possible. My colleagues and I are arguing that in the longer term we move over to a system that more accurately reflects pollution costs, congestion costs and road use. It is a question of time periods. Given that we have the VED system, I have been happy to defend, and have voted for, a wider differential on new vehicles.</p>

 But surely that would not send the signals for demand reduction that my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary mentioned earlier. For those who drive gas guzzlers, the signals that it sends are that as long as they stay off the motorways and trunk roads, they can drive as much as they want, in whatever vehicle they want, and the emissions of their vehicle are irrelevant. It is a blank cheque for Chelsea tractors in suburban areas.</p>

 In the longer term, a combination of road pricing and fuel duty will be needed. Essentially, however, one is taxing use, and those who drive vehicles that are prodigious consumers of fuels would pay relatively more.</p>

the change due to the so-called stabilisation. Not only would it be a burden on business to keep adjusting to that, but motorists would start second-guessing, saying, &#147;I might not fill up my tank today; I&#146;ll fill it up tomorrow, because it might change again.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80716-0018.htm_para3"><a name="08071689000115">That would throw out the modelling completely again. Is the system not far too complex?</p>

 To be fair, I had a long discussion with the SNP, and its argument&#151;I do not know whether the Conservatives have carried it forward&#151;is that the adjustment would be every six months. That is the proposal as I understand it. One criticism concerns how on earth the windfall would be worked out, given the complex modelling problem.

If I understand Scottish nationalism sufficiently, it seems the idea is not to use oil revenues to keep down petrol prices in Runnymede, Tatton or Twickenham. I think that the scenario goes rather differently: some time in 2010, perhaps there is a change of Government&#151;who knows?&#151;but there are not many Conservative MPs elected, and they say, &#147;There is no legitimacy; let&#146;s have a plebiscite.&#148; They vote to go their separate ways, and the revenue gets no further south than Edinburgh.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s points was particularly well made: those of us who feel that the way that motorists are taxed must change should ensure that we are not double accounting in relation to where the money comes from and goes to. If one revenue is to offset a tax, we must ensure that we are not offsetting in two different places. It is clear to me from the Conservatives&#146; recent announcements that they are doing precisely that. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, their family-friendly proposal is that fuel duties should be put into a pot to offset income tax and be treated as green taxes. However, they are also talking about offsetting those same revenues against motoring taxes. That is clearly double accounting and it does not stack up.</p>

I would claim that they have nicked my policy rather than that of the Scottish nationalists. However, whether it is the SNP&#146;s policy or my policy that has been stolen, the only added value that we have had from the Conservatives is that they spent the past three weeks with a thesaurus, coming up with a different word to describe the policy.</p>

 I am not sure to what extent it applies to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s policy, but it certainly applies to the SNP policy, now that I have had a chance to read its proposal.

They have to be responsible for ensuring that there is no black hole in our revenues and that all the Government&#146;s spending commitments are fully funded. I point out to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) that the Conservatives have a proposal whereby they will stick by our total spending plans. They are not committed to spending the money in the same way, but they are committed to spending the same amount, which means that they also have to be committed to raising the same amount. They cannot offer tax cuts here and there without creating a black hole in their spending plans.</p>

11 times since 1997, is to look at the net revenues coming in and the pain or otherwise being felt in the economy and make a judgment about whether fuel duty is going to go up or not. What Chancellors do when they make that judgment is look back at the levels of revenue that the Government are receiving from all the different sources and all the complexities of the economy&#151;whether the money is coming from VAT, North sea oil revenue, corporation tax, income tax or all the other things that are happening in the economy at the same time. They then make a judgment on whether the country can afford, or needs, a fuel duty rise. They have made that judgment today, so we can have a fuel duty moderator, but I would not necessarily recommend a formulaic fuel duty moderator such as the one proposed by the Conservatives.</p>

 Let me make a little progress. One reason why I consider it necessary is that there are 23 million motorists out there who clearly feel that the net package of taxation that they are having to pay is unfair and, as a proportion of taxation as a whole, places too great a burden on their shoulders. I believe that we need to get those 23 million motorists on side with our green agenda, because otherwise we will never be able to drive down carbon emissions from fuel-powered transport. That is why I believe that we must put together a package of measures that will make motorists instinctively feel that the taxation system is a bit fairer than it is today.</p>

charge the same duty for diesel as for petrol, we have the highest diesel prices in Europe. People are coming into our country in lorries and stealing work from United Kingdom hauliers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="80716-0018.htm_para13"><a name="080716101000027">According to a haulier who was involved in the fuel duty lobby the other week and whom I arranged to meet along with one of the Transport Ministers, between January and June 2007 the fuel bill for Les Knight Transport Ltd, which has a fleet of about 20 heavy goods vehicles, was &#163;390,000. The bill for the same period this year was &#163;484,000. That amounts to an increase of &#163;94,000 so far this year. I asked how much of it the firm had been able to pass on to its customers. A fuel duty escalator is built into its contracts so that it can pass on some of the price, but so far it has only managed to get its customers to pay an extra &#163;34,000. So far, &#163;60,000 of extra cost has been imposed on the business in this year alone. No business could sustain that for long, and British hauliers will not be able to sustain it for long. I accept that that their social costs are lower, but we need to find a way of adjusting the balance on behalf of the haulage industry. Whether that is done through an essential user rebate&#151;which is what it is asking for, but which seems to me to be a rather complicated mechanism&#151;or a reduction in excise duty on heavy goods vehicles, we have to do something and do it fairly rapidly.</p>

We would have to have a simple vignette system that everyone&#151;British hauliers as well as foreign hauliers&#151;has to buy. A foreign haulier would, of course, buy it at the day rate, and the British haulier would buy it at a discounted annual rate, but what is important is that the revenue from that system would be used to offset UK excise duty on heavy goods vehicles. That would be a perfectly legal system under EU law, and it would be zero-cost to the Treasury and provide a considerable competitive rebalancing for the heavy goods vehicle industry.</p>

London is, indeed, fortunate, and the people of my constituency are proud of Boris&#146;s success and achievement. During the election campaign, it became apparent on the doorsteps just how much Boris had done as a constituency MP. For a man used always to being in the limelight, most of this had been done without fuss, but in the knowledge that it made a real contribution to the lives of the people of south Oxfordshire. People in one village in the constituency recalled Boris making a complicated journey from London simply to play a cameo role in the village panto. His ability to arrive late for almost all occasions must have presented particular challenges for the theatrical management&#151;but arrive on time he did, and he delivered his lines on cue. Incidentally, Boris&#146;s cameo role was playing Boris Johnson&#151;a role he had no trouble playing.

<a name="80716-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="080716101000714"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;many of my constituents find it very difficult to afford petrol these days&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 12 July 2001; Vol. 371, c. 1010.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80716-0019.htm_para7"><a name="080716101000038">He said that when the average price of a litre of unleaded was just about 80p. He went on to point out that there was no public transport alternative, with many villages having only one service per week. Seven years later, the situation is, in all senses, considerably worse in an area where the car is a necessity, not a luxury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80716-0019.htm_para8"><a name="080716101000039">Secondly, I shall not argue over whose by-election should take credit for the Government&#146;s climbdown over the 2p autumn rise. I think that my constituents would feel that they had a role to play in it, because they regarded their by-election as, in many ways, a referendum on the Government&#146;s whole approach to the motorist and will be glad to have forced the Government into that climbdown.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80716-0019.htm_para9"><a name="080716101000040">Finally, if the Government find it hard to listen to us or to my constituents, perhaps they ought to listen to those who once would have been their natural allies. Last Friday, I returned to Oxfordshire county council, where, until recently, I held a portfolio that included human resources and its relationship to the unions. I was asked by the secretary of the Oxfordshire county branch of Unison to help draw to the attention of Treasury Ministers a 2,000 signature petition that it had raised on fuel duty. I was told that, for some reason, the union had been unable to find a Labour Member who was willing to do so. One can disagree with the detail of Unison&#146;s proposed mechanism to achieve the scrapping of the 2p increase and the further 10p reduction in fuel duty for which it is calling, but it is difficult to disagree with the sentiment it expresses: that pump prices are hurting businesses and individuals, particularly the poorest paid. I am pleased to have been elected to this House at a time when Conservatives are clearly trusted to represent the views of trade unionists, and I thank the House for its indulgence in listening to this speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80716-0019.htm_para10"><a name="080716101000042">It is a great pleasure to speak in this debate, because I have rarely seen an Opposition motion so steeped in cant. The truth is that the people who led the charge to keep fuel duty high are on the Opposition Benches&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) says &#147;Come on!&#148;, but who brought in the fuel duty escalator? The last Conservative Chancellor. No wonder they lost. It is not Heathcliff who is responsible for the problem, but Rushcliffe&#151;the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), who brought in the extra tax at the pump. Heathcliff abolished it. If the Tories had continued, about 30p would have been added through that tax to every litre, every day for the motorist filling up at the pump.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80716-0019.htm_para11"><a name="080716101000043">In February, less than five months ago, when petrol was already more than &#163;1 a litre and diesel was more than &#163;1.10, the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo), the Conservative Chairman of the Select Committee on Environmental Audit, criticised the Government for abolishing the fuel duty escalator. He was joined in that by his Conservative friends the hon. Members for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker), for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd), for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger) and for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart), but their demands for higher fuel taxes did not stop there. They called in paragraph 14 of the Committee&#146;s report for air tax freight duty to be introduced for the first time. That would send the cost of some foods through the roof.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80716-0019.htm_para12"><a name="080716101000044">The Committee&#146;s fourth report of 2006-07 called for a sixfold increase in diesel for airport vehicles, when diesel cost 7.69p a litre. That would have sent up the cost to more than 46p a litre. The report produced in February went on to state that, by April 2009, fuel duties were set to go up by 6p a litre, but reminded the Committee and the House that fuel duty rates were still 11 per cent. below the price in 1999.</p>

 I do not quite know what the hon. Gentleman is rambling on about now, but let us get back to his criticism of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). Will the hon. Gentleman remind the House what the price of a barrel of oil was when my right hon. and learned Friend introduced the fuel duty escalator?</p>

 It was less than it is now, but as the price went up the Conservatives kept the escalator going. That would, of course, have meant that prices now would have been some 30p more than they are at the pump and up to about &#163;1.50 a litre, according to the figures that I mentioned earlier, which were provided by the Automobile Association. The Committee&#146;s report is proof that the Conservatives have not learned a lesson about the fuel escalator. When the five Conservative Members I mentioned signed up to the report, which called for the Government not to back down on the rates of duty, they said that that would be a test for the Treasury. The report states:</p>
<a name="80716-0019.htm_brev1"><a name="080716101000715"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Some motoring organisations have begun calling for the next planned increase in fuel duty to be scrapped, given the rise in petrol prices due to increases in the price of crude oil. The forthcoming Budget is a test of the Treasury&#146;s environmental credibility: it must not defer its planned rises in fuel duty.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80716-0019.htm_para13"><a name="080716101000047">The problem, of course, was that even that was not enough for the Conservative report on green taxes produced by Zac Goldsmith and the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer). It proposed to push up the vehicle excise duty differential to &#163;500. They wanted a new graduated purchase tax with a variable VAT rate that would see a combined tax of 27.5 per cent. on larger cars. That was all aimed at hitting the motorist.</p>

 That is because the modern Tory party has abandoned the sort of principles that the right hon. Member espoused. It says one thing to one group, but allows the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal to say another thing to another group.</p>

That is the sort of U-turn that he does: one day it is hug a hoodie, then it is hug a tree, and now it is hug a Hummer. The Opposition cannot make their minds up about whether they are going to be environmental or not, although I pay tribute to the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) for his consistency at least.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80716-0019.htm_para15"><a name="080716101000051">The problem is that when the cold economic winds blow across the Atlantic and reach Britain and the Leader of the Opposition, the shiver looks in vain for a spine to run down. People want action, not unbelievable and untried policies from an Opposition Front-Bench team that clearly has not bothered even to look at the fuel tax stabiliser in other countries, given that it appears that all of them have rejected the measure as being pie in the sky. What the public want are practical steps such as the action that we have taken today.</p>

 I shall tell the hon. Gentleman how it would work, if it would work at all, and that is if the oil price continues its reduction of the past few days. The hon. Member hopes that that will happen, but he failed to tell the House about what would happen if it keeps going up&#151;and there have been predictions, and not just from the doom merchants, that it will rise inexorably and hit $200 a barrel. If the oil price continues to rise, what mechanism will ensure that people and motorists are weaned off the so-called stabiliser? If oil prices do not fall but keep rising, the stabiliser would have to be removed and fuel prices would rise. The stabiliser does not offer a long-term solution to the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80716-0019.htm_para16"><a name="080716101000056">The country wants a credible alternative to the stabiliser. The Opposition are offering something that no Government in the advanced industrial world, or indeed anywhere, have proposed. As my hon. Friends have pointed out, other countries are in the same position as Britain, being oil producers with advanced industrial economies. That is why the public will reject this gimmick from the Opposition. They clearly did not have sufficient confidence in it to test it in the Finance Bill Committee where, if it had not been debated to destruction, it would certainly have been thrashed around. To its credit, the Scottish National party allowed the policy to be tested. It was not adopted, but it has been partially stolen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80716-0019.htm_para17"><a name="080716101000057">However, the nationalists have their own problems with fuel. Some months ago, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor set aside a sum of money for England and the devolved regions to ensure that bus companies could offset some of the fuel rises and duties and keep fares frozen. The Scottish National party Administration in Edinburgh did not pass the money on to local bus companies, with the result that very successful companies such as Lothian Buses and others up and down Scotland were forced to put fares up by 10 per cent. That is a direct result of the Scottish National party talking up its concern about fuel, but in fact pocketing the money that had been set aside and using it for something else. As a result, my constituents and other people all over Scotland, including in Dundee, have suffered increased bus fares.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80716-0019.htm_para18"><a name="080716101000058">People want the Government to take the sort of practical step that I have described. This Government set money aside, and it is a pity that it was not passed on by the Scottish Nationalist Administration in Edinburgh. However, the money was passed on elsewhere in the country, and it has helped to keep fares down, even at a time when diesel prices have escalated as the world price of oil has soared.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="80716-0019.htm_para19"><a name="080716101000059">Today&#146;s decision by the Chancellor to defer the 2p fuel duty rise will be widely welcomed. However, it is important that we send the clear, not mixed, message that things will not get easier as regards fuel. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has rightly pressed at summits to ensure that oil production is increased, but we all know that if China&#151;a rapidly advancing, industrialising country&#151;started to use oil at the same per capita rate as the United States of America, the entire world&#146;s current annual output would be consumed solely by China.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="80716-0019.htm_para20"><a name="080716101000060">It is right that we address issues of climate change and ensure that America&#151;the largest consumer of oil&#151;is part of that regime, recognises Kyoto, as it has started to do, and sets its own targets. We are not in a position to lecture the rest of the world unless we take steps in this country. I am very pleased that colleagues on my party&#146;s Front Bench have taken key steps on renewables. The measure that has been announced is necessary to bring some relief to hard-pressed motorists, and I welcome it. I am sure that they, too, will welcome it as a practical measure, and will reject the Opposition proposal as pie in the sky.</p>

speech, he showed his insight into his constituency. I visited his constituency just before his election and got to know it a little better, so I understand some of the glowing references that he made to villages in the constituency, and to the town of Henley, which is one of the most beautiful parts of south Oxfordshire. It is a great pleasure to have him here, although I think I speak for many Conservative Members, and perhaps a few Labour Members, when I say that we will miss his predecessor, who, in his role as Mayor of London, is doing great things. However, we will miss his charm and wit in this place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="80716-0019.htm_para21"><a name="080716101000062">I am pleased to take part in this debate. It is clear that we are in a period of great economic uncertainty, and the situation is somewhat exacerbated by the recent massive fuel price increases. As a result of the Prime Minister&#146;s recent attendance at a meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in June, he is aware that it is unlikely that there will be any significant increase in oil supply in the next few years. That is why I found the comments of the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) interesting; he seemed, rather optimistically, to think that there might be changes in oil prices over the summer. I think that he may be looking at the world through rather rose-tinted spectacles, because as the Prime Minister said:</p>
<a name="80716-0019.htm_brev2"><a name="080716101000716"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This is the third great oil shock in three decades&#148;.</p>

We recognise that problem, and constituents will be grateful to us for calling this debate so that we can really press the Government on practical ways to support our constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="80716-0019.htm_para23"><a name="080716101000064">The Government may say that they recognise the problem, but they are failing to show any of the leadership that we need to find a solution, and are failing to give business certainty; that is what people are crying out for. I am not sure that a six-month delay in implementing the 2p fuel rise will do anything to create the long-term certainty that families and businesses need on fuel costs. Let us consider the intricacies of the 2p delay. The cost of deferring the increase last time was about &#163;550 million. We know that, as a result of the increase in fuel prices, the Government received in the first five months of this year alone a windfall that yielded almost that amount of money. Perhaps we could consider the issue in that context. As the Royal Automobile Club reminds us in its briefing, which sets out its reaction to the Government&#146;s announcement, the measure is just a drop in the ocean, given the &#163;2 billion extra that the Treasury intends to take from motorists in the next two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80716-0019.htm_para24"><a name="080716101000065">I am very concerned about families across the country, who face the reality of increasing mortgage rates and food prices, as well as ever-increasing fuel prices. That is the case not just in the rural areas of my constituency, but in the town, where we have great problems sustaining the public transport networks that are needed if people are to rely on them rather than their cars. The Government should be listening a little more intently to some of the proposals of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond).</p>

4,000 are in the transport and communications sector, and almost 8,000 are in manufacturing, so the cost of fuel matters to businesses in Basingstoke, which is one of the top 10 areas of employment in the south-east of England. It makes a lot of money for the Government and they need to listen harder to businesses such as those in my constituency. Visiting and talking to people who are running businesses day in and day out in this economic climate might bring home the reality of some of the Government&#146;s policies.</p>

It is having to consider not just an annual price rise, but six-monthly price rises to try to keep on top of the fuel increases that it is having to endure. A delegation of local road hauliers recently came to the House and I was pleased to meet Mrs. Sandra Hunt and Miss Sarah Hunt. They are from L. Hunt and Sons Ltd, which has been in my constituency for more than 100 years, and they run a road haulage business out of Upton Grey that is enduring immense pressure as a result of the increases in fuel costs and that, again, has seen two price rises to its customers since April. Such price rises will be handed on not just to customers of road haulage companies but to their customers in turn, fuelling more of the inflation that we have seen in recent weeks and months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="80716-0020.htm_para2"><a name="080716101000068">It is the Government&#146;s failure to grasp the scale of the problem that concerns businesses most, and perhaps in her closing remarks the Exchequer Secretary could show that she has been listening to the concerns of businesses and families today by showing that she will consider some of the practical measures that have been put forward by my hon. Friends. The country really needs certainty and fairness when it comes to the future in this area. We have the highest diesel costs in the EU, and that is a result of the level of taxation, and that has been so for more than a decade now. Particularly concerning is the fact that the gap between the UK and other EU countries has increased markedly since the late 1990s. The UK duty rate has been increasing much faster than elsewhere and that is of particular concern.</p>

When fuel prices rise, we do not want to see the instability that the current situation is creating. The stabiliser could provide just the sort of solution that could help businesses to have a more stable and certain future. We cannot continue to lurch from one tax crisis to another, whether it is the 10p tax rate today or delaying a 2p tax rise for six months. As my hon. Friend said, this is simply no way to run our economy. I urge the Chancellor and his right hon. and hon. Friends to look more carefully at the fair fuel stabiliser as a way of providing the real long-term help that businesses in Basingstoke and throughout the country really need.</p>

Treasury comes before the House and is unable to answer the simple question of by how much the pump price has gone up since the Budget as a result of the tax increases that the Government have imposed, or have allowed to be imposed by market movements, because some of the tax is ad valorem and some is fixed. We have a Chief Secretary who either does not know or will not tell us that very simple point of great interest to our constituents.</p>

The Government had been threatening us with that rise for so many weeks and months, despite all the evidence that they were collecting far more tax than they were planning for in the Budget forecast, and all the evidence of the damage that petrol prices were doing to our constituents around the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="80716-0020.htm_para5"><a name="080716101000072">It is surely not beyond the wit of the Prime Minister to find a Chief Secretary who knows how to do a few sums, and understands that she is paid a good salary to come to the House and tell us about the cost consequences of the Government&#146;s proposals. We would like to know how much extra revenue the Government are already getting from the windfall on North sea oil taxes as a result of the rise in the oil price, and from the windfall at the pumps that we have been describing.</p>

We have at last gleaned from the Treasury&#151;it has confirmed&#151;that it did its forecasts at $84 a barrel. The price today is $139 a barrel, so we can all see that there must have been a huge increase in the tax that they have claimed. We should then ask who is having to pay all the additional tax that the Government are allowing to be imposed, or have deliberately imposed through their own positive decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="80716-0020.htm_para7"><a name="080716101000074">We are back to the new Labour/old Labour story. The party seems to believe that only the rich should be allowed to drive, because the tax will bear disproportionately on those with older cars and lower incomes. We see much evidence around the country that families on low incomes in rural areas, or with work or school-run patterns that cannot be met by public transport, are under enormous pressure. Such families are in genuine fear of going to the filling station and filling up. They think about which other journeys they can cut out, or how they can adjust their lives in some way to try to deal with the weekly hit of an enormous fuel bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="80716-0020.htm_para8"><a name="080716101000075">It is those on the lowest incomes who will have to sacrifice journeys or sacrifice the car. People on high incomes such as ministerial incomes and better&#151;the lawyers and consultants whom the Government hire&#151;will not find the situation that difficult. It may be slightly tricky for them, because they may have to cancel the extra glass of champagne, but it is not the end of the world. However, there are so many people for whom this means digging deep into their limited family budget, and being really afraid of what their Government are doing to them.</p>

It may be more. It certainly is if North sea taxation is added; if we factored in the idea that the petrol we get at the pump is pumped via the North sea through a British refinery, the tax would be even higher. However, we can definitely conclude&#151;and the Exchequer Secretary will have to agree&#151;that most of the money collected by the oil companies at the pump goes to the Chancellor. We can agree that the amounts are massively higher than was forecast in the Budget, and than they were last year. We must conclude that when it comes to higher petrol prices, the Government are undoubtedly the main villain of the piece.</p>

How many times have the official Opposition had to make the case in this House for British hauliers? How many times have the hauliers had to block the streets and undertake democratic protest because their Government are deaf and do not understand the point? Driving the British haulage industry out of business is not a green policy but a policy of the madhouse, because it will substitute foreign hauliers for British hauliers. Foreign hauliers do not pay the same taxes to own and run their lorries. They will bunker abroad. They will fuel up in Calais or the nearest port of departure from the continent and try to drive back to the continent with an almost empty tank so that they can refuel in a jurisdiction where the fuel is cheaper.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman talks about the comparative costs of haulage in other European countries. Although he is right about fuel, he must factor in two other elements of the cost equation: first, that corporation taxes on the haulage companies are lower than in European countries; and secondly, that wage rates and suchlike are lower. Therefore, the overall cost of operation for companies in France, Holland and elsewhere is probably not substantially different from what it is here.</p>

a rude awakening at the polls. It will be yet another example of their not understanding what is going on and not speaking up for the people in this trouble.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80716-0020.htm_para11"><a name="080716101000082">The Chief Secretary to the Treasury and the other senior politicians in the Government seem to think that all this is a silly political game about black holes in public finances. I hope that I have illustrated that there is no black hole in this area of the accounts. There is a massive increase in revenue, and we are asking the Government to give a little bit of it away while oil prices are high, and at the same time have a stabiliser so that if the oil price plunges the Government will not be short of revenue, as they would otherwise be. Ministers do not even seem to be able to work out that if one charges an activity at 60 per cent. or more, and charges other activities at 40 per cent. or so, one will have more revenue if there is a rise in the price of the 60 per cent. tax item and less revenue if it falls. Anyone else can see that that must be true, because it is being taxed so much more highly than the other activity that it may be displacing to some extent when the price rises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80716-0020.htm_para12"><a name="080716101000083">The Government must learn how to do the sums. They must understand that if they gave a bit away now, it would do them a lot of political good, help the British economy, and do a little to ease the phenomenal squeeze that they have decided to place on the British consumer and the average voter out there. At the same time, by adopting the Conservative proposal, they could have some kind of insurance against the possibility that there is speculative money as well as underlying demand in the oil market, and that the price will come down. It is a very unusual market that always goes up, and it would be foolish of the Government to plan all their Budget assumptions on the basis that the price of oil will always go up now that it has reached about $140 a barrel; indeed, it has been a bit higher than that in recent trading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80716-0020.htm_para13"><a name="080716101000084">The black hole is the Government&#146;s black hole. If we are engaged in a debate about black holes, as the Chief Secretary says that we are, we would like to know exactly how much Northern Rock has cost them&#151; &#163;5.3 billion so far, and rising. We would like to know how much all these tacky packages to try to win votes in by-elections have cost them. They are probably already overrunning by &#163;10 billion, yet they have the gall to criticise the Opposition for coming forward with a very modest proposal that would make a small reduction in the part of the tax budget that is rising so colossally because of how the Government have set it up. Now that the Government have at last realised, long after everybody else, that they cannot go on with a 2p rise in the autumn, it is important that they should think again and take something off the already over-burdensome high taxes at the pump.</p>

The inflation is occurring in the areas where the Government meddle most: in energy prices, where they have not allowed the permits to go ahead for an expansion of energy supply; in the oil products market, where they impose cripplingly high taxes and allow them to go up when the price is going up; and in food markets, where we have rigged prices thanks to the common agricultural policy and the Government&#146;s failure to get proper reform from our partners.

to do themselves, as well as the country, a favour by seeing common sense and the need to cut those petrol prices immediately. That would reduce the retail prices index in the subsequent figures, which would help with other Government spending pressures because so much Government spending is linked to the RPI. Above all, it would help my constituents and the Minister&#146;s constituents, who have had it beyond belief with these price rises, and blame the Government for the petrol price rises because so much of that money is tax.</p>

 I enjoyed the maiden speech of the hon. Member for Henley (John Howell). He is in the extraordinary position of having been a candidate with one policy and making his maiden speech with another. However, he has the advantage over all his Tory colleagues, in that the next time we vote on a fuel duty regulator, modulator or stabiliser, he can vote for it without the embarrassment of having not done so in the past. Having got that out of the way, I can say to the hon. Members for Putney (Justine Greening) and for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) that they have done the right thing. They have fully considered the issues that affect 23 million motorists, the haulage sector and many others. They have clearly reached their own conclusions in their own time and developed a model for how their plan will work. However, it is fundamentally the same idea as many hon. Members have had.</p>

Many support that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80716-0020.htm_para16"><a name="080716101000088">Two weeks ago, when I tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill, I provided the context, so I will speak for only a few minutes; I want other hon. Members to be able to contribute to the debate. From 2005, when petrol was 86p a litre, the price has increased to an average of &#163;1.32 a litre&#151;&#163;6 a gallon. In 2005 Brent crude had reached $60 a barrel&#151;almost a 20 per cent. increase on the forecast for that year. Two weeks ago it was $132 a barrel, and yesterday the price reached $145 a barrel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80716-0020.htm_para17"><a name="080716101000089">I have also consistently said that the rises that we have experienced are inflationary. Yesterday the inflation figures were published, showing, at 3.8 per cent., a half point rise to almost double the Government&#146;s target. Fuel and energy prices have risen by 24 per cent. in the past year. We are considering essential items, and for those on low incomes and others, such as the haulage sector, real inflation far exceeds the Government&#146;s official figures.</p>

Almost half of that rise&#151;14p&#151;happened between mid-April and mid-June, according to the AA. That is precisely the sort of spike that a regulator, modulator or stabiliser is designed to smooth out. Only in Norway, with an average price of 137p a litre, is diesel dearer than in the UK.

that means that it costs &#163;30 more a month to run one diesel car, or &#163;46 more a month for a two-car family with petrol cars. People will need to earn nearly an extra &#163;1,000 a year to pay for the increase in fuel that a two-car family will experience.</p>

Of course, it is welcome&#151;many of us have called for it for some time. However, it should have happened months ago as prices began to spiral way above inflation and the Government&#146;s forecasts. That is why we need a regulator. The suspension should have been automatic, not based on any politician&#146;s whim&#151;and certainly not eight days before a by-election, although we in the Scottish National party claim credit for that.</p>

In particular, that would mean that the haulage sector would not be crucified, and that, as we heard in the earlier example, modest companies would not have to find &#163;60,000 net extra each year just to stand still.</p>

 As we have heard in this debate, the high price of fuel is having a severe effect on the economy throughout the country. However, it has a much more severe effect in remote rural areas than in urban areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80716-0020.htm_para23"><a name="080716101000096">In my constituency, the effects are felt particularly severely on the islands and on the Kintyre peninsula, because fuel there is sold at a much higher price than in urban areas. That means that people suffer from a triple whammy: they pay higher fuel prices; there are no public transport alternatives; and they need to drive longer distances. Let me cite an example: on a recent visit to the remoter parts of my constituency, I found that the price at the pumps in Campbeltown, at the end of the Kintyre peninsula, was 6p a litre higher than at Glasgow airport and that at Port Ellen on Islay, fuel was selling at 15p a litre higher. On the smaller islands, the difference is always much greater.</p>

accusation&#151;which can be dealt with through regulations, but from the way the market operates. In a small village, the number of pumps at the filling station and the turnover at each pump is less than one would find in an urban area. That means that the income required to cover costs is greater than that for urban filling stations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80716-0020.htm_para25"><a name="080716101000098">Another problem is that because remote filling stations are owner-operated, they are dependent on regional wholesalers for their fuel supplies, whereas urban filling stations usually have direct access to a supply of fuel without the need for the middle man of the wholesaler. Another problem that small filling stations face is finding the money for the fuel up front. Even a small island filling station will need to pay more than &#163;10,000 up front to fill the tank. That is a lot for a small business to find up front, which leads to interest charges, and therefore additional costs. For islands, there is the additional cost of the ferry fare for both the tanker and the driver, and of the driver&#146;s wages for the time that it takes to make the delivery and return to base. For smaller islands, that can mean two or three full days simply for one delivery. That all adds to cost.</p>

I was told that if it were operating in central Scotland, for example, there would be many fuel discount cards to choose from, with bulk-buying discounted rates. However, those rates do not apply in Argyll and Bute. All those costs add to the cost of both fuel at the pump and everything that is sold in the shops.</p>

We proposed a rural fuel duty discount, which operates in many other countries. Highlands and islands MPs recently held a constructive meeting with the Exchequer Secretary. She and other Treasury Ministers have certainly been sympathetic and have promised to examine the evidence. I have sent evidence to the Treasury and will soon send more. I urge the Government to examine this evidence very carefully and to produce a rural fuel duty discount scheme for islands and remote parts of the mainland before the high fuel prices work their way through to job losses.</p>

fuel. The Conservatives have proposed a fair fuel stabiliser, and businesses, green groups and the public will all have a chance to give us their thoughts during our consultation on this proposal over the coming months. However, we thought that it would be sensible to give Parliament the opportunity to consider our proposals as well. Unfortunately, the Government&#146;s attitude during this debate has been one not of positive engagement, but of relentless defeatism and, in my opinion, criticism for criticism&#146;s sake.</p>

Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) mentioned, the issues that we are discussing today are real ones. The cost of living&#151;particularly the cost of transport&#151;is one of the most serious issues facing families and many businesses in Britain right now. My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham, as well as my hon. Friend the Member for Henley, said that these are particularly pressing issues for families, and especially for businesses, which cannot necessarily change their business procedures to avoid the kind of fuel price rises that we have seen in recent months. In the past year, we have seen a rapid rise in the price of petrol at the pumps. In September last year, a litre of petrol cost 95p; now, it is more than &#163;1.19. Petrol price inflation in the UK is almost the highest in Europe, running at 17 per cent. In fact, it is second only to that of Estonia.</p>

The current rate of price inflation would have meant an increase of &#163;185 a year in household fuel bills by the end of this year, which would put the average family&#146;s expenditure on fuel at more than &#163;1,000 a year. As the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) pointed out, this is a real problem for businesses and families. It is a serious burden for both those groups, and the Government would have been wise to take it seriously, but they have not done so. It is a burden that the Government could do something about, but they will not. Other hon. Members have looked for ways to tackle these issues. We have heard the ideas of the hon. Members for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) and for Dundee, East. However, when tasked with helping people at a time of real and urgent need, the Government have offered nothing more than excuses and token gestures, when they really needed to take responsibility and offer real solutions.</p>

We&#146;re just going to keep things as bad as they already are, and you should be grateful for that.&#148; Frankly, that is typical of the Government&#146;s attitude so far. They are showing a shocking unwillingness to tackle the issue, saying, &#147;Don&#146;t blame us. What can we do?&#148; The line coming from the Government&#151;we heard it again today&#151;is that rising fuel prices are to do with the global price of oil and are therefore beyond the Government&#146;s control. When they finally take decisions on fuel duty, instead of introducing substantive policies to tackle the issue in the longer term, they give us policy by press release and policy by parliamentary question and answer. We all know we simply cannot go on running the public finances in that way. Everyone knows the bottom line: this is  <br>

We believe that they will help families by stabilising their finances and we believe that they will help the public finances by helping to insulate them from oil price rises. We also think that they will have a welcome dampening effect on inflation. That has to be better than the sort of &#147;nudge and wink&#148; policy that we have had from Ministers today, as there is a sense that the Government&#146;s approach is unsustainable.</p>

 Will the hon. Lady explain how long the gaps will be between now and the adjustments taking place? If they are too long&#151;six months was mentioned&#151;the Chancellor will effectively decide, and if they are too short, the proposals will have what has been described as a yo-yo effect.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises a fair point. The reason for going through a consultation process is to ensure that, unlike with the Government&#146;s new policies on capital gains tax, non-doms and the 10p tax rate, we get things right first time. We have learned from the Government&#146;s mistakes, even if they have not.</p>

 Actually, it sounds like a response from a Treasury Minister who has no realistic alternative of her own. The reality is that the current situation requires action, not inaction, and it requires leadership rather than dithering. We have proposed this fair fuel stabiliser as a solution and we want to get it right first time. I would have hoped and expected that Government Ministers approached potential solutions to the impact of fuel prices on families with an open mind. Instead, when new ideas have been suggested, as today, they have simply been dismissed out of hand. In fact, Ministers have criticised other people&#146;s suggestions while offering no ideas of their own. They are struggling along on a  <br>

day-by-day, by-election-after-by-election basis, desperately trying to provide the illusion of control. Frankly, it would be much better for families if they simply recognised a good idea when they have one put in front of them. They have done that on inheritance tax, capital gains tax and the 10p tax rate, so why not on road tax as well? Instead, they are putting their own political priorities ahead of what is right for the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para8"><a name="080716101000114">I realise that no Government like to appear out of touch or out of their depth, but I have to tell Ministers that the public know that that is exactly what is happening. We have already reached that point with the current ministerial team running the country. The public can see that the Treasury is failing to cope with the challenges they have to face every single day. They need Ministers to rise above political posturing and tackle the problem. Businesses are going under; families are facing sky-rocketing fuel bills; and oil price fluctuations are destabilising the wider economy. We offer a solution that would be good for the Government, good for the economy and, most important of all, good for the people of this country who are struggling to cope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para9"><a name="080716101000115">I shall finish my contribution to this debate on fuel costs with a motoring analogy. We find ourselves with a Government and Ministers with so little direction that we feel inclined to give them a political sat-nav, but the problem is that they would not be able to put any political destination into it: half the Labour party would be shouting, &#147;Left, left!&#148; while the other half would be shouting, &#147;Right, right!&#148;, with no clue where to go next.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para10"><a name="080716101000116">Yet again today, we saw Labour MPs&#151;self-proclaimed representatives of low-income families&#151;justifying the Government&#146;s plan to keep high taxes on those very same families and crowing about their Government not going ahead with tax rises, as if that were some sort of achievement or success. On three Wednesdays running, I have watched them vote against relieving the financial burden on those families. Those constituents and families will ask themselves why MPs have taken no action on road tax, no action on the cost of living and no action today on fuel duty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para11"><a name="080716101000117">People will realise the answer to those problems: it is to get themselves a fresh Government with some fresh ideas who are willing to take a fresh approach to tackling the problems that our constituents face today and that need sorting out sooner rather than later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para13"><a name="080716101000120">The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) made an interesting point when he asked why oil revenues should be pooled separately from other UK revenues. Why, uniquely, should oil revenues be pooled? The Conservative party needs to think about that. There is also the proposed green taxes pool, which would go into the family fund. One wonders where the Conservatives would collect their taxes to pay for general public expenditure. If they carry on like this, by the time we get to the next election they will have hypothecated the lot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para14"><a name="080716101000121">We listened to the advocacy of some of those who have been talking about stabilisers, regulators, moderators and various other words from the thesaurus in relation to fuel balancing plans. My hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), who also suggested that approach, at least said that there needs to be a package of measures for fairer treatment for motorists&#151;we would agree with that&#151;but that we need to consider the totality of revenues, rather than particular pieces of revenue in isolation. We should all bear that in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para15"><a name="080716101000122">My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths) spent some time quite accurately pointing out the many different faces of Conservative environmental policy, depending on where one looks and which audiences the Conservatives happen to be addressing at the time. Again, that is something we should be well aware of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para16"><a name="080716101000123">The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie), who is something of a pioneer in this respect, must be sat back enjoying the interest that his proposals are attracting and the ripples that they are causing across all the Opposition Benches. I congratulate him on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para17"><a name="080716101000124">The background to the debate is the rapid rises in petrol prices over recent weeks and months. Those rises have been caused by global forces, which have led to rising world oil prices. They are putting real pressure on many businesses and on many families&#146; finances. The Government have recognised that, which is why my right hon. Friend the Chancellor deferred the planned 2p per litre fuel duty increase in April&#146;s Budget. It is why he decided to postpone the rise planned for October this year, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para18"><a name="080716101000125">By contrast, as my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary demonstrated in her opening remarks, the Opposition have suggested a policy that would be a fuel duty destabiliser. It would achieve the very opposite of the things that they claim for it. Fuel duty is not the cause of the rapid petrol price rises of the past few months. Duty rates have not changed since October last year, yet fuel prices have risen 20 per cent., driven up by the near-doubling of the world oil price in the last year to record highs of more than $145 a barrel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para19"><a name="080716101000126">It is worth reminding the House of our record as a Government. Since 1999, we have abolished the Tory fuel duty escalator. Fuel duty rates have gone up only three times, and are now 17 per cent. lower, taking account of inflation, than in 1999. Instead of the current level of 50.35p, if fuel duty had gone up in line with inflation it would now be 61p a litre. If the previous Conservative Government&#146;s policy of a fuel duty escalator had been continued, the tax on fuel would now be 79p a litre, which is nearly 30p a litre more than the current level. Therefore, we need take no lessons from the  <br>

Conservative party about helping ordinary working people and businesses to cope with challenging economic circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para20"><a name="080716101000127">It was the last Conservative Prime Minister, when he was Chancellor, who said that if it is not hurting, it is not working. But we know that it is the legitimate role of Government to help people through turbulent economic times, and not just abandon them to market forces. It was the Leader of the Opposition, not any member of this Government, who recently made a speech blaming the poor and obese for their predicament, and denying that the state should have a legitimate role in helping them to overcome their problems. We, however, will continue to help people through challenging economic times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para21"><a name="080716101000128">That brings me on to the policy proposals outlined recently by the Conservative party for a fuel duty destabiliser. My right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary has dealt in some detail with that suggestion. She rightly pointed out that the Tory fuel duty destabiliser relies on redistributing a fantasy tax windfall&#151;it simply does not exist, and cannot be redistributed to motorists or anyone else. The Tories&#146; fuel duty destabiliser assumes an ability to forecast and define a &#147;fair oil price&#148;&#151;the phrase that they use&#151;when the reality is that any such figure would be completely arbitrary. The Tories&#146; fuel duty destabiliser would cost &#163;2 billion to &#163;3 billion a year if duty rates were cut by 5p a litre as they suggest. There is no indication of where the money would come from.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para22"><a name="080716101000129">There is no guarantee, however, that cuts in fuel duty would translate into lower prices at the pump&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para23"><a name="080716101000132">Retailers would be likely to stop smoothing the impact of oil prices feeding through to petrol prices, as they tend to do at the moment. As well as being based on a non-existent windfall, the Opposition&#146;s proposal would make it incredibly difficult to forecast the public finances, given the notorious volatility of the world oil price.</p>

<p><a name="st_o502"><a name="080716101000133"><a name="80716-0021.htm_spnew6"><a name="080716101000782"><b>Justine Greening:</b>
 On the Government&#146;s policy, how much will the 2p delayed duty rise cost the Exchequer?</p>

<p><a name="st_o503"><a name="080716101000134"><a name="80716-0021.htm_spnew7"><a name="080716101000783"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>
 The Red Book figures demonstrate that the cost is &#163;550 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para24"><a name="080716101000135">Since the beginning of this year, the oil price has varied between $146 and $86 a barrel. In one day alone, it increased by more than $10. Assuming that the Opposition&#146;s proposal would involve changing the fuel duty rate by 1p a litre for every $6, as they said, we would have had to change the fuel duty 25 times since the Budget 18 weeks ago. That is a ridiculous policy. Nor is there any guarantee that the duty reductions would be passed on in full to consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80716-0021.htm_para25"><a name="080716101000136">Now that the Tories have their press release out, they have many questions to answer about their fuel duty destabiliser. Is it a pledge? Is it policy or just warm words? I notice that they are consulting on it. Does that mean that they will quietly drop it when they hope no one is looking, or can we add another &#163;2 billion to &#163;3 billion to the black hole in their finances? If it is policy, why on earth did they not vote for new clause 4 in the Finance Bill on 15 May?</p>

 Lords amendment No. 1 is designed largely with the avoidance of doubt in mind. We wish to prevent unnecessary legal argument arising about the effect of the emergency legislation that will come into force on Royal Assent. The amendment puts beyond doubt that, even following the abolition of the common law in relation to such applications, the identity of witnesses can be withheld from the defence before and during the making of an application for a witness anonymity order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80716-0022.htm_para7"><a name="080716101000674">The amendment therefore makes it clear in the Bill that the party making the application is under no obligation to disclose the real identity of a witness to other parties at the application stage, with a saving for the disclosure of a defence witness&#146;s real identity to the prosecutor. In addition, where it is proposed that an order should be made, the amendment makes it clear that the identity of witnesses can be protected in the proceedings before the application is made, for example, during committal proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80716-0022.htm_para8"><a name="080716101000675">Lords amendment No. 1 also addresses a question raised by amendments tabled in the other place. The issue is whether the court must always know the identity of the witness. In the vast majority of cases, it will do so, but very occasionally there may be national security-related cases where even the court will not know, and will not want to know, the identity of a witness. For that reason, the amendment does not include an absolute requirement to disclose the identity of the witness to the court. Rather, it grants the court a power to waive the disclosure to the court of the real identity of a witness on a case-by-case basis. We envisage that the real identity of a witness will be disclosed to the court in the vast majority of cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="80716-0022.htm_para9"><a name="080716101000676">Finally, Lords amendment No. 2 makes it clear that the power of the criminal procedure rule committee to set out further procedures relating to witness anonymity in criminal procedure rules is unaffected. It is likely that the rule committee will want to make specific rules, as soon as possible, to set out the mechanics of applications for these orders. Indeed, the committee is meeting on Friday, when it will be invited to discuss this very matter.</p>

 I shall begin by dealing with Lords amendment No. 2, in respect of which I simply ask the Minister to confirm that the rules bringing this procedure into effect will be made as quickly as possible. She mentioned that the committee will be sitting fairly soon. It is important, however, that despite the emergency nature of this legislation, the practitioners and courts see the rules as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="80716-0022.htm_para10"><a name="080716101000678">Amendment No. 1 provides us with an object lesson of what happens when one legislates without proper care and with a great deal of speed but without much consideration. Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, the Minister in the other place, spent about four of the five minutes of his speech apologising when he explained why the amendment was introduced at the last moment. He was right to do so. I notice that the Minister did not find it convenient to do it here, but I am sure that in the back of her mind was the need to apologise to this House for that late amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="80716-0022.htm_para11"><a name="080716101000679">We do not want to press the matter to a Division, but we think that a degree of clarification is required at this late stage. First, what effect does the late Government amendment have on the prosecution&#146;s duty to give full disclosure in a criminal case? It is not clear from what the Minister said how or whether that duty is affected. Secondly, will she explain precisely what has been abolished in relation to the common law as it was thought to be until the House of Lords judgment on the Davis case?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80716-0022.htm_para12"><a name="080716101000680">Clause 1(2) states:</p>
<a name="80716-0022.htm_brev2"><a name="080716101000722"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The common law rules relating to the power of a court to make an order for securing that the identity of a witness in criminal proceedings is withheld from the defendant (or, on a defence application, from other defendants) are abolished.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="80716-0022.htm_para13"><a name="080716101000681">Yet clause 5(2), which deals with relevant considerations that have to be taken into account before a court is satisfied that the conditions for making an order have been fulfilled, states in paragraph (a) that those considerations include</p>
<a name="80716-0022.htm_brev3"><a name="080716101000723"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the general right of a defendant in criminal proceedings to know the identity of a witness in the proceedings&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="80716-0022.htm_para14"><a name="080716101000682">Of course, that takes us back to the common law position. The Government need to explain, even at this late hour, what they intend by clause 1(2). Having said all that, I trust that the Minister is looking forward to her happy hols.</p>

<p><a name="st_o509"><a name="080716101000683"><a name="80716-0022.htm_spnew3"><a name="080716101001308"><b>David Howarth (Cambridge) (LD):</b>
 On amendment No. 2, I have nothing to add to what the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) just said. However, I have a point to make and a question to ask about amendment No. 1. When we debated amendment No. 35 to clause 3(2) last week it became very clear that that clause was trying to cover too many different possible cases with too few rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="80716-0022.htm_para15"><a name="080716101000684">I welcome the fact that the new version of clause 3(2) provides more detailed provisions. I particularly welcome the addition of the obligation to disclose the identity of the proposed anonymous witness to the court. That is an important improvement. I also welcome the fact that the new version pays more attention to the procedure for making those orders. I am still very concerned about the lack of equal treatment between anonymous witnesses proposed by the defence and those proposed by the prosecution. Under the new version of clause 3(2), when the defence applies for a witness anonymity order,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="16 July 2008">

<notus-date day="16" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>16 July 2008 : Column 370</b><br>
it still has to disclose the identity of that witness not only to the court but to the prosecution. That is not the case the other way around.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="80716-0022.htm_para16"><a name="080716101000685">When we debated the matter last week, the argument was made that the prosecution needed to know the identity of the witness in order to fulfil its duties, which were also mentioned by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, of disclosure to other defendants in multiple defendant cases. The problem with that is that it is precisely in those cases that everyone is agreed that we do not want material that identifies the witness to go to the other defendants as it is usually the criminal associates of the other defendants who cause the trouble and the fear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80716-0022.htm_para17"><a name="080716101000686">In fact, the new version of clause 3(2) specifically states that there is no obligation on the defence to disclose to the other defendants material that might tend to identify. The problem is that if there is an obligation on the prosecution to disclose and the prosecution receives information that might tend to identify the witness, the prosecution might find itself obliged under the disclosure rules to disclose that information to the other defendants. The effect of that would be that what the Bill is attempting to ban directly might occur indirectly. I cannot find anything in the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 that might prevent that, so there is a serious problem with how the Bill is worded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="80716-0022.htm_para18"><a name="080716101000687">I still have a more fundamental problem with the imbalance between prosecution and defence. There is still a human rights problem, because article 6.3(d) of the European convention on human rights requires witnesses for the defence to be examined on the same basis as those for the prosecution. It was argued last week that the difference between the two sides is that the prosecution would know the previous convictions of a proposed witness and would put them to the court when the court was deciding whether to make an order. It was said that the same would not apply to the defence because it would not necessarily know the true picture of the defence witness&#146;s antecedents, and the Lord Chancellor made the point that people are not often entirely honest about previous convictions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80716-0022.htm_para19"><a name="080716101000688">The problem with that is that I am not entirely sure that the prosecution always puts a witness&#146;s previous convictions to the court&#151;at least not under the previous, rather informal procedure. Secondly, when the court is faced with a decision about whether to grant an order, it knows that it will not have the same information about a defence witness as it does about a prosecution witness. Even if it does not know that, the court can be reminded by the prosecution that it does not have the same information that is available for a prosecution witness. The court can take that into account when deciding whether to grant an order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80716-0022.htm_para20"><a name="080716101000689">In any case, if the defence thinks that it might not get an order because it is not in the same position with regard to a witness&#146;s previous convictions, it can supply those previous convictions itself. It is an oddity of the Criminal Records Bureau legislation that people cannot undertake a CRB check on themselves, but that they can get around that by submitting a data protection request to the police national computer. It seems to me that it should be up to the defence to decide whether it wants that to happen.</p>

 I accept that, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but my point was that a different aspect of the independent counsel proposal was raised twice&#151;first in connection with this amendment and specifically because it offered an alternative way of dealing with this problem, and then later by itself. I still think that it is relevant to say that I was disappointed by what happened in the other place, where the Conservative party was slightly feeble.</p>

 Indeed, but I hope to be able to assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that what he suggests is not what is happening. The legislation before us, and any refinement of it in the forthcoming Bill, is about dealing with the rules for anonymity orders, for which a Judicial Committee of the House of Lords said that there was no common-law power. There will not be two sets of rules running in parallel. The legislation sets out the statutory rules for granting an anonymity order. I hope that that clarifies the matter.</p>

Member for Cambridge, because he made an important point to which the hon. and learned Member for Harborough also alluded. Where the defendant has told the prosecutor of the witness&#146;s real identity for the purpose of making an application for a witness anonymity order under the Bill, the prosecutor will have to consider whether that material is potentially disclosable under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, which the hon. Member for Cambridge has clearly read this afternoon. Under section 3(6) of that Act, the prosecutor already has the power to make an application to the court to withhold such material if it is not in the public interest to disclose it. In practice, we expect that the courts will deal with any prosecutor&#146;s duty when it makes the determination in respect of the defendant&#146;s application for the witness anonymity order. In practice, over the next few months, we will be in a position to see how that works, and no doubt we will be able to take any action that needs to be taken in the light of that experience when we reconsider the legislation in proceedings on the Law Reform, Victims and Witnesses Bill. I think that I have dealt with the points raised, and I reiterate the fact that we support the Lords amendments.</p>

It was important to complete proceedings on the Bill as quickly as possible.

 It is less than a year since the Government made it a statutory requirement for sellers of domestic properties to provide and pay for, at their own expense, home information packs. It is now clear that the Government have introduced HIPs without proper preparation of the process that is to be followed, they are of questionable value to those who buy a home, they are an additional expense to those who are selling a home, particularly in what is frequently referred to as a turbulent housing market, they do not speed up the process of conveyancing, and the energy efficiency component is neither reliable nor worth the money that is spent on it. Despite the fact that HIPs were subject to frequent debate in the House and also subject to many U-turns on the part of the Government in terms of how they would or would not introduce them, none the less the Minister at the time, the right hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), now the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, repeatedly espoused them as valuable, often likening the process to buying a fridge or identifying the need to change the light bulbs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="80716-0023.htm_para19"><a name="080716105000025">In less than a year since the full introduction of HIPs, we have seen several reports from independent bodies that have identified the real weakness in the system. I refer first to the Leeds Legal report by professional lawyers in Leeds, which came out only this month. It states:</p>
<a name="80716-0023.htm_brev6"><a name="080716105000080"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Fifty-seven per cent. of people questioned in the national research for Leeds Legal, an alliance of the city&#146;s major law firms, said the time has come to ditch the packs, introduced by the Government last August in a bid to simplify and speed-up the home buying process.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="80716-0023.htm_para20"><a name="080716105000026">Mr. Stephen Pickard, head of residential property at law firm Lupton Fawcett and a Leeds Legal spokesperson, said:</p>
<a name="80716-0023.htm_brev7"><a name="080716105000081"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our finding that a clear majority of people now want Hips abolished will come as an eye-opener to many and a blow to the Government.</p>
</ul><a name="80716-0023.htm_brev8"><a name="080716105000082"><ul><p class="tabletext">It will be no surprise to many professionals, however. Most of the buyers I&#146;ve acted for since Hips were introduced have regarded the content of the packs as so unreliable they&#146;ve commissioned providers like me to supply the information independently.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="80716-0023.htm_para21"><a name="080716105000027">It sounds as though people are so disenchanted with HIPs that they are paying twice. Mr. Pickard goes on:</p>
<a name="80716-0023.htm_brev9"><a name="080716105000083"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Given the current credit crunch, most buyers are far more concerned about securing funds for their purchases than they are about receiving Hips, which they seem to regard as a complete waste of time and money.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="80716-0023.htm_para22"><a name="080716105000028">Furthermore, it is not just the sellers who have to part with money&#151;and I have had reports of this fact, and personal experience of it. If someone wants to have a look at a HIP for a property, even one for which they have made an offer, they can look at it online. However, if they want to receive a hard copy, costs are involved and there is also a cost to the purchaser. I should like the Minister to look into that issue particularly, because it seems that money is being paid out at both ends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="80716-0023.htm_para32"><a name="080716105000038">I have raised this issue on the Floor of the House before. On 18 December, during the Christmas Adjournment debate, I described the case of Mr. Dyke of Dunkeswell, about which I have had correspondence with the Minister. The problem that Mr. Dyke identified&#151;I have visited his home, so I am very familiar with it&#151;is typical of what must apply not only in my Devon constituency but around the country. When the Government introduced the process for assessing properties, particularly the energy performance certificate, they used a form of matrix that clearly was trialled only on modern properties. The tick-box procedures that the assessors go through mean that they have great difficulty in accurately identifying the merits of the energy efficiency of older houses, of which we have a great many in Devon. Very old houses are added to over the years and the centuries, and improvements are made to them. If people are to be expected to pay out of their own money for such a certificate, they will expect, whatever the construction or age of the property, that the people coming to carry out the process are able to do it competently and professionally. When I tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister&#146;s predecessor, I received some disturbing answers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="80716-0023.htm_para33"><a name="080716105000039">One of my concerns as regards older buildings is the way in which cob walls are assessed. We have a lot of those in Devon&#151;they are very thick walls that have good insulating properties. Another material that has been used to construct many Devon properties is wattle and daub&#151;although it is not used nowadays. This flags up the fact that the major building regulations were last changed in the 1960s, when there was a big push to reform them. However, the thinking behind the Government&#146;s home information packs seems to be that properties built since 1960 are typical of all properties that are assessed. There are a lot of anomalies. For example, people with solid-fuel Agas or wood burners, which are deemed to be carbon-neutral, are not even given a credit rating on their energy assessment for those types of heaters and cookers. For some of the older properties, there is no proper consideration of the amount of double glazing, which I would have thought pretty fundamental when assessing their energy efficiency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="80716-0023.htm_para34"><a name="080716105000040">The SAP&#151;standard assessment procedure&#151;is the Government&#146;s approved procedure for calculating an energy rating. It is based only on modern houses. The process for a reduced data SAP, which many of my constituents in older properties have come across, is so flawed that they, like Mr. Dyke, have had to take professional advice. He said that he had a professional benchmark, because in 1998 a properly approved, qualified architect had rated his property with a SAP of 60. When he had the HIP done to sell the property, the SAP was reduced to 44. He therefore started to ask a lot of questions and to negotiate with the powers that be, especially the national home energy rating people, because he wanted to identify the problem and discover why the SAP was lower now, albeit with reduced data, than it was when an architect examined the property.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="80716-0023.htm_para35"><a name="080716105000041">There is a long list of items that the reduced SAPs cannot take into account because of the procedure that the Government have introduced and which the assessors have to implement. I will not go through the whole list  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="80716-0024.htm_para1"><a name="080716105000047">The point that I want to make strongly to the Under-Secretary is that what applies to Mr. Dyke&#146;s property surely must apply to thousands of other older homes throughout the country. The lady with the solar panels that were not noticed asked whether I could bring the matter to the attention of the relevant authorities, because trading standards should have an interest in it. That is a pertinent point. If the Government are forcing people to pay money not only for a flawed process but for the unsatisfactory standards applied by those who undertake it, and those people consequently suffer material loss, I hope that every trading standards department in the country will take an interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80716-0024.htm_para3"><a name="080716105000049">I tabled written questions on this subject, and I was horrified by, for example, the fact that&#151;unless the Under-Secretary tells me differently&#151;the Government have no plan for people who have paid for the energy performance certificate to receive a copy, so that they can identify the problems early.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) on securing this debate. I know that she takes a close interest in home information packs and energy performance certificates. She has mentioned her contributions to debates in the House on the subject, and I have seen recent written parliamentary questions to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing that demonstrate her commitment to her constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="80716-0024.htm_para5"><a name="080716105000052">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving me the opportunity to deal with her concerns tonight. I understand from her contribution that she is concerned with three broad aspects of HIPs and EPCs: the value of HIPs and the policy framework; buyers not being interested in HIPs; and&#151;the key part of her contribution&#151;poor quality HIPs, HIP providers and EPCs. Let me take each of those in turn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="80716-0024.htm_para6"><a name="080716105000053">On the value of HIPs, I am not convinced&#151;in fact, quite the reverse&#151;that the current house buying and selling process has so far provided clear, transparent information for people who are undertaking probably their biggest financial transaction. It is not right, for example, that people in this country have to wait the longest time in Europe to buy or sell a house. The introduction of HIPs has helped to start to address those problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="80716-0024.htm_para7"><a name="080716105000054">Hon. Members in all parts of the House recognise that the EPC can play a vital role in helping us to achieve our carbon emissions objectives, as well as helping consumers to save money on their fuel bills, which is something to which I shall return later in my contribution. It is vital that the EPC provides information of genuine value and is appropriate to the property being reported on. It is equally important that the people who produce the report are competent. Again, I shall come to that in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="80716-0024.htm_para8"><a name="080716105000055">I am sure that the hon. Lady will agree, however, that we are seeing value in HIPs. On average, there have been savings of around &#163;30 on property search costs, which in some areas have fallen by &#163;120 since the introduction of HIPs. Important information on energy efficiency is now being delivered to consumers as part of HIPs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="80716-0024.htm_para9"><a name="080716105000056">More than 750,000 HIPs have now been produced, with EPCs providing information to sellers and prospective buyers alike on measures to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. According to the Energy Saving Trust, consumers can save on average &#163;300 a year on their fuel bills if owners follow the improvements recommended by the EPC. Throughout the country, that could produce &#163;100 million of savings on energy bills.</p>

 But surely the report by the consortium of Leeds lawyers shows that the issue is not about reducing conveyancing costs, but about whether people feel that the HIP is a reliable substitute for the normal paperwork that would be involved in conveyancing a property. The fact of the matter is that it is not. If we are talking about a modern property that is still under an NHER 10-year guarantee, one can understand people not bothering too much about the HIP, which means that such transactions are therefore pretty straightforward. However, for all those pre-1960 properties, some of which will be hundreds of years old, the conveyancing is quite complex. If the lawyers are telling the Minister that people are not relying on HIPs, he should really take notice of that.</p>

 I will come on to that point, but let me turn to the second point that the hon. Lady made, which she touched on in her intervention, too, about buyers simply not being interested in HIPs. I disagree with her quite fundamentally about that. When consumers see HIPs, they see their benefits and they see real cost savings that help to improve the decision-making process for them. However, I think that there is a problem at the moment with estate agents not showing HIPs. We need to do more to encourage estate agents and others to show HIPs to home buyers and sellers, as well as encouraging consumers to ask for them when they are interested in a particular property. All the indications are that HIPs improve the home buying and selling process. Having said that, I take the hon. Lady&#146;s point that home buyers are not being shown the HIP at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="80716-0024.htm_para10"><a name="080716105000059">My officials are currently drafting correspondence to estate agent bodies, saying they should be more proactive in making buyers aware of the HIP and the EPC as early as possible. The correspondence will remind them of their statutory duties with regard to the timely provision of an HIP and an EPC. It will also point out that agents who fail to make an EPC available risk making the owner of the property liable to pay a financial penalty imposed by the local trading standards officer.</p>

 I will certainly look into the point that the hon. Lady raises. We are keen to make it as quick as possible for home buyers and sellers to access the relevant information, and one of the ways of doing that is through online and e-conveyancing. I suggest that, if an estate agent is charging a fee for a hard copy, there is nothing to stop buyers printing a copy at home, if they so choose and if that option is available to them. The whole point is to try to rationalise the costs as much as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="80716-0024.htm_para11"><a name="080716105000064">I want to move on to the central point of the hon.

important for consumers to have clear routes to complain and obtain redress when standards have not been as high as they should have been.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="80716-0024.htm_para12"><a name="080716105000065">Most HIP providers subscribe to the HIP code. The HIP code provides protection for home buyers, sellers, estate agents, conveyancers and mortgage lenders who rely on the information included in a HIP provided on residential property in England and Wales. It sets out minimum standards which HIP providers have to meet. As part of the code, there is a formal written complaints procedure for handling complaints in a fair and prompt manner. The complaints procedure promises that complaints will be acknowledged within five working days of receipt, and normally dealt with fully within four weeks. If the consumer remains unsatisfied, they have the right to refer the complaint to the independent property codes adjudication scheme. The HIP code states that all providers who subscribe will fully co-operate fully with the independent adjudicator and comply with any decision reached.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="80716-0024.htm_para13"><a name="080716105000066">In addition, all HIPs and their providers who comply with the code will display the HIP code logo prominently on their literature and on the HIP itself. It is also possible for consumers to check whether a specific HIP provider subscribes to the code by contacting the Property Codes Compliance Board. In this way, reassurance should be provided to home buyers and sellers regarding the quality of the product that they are using and the professionalism of the firm that is providing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="80716-0024.htm_para14"><a name="080716105000067">Let me move on to the key point. Now that HIPs and EPCs have been up and running for 12 months, we can look at certain difficulties that we have encountered, particularly in relation to non-standard buildings. As the hon. Lady suggested, buildings in this country span a period from the middle ages to the modern day. Given the wide range of ages, spanning perhaps 700 years, it is perhaps understandable that we have had some degree of difficulty in regard to the operation of EPCs and HIPs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="80716-0024.htm_para15"><a name="080716105000068">The software used to produce the EPC is called the reduced data standard assessment procedure&#151;RDSAP&#151;and it takes account of a wide range of features in a property, including its age and dimensions, the material used to construct it and whether there is cavity wall insulation, double glazing and so on. To keep the costs reasonable, the software has been developed to be simple enough to achieve consistency and to avoid requiring energy assessors to spend an unnecessarily long time on site. Since August 2007, something like 860,000 EPCs have been produced using this software, and the accuracy of the vast majority of these has achieved the agreed professional level.</p>

Lady would acknowledge that a balance must be struck between the time spent assessing a building, the associated costs of producing the HIP and the EPC, and ensuring that all appropriate features should be taken into account. As she mentioned, at present the software cannot take into account every possible feature in the insulation, the heating system controls and so on that a homeowner may have provided, and to input that at the start would have caused immense costs, making HIPs and EPCs uneconomic and counter-productive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="80716-0024.htm_para17"><a name="080716105000070">It is also important to point out that an EPC is designed to be a description of the energy performance of the building rather than a description of the building per se.

<a name="80716-0024.htm_brev1"><a name="080716105000097"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This issue has been recognised by my Department, and the software will be amended to include cob construction, although using the sandstone descriptor is not likely to impact the rating significantly.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="80716-0024.htm_para19"><a name="080716105000072">I hope that that reassures the hon. Lady. In addition, if an owner wants unusual features to be taken into account, a full SAP calculation can be undertaken, but I am sure that the hon. Lady would recognise that that would need much more time and a more highly qualified assessor, so it would be likely to come in at greater cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="80716-0024.htm_para20"><a name="080716105000073">In conclusion, I hope that I have reassured the hon. Lady in respect of the three points she made. She mentioned that she is unhappy with the performance of HIPs and EPCs. In the light of current economic difficulties and particularly the drying up of mortgage finance, I would suggest that the last thing required in the housing market is needless tinkering. In the current climate, the industry and consumers want as much certainty of information as possible. As regards escalating fuel bills, for example, which were caused by a trebling of oil prices on the world markets, the importance of information about energy performance has never been so timely. In such a turbulent time as we are experiencing, I believe that HIPs and EPCs are an important and stable part of rationalising the home buying and selling process.</p>
