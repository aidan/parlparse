<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60420-01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Jim Knight): </b> 
 Since      2001, Vital Villages has helped more than 5,000 communities gain access to more or higher standards of public services&#151;an agenda further supported by more than 270 quality parish and town councils. More than 230 towns received funding through the market towns initiative to support community-led regeneration.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60420-01_spnew0"><b> John Mann: </b> 
 The image of market towns is often that of the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker and, in particular, many solicitors doing business. However, there is another kind of market town: small towns that have been built up and surrounded by the coal industry over the past 100 years. Those market towns have particular problems in regenerating themselves. Will the Minister look at market towns such as Warsop to see whether beacon status could be conferred on them to assist with their regeneration?

 As I ever, I listen to my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) with care. I take note of his comments and will consider them in due course.

<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60420-01_spnew3"><b> Tony Baldry  (Banbury)</b> 
 (Con): Will the Minister explain to the House why his Department, rather than the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, is taking these initiatives forward? Will he also explain to the House how the initiatives are promulgated? How do parish councils, town councils and others know that the money is available to them? Rather than having all those various initiatives, which people have to know about, would it not be better if the Government simply increased the grant to local authorities in relation to council tax, rather than reducing the grant and obliging council tax to go up continually?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60420-01_spnew4"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 It is clearly appropriate that the Minister with responsibility for rural affairs should have some input into what is going on in rural communities. That is why the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is involved, as well as the ODPM. The hon. Gentleman will be pleased to hear that we have simplified the arrangements for Vital Villages and the market towns initiative, for example, by contributing all that money to the regional development agencies&#151;as a Department, we are now the third largest contributor to the regional development agencies&#151;so that they can make more localised decisions in the interests of rural communities.

 (Lab): I welcome the market towns initiative, which has gone down extremely well in Neston in my constituency. It can provide a vehicle to improve the centre of a town radically. What efforts is my hon. Friend making to liaise with other key Departments to ensure that there is a holistic approach, particularly with transport and other such key factors?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60420-01_spnew6"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and interested to hear about Neston; Swanage, in my constituency, is benefiting from market and coastal towns initiative funding. I regularly meet colleagues from other Departments, and in the next few weeks I am due to meet the Minister of State at the Department for Transport. I will have my hon. Friend&#039;s comments in mind.

 (Con): Does the Minister agree that one of the best bits of the Vital Villages funding was the regard given to local transport issues, and transport issues more widely? Does he further agree that one of the biggest problems in our villages today is the increasing clutter caused by traffic calming measures, street furniture of one sort or another, signs and signage? It is almost impossible to see where the village is because of the ghastly mess on the roads. How will the Minister seek to reduce that clutter now that he has cancelled the Vital Villages funding?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60420-01_spnew8"><b> Jim Knight: </b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>hon. Gentleman&#039;s party is now welcoming. As for the signs and the clutter, as he calls it, many villages are clamouring for traffic calming, and I am sure that there may be some such villages in North Wiltshire. However, the Department for Transport is concerned about the proliferation of signage and there is some work going on with highways authorities to consider how that can be simplified for the motorist, to make sure that there is not a confusion of signage causing a hazard on the roads.

 The target for implementing the Countryside and Rights of Way Act right of access in England by the end of 2005 has been met, enabling people to enjoy some of the finest landscape that the country has to offer.

 I thank my hon. Friend for that reply.

<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60420-01_spnew10"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 I can hear someone saying that there is a wonderful coastline in my constituency, and I cannot argue with that. Improving coastal access was a manifesto commitment.

 (Con): How many incidents of bovine tuberculosis were reported to her Department in the last 12 months. [63729]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60420-01_spmin2"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Mr. Ben Bradshaw): </b> 
 Some 3,653 new herd incidents were recorded in Great Britain in 2005. That was a 9.1 per cent. increase on 2004.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60420-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Jones: </b> 
 As the current bovine TB skin test is a rather blunt diagnostic tool with only a 60 to 70 per cent. degree of accuracy, when does the Minister anticipate that the working group that he established in September 2005 will be able to report on the increased use of the gamma interferon test?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60420-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The figures that the hon. Gentleman gives the House are not quite correct. The skin test&#039;s sensitivity, which is its identification of infected animals, is between 77 and 95 per cent. Its specificity, which is its identification of uninfected animals, is 99 per cent. The test is much better than he suggests, and it is recognised internationally, as it is in the EU. As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, we have set up a working group 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Apr 2006 : Column 210</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to look into rolling out the gamma interferon test, but that test could only ever be used as a supplementary test, although I agree that it has the potential to be helpful.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60420-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): With the number of cases of bovine TB continuing to rise, which is deeply worrying, will my hon. Friend assure me that no decision has been taken on how the Government intend to respond to their consultation, given that there is a clear need to examine alternatives, including vaccination and the idea of mineral deficiency? We must rely on science, not several of the ideas that are floating around.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60420-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I can give my hon. Friend the assurance that he wants. The consultation was important. We received tens of thousands of responses, so I do not think that anyone would think it reasonable to expect us to reach a decision within five weeks of the end of the consultation period, given the scientific uncertainty to which he alludes.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60420-01_spnew15"><b> Dr. William McCrea  (South Antrim)</b> 
 (DUP): Will the Minister tell the House whether herds that have had, or are suspected to have had, a tuberculosis outbreak in the past three years will be restricted from exporting live animals when the beef export ban is lifted in early May?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60420-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I will have to write to the hon. Gentleman with the exact answer to that question, but I think that I am right in saying that because our status is officially still TB-free, our export markets will not be affected.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60420-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Eric Martlew  (Carlisle)</b> 
 (Lab): With regard to the consultation, is the Minister aware that there is growing opposition among major landowners, such as the National Trust and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, to the possibility of a major cull of badgers, because they believe that the science does not justify any sort of cull whatever? Will he need legislation to be able to go on to such property to cull badgers if that is the final, and unfortunate, decision?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60420-01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I am on record as saying that I do not think that it is practicable to have any sort of culling system that involves enforcement when landowners do not want badgers to be culled on their land. That would not be a feasible option&#151;but my hon. Friend&#039;s point about landowners is absolutely right. One of the problems with getting widespread and intensive coverage for our badger culling trials is that a number of landowners do not want such culling to happen as a matter of principle, although that might not necessarily be the case in all areas. My hon. Friend is right to imply that if there is to be badger culling as part of our bovine TB policy, all the scientific evidence, which, as he rightly says, is uncertain, tends to suggest that it would need fairly widespread coverage over a very large area, which would be a challenge to achieve.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Apr 2006 : Column 211</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>about what they will do following the consultation on badger culling. Does he think that we should accept a level of TB in wildlife?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="60420-01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 As I have said before, and as the consultation document said, the international experience suggests that if we leave the reservoir in wildlife untouched it will prevent us from containing and eradicating bovine TB. We have made that perfectly clear, but we face a challenge in finalising a practicable cost-effective system of culling that is scientifically sustainable in the long term. As for timing, I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an exact answer, but we wish to proceed as quickly as possible, given the seriousness of the situation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="60420-01_spnew21"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): Is the Minister convinced that the new compensation scheme for affected cattle is an adequate reflection of farmers&#039; losses? A farming family in my constituency have put the alternative case to me very vigorously, as they say that there is a significant risk that beef and milk production&#151;the engine room of English agriculture&#151;will be seriously affected, and that some farmers will stop milk production altogether without adequate compensation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="60420-01_spnew22"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 It is early days, as the new compensation system has been operating for only a short time. I remind my hon. Friend that reports by the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office, as well as a number of independent reports, have      repeatedly found that there was serious overcompensation in the system, and the Government have a responsibility to defend taxpayers&#039; interests as well as to compensate farmers for the true value of the animals that are slaughtered.

 I refer the hon. Gentleman to the written statement given to the House yesterday.

<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="60420-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Lancaster: </b> 
 I wrote to the Minister on 4 April giving her notice that I wanted to raise the case of my constituent, Mr. Arthur Adams, who is typical of farmers across the country who have had to sell their grain early at a loss, whose rent was due last month, and who simply cannot afford to buy the chemicals that they desperately need now that spring is here. All of them have one thing common&#151;they still have not been paid. All that I want to know&#151;all that farmers across the land want to know&#151;is when they will be paid.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="60420-02_spnew1"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for writing to me, as that provided me with an opportunity to look at his constituent&#039;s case, which is not the norm. I am afraid that some validation tasks remain outstanding in that claim, but we hope that they will be completed as soon as possible. I remind the hon. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Apr 2006 : Column 212</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Gentleman that of course there is, and always has been, a payment window. It was never the case that we hoped or believed that everyone could be paid at the start. Payments are being made as fast as possible.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="60420-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Lindsay Hoyle  (Chorley)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend is aware that Scotland and Wales have managed to ensure that farmers are paid, but farmers in Lancashire are struggling without the single farm payment. Can she ensure that it will be paid as soon as possible? If not, can she guarantee that interim payments will be made, and that farmers will be compensated for the delay?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o30"><a name="60420-02_spnew3"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 First, I remind my hon. Friend and other hon. Members that the payment is not late, as the payment window does not close until the end of June. May I also draw to his attention, and to that of the whole House, our announcement yesterday that because of continuing concern about the rate at which the Rural Payments Agency can make payments, we have made work on a system of substantial partial payments a priority?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o31"><a name="60420-02_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Maria Miller  (Basingstoke)</b> 
 (Con): A great many farmers in my constituency in north Hampshire are also waiting for payment under the scheme, and it is causing a great deal of hardship, particularly among smaller farmers. Many of the provisional acceptances received by those farmers are littered with errors&#151;for example, with regard to field boundaries. One of the farmers in my constituency has been given an entitlement for a type of land that does not even exist in north Hampshire. What is the Minister doing to deal with those problems? Does she agree with the statement by a farmer in my constituency that the IT system is in meltdown?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="60420-02_spnew5"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 No, the IT system is not in meltdown, but there are continuing problems. The hon. Lady is probably not aware that since September 2004 there have been no less than 100,000 requests for new land to be registered or for changes to be made to the boundaries of land that had in many cases long been registered with the payments system. Indeed, 61,000 changes in registration have been made in the past five months alone. That is a substantial task. It is a substantially greater task than anyone had anticipated when the system was put in hand. That has caused difficulties, but I can assure the hon. Lady both that attempts are being made to resolve those as fast as possible, and that if there are difficulties with the specific information given to a particular farmer, we are trying to encourage contact between that farmer and the Rural Payments Agency.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o33"><a name="60420-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Andy Reed  (Loughborough)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): I welcome the statement yesterday. In meetings with my farmers recently, they highlighted the genuine concern that many of them have, particularly the smaller farmers, who are finding it difficult to maintain their cash flow. When does my right hon. Friend expect progress to be made under the timetable for improvements to IT? Would it be possible for the RPA to ensure that farmers dealt with a specific individual? One of the problems seems to be that when they phone, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Apr 2006 : Column 213</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>they have to go through the whole history all over again. Perhaps we should learn from other agencies, where specific case officers are assigned.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o34"><a name="60420-02_spnew7"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 First, it is our intention that all those who are eligible will receive full or substantial partial payments by the end of June. The second point that my hon. Friend makes is a valid and important one. Among the changes that have been brought in by the acting chief executive is a major overhaul of the way in which claims are processed, which gives staff responsibility for individual applications. I understand that previously, not only was there a system whereby staff had responsibility for individual tasks, but the staff involved in dealing with the tasks relating to particular claims were not the staff who were allowed to talk to customers. That is one of the first changes that our new acting chief executive has introduced. I will certainly pass on my hon. Friend&#039;s observations, in case the further point that he makes is helpful.

<p><a name="st_o35"><a name="60420-02_spnew8"><b> Mr. Angus MacNeil  (Na h-Eileanan an Iar)</b> 
 (SNP): There seems to be a misconception. It is not just in England and Wales that there are problems with single farm payments. Some crofters in my constituency&#151;I declare an interest here&#151;have still to get their single farm payments, although those will be modest sums compared with payments to farmers in England and Wales. Will the Minister give an assurance that, perhaps with the Scottish Executive, she will look into the systemic problems connected with the single farm payments system?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o36"><a name="60420-02_spnew9"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I am interested in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s observations. It was also my understanding that although, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) said earlier, there is a different system in the devolved Administrations and most of the farmers had been paid, as the hon. Gentleman rightly says, not all had been paid. As he will appreciate, I do not have responsibility for the way that payments are made in the devolved Administrations, but I undertake to draw his concerns to the attention of those who do.

 (Con): One of my farmers recently tried to take the Secretary of State to court by issuing a summons for her in the Weston-super-Mare small claims court. The right hon. Lady will doubtless be sad to hear that she has been deprived of the opportunity of coming to visit the beautiful town of Weston-super-Mare because of a legal technicality&#151;but does she agree that that farmer, Paul Bateman, typifies the frustration felt by farmers across the country, particularly when he received a letter from the Rural Payments Agency telling him exactly how much he was owed in euros, but no cheque was enclosed with the letter? Would it not have been simple for someone to have signed a cheque, put it in with the letter and got that one out of the way immediately?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o38"><a name="60420-02_spnew11"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 No. We are doing everything we can to speed up the payments system. On the validation of claims, identifying the amount is the first step, but I recognise that it is the cheque that really matters. Far more cheques are being issued, and that work will continue. As I have said, our top priority is a system that at least involves substantial partial payments.

 (Con): Uncertainty is the politest word to describe the mess which is the RPA. Applicants who have not had this year&#039;s claim validated now face a four-week time window before next year&#039;s payment application must be made. How can someone apply for help from 2007 onwards with certainty, when they do not know whether they have made a clear application for the current payment?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o40"><a name="60420-02_spnew13"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 Whether or not someone has a clear application for this year does not affect the need for people to get in information for 2006. Alongside the work that is being done to resolve the current problems at the RPA, we are trying to make sure that we protect the system for 2006, because we recognise the importance of a smooth transition into that subsequent year.

 (LD): Does the Secretary of State recognise that any delays that may occur beyond the end of the payment window in June, which she mentioned in yesterday&#039;s written ministerial statement, would be a clear breach of the undertakings on which the farming community relies? Will she now promise that any farmers whose payments are not completed by the end of June will have their interest costs defrayed by the Exchequer? Given that the sacking of Johnston McNeill represented some recognition of the existence of an implementation problem, does she recognise that a policy decision was involved, as we can see from the difference in the payments in England, Scotland and Wales, and that she and her team must take responsibility for that decision? Will she now consider her position accordingly?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o42"><a name="60420-02_spnew15"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 No. I have two things to say to the hon. Gentleman. First, it is easy to overlook the fact that in Scotland and Wales not only is there a different basis for payments, but there are far fewer claimants. Nevertheless, payments in Scotland and Wales have not been completely problem free, as was identified earlier in this Question Time. Secondly, the hon. Gentleman is right to say that the ministerial team made a policy decision, for which I take full responsibility, and in the long term that decision will be seen as having been clearly in the interests of the English farming community. Without getting into dispute about the decisions that people in other member states and in other parts of these isles have taken, perfectly rightly and properly, there are already growing concerns in farming communities where a different payment system has been adopted. The hon. Gentleman is comparatively new to his responsibilities, and he might not fully appreciate that the alternative basis&#151;

</p>





<p><a name="st_o44"><a name="60420-02_spnew17"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I am not being patronising; I am trying to be helpful. The alternative systems rest on paying somebody what was paid on a farm between 2000 and 2002. Such figures are already substantially out of date, and that will increase as the years go by. There is growing unrest in farming communities about   that being an unsatisfactory basis on which to proceed.

There is a real human crisis out there, because farmers face a huge amount of debt, and their suppliers are carrying large amounts of credit that they have extended to farmers who cannot pay. Any money will be welcome, and yesterday&#039;s announcement takes us in that direction. Will the Secretary of State tell us what she means by &quot;substantial&quot;?

Now that she has had to start making executive decisions herself, does that not prove that she has no confidence Lord Bach, who spent months criticising anyone who forecast this crisis, while failing to grasp the seriousness of the situation? As she has had to intervene now, how can the industry have any confidence in him?

 I entirely share the view that the hon. Gentleman expresses. I fully recognise that there is a human crisis in the farming community, and that is why we are doing everything we can to resolve it.

<a name="60420-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">The hon. Gentleman asked what we envisage as a substantial partial payment. We are working on the basis of roughly 80 per cent. of the claimed amount. I think that that is recognised as being substantial, and substantially helpful. I cannot tell him at the moment when the partial payment system that is being worked on will have been validated and will be able to run. However, if it would be helpful to him and to other hon. Members, particularly Front Benchers and the Chairman of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, the acting chief executive could come to give a briefing with his technical experts. I know that Members will want to raise particular technical issues arising from their experience and the questions of their constituents. The best thing is for them to get those answers from those who are charged with making the day-to-day executive decisions.

<p><a name="st_o47"><a name="60420-02_spnew20"><b> Mr. Paice: </b> 
 Does not that make my point? The Secretary of State cannot have her cake and eat it. The    more she tells us of Lord Bach&#039;s greater involvement, the greater is his responsibility for the crisis that we are facing throughout the country, and there is even more reason why he should go. If she is not going to meet fully the window that she keeps talking about by the end of the June, how much will the British taxpayer have to pay in penalties to the European Commission for that failure?

 In fact, as I have already said, we do anticipate making all those payments within the window. That is the task on which the RPA is currently engaged.

 I thank the Under-Secretary for his reply and pay tribute to the work of the civil contingencies secretariat. However, does not the answer pose the problem that the secretariat faces?

 The implication of my hon. Friend&#039;s question is that it is important that we learn the lessons from the foot and mouth outbreak. As has been mentioned in relation to a question on bovine tuberculosis, we have already looked carefully at the compensation that we pay. It is right that poultry and egg producers should be entitled to compensation for birds that are slaughtered in the event of any outbreak, because that provides an important incentive for them to report any signs of disease at an early stage.

 I thank the Minister for that answer. He mentioned prudent measures. Is he aware that the hosepipe ban introduced by Thames Water on 3 April extends only to privately owned vehicles?

 It is important to recognise that the hosepipe ban is implemented under the water companies&#039; own measures, and they are restricted in regard to the conditions that they can apply. The hon. Gentleman should be aware that a hosepipe or sprinkler can use in one hour the total daily water consumption of a family of four, which can have a big impact. If the water companies wish to go further and apply the ban to companies, they can apply for a drought order, as some companies have done.

 But it does not stop with hosepipe bans.

Far more importantly, however, this situation has arisen because we have just had our second dry winter in a row. What are the Minister&#039;s contingency plans in the event of a third dry winter?

<p><a name="st_o75"><a name="60420-03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 That is not necessarily the case, but we should not get away from the fact that we are facing a two-year drought&#151;and the worst drought since 1976. Indeed, in some parts of the south-east it is the worst drought for 100 years. In that respect, it is not a lot to ask that people should face some restrictions on hosepipe bans in gardens.

<p><a name="st_o93"><a name="60420-04_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Margaret Beckett): </b> 
 There are regular discussions at ministerial and official level on energy and climate change, including discussions on the relative costs of different means of generating power.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o94"><a name="60420-04_spnew8"><b> Jo Swinson: </b> 
 Now that the bill for clearing up nuclear waste is approaching &#163;70 billion, of which &#163;5.2 billion is for the three Scottish sites, does the Secretary of State agree that money spent on new nuclear power would be better spent on energy efficiency and renewables? Has her Department undertaken any work internally to assess the cost benefit of various energy options to reduce carbon dioxide emissions? If so, what conclusions has it reached?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o95"><a name="60420-04_spnew9"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 It was a feature of the energy White Paper that we published together with the Department of Trade and Industry in 2003 that the prime emphasis was initially on energy efficiency and renewables. That was precisely because they were seen as the most speedy and effective way to begin to tackle some of these issues, and also the most cost-effective, so I can certainly tell the hon. Lady that that has been a high priority and that the issue is being looked at afresh in the energy review.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o96"><a name="60420-04_spnew10"><b> Joan Ruddock  (Lewisham, Deptford)</b> 
 (Lab): Despite what my right hon. Friend has just said, does she agree that it is unfortunate that the energy review has become so focused on nuclear power when nuclear power is only 8 per cent. of the total UK energy mix that gives rise to emissions? Will she ensure that any outcomes of the energy review are fully integrated with the climate change review to achieve a major reduction in energy demand, an improvement in energy efficiency and maximum development of renewable technologies?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o97"><a name="60420-04_spnew11"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 It is my understanding that the review is not focused only on nuclear energy, although I appreciate that the media coverage is. It is the intention of both the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and myself&#151;and, indeed, the Government&#151;that the issues should be fully integrated with those that concerned us in the climate change review, including reduction in demand&#151;not least through energy efficiency&#151;and an increase in renewables.

<p><a name="st_o99"><a name="60420-04_spnew13"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 My hon. Friend rightly makes a point about increased energy prices. There are immense gains to be made in terms of energy efficiency because it is not only beneficial for the climate, but beneficial for the pocket of the customer. The review will include whatever issues would have to be taken into account were there to be a recommendation for further nuclear build.

 Some 25 per cent. of applicants had been paid by the end of March, and 15 per cent. of the fund disbursed. This unacceptably slow progress was, as the hon. Lady knows, the reason why the chief executive of the Rural Payments Agency was replaced on 16 March.

 I welcome the announcement by the Secretary of State of substantial part payment&#151;approximately 80 per cent.&#151;of entitlements under the single farm payment scheme. It will help to ameliorate the disastrous financial situation in which many in the farming community find themselves. Will the Secretary of State go even further and suspend cross-compliance inspection until the payment process is complete? Will she waive penalties for late claims in 2006 because, as she knows, the system is completely inflexible?

 (Lab): My right hon. Friend will be aware of the premium that her Department places on stakeholder engagement and discussions in this important area.

 As my hon. Friend will be aware, Lord Bach and the acting chief executive Mark Addison have been having weekly meetings with stakeholder representatives, which have included opportunities for stakeholders to raise any concerns and to discuss issues with the technical experts dealing with the issues on a day-to-day basis. As I think the stakeholders recognised in their press release of yesterday, it was very much as a consequence of the discussions as well as the exploration of what can be done within the RPA that we made the announcement that we did yesterday. We are grateful to the stakeholders for their input.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o106"><a name="60420-04_spnew19"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is aware that some work to prepare not least for 2006 had to be done on the IT system over the past couple of weeks. That inevitably and regrettably led to a slow down. A reason why I offered the House a technical briefing with the acting chief executive and those who are dealing with those issues was so that Members, all of whom will have particular concerns brought to them by particular constituents, have the opportunity to raise those issues with the RPA, as we are doing, and have a full discussion on a more sustained basis than is possible across the Floor of the House.

By choosing more sensible cars, travelling less and not using the Queen&#039;s Flight so much, by looking at how buildings are insulated and at control systems in buildings and by introducing fuel-efficient lighting, the Government could do a number of things to contribute to trying to meet targets that they are not hitting.
</p>





<p><a name="st_17"><a name="60420-06_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman makes an entirely sensible and practical suggestion on something about which all Departments are concerned.

I agree that it is important that the Government set a good example for others to follow.

My right hon. Friend has encyclopaedic knowledge of things coming from all Departments, but I am sure that he missed that document. Even the Haemophilia Society only found out that it had been published from a website and had to ask for a copy.

The document is strongly criticised by the society for omitting some of the major points that were supposed to be considered&#151;the Government&#039;s involvement and omissions at a high level of Government. There was a disaster: 4,800 people were contaminated with HIV and hepatitis C in the 1970s and 1980s.

The final spending for 2007 to 2013 will exceed &#163;600 billion, which is &#163;24 billion above the budget that the Prime Minister announced.

 I wonder whether the Leader of the House will give the House the opportunity to consider the way in which the Government have broken their word on education. The whole House will remember that, in 1997, the Prime Minister made great play of saying that he was going to cut primary class sizes. Then and since, he has promised to tackle school truancy.

 I know that the hon. Gentleman may not have read the Labour party&#039;s manifesto in 1997 with quite as much care as he should have done, but if he checks that manifesto, he will see that the commitment was not in relation to primary education generally; it was in relation to early years, and that promise was categorically carried out. In case he failed to notice this, I should just mention that the electorate voted for the Labour Government again in 2001 and in 2005. Rather than suggesting that somehow promises from 1997 were broken, the electorate have made a judgment about the record of success in education. Labour Members will take no lessons at all from Conservatives in relation to health or education. This country has seen a revolution in the provision of health and education since 1997&#151;a revolution that is benefiting the great majority of our children and young people in education, and will go on doing so.

May I emphasise a point that I have made repeatedly? Given the amounts that are made available from the taxpayer to the national health service, it is important that all NHS organisations maintain a balance between their expenditure and income. Given that only a handful are failing to achieve that, it is important that we continue to offer help and assistance to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s hospital and others that are not able to manage their finances effectively. Such help is available, and it will go on being available until we ensure that we are getting the best value for the taxpayer out of the enormous sums that are put into the health service.

 May I return to the cross-party calls for an early debate on job losses in the NHS? Three years ago, Ravenscourt Park hospital, which is in my constituency, was nationalised. At that time the chief executive of the Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust said to the press that staffing was growing all the time and that he was looking to recruit from all over the world, starting with Germany and going on from there. Three years later, the same chief executive announced 300 redundancies, so may we have an early opportunity to debate boom and bust in the NHS under Labour?

 The hon. Gentleman misses from his litany of complaint the quality and number of treatments undertaken by health service hospitals and bodies throughout the country. We want to see experienced health service professionals&#151;nurses, doctors and consultants&#151;delivering the service. We want them to deliver the service with overheads that are as low as can possibly be achieved. I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman would welcome the fact that the national health service is delivering the treatments and quality of care for which it is rightly famed. It is a success and a cause of congratulation that that is being done more efficiently and cost-effectively.

<a name="time_1">
<a name="60420-10_time0"><h5>12.23 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_82"><a name="60420-10_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Mr. Charles Clarke): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I should like to make a statement about further measures that the Government intend to take to protect the public from dangerous offenders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_36">In my statement on 28 February, following the publication of the report by the chief inspector of probation on the appalling murder of John Monckton, I made it clear that, although we have already made improvements to our system for public protection and will continue to do so, we have to do more to improve the way in which we identify and manage dangerous offenders who present a risk to the public. I announced that the Government would accept the main findings and the key recommendations of the chief inspector&#039;s report. Today, I have placed in the Library of the House a probation circular that requires chief officers to implement those recommendations and the 31 &quot;practice&quot; recommendations that were set out in the report. Arrangements will be made to audit implementation in July and again in October this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_37">Action on those recommendations is not enough, so I propose to take new powers to enable dangerous and high-risk offenders to be better managed, as well as to strengthen the work of the Parole Board and the probation service. The Government need to provide the framework in which the probation service and other criminal justice agencies can do their job to the highest standards. We have already made changes to the sentencing regime to ensure that dangerous offenders who pose a continuing risk can be detained indefinitely if a court so determines. Those arrangements apply to all eligible offenders who commit offences after the new provisions came into force&#151;that is, offences committed on or after 4 April 2005.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_38">I have looked very carefully to see how we can increase safeguards in respect of offenders who committed their offences before that date. I considered whether it would be possible to make the more dangerous offenders subject to the new public protection sentences, notwithstanding the date of their offence. I concluded that it would not, as it would violate the principle of retrospective legislation, and the House would be likely to find that unacceptable. However, I consider that three further steps are necessary. First, I have decided to ensure that offenders who have been sentenced to imprisonment for offences committed before 4 April 2005 are on licence from the moment that they are released from custody until the very end of their sentence, rather than to the three-quarters point of their sentence as now. That means that offenders who give cause for concern at any time during the currency of their sentence can be recalled to prison.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_39">I will introduce that change by means of an order under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, which will be laid before the House and the other place as soon as possible. The aim is to focus active supervision on those dangerous offenders who pose the most risk of harm and who will be actively and intensively supervised until the end of their sentence. That step is not enough in itself. There are some offenders who do not cease to be a risk to the public just because their licence has come to an end. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Apr 2006 : Column 245</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Secondly, therefore, we must be able to deal with such offenders. There is a strong case for introducing a violent offender order along the same lines that have proved effective in the case of sex offenders. Such an order would enable the court to make specific prohibitions on offenders who have been convicted of offences of violence, breach of which would be a criminal offence subject to up to five years in prison. I will publish proposals in that area before summer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_40">Thirdly, I acknowledge that many dangerous offenders suffer from mental disorder. The plans that we recently announced to amend mental health legislation will help to ensure that mentally disordered offenders receive the treatment that they need and that the risk that they pose to the public is minimised. I am confident that those proposals, together with the reforms that I set out in my five-year strategy for protecting the public and reducing re-offending&#151;in particular, the introduction of a single named-offender manager for all offenders, coupled with my proposals to drive up performance by introducing alternative providers of services and challenging the probation service to demonstrate that it can and does meet the highest standards&#151;will help to improve the way in which dangerous offenders are managed. Of course, no risk can ever be eliminated, but we need to do much better in minimising risks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_41">Accurate assessment of risk must lie at the heart of our public protection arrangements. It is essential that staff are clear about their responsibilities and are properly trained. With immediate effect, all chief officers of probation will have a specific objective to improve the quality of risk-of-harm assessments in their area, and they will be required to provide regular reports. In addition, almost all probation middle managers throughout the country&#151;there are about 1,400&#151;have undergone a rigorous training programme to improve the quality of risk-of-harm assessments and the way in which they manage such cases. In June, we will introduce a new training tool further to improve the way in which staff assess and manage risk.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_42">Still more needs to be done to improve the risk assessment process itself, so I have commissioned the National Offender Management Service risk of harm improvement board to undertake an urgent exercise, with independent input as necessary, to achieve that. I have issued guidance to both prisons and probation staff to highlight the need to avoid over-emphasis on good behaviour in prison and to make progress in addressing dynamic risk factors when assessing risk prior to release. The Parole Board&#151;an independent body charged with the task of deciding whether offenders are safe to be released&#151;has a crucial role to play in assessing risk. New minimum standards for the reports prepared for the Parole Board have been introduced and new monitoring arrangements came into force at the beginning of the month. Urgent work is in hand to ensure that the board has available to it all the relevant information that it needs to ensure that its decisions are well founded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_43">In addition to these measures, the chairman of the Parole Board has also informed me of his plans to appoint senior and well respected independent figures to the panel that reviews cases involving serious further offences, to ensure that lessons are properly identified and learned. I welcome this move, too.

<a name="60420-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_44">More generally, it is the role of all agencies within the criminal justice system to prioritise public protection through partnership working, which is why Her Majesty&#039;s inspectors of probation, prisons and constabulary are conducting a joint thematic inspection of the effectiveness of public protection arrangements. I will report back to the House on any further recommendations that stem from this report when it is published this summer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_45">Taken together, I believe these measures represent an important step forward in protecting the public. Implementation of the improvement package will be overseen by my noble Friend the Minister of State for Criminal Justice and Offender Management. I commend the proposals to the House.

 I thank the Home Secretary for early sight of his statement. Much of what he said is welcome and constructive. However, it is the first duty of the Government to protect the public, and clearly they and their actions have not protected the public on too many occasions in recent times. Failure of Government policy has been a contributing factor in the tragic deaths of Marian Bates, John Monckton, Robert Symons and Mary-Ann Leneghan, among others&#151;all murdered by criminals on early release, parole or probation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_46">It is no surprise that the Government are announcing the order this week, just before the killers of Mary-Ann Leneghan are sentenced and a report on the murder of Naomi Bryant, which is expected to be extremely damning, is published. This is the latest in a series of tough-sounding measures that the Home Secretary has announced this week, which are designed to catch the    headlines and pre-empt the reports of the Government&#039;s failure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_47">The problem that the Home Secretary&#039;s new order seeks to address is largely of the Government&#039;s own making. It has been the Government&#039;s policy to release dangerous offenders into the community on early release. The <i>Daily Mail</i> reports the chief inspector of probation as saying that there are 15,000 offenders on probation who are assessed as representing a high or a very high risk of causing harm to others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_48">It was the Government who cut the Parole Board&#039;s budget for face-to-face interviews by 90 per cent. two years ago. Yusuf Bouhaddaou, who murdered Robert Symons just five weeks after being released from prison, was released with no face-to-face interview. Instead, he had just a 25-minute telephone conversation with the probation service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_49">It was the Government who introduced OASYS, the offender assessment system that the National Association of Probation Officers has described as &quot;poorly designed&quot;, with its prime purpose being to
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;produce data for the Home Office, rather than analysing the behaviour of offenders&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_50">If we look at each of the appalling murders committed by offenders on probation, early release and parole&#151;Mary-Ann Leneghan, John Monckton, Marian Bates, Robert Symons and others&#151;one point is clear: if the offenders had been in prison, those crimes would not have been committed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_51">So what are the Government proposing to address   their own failures? Although, astonishingly, the Home Secretary did not mention it in his statement, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Apr 2006 : Column 247</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>pre-briefing by the Home Office stated that they would increase the number of face-to-face interviews prior to release to 30 per cent. Is that true? Even if it is, an astonishing 70 per cent. of prisoners will still not have a face-to-face interview before release. What extra resources is the Home Secretary providing to the probation service, which we are told is already overstretched? Will he increase the interview budget, which was cut by 90 per cent. two years ago?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_52">The Home Secretary says he wants to impose restrictions on violent offenders and, presumably, ban them from approaching certain people or places, but prisoners released under the home detention curfew scheme have committed over 7,000 further offences already. In 2004&#150;05 alone, 224 offenders on probation were convicted of further serious offences, including 26 murders&#151;I repeat, 26 murders. A criminal who is willing to murder or to commit armed robbery or burglary will not be put off by some sort of super-ASBO. If 42 per cent. of antisocial behaviour orders are ignored by young tearaways, how effective will the so-called super-ASBOs be against psychopathic hardened criminals? If the Government cannot make the sex offenders register work properly, how safe should the public feel after this latest headline-grabbing initiative?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_53">The Government&#039;s proposals fail to address the real problems in the probation service, which is in desperate need of effective leadership and management from the Government. What does the Home Secretary have to say to Harry Fletcher of the National Association of Probation Officers, who says that the probation service is already poorly resourced and massively overstretched? <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Home Secretary laughs. Damien Hanson, who murdered John Monckton, was assessed as being 91 per cent. likely to re-offend, yet he was released halfway through a 12-year sentence for attempted murder. The Home Secretary&#039;s proposal fails to address the underlying problems in the probation service that allowed that to happen. Is he proposing any further legislation with respect to the National Offender Management Service, which remains only half-reformed?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_54">The Government have failed to address the problem of prison overcrowding, which means that prisoners are not getting the rehabilitation that they require. How do the Government intend to solve that problem? Let us be clear. The latest spate of murders is just the latest symptom of a major failure in the criminal justice system&#151;a failure by the Government of policy, strategy, leadership and management. The measures smack of a policy designed primarily to relieve the pressure on overcrowded prisons, rather than protecting the public. With 15,000 dangerous offenders back on our streets, let us hope it does not result in yet more victims of crime and yet more families devastated by murder.
</p>





<p><a name="st_84"><a name="60420-11_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman started well by saying that he welcomed the proposal and wished to be constructive about it. His allegations are demeaning and misleading. Let us go through the points in detail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-11_para9">
<a name="stpa_55">The right hon. Gentleman&#039;s first allegation was that the announcement was some sort of initiative to catch the headlines, rather than a substantive measure to address the issue. As I said in my statement and as he should have had the grace to acknowledge, immediately upon the announcement of the verdict in the Monckton 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Apr 2006 : Column 248</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>case, which had the appalling results that he described in the case of Hanson, I asked the chief inspector of probation to go through in detail what was done wrong in relation to that case and how to put it right. I published that report extremely rapidly, and I announced today that we are carrying through in specified ways measures to stop what the right hon. Gentleman correctly defines as a terrible, appalling case, the Hanson case, happening again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-11_para10">
<a name="stpa_56">Secondly, at the time that I announced the outcome of the Bridges report, I said that despite its recommendations, which were important and would be implemented, it necessarily fell short in certain important respects, and I would return to the House, as I am doing today, to say what further steps we would take. To suggest that this is some kind of spun response is demeaning and unworthy of the right hon. Gentleman.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-11_para11">
<a name="stpa_57">There are three core issues. In each area we have made major improvements since the time of the Government with whom the right hon. Gentleman served and held office. First, with regard to the sentencing regimes, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 established the means, which did not exist under the Government of whom he was a member, of controlling people sentenced under that regime who are dangerous to society, and at any point recalling to prison people who are dangerous to the public. That does not solve problems arising from sentences before 2003, but it is a major advance which will make a difference. Today we are announcing further measures to deal with people sentenced before that time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-11_para12">
<a name="stpa_58">Secondly, on the risk assessment regime, it is critical that professionals can assess the risks associated with individuals who commit appalling crimes, but the right hon. Gentleman is quite wrong in his demeaning remarks about OASYS and the multi-agency public protection arrangements. It is an internationally recognised system, which is being introduced in a way that was never considered by his Government. It is improving the system and will improve it further, to deal with the issues properly. That is what we are doing and what he never did.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-11_para13">
<a name="stpa_59">Thirdly, once the assessment has been carried out, the question arises how we properly manage people thought to be a risk in those circumstances. Once again, we are introducing major changes to do that, including focusing the professional resource of probation staff on those who are most dangerous, which is why we will publish further legislation on the contestability agenda as I described. My comment to Harry Fletcher and the National Association of Probation Officers, whom the right hon. Gentleman entertainingly chucks into the discussion, is that resources are important and that we have put more resources in&#151;much more than under his Government&#151;but change and reform to the way we run our probation system are also important. We make the changes to protect the public better. That is what we are committed to do.

 I agree with my hon. Friend&#039;s final point and pay tribute to the way in which he has taken up that appalling case in his constituency. I have listened carefully to his comments, which are based on what he has learned from the community that he represents. We need better sentencing regimes, which we have established, and we need the courts to carry them through. We also need proper risk assessments, and we are putting them in place. Earlier, I decided not to respond to the shadow Home Secretary&#039;s gratuitous remarks about the early release scheme, and I am glad that my hon. Friend has pointed out that to confuse those issues, which are real, with the issues at stake in the Mary-Ann Leneghan case is dishonourable and discreditable.

<p><a name="st_87"><a name="60420-12_spnew1"><b> Mr. Nick Clegg  (Sheffield, Hallam) (LD):</b> 
 I also thank the Home Secretary for his courtesy in providing an advance copy of the statement. There is no easy solution to the problems that we face, and Liberal Democrat Members will support any constructive or workable proposals to improve public safety against the actions of dangerous offenders. The Home Secretary will remember that we supported the Government in 2003, when they sought to create a new indefinite sentence for the most dangerous individuals, and I agree with his acknowledgment today that the new powers cannot be used retrospectively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_60">I broadly welcome the package of alternative measures outlined in the Home Secretary&#039;s statement. The proposal to extend post-custody supervision for those sentenced before April 2005 is particularly welcome, as are all attempts to improve the assessment of risk. According to Andrew Bridges, the chief inspector of probation, only 20 per cent. of offenders who go on to commit serious offences while on parole were assessed as being high risk.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_61">The statement leaves two questions unanswered. First, is the new system of early release really providing the maximum protection for the public? In the debates in this House during the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the rules on early release were changed in the teeth of opposition from both Liberal Democrat and Conservative Members. Before the implementation of the 2003 Act, the Parole Board had discretion whether to release long-term prisoners at the 50 per cent. point of their sentence and, if there was a reasonable concern about public safety, release could be delayed until the two-thirds point. The 2003 Act removed that discretion from the Parole Board. In view of the cases that have been cited today, will the Home Secretary agree to review that change?

<a name="60420-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_62">Secondly, how much will the increase in supervision cost, and how many additional probation officers will be needed? A key problem faced by probation staff and by those involved in multi-agency public protection arrangements is how to apportion scarce resources, which is compounded in turn by a desperately overcrowded prison system in which staff often do not have time to assess individuals properly. What will the Home Secretary do to tackle the severe underlying problems of an overcrowded prison system and an overloaded probation service?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_63">We will, of course, respond constructively and in detail to the Home Secretary&#039;s proposals on violent offender orders later in the summer.

<a name="60420-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_65">The hon. Gentleman is right to say that early release should be reviewed in the context of the proposals, and I am discussing the issue with the Parole Board and others. He will recall that the system that we have established was an attempt to focus on the greatest danger to the community, which is our precise ambition for the five-year strategy and the contestability agenda. This may be asking too much, but perhaps he will consider constructively our proposals in that area, which are designed to ensure that the professionalism of the probation service is focused on the areas in which it can be most accurately applied.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_66">On costs and prison overcrowding, which are extremely serious issues, more resources are needed for training and support on the difficult decisions that highly professional staff have to take&#151;in general, staff make those decisions very successfully. Within the probation and prison system, which needs to be well led and managed, we need to focus existing resources on the most challenging cases, which will require some of the changes that I have described. A range of different measures is needed to address those questions rather than simply more resources.

</p>





<p><a name="st_90"><a name="60420-12_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The answer is that such judgments are very difficult, but existing mental health legislation allows us to make them in some cases. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health will introduce carefully prepared legislation on that matter later this year, and I hope that it will provide the protection mentioned by my hon. Friend. The 2003 Act contains a power indefinitely to detain people who are a danger to the public, which also relates to his point. The core point is that we must acknowledge the difficulty of identifying the people who really pose a risk. We should not imply that that task is easy or routine, because it is exceptionally difficult and demands professionalism from those involved. We must encourage and support that professionalism and learn how better to conduct the task.
</p>





<p><a name="st_91"><a name="60420-12_spnew5"><b> Mr. Rob Wilson  (Reading, East) (Con):</b> 
 As the hon. Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter) has said, four of the six men who brutalised, tortured and murdered my constituent, Mary-Ann Leneghan, were under the supervision of the criminal justice system, which ultimately betrayed her. The Home Secretary is proposing &quot;to take new powers to enable dangerous and high risk offenders to be better managed as well as to strengthen the work of the Parole Board and the probation service&quot;. I welcome the moves to strengthen the Parole Board and the probation service, but my constituents want to know whether dangerous criminals will be locked up, which would be a fitting epitaph for Mary-Ann Leneghan and reassure her family.
</p>





<p><a name="st_92"><a name="60420-12_spnew6"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The short answer to that question is yes. However, I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged that a number of measures are required. We must ensure that the current procedures are carried out properly. As the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) rightly said about the Monckton murder, there is clear evidence in that case and, I think, the Mary-Ann Leneghan case that the procedures that should have been followed properly were not followed properly, which led to tragic consequences. That state of affairs is scandalous, and it is being addressed by the measures that I have set out. Above and beyond that, there is the question whether the procedures and approaches are appropriate in such cases and whether we need to change and improve performance&#151;I believe that we do, which is why I have made my statement today. Finally, there is the question how to deal with people whom we deem to be dangerous. The 2003 Act allows us to take the action that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned, and the measures that I have set out today will strengthen our capacity in that area.

 I can certainly give my hon. Friend the assurance that I will consider the question carefully. I go beyond that to say that he is right that the continuity of approach between prisons and probation in an end-to-end offender management system is absolutely essential and that that requires the person-institution relationship to be very close. He has made the case in this House and elsewhere, as have others, regarding concerns about the reorganisation of police and probation on to an all-Wales basis. I assure him that the concerns that he expressed can be properly dealt with in terms of the necessary change that we are making.

<p><a name="st_95"><a name="60420-13_spnew1"><b> Mr. Douglas Hogg  (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con):</b> 
 The Home Secretary&#039;s concept of a violent offender order may well have merit&#151;we will look at the detail when the legislation is published&#151;but may I make a wider point? Persons like myself who practise in the criminal courts, often deal with violent offenders, and have to consider whether they have a propensity to commit future violence, know that one of the problems is that they are often unemployable because they are addicted to drink or drugs or lack employment potential by reason of poor education or lack of relevant skills. Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the Prison Service must place yet greater weight on tackling addiction of various kinds and on providing education and employment skills, and that his violent offender orders should be shaped in such a way as to enable that to continue after release from prison?
</p>





<p><a name="st_96"><a name="60420-13_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I find myself in the utterly extraordinary position of agreeing with absolutely every word that the right hon. and learned Gentleman says. He is right to say that dealing with addiction and rehabilitation&#151;particularly as regards drugs but also in other areas&#151;is critically important; that is why such provision has been dramatically expanded. He is also right to make the link to employment. About three months ago, my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Education and Skills and for Work and Pensions and I jointly published proposals to develop the relationship between employment and people in the criminal justice system. I am simply delighted to agree with every word that the right hon. and learned Gentleman says.

 I welcome my right hon. Friend&#039;s statement and his efforts to protect the public in this very difficult area. I particularly welcome the creation of the violent offender order and his comments about mental health. I am sure that he will accept, as we all do, that risk cannot ever be completely eliminated and that it would be unrealistic to think so. These proposals will make much more specific demands on the probation service and probably require more resources for it to carry them out. Will he comment on that?

<p><a name="st_98"><a name="60420-13_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>be completely eliminated. It is important to say that, because some people seem to believe that it is ultimately possible to do so. It is necessary to minimise risk, however, and that is what our proposals do by putting in not only resources, but advocating change and reform to the way that we do this work.
</p>





<p><a name="st_99"><a name="60420-13_spnew5"><b> Mr. Andrew Mackay  (Bracknell) (Con):</b> 
 Can the Home Secretary now answer the important question asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)&#151;namely, why is it that in 90 per cent. of cases, potentially dangerous criminals who are leaving prison do not have a one-to-one, face-to-face interview, and when will that change?
</p>





<p><a name="st_100"><a name="60420-13_spnew6"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I do not think that the figure is as high as 90 per cent., but I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman has given me the chance to answer the question. There are two issues: first, face-to-face interviews with probation officers as people leave prison; and secondly, face-to-face interviews by the Parole Board as it makes its decisions about what to do. It is our policy to ensure face-to-face interviews with probation for all people coming up for parole. That does not always happen, as the right hon. Gentleman says, but our policy is to reach 100 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_68">As for the Parole Board panel&#039;s assessment of particular individuals, there has been some controversy over the past two or three years about the extent to which face-to-face interviews should take place. Some of that is based on professional grounds as to whether it is the best way of dealing with the case, and some of it is based on resources grounds. I discussed this some weeks ago with Sir Duncan Nichol, the chairman of the Parole Board. I said that I want to be clear about the professional basis, and then whatever resources are necessary will be made available to the Parole Board to do what needs to be done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_69">On the first point&#151;interviews with probation as people leave prison&#151;the right hon. Gentleman is entirely correct. We are taking the 100 per cent. route, but there is a journey to travel, although it is not as far as he says. Parole Board interviews are a matter of professional judgment about the right way to make those assessments, with face-to-face interviews being part of that process.

<p><a name="st_101"><a name="60420-13_spnew7"><b> Dr. Vincent Cable  (Twickenham) (LD):</b> 
 While I accept the Home Secretary&#039;s basic point that reform and resources need to go together, cannot he give even a ballpark estimate of the additional resources that will be available to the probation service to deal with the additional tasks required of it, particularly given that the Chancellor&#039;s projections and priorities suggest that there will be a real-terms cut in future Home Office spending?
</p>





<p><a name="st_102"><a name="60420-13_spnew8"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am surprised by the hon. Gentleman&#039;s last remark, because it is not true. The Chancellor made it clear in his Budget statement that during the next comprehensive spending review, the Home Office budget would maintain a zero real-terms position. That was a good settlement that reflects the needs of public expenditure as opposed to the existing service. The hon. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Apr 2006 : Column 254</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Gentleman is wrong to say that it is a real-terms cut. We have not yet taken final decisions on the allocation of resources within that Home Office envelope, but the resource demands that we are discussing will be part of that. It is important for the probation service to concentrate at the moment on deciding where it should best focus its professional resources in carrying out those responsibilities. That discussion needs to go side by side with the overall discussion on resources.

<a name="60420-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_70">Last week in the High Court in Northern Ireland, a person was convicted of the murder of Attracta Harron, a senior citizen. That person had previously been convicted of a very serious sexual assault. The conviction was accompanied by a sentence that was widely regarded as being lenient. It was appealed and increased after the person was released upon serving the original sentence. Four months later, the body of Attracta Harron was found, and he was subsequently convicted of her murder. The police said after last week&#039;s court case that that man was the most closely monitored released prisoner in Northern Ireland. What will the new provisions do to protect the wider public from convicted murderers such as the person who murdered Attracta Harron?
</p>





<p><a name="st_104"><a name="60420-13_spnew10"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 First, I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s support in principle. Secondly, I am not going to comment on specific cases, but I know that the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), and his Department are looking carefully at the case that he mentions, taking account of the opinions that he expressed about it in the context of my statement and with a view to seeing how they interrelate in the best way. Thirdly, we would be happy to work with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party on these matters to see how we can establish the best regime that will deal with these matters consistently.

 This week, a person was convicted of murdering two patients in Banbury and causing grievous harm to several others. That reinforces the Secretary of State&#039;s point that many dangerous offenders have mental health needs. There is obviously an overlap, with many such people going into prison for long stretches of time. Can he assure the House that before violent offenders are released on licence or parole, they will be assessed for their mental health needs, that it will be a condition that they co-operate with any appropriate mental health treatment, and that if they do not, that will be classed as a breach of parole? The danger is that such individuals are looked after by the parole system but are lost to the mental health system when they leave prison. At that point, there needs to be a handover from the Prison Service to the mental health service. I hope that I have made that clear to the Secretary of State.

We are considering how we can deal with such issues more profoundly in the context of our departmental work, the new proposed legislation that the Department of Health will introduce and the comprehensive spending review. That is one of the reasons why simple statements about the prison population are not necessarily especially helpful. A large proportion of the prison population has mental health needs, and the Secretary of State for Health and I agree that there is a good argument for perhaps dealing with that in better ways, if we could find such ways and have a proper assessment regime. The hon. Gentleman is therefore right in principle, but, in saying that, I do not want to imply that there is not much difficulty in practice.

If policing functions were devolved to a Department&#151;or two Departments, if the Assembly so chose&#151;what would be the implications for the Policing Board? The board was the creation of the Patten committee and its report, and in the absence of an Assembly with devolved policing functions it was given political accountability by MLAs serving on it. However, in a new scenario in which policing is devolved to the Assembly&#151;I hope that we shall see that one day&#151;I presume that there will be a committee of Assembly Members to scrutinise policing. The Minister&#151;or perhaps the two Ministers&#151;will therefore be accountable to, and have their actions scrutinised by, that committee. What long-term impact would that have on the Policing Board and its composition? I would appreciate an answer from the Minister, who seems to have addressed the other issues. Will it be up to the Assembly to establish whether one or two Departments are involved? Will policing and justice powers be devolved at the same time, or will one be devolved ahead of the other?

 I hope that my earlier comments about the amendment satisfied the hon. Lady. The Government&#039;s purpose is to ensure that when the Assembly judges the time to be right to seek the devolution of policing and justice powers it can implement whichever model it concludes is appropriate. The amendment would have run counter to that purpose, because it would have restricted the number of options available to the Assembly rather than enhancing it. The Government believe that the Assembly should choose whether it has two Departments, how it runs them and how accountability to the Assembly is determined.

Will the Minister acknowledge that the Patten report&#151;which, as he rightly said, established the Policing Board&#151;dealt with the devolution of justice and policing powers, and stated that steps would have to be taken to protect the integrity of such structures as the Policing Board, to ensure that devolution did not have adverse implications for its role?

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. In principle, devolution will be undertaken when the Assembly wants it, when the Government agree to it and when the House of Commons votes for it. The Assembly has the freedom to consider whatever model it wishes, and the Bill will add models to those set out in the 1998 Act for the Assembly&#039;s consideration. The position of the Policing Board needs to be examined, and the future of any Assembly committee overseeing policing will need to be considered in the light of the important role played by the board.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the options on the menu that might be considered in party discussions, but I can advise Members, as someone who has served in the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, that it would be a most unwelcome and unhelpful arrival in that Department. It would not assist the competent performance of the Department at large, and it would add unduly to the burden of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and handicap the good conduct of those devolved responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-16_para0">
<a name="stpa_87">I do not fret about the absence of that option. The significance of the Bill setting out some options is that it raises questions: if such matters are to be the subject of agreement by the parties, does not it make sense to ask the parties to have those discussions, reach agreement and then legislate on known outcomes? We have seen some of the folly and futility of legislating for all sorts of potential options, which then turn out not to be needed and to be withdrawn subsequently or overtaken by other legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_88">I note that the d&#039;Hondt option is available for appointing a First Minister and Deputy First Minister, or the Assembly can decide not to appoint by the d&#039;Hondt system. Of course, under the Bill, that decision would be entirely under the control of Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party&#151;no doubt a marriage made in heaven. They, through their control of the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, and of the voting mechanism proposed in the Bill, would determine that entirely. An option of joint Ministers and rotating junior Ministers is given, but no option is given for the Assembly to say that it will be outside the d&#039;Hondt system and that the Assembly will elect, through cross-community support, a single Minister. In discussions, the parties might agree that they want to go for that option. The House could therefore find itself having to legislate for another option in future, unless, of course, there has been prior agreement on some of the options under consideration.

<p>
<a name="60420-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_89">Many of us have questions about that. Martin McGuinness tells us that the whole question of how and what things were to be transferred was done and dusted in the negotiations leading up to the so-called comprehensive agreement of December 2004. With regard to the comments of the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson), we know that we did not see everything that was agreed in the comprehensive agreement of December 2004, because the documents published were accompanied by up to 100 different side-notes, letters and clarifications. Does that cover some of how devolution of justice and policing was to be handled and transacted? Does it mean that there has been a prior agreement involving Sinn Fein and the DUP about some of the models? If not, surely the likelihood is that we will face new legislation to provide for what is agreed in the future? If Democratic Unionist Members are going to tell us that none of that is agreed, and none of it will matter, why is the Committee being asked to pass this legislation?

<a name="60420-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_90">The answer, as I said on Second Reading, is that we are being asked to deal with parts of the Bill that are something between a figment and a fig leaf.

 Additional models need to be applied to support the potential options for the Assembly to choose, in due course, what form the devolution of policing should take. If we did not include those additional models, we would restrict the Assembly&#039;s choice. That relates particularly to the point made earlier by the hon.

 Will the Minister address the possibility that the Bill will limit the choices?

First, in the negotiation of the Good Friday agreement, a clear, deliberate, collective decision was made that we would not build in any vetting requirements, qualification or screening in relation to ministerial appointments. To use this Bill to do so now would take us on a path that departs from the spirit, the letter and the principle of the Good Friday agreement.

<p><a name="st_189"><a name="60420-18_spnew5"><b> Mr. Peter Robinson: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman indicated earlier that my colleagues were not involved in those negotiations, so perhaps he can give us some illumination. When he talks about a collective decision, which parties took that decision?

<p><a name="st_190"><a name="60420-18_spnew6"><b> Mark Durkan: </b> 
 The parties who were present in the negotiation, Sir Alan. I can advise the hon. Gentleman that the hon.

We took that decision because to create such powers would force parties to use the power to vet or veto other people&#039;s choice of Minister. The hon. Gentleman was clear on that and I remember being directly involved in negotiations in that context with him. I remember it clearly, although I am sure that he tries to forget it.

 We are in no way exposed in relation to this point. I am explaining carefully and clearly how the decision to appoint Ministers by respective parties was reached. Obviously parties and party leaders would be held to democratic account in different ways for their choices of Ministers.

We always hoped that that would include parties and party leaders making clear declarations about such issues.

 The hon.

His party claims to support human rights, of which the right to life is the most fundamental. How can it reconcile appointing a justice or policing Minister who may well have snuffed out and taken the life of another person with showing respect for human rights?
</p>





<p><a name="st_204"><a name="60420-18_spnew19"><b> Mark Durkan: </b> 
 I take the hon. Lady&#039;s point. Many people are suspected of exactly the sort of crime that she is talking about, but have no conviction. It may well be possible for somebody whom many people believe has committed such a crime to be appointed a Minister. They would not be disqualified by her amendment, which relates purely to a conviction and imprisonment, so there is no contradiction in our position in relation to upholding human life as the most fundamental human right.

<a name="stpa_106">A further reason why I oppose the amendment is that it may have unforeseen applications. If someone is to make a declaration to the Assembly of unequivocal support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland, some of us could argue that the Ulster Unionist party now is potentially showing equivocal support.

 In my absence, I believe that the hon. Gentleman referred to my role in the negotiations leading up to the Belfast agreement.

He will know that I have devoted the last eight years of my life to opposing the proposition that any Minister who has a connection with a paramilitary terrorist organisation should be a Minister in the Government of Northern Ireland. There is nothing in the Belfast agreement that suggests otherwise. The hon.

<a name="stpa_113">Given that we are seeking to devolve policing and justice, it does not seem to me to be asking a lot for potential Ministers to affirm their support for the police. The extra requirement in the amendment is a very minor adjustment, and I should have thought that its inclusion should be axiomatic. Although it might seem a small step to me, I accept that it might seem a large one to some people, yet it would give at least some confidence to members of those political parties in Northern Ireland that show no reluctance about supporting the police and upholding the rule of law that people seeking to hold office would have the appropriate objectives. In other words, the amendments would add to the pledge of office a commitment to support the police. I think that that is reasonable.

<a name="stpa_115">I do not see why there should be a great deal of difficulty with the amendments. I heard what the hon.

If we leave matters as they are, I understand that there will be stumbling blocks to the devolution of policing and justice, and that more or less the same stumbling blocks would obstruct getting the Assembly up and running in the first place.

Another is that some members of the Assembly might be Ministers by day and terrorists&#151;if I may use that word&#151;by night.

<p>
<a name="60420-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_117">Those are real fears, and the Government must put pressure on the appropriate people. We have had many debates, in the House and in Committee, and as I said yesterday the Minister of State has been unfailingly courteous.

 I will give way in a moment, but before I do I want to emphasise that I have chosen my words very carefully. I understand how difficult this matter is. We are talking about actions as bitter as wormwood and gall to many hon. Members, and I understand that their communities have suffered for many years in ways that are inconceivable to people who live in comparative safety and comfort in Great Britain. However, people in my borough of Ealing have been affected physically&#151;and lethally&#151;by the conflict. Therefore, I feel that I have the right to speak about these matters in this House, and to say that it is vital that we thaw the permafrost, escape from the past and move forward.
</p>





<p><a name="st_216"><a name="60420-20_spnew3"><b> Sammy Wilson: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is trying to divert attention away from the essence of the amendment. This is not only about people who have a past; it is about people with a present and particular attitude to the police. The second part of the amendment requires such people to make a declaration of support for the very service that, as Ministers, they are supposed to be in charge of.

 I am very grateful&#151;rather more often than I expected to be&#151;for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s interventions, but I disagree profoundly with the point that he makes. If that were the case, we could understand the need for the amendment. If we say, as one of the amendments specifies, that everybody holding office has to swear to uphold the rule of law, that implies that we can pick and choose our obedience to the rule of law.

<a name="stpa_124">The hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) referred earlier to the past and the present, and he is absolutely and precisely right. Although the past is in some ways uncertain because it is constantly reinterpreted, at least we know what happened in the past, and we can examine it. What we cannot do is to legislate for attitude. How in heaven&#039;s name can attitude be analysed, delineated, listed and then legislated for? I am sorry, but the hon.

 The issue has been raised of past miscreants who engaged in criminal activity perhaps becoming, for example, justice Ministers in Northern Ireland. Such people may currently support illegality and criminality; indeed, some would say that they do. Does the hon.

<p><a name="st_219"><a name="60420-20_spnew6"><b> Stephen Pound: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. Few statements are less equivocal than the statement that was made to the effect that the war is over. The hon. Gentleman will probably say that although statements can be made and words uttered, they may be blown hither and thither on the wind, but what on earth would it take to prove this commitment? One could say, &quot;Here is a form of words that constitutes a continual raising of the bar, which has to be jumped over before such people are acceptable&quot;. However, although it would be presumptuous of me to attempt to speak for the Government&#151;I have no doubt that I will never be called upon to do so&#151;I would suggest that the participation of individuals in the democratic process is in itself a statement of intent. The hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>North Down (Lady Hermon). He said that the IRA stated that the war is over, but he knows as well as the rest of us that the elected Sinn Fein Members do not take their seats in this House because they do not recognise the legitimacy of this Parliament. Similarly, they do not recognise the legitimacy of the police in Northern Ireland. Surely it is reasonable to expect someone who takes office and takes charge of the police to recognise their legitimacy. That is what my amendment seeks to ensure.
</p>





<p><a name="st_223"><a name="60420-20_spnew10"><b> Stephen Pound: </b> 
 Recognising the police&#039;s legitimacy is one thing; having to swear a secondary or tertiary oath is entirely another matter. All Members of this House swear an Oath of Allegiance and we accept that. We have never been asked to swear a second or third oath and frankly, introducing an additional filter of oath-taking would be provocative.
</p>

<a name="stpa_125">As I said earlier, I do not speak for Sinn Fein in this House and nor will I, but based on my tiny amount of knowledge of the subject, the consistent political position of Sinn Fein, who believe in an all-Ireland party and who do not wish to sit in the legislature of what they consider another country, is understandable and legitimate, even if it is not endorsed by many&#151;about four, I should imagine&#151;Members of this House. It would be easy for them to turn up, collect their pay and rations and keep their fingers crossed when they swear the Oath of Allegiance. They do not do so and I almost admire them for that, even if they do not have my personal sympathy.

Given that attitude, can we accept the bona fides of such a person if they aspire to be a justice Minister in Northern Ireland?

 The description &quot;Oglaigh Na hEireann&quot; was in fact used for a different army on a number of occasions, as the hon. Gentleman is well aware. I repeat&#151;I hope for the last time&#151;that I cannot speak for another political party; indeed, I can scarcely speak for my own on many occasions. I say, in a sincere attempt to cut through the mist and obfuscation and the terrible dead weight of the past that hangs so heavily on our shoulders, that were I faced with choosing between an individual committing acts of terrorism or them being in a state legislature, choosing the latter option might well stick in my craw. I accept that entirely, and I cannot say too often how much I understand the difficulties that Northern Ireland Members have faced over the years, but given the choice of such a person being at the Dispatch Box or wielding a nail bomb, I am absolutely sure which I prefer.

If Sinn Fein were not involved and there was no Provisional IRA, nobody would be talking about constantly raising the bar in this way. What we are talking about is a disqualification mechanism when in fact, we should be thinking of mechanisms for inclusion. We are talking about a way of preventing people from participating in the democratic process when we should be drawing people into that process, and if they bring with them a trail speckled with blood, I must reluctantly accept that that was the past but that this is the future and people change.

 Will the hon. Gentleman try to see our side of the argument by answering this question? Ten or 15 years down the road, would he accept into the Government the people who committed 7/7 in London? Will he balance that with what he is asking us to do? Let us not forget that the Royal Ulster Constabulary was disbanded and its name blackened across the world to satisfy Sinn Fein-IRA, yet even though that was done and we now have the Police Service of Northern Ireland they still do not accept the PSNI, despite 50:50 and the Government turning cartwheels to accommodate every demand put to them.

<a name="stpa_128">I apologise for reiterating the first point, but it bears repetition: at a personal level, I profoundly regret any impression that I or any of my colleagues may ever give that we are less than sympathetic to the reality of life as it has been and is being lived in the north of Ireland. We understand in many cases even though we may be confused in some cases. We may sometimes be the victims of history or our personal prejudice, but if there is one thing that overarches every syllable that has been uttered in the Chamber over the last few years, if there is one aim and one light that we can surely walk towards, it is the possibility&#151;the prospect&#151;of that shimmering chimera of the future where we can have a peaceful community and reach not a nirvana but an unachievable situation.

But the alternative is to be for ever frozen in a bloodstained past with no hope and no future whatever. I am not happy with the situation. I do not like it, and in an ideal world I would have nothing to do with it; but we live in a real world and constantly to tell people, &quot;We will not allow you in unless you tick this box, tick that box, jump this bar and swear that oath&quot; is ultimately prohibitive and negative, and will detract from the one thing that every democrat in the House of Commons wants&#151;a peaceful future for the people of a Province who have suffered for long enough.

<a name="stpa_130">I want to make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that we are talking about the people who will be Ministers for policing and justice in Northern Ireland. They could be chosen&#151;and are likely to be chosen if there are joint Ministers&#151;from those who have engaged in the most heinous crimes imaginable in Northern Ireland. The current Sinn Fein-IRA spokesperson on policing and justice is Gerard Kelly, who, among his achievements, was responsible for the bombing of the Old Bailey and the attempted bombing of New Scotland Yard&#151;policing and justice in one go. The same person was jailed in the Maze prison and led an escape in which one of my constituents was killed by being stabbed in the eye with a screwdriver. That is a person whom we are asked to accept as a Minister for policing and justice in Northern Ireland.

<a name="stpa_131">My hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea) intervened to indicate that the hon.

Is that an outrageous suggestion? Is it so off the wall to expect those who will be responsible for policing and justice in Northern Ireland to say, &quot;We support the police&quot;?

<a name="stpa_133">The hon. Gentleman thinks that it is awful to ask those people to pledge themselves in that way. He says that we come to the House and we make pledges, but no one asks us to take a second pledge. Well, he asked me to take a second pledge in Northern Ireland, because he supported the enactment of the Belfast Agreement in the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which required a pledge of office to be taken by Ministers in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_134">A pledge of office had to be taken, because of the recognition that, in the special circumstances of that Assembly, it was necessary for those Ministers to pledge themselves to certain standards and behaviour. Is there something different in the office of policing and justice? Is it not more required in those circumstances that a pledge of office be taken? I fully support the proposition of the hon. Member for North Down, and I hope that, given the sincerity of Unionist Members and the severity of the criminal and other offences committed in Northern Ireland, the House will consider that it is a necessary requirement for the post that is being discussed.

 I am sure that the debate has certainly stirred the hearts of quite a number of Northern Ireland Members, especially given the contribution made by the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound). He tells us that we must live in the real world. With the greatest respect to him, no one, but no one, is living in the real world more than the people of Northern Ireland. We must tell the Government that, many times, they seem to be sleepwalking. They are not facing the realities of the situation. They are not part of the real world whenever they make demands and requests of members of the Unionist community or the nationalist community who have suffered grievously under all acts of terrorism.

Again, I say to him genuinely that there is no one who wants to see Northern Ireland in a peaceful and prosperous state more than the Unionist Members here today and the Unionist family completely. We genuinely want Northern Ireland to move into a peaceful state, but the reality of the situation is that, yesterday, a bomb was being prepared in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson), in Lurgan, by the republican movement. In the constituency of Foyle, a few days before that, once again there was a primed bomb ready and activated to carry out a dastardly deed&#151;certainly, we believe, of destruction and we were told by the police that it would have brought forth

<p><a name="st_237"><a name="60420-22_spnew1"><b> Stephen Pound: </b> 
 I read the details of the discovery in Lurgan with great interest. Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that the point is that those suspected of preparing that lethal device were identified by the headline of &quot;dissident republicans&quot;&#151;the very people who are trying to stop other republicans taking part in the democratic process? Does his argument not support my thesis that it is better to have people in Stormont than in a lock-up in Lurgan?
</p>





<p><a name="st_238"><a name="60420-22_spnew2"><b> Dr. McCrea: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, but people in Northern Ireland know fine well that the title of &quot;dissident republican&quot; has been used to cover a number of sins. In the case of some of the actions in the past, we have known that the dissidents have been working hand in glove with the provisionals. In that situation, we have got to ask ourselves, when does that title mean dissident and when does it mean something else? We know that, in certain parts of the Province, no dissident could do anything if the provisionals did not agree with it being done. They would not survive without that agreement, because the provisionals have a wonderful way of ensuring that people do not undertake action on their territory if they do not want them to do so. That has been proved in the past. We have to look at a situation in which neither the Police Service of Northern Ireland, nor the Garda from the Irish Republic, have stated with certainty what happened in the murder of Denis Donaldson, which could have been the act of the Provisional IRA.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_138">Yes, people can have a past. But the reality is that there has been no remorse&#151;or no expression of remorse&#151;from those persons who have been actively engaged, right up to the present time, in murderous activity. This House is being asked to give credence to someone who in actual fact has planned the murder&#151;not only given credence to, but actually could have planned the murder&#151;of police officers or members of the security forces. We are being asked to give credence to making them Minister for policing or justice. That is without any expression of remorse, regret or any other thing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_139">A Provisional IRA member was caught redhanded a few days ago, but then, of course, the provisionals stated that they did not send him out and that he did not go with their agreement. Now they are trying to say, &quot;Oh well, it wasn&#039;t approved by the army council.&quot; That is very interesting, because the IRA&#039;s last act before it started its supposed ceasefire was to be the murder of my wife, my children and myself&#151;that was its last hooray. The next morning the ceasefire was declared. Those responsible have never been brought to justice&#151;those who shot at my home, which was riddled by 60 bullets from an AK47, and directly at my daughter of seven years of age. Nobody has been brought to justice. What did the IRA say? The persons were not acting with their approval. Now, that would have been very nice if they had been carrying my wife and my children down the road in coffins. I would have been greatly encouraged if the act had not been approved.

To sweep it away and put in control of policing or justice in Northern Ireland someone who not only agreed with murderous intent, but was an active participant in it, would be an absolute insult, as well as injury, to the people of Northern Ireland. I am sure that nobody but nobody on the Government Benches would ever suggest that a member of al-Qaeda or those responsible for 7/7 in the city of London would be at any time a suitable person to be Home Secretary, put in the Home Office, or put over the police. We must especially bear it in mind that these people will not even be asked to support the police, or give a pledge of their support of the security forces.

When he talked about an attack on the police, he gave the impression that the attack came simply from the loyalist community. Talk about a revision of facts. Whenever there have been Unionist and loyalist parades, constant attacks have come directly from the republican community. There is a vast difference between disagreeing with a police decision in a peaceful manner, even if that involves stepping aside from the district policing partnership, and allowing there to be someone over the police who does not support them and has actively participated in campaigning against them and actively supported a campaign of murder against them. Trying to equate those two things pushes matters beyond the realms of what I can accept.

<p><a name="st_241"><a name="60420-23_spnew0"><b> Sammy Wilson </b> 
: We have gone over the issue a great deal, but I should like to take up a couple of points made by the hon. Members for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound) and for Foyle (Mark Durkan). There has been an attempt to use passion to cover up the lack of logic on the part of some Members who argued against a perfectly reasonable amendment. The hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) is asking for two things: first, anyone who is in charge of policing in Northern Ireland should not have a serious criminal record and, secondly, they should be prepared to support the police service, and give public expression to that support. I do not know why that generated so much opposition, as both requirements are logical.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_145">The hon. Member for Ealing, North said that there were two reasons why he could not support the amendment. He said that we should not confuse the past with the present&#151;just because someone has a past that does not mean that they cannot have a present or a future. He may have stolen those words from the previous leader of the party of the hon. Member for North Down. On the issue of whether having a past disqualifies someone for office, I believe that it is difficult for someone with such a record to be in charge of policing or to have any credibility in such a role. Setting that aside, proposed paragraph (b) requires Ministers in charge of the police service to give support at the present time to that service. I do not see why that should create a problem. How could anyone say, &quot;I wish to be in charge of policing in Northern Ireland, but by the way, I am so suspicious of the police service, or I have such antipathy towards it because of its past record, that I could not make a declaration of support for it&quot;? There 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Apr 2006 : Column 284</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>is no logic in that. The hon. Member for Ealing, North must have understood that, so he became quite passionate to overcome the lack of logic in the position that he had adopted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_146">The hon. Gentleman asked what it would take to make a member of Sinn Fein acceptable as Justice Minister. Let me tell him. I shall give some recent examples of the practical implications of not supporting the police service. A young girl from England, walking home late one night in west Belfast last summer, was raped by three fellows. They videoed it on her phone and sent the pictures to her mother in England. Sinn Fein would not encourage the people who had witnessed that event to give evidence to the police. What would it take? It would take members of that party at least to have enough willingness to support the police to encourage their constituents and those who look up to them to give evidence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_147">What would it take? The hon. Member for Ealing, North has sat in a Northern Ireland Committee and listened to some of the evidence given about organised crime in Northern Ireland. When the police raid the home of someone who has hidden &#163;600,000 under hay bales and hidden evidence of his fuel laundering and smuggling, it would take Conor Murphy and Gerry Adams not to attack the police for raiding the home of someone who is only a poor republican farmer and who supports the police process&#151;the implied threat being that by raiding that home, the police are disturbing the chance of peace in Northern Ireland. That is what it would take.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_148">What would it take? Let me tell the hon. Member for Ealing, North. I serve on Belfast city council. Every year the police give awards for a rambling scheme. When it comes to allowing council facilities to be used to give out those awards, Sinn Fein&#039;s opposition to the police requires them to vote against that every time. I am not talking about an individual member of a party. I am talking about the collective attitude of Sinn Fein towards the police. If the hon. Gentleman believes that some member of a party which adopts that attitude towards the police is fit to be in charge of the police and to stand up in the Northern Ireland Assembly and defend the police, answer questions about the police and explain police operations, there is no logic in that. I hope the hon. Gentleman will rethink his position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_149">I think the hon. Member for Foyle was having an experience similar to the experience that the Minister had yesterday, when he was trying to explain the circumstances in which the Secretary of State might refuse to allow the electoral officer to hold an additional canvass. He scratched around for reasons, and he came up with two&#151;yesterday, the Minister came up with three, but they were no more convincing than the two that we have heard today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_150">The first reason was, &quot;We do not believe in building in a vetting requirement.&quot; I have pointed out that SDLP members on the Policing Board believe that the members of lowly district policing partnerships should be vetted. The Policing Board has a vetting procedure, which SDLP members argued for furiously. The code of conduct will require people on the Policing Board to have due regard to equality and diversity requirements. That means that even if someone expresses a religious

<br>&nbsp;<br>belief in a private capacity that is deemed to be against equality and diversity requirements, they cannot sit on the Policing Board. Do not tell me about vetting.

<p><a name="st_242"><a name="60420-23_spnew1"><b> Mark Durkan: </b> 
 I have never said that the SDLP has no time for vetting of any kind. In negotiating the agreement, it was clear that the appointment would be made by the d&#039;Hondt system with no qualifications or vetting by any other parties, but the amendment would go against that aspect of the agreement. I also point out to the hon. Gentleman that the agreement included a pledge of office and that we have said that we would look again at the pledge of office, including in relation to policing.
</p>





<p><a name="st_243"><a name="60420-23_spnew2"><b> Sammy Wilson: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. I did not realise that my argument has such force, but perhaps he is coming round to our point of view.
</p>





<p><a name="st_244"><a name="60420-23_spnew3"><b> Mark Durkan: </b> 
 I assure the hon. Gentleman that the record of our submissions to the review of the workings of the Good Friday agreement in 2004 shows that we made it clear that the terms of the pledge of office might need to be looked at. We also made that point as far back as 2003, when the question of the devolution of justice and policing came up&#151;at that point, it was agreed that a series of arrangements needed to be looked at before that issue could be examined.
</p>





<p><a name="st_245"><a name="60420-23_spnew4"><b> Sammy Wilson: </b> 
 The hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) has given the hon. Gentleman the opportunity to move in that direction by including in her amendment a requirement that those who take on the role of Policing and Justice Ministers must pledge to support the institutions which they are going to govern.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_151">The second argument advanced by the hon. Gentleman&#151;that the amendment could have unforeseen applications&#151;was as weak as his first. The hon. Gentleman did not let the Minister off with weak examples yesterday, but the only example of an unforeseen application that he could provide was that the Ulster Unionist party in Belfast has withdraw from the DPP, which could be interpreted as not supporting the police. I will not defend the UUP, because the hon. Member for North Down is quite capable of doing so, but by no stretch of the imagination could that example be described as not supporting the police in the same way as Sinn Fein members do not support the police.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_152">We will support the amendment, despite the lack of consistency&#151;the position is no more or less important than any other office in an Executive in the Assembly, and the provision should apply to all Ministers and all ministerial posts. At least the amendment is a start, and when we discuss the pledge of office, hopefully the hon. Member for Foyle and his party will have changed their position sufficiently to include the provision in all pledges of office for Ministers in any Executive in Northern Ireland.

<a name="stpa_157">I understand why the hon. Member for North Down tabled the amendment, but I cannot support it. In the House of Commons, the disqualification arrangements for ministerial office are broadly the same as in the Northern Ireland Assembly. In this House, a person who is detained in prison for a year or more is automatically disqualified from membership of the House and therefore from holding office for the period of his or her detention. Section 36(4) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 provides that a person is similarly disqualified from the Assembly if he or she would be disqualified from the House of Commons. I can see no good reason to bar an individual in Northern Ireland from holding ministerial posts on the basis of any criminal conviction or to depart from the Westminster model.

<a name="stpa_158">I do not wish in any way, shape or form to equate the situation in South Africa, for example, with that in Northern Ireland. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound) pointed to three or four examples of individuals who have served criminal sentences in jurisdictions and who have gone on to serve their nation with distinction because, however much we may dislike the views that they express, they have ultimately, just like the hon. Member for South Antrim, had crosses put by their names on ballot papers by individuals in their communities. That is the test of democracy. They are in those Chambers with the legitimacy of those crosses, even if they have had convictions in the past for events that were, by any stretch of the imagination, intolerable at that time.

<a name="60420-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_159">If we introduce special provisions on disqualification relating to the Northern Ireland Assembly, they will not apply in the House of Commons. When I researched the amendment, I found, surprising as it may seem, that a

<br>&nbsp;<br>Home Secretary of today could have a past conviction. Provided that they are not in jail now, they could serve as Home Secretary. Likewise, no such provisions for disqualification apply in the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly. Although there are special and difficult circumstances in Northern Ireland, to introduce that condition would disqualify individuals on the basis of their past sentences, not on the basis of where they may be currently. Indeed, there may be Members of the House who currently could not serve in a Northern Ireland Executive because of the disqualification for which the amendment provides. That is unacceptable and generally unfair to society.

<p>
<a name="60420-23_para15">
<a name="stpa_160">Secondly, I believe that the protections for which the 1998 Act provides are sufficient. The hon. Member for Foyle mentioned the pledge of office. As hon. Members know, all Ministers in the Northern Ireland Assembly must affirm it before taking up their posts. It already requires them to make a commitment to non-violence and exclusively peaceful and democratic means. The hon. Members for Tewkesbury and for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) also referred to the pledge of office. The protection of exclusively peaceful and democratic means already exists.

We were treated like lepers and demonised as being against peace simply because we said no. How does the Minister reconcile our treatment with being so flexible with Sinn Fein/IRA at every turn?

<a name="stpa_163">This is a difficult issue. I have listened with passion to the points made by my hon. Friend&#151;if I may call him that&#151;the Member for South Antrim, and I cannot imagine facing such situations in my daily life, with my children facing machine gun bullets from an IRA terrorist. Having said that, should we bar someone who received a conviction 20 or 30 years ago from holding office? I believe that the rules that apply to the House of Commons should be the rules that apply to the Assembly.
</p>





<p><a name="st_253"><a name="60420-24_spnew6"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 The Minister has centred on the first part of the hon. Lady&#039;s amendment. I take it that he will come to its second part and, indeed, to my amendment. When he does so, will he tell the Committee whether he would be happy to have a Minister in charge of the police&#151;given the crucial role that they play in any society&#151;who did not recognise the legitimacy of that police force?
</p>





<p><a name="st_254"><a name="60420-24_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I want Sinn Fein to take part in the Policing Board and play a role in policing. I want to see that support for policing in the community.
</p>





<p><a name="st_255"><a name="60420-24_spnew8"><b> Mr. Peter Robinson: </b> 
 It is one thing for the Minister to say that the rules that apply in the House of Commons should apply in the Northern Ireland Assembly. If everything was standing on all fours, that would be a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Apr 2006 : Column 289</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>sound argument to make. However, that is not the case. The Executive here are formed by means of a voluntary coalition. The Executive that will be formed in Northern Ireland will be a mandatory coalition under the Belfast agreement proposals, and under any other proposals that the Government have considered. On that basis, there will be no Prime Minister choosing the suitability of individuals. As the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) has said, they will not be vetted in any way, so there will not be a similar set of circumstances, and that is why the conditions set out in the amendments must be applied.
</p>





<p><a name="st_256"><a name="60420-24_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I understand that point, but I stick to the principle that the cross on the ballot paper provides the legitimacy for a person to walk into a Chamber, and in my view the rules of this House should be applied separately.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_164">Hon. Members have raised points about the rule of law. Of course we wish to see the rule of law upheld. If the hon. Members for North Down and for Tewkesbury seek confirmation from the Government that the police service deserves full support from all quarters in Northern Ireland, of course I will say that it does, and of course the rule of law should be upheld. The answer to that is unquestionably yes. However, I must say, with respect to the hon. Member for Tewkesbury, that to impose a legal requirement for a person to support law enforcement organisations, in whatever circumstances, or face expulsion from political office will give rise to problems. I do not wish to fetter Ministers in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_165">Let me give the hon. Gentleman some examples. In regard to the separation of executive functions and operational independence, the Minister responsible for a police force has to be able to offer constructive criticism on the appropriate occasions to members of that police force. In addition, the Minister might have to consider appeals against decisions made by the Chief Constable or other members of the police force. That is the case with medical and firearms appeals, and a declaration of the kind that the hon. Gentleman seeks, giving full support to the police service, would be incompatible with the requirement for the Minister to act impartially on such issues.
</p>





<p><a name="st_257"><a name="60420-24_spnew10"><b> Lorely Burt: </b> 
 The Minister seems to be giving the second part of the amendment some credibility. However, the situation in Northern Ireland is clearly not the same as that in England. Given that the people of Northern Ireland have a history of worrying about involvement in policing, and given the lack of involvement by certain parties, does not the Minister agree that it would give a great deal of reassurance to vast numbers of people if the person responsible for policing had overtly given their support for the whole policing system?
</p>





<p><a name="st_258"><a name="60420-24_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her contribution. If we reach the stage whereby policing is devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, by the Assembly voting for it, the Secretary of State agreeing to it and this House voting for it, the situation will have arisen in which political parties in Northern Ireland are supporting policing. That will provide the confidence to undertake that.

 I have tried to say to the hon. Gentleman that support for policing is important and fundamental. On occasions, however, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will not support the police. As a Minister, he will take decisions that override the requests or decisions of the police.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_168">I am sure that the Minister is aware that all police officers in Northern Ireland must make a pledge when they become serving constables. That pledge is in statutory form&#151;it is in the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. Every constable must declare and affirm that they will

<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_169">If that is the requirement that the office of a constable must undertake, it is shocking that the Minister found himself unable to support the amendment this afternoon.

<p>
<a name="60420-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_170">It is inconceivable to me and fellow Unionists that the Minister found himself unable to accept that those with a criminal conviction might well have been responsible for the murder not just of one police officer&#151;let us remind ourselves that 302 police officers have been murdered in Northern Ireland. Does he honestly believe that it will inspire confidence and instil trust within the police service if a Minister cannot make a declaration in public of his or her support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland? Likewise, will it inspire trust and

<br>&nbsp;<br>confidence that those with a string of convictions hold an important ministerial post as either the Minister with responsibility for policing or for justice, either at six-monthly intervals or acting jointly?

<p><a name="st_267">This is essentially a probing amendment. We hope that the Government will give us appropriate reassurances that the devolution of policing and justice functions to the Assembly will not occur until that body is on a secure footing.</p>





<p><a name="st_268">We hope that the Government will not misinterpret the intentions behind the amendment. The Liberal Democrat party is a devolutionist party, and our policy for a number of years has been that policing and justice functions should be devolved to the Assembly. We generally welcome part 5, but the importance of policing to society was shown clearly in the previous debate, so we must be careful about when, and under what circumstances, those functions are devolved.</p>





<p><a name="st_269">The Northern Ireland Assembly has been suspended for three and a half years. In the period between the elections of 1998 and the beginning of the current suspension in October 2002, the Assembly went through a stop-start process, with various periods of suspension. Even when it was functioning, there were several crises involving the resignations of First Ministers and Deputy First Ministers.</p>





<p><a name="st_270">Given that instability, it would be wrong to devolve policing and justice functions to the Assembly. We cannot allow something as important as policing to be devolved to an Administration that does not look as though it will stand the test of time. It would be disastrous for policing to be in the hands of an Assembly Minister one week and the responsibility of a Minister in Westminster the next. Of all the areas of life for which Parliament is responsible, policing is one of the most fundamental.</p>





<p><a name="st_271">We recognise that the amendment may not be perfect, but hope that the Minister will be able to give some reassurance when he responds. It is relatively simple and provides that the Secretary of State could not lay an order before Parliament to devolve any policing or justice functions to the Assembly unless two conditions were fulfilled.</p>





<p><a name="st_272">The first condition is that the Assembly must have been up and running for a continuous period of two years. We chose that length of time because it was mentioned by the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach in the proposals for the comprehensive agreement in 2004.</p>

I realise that defining &quot;stable and secure&quot; is difficult, but I suggest to the Committee that we will know that the state has been reached when we see it.

 I am grateful to the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) for moving the amendment. I share her concern, in the sense that the conditions should be right before the devolution of policing and criminal justice functions takes place but, with all due respect, her amendment applies a precondition that is not necessary. We have already put in place secure processes to ensure that, should devolution take place, it does so with the support of a range of bodies and institutions. Under the terms of section 4 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, policing and justice will not be devolved until the triple lock, as we have termed it, is in place. The first element of the lock is that the Assembly itself must vote on a cross-community basis for such devolution before it can take place, so in the first instance, the ball is firmly in the Assembly&#039;s court. On the Assembly&#039;s not being &quot;stable&quot;, as her amendment describes it&#151;it remains to be seen how we define that&#151;she will doubtless recognise that the Assembly would want to devolve policing and criminal justice only on the basis of cross-community confidence in such devolution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_173">The hon. Lady has witnessed today the great strength of feeling that exists in all parts of the Committee on several issues appertaining to building the confidence that will allow policing and criminal justice to be devolved. The Assembly itself must first have such confidence. Secondly, the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland must agree to introducing the relevant order in this House; in other words, the British Government must first take into consideration the Assembly&#039;s stability, safety and security. Finally, the House of Commons must vote in favour of the transfer order before the devolution of policing and criminal justice can become a reality.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_174">With due respect to the hon. Lady, the two-year period to which her amendment refers would prove arbitrary. The Assembly, the Secretary of State and the House of Commons could support such devolution as soon as this December, following the Assembly&#039;s restoration&#151;we hope&#151;on 24 November at the latest. Alternatively, such support could be forthcoming in one, two or five years&#039; time. Establishing an arbitrary limit of two years would not add anything of substance to the safeguards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_175">As the hon. Lady herself seemed to recognise, every lawyer in the United Kingdom would find it difficult to define the phrase &quot;stable and secure&quot;. The use of such a phrase would not help the Secretary of State in reaching a judgment on the timing of devolution, with which section 4(2) of the 1998 Act already deals. I accept that

 These are essentially probing amendments. Schedule 2 requires that a nomination to the ministerial department with policing and justice functions must be approved by a cross-community vote of the Assembly: a vote in which a majority of Unionists, a majority of nationalists and a majority of all Assembly Members approve the appointment. However, by virtue of the Good Friday agreement and the Northern Ireland Act 1998, there are two ways in which a cross-community vote can be achieved. The first is the 50:50:50 method, outlined in the Bill, while the second requires that the vote is approved by 40 per cent. of Unionists, 40 per cent. of nationalists and 60 per cent. overall of Assembly Members voting.

<a name="stpa_176">The first method of achieving a cross-community vote was designated in the 1998 Act to approve the appointment of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. As we have seen, there were difficulties in achieving a vote on that basis. Can the Minister confirm that it is the Government&#039;s sincere intention to use that type of cross-community vote when the Assembly asks that policing and justice issues are devolved to it?

<br>&nbsp;<br>office in the case of the Minister for criminal justice and policing had in more common with that of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister than any other Department.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_178">I am reasonably flexible in the matter. Although 50:50:50 was our original choice, the amendment would mean that there were two methods. I have not discussed the election of a criminal justice Minister with any of the parties in Northern Ireland to take their views about what would be acceptable to the Assembly, but I am reasonably content to look into that possibility.

 I encourage the Minister in that flexibility. The only effect of the provisions as they stand would be that Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party would have an absolute lock on the appointment of policing and justice Ministers. If d&#039;Hondt is not used, only Sinn Fein and the DUP, through the office of the First and Deputy First Minister, will have control of nominations. If the Minister relies only on the parallel consent form of approval, Sinn Fein and the DUP alone will control the election to those posts&#151;hardly the spirit of inclusion, with no side deals and prior agreements, about which we are being told.

 I am sorry that the hon. Lady found my explanation as clear as mud. It was meant to be helpful to her. UK extradition policy remains a UK responsibility. Legislation remains a matter for the House.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_182">Following the appalling events in New York and the massive loss of life in 2001, a new arrangement was made between the British and American Governments that extradition procedures would be changed, so that a prima facie case did not have to be made either in the British courts by the Americans. Likewise, the reciprocal basis should be that the British Government need not make a prima facie case before an American court to extradite an individual.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_183">Since the Minister has assured us that extradition remains primarily or exclusively a matter for Parliament in London, will he enlighten us about why the Irish-American lobby in America, vast as it is, has been able to prevail on the American Government to ensure that the reciprocal part of the arrangement entered into in March 2003 has not been implemented in America, whereas the British Government have honourably implemented their part of the arrangement?
</p>





<p><a name="st_304"><a name="60420-27_spnew10"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising the matter. I hope that my muddy explanation helped, at least in part. As I have said to her, the Government believe that it is important to maintain a single legislative framework for international co-operation between criminal justice agencies and for extradition arrangements throughout the United Kingdom. For that reason and for the reason that I mentioned in my intervention, the provision does not transfer any legislative competence from this House to the Northern Ireland Assembly for these matters of extradition. Nor do we intend to do so in any future devolution under section 4(2) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_184">Instead, the provision is in place to allow Northern Ireland Ministers to assume direct responsibility for those administrative functions that fall directly within their control and which they are best placed to carry out. It may be helpful if I give the hon. Lady an example in relation to Scotland, where criminal justice and policing are the devolved responsibility of the Scottish Parliament. Under the Extradition Act 2003, a guarantee may be needed about the future treatment in custody of an individual being extradited to the UK jurisdiction. In England and Wales, that guarantee will currently be given by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on behalf of the British Government. In Scotland, because justice matters are devolved and the Scottish Parliament has taken responsibility for them, it will have to be responsible for any guarantees. At the point in the future when the Northern Ireland Assembly assumes responsibility for criminal justice and policing, there may be areas of administration where guarantees are required under legislation and a British Government Home Secretary cannot not give them because, for example, the Court Service and the Prison Service are devolved matters in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-27_para9">

<br>&nbsp;<br>a whole, under its international obligations. However, as now happens in Scotland, the administration of certain aspects of the implementation or operation of the legislation will be the responsibility of the devolved Administration. The purpose of clause 21 is to allow the administrative functions that can be transferred to be transferred, where it is appropriate to do so&#151;at the moment, I do not know all the details of when that might be. When the functions are entitled to be transferred, the Bill will give us the power to do that, without diluting in any way, shape or form the UK responsibility for extradition and for those matters that the hon. Lady remains concerned about.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_186">The hon. Lady mentioned the extradition treaty, which, as she said, is not yet in force. Some of its provisions were given effect in UK legislation by the Extradition Act 2003, which came into force on 1 January 2004. For the treaty to come into effect, it needs to secure the advice and consent of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee. As a Government, we are urging very strongly that that be considered at the earliest opportunity. Obviously, she will understand that it is not within my gift to ensure that a separate legislature, particularly in America, can agree that matter very quickly, but it is the Government&#039;s certain intention to ensure that the treaty comes into effect. Once the United States and the United Kingdom have exchanged the instruments of ratification, the treaty will come into force. I hope that that will happen as soon as possible. I hope that I can reassure the hon. Lady by saying that it is the Government&#039;s intention to make sure that it does. She will know that, in this House, Select Committees take their time to examine issues. The same thing is the case in the United States Senate, but I am confident that this matter will be resolved speedily and I hope that that reassures her on both counts.

<p><a name="st_321"><a name="60420-28_spnew4"><b> Mr. Robinson: </b> 
 New clause 6 relates to the recruitment policy of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and, especially, its discriminatory 50:50 recruitment policy. I state on behalf of all my colleagues on these Benches that we want the best of our citizens in Northern Ireland in the ranks of the PSNI, irrespective of their religious or community background. We want the composition of the PSNI to reflect our whole community, and to represent both its religious groups and the smaller ethnic groups. It adopted its present policy because of the low numbers of Roman Catholic recruits in the past years and decades to the PSNI and, before that, the Royal Ulster Constabulary. That was a direct result of the activities of the Irish Republican Army, which targeted Roman Catholics, who were less likely to apply to, and join, the RUC. Happily, many of them defied the terrorists and became members of the RUC, many of them serving in high-ranking posts with considerable bravery and distinction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_190">Discrimination is wrong. It is offensive, and it is against European human rights legislation, but it is authorised in recruitment to the PSNI. Some people may describe it as positive or benign discrimination, but it is still discrimination. Hundreds of fully qualified Protestants have been denied employment on the basis of their religion simply because there has not been a corresponding uptake from the Catholic community. The 50:50 recruitment policy requires a 50 per cent. intake from the Roman Catholic community and a 50 per cent. intake not just from the Protestant community&#151;the largest community in Northern Ireland&#151;but from all other non-Christian and ethnic groups. On 12 October 2005, the Secretary of State revealed in response to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell) that of the 4,413 applicants from the Protestant community who were considered suitably qualified to hold a post only 972 were appointed. That is a success rate of only 20 per cent. for applicants from a Protestant background. Of the 1,568 Roman Catholic applicants, however, 991 were successful, which is a success rate of over 60 per cent. To be successful in gaining admittance to the PSNI merit pool, non-Roman Catholic applicants were expected to score an average of 59 marks or 84 per cent., whereas Roman Catholic applicants were expected to score an average of 43 marks or 62 per cent. in the examination. It is entirely unacceptable that non-Roman Catholic applicants should be expected to score an average of 22 per cent. more than Roman Catholic applicants to gain access to a merit pool, in which Roman Catholic applicants are over three times more likely to be successful in achieving selection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_191">As Roman Catholic recruits do not need to score as highly as their non-Roman Catholic counterparts, there is a valid charge that less qualified Roman Catholic recruits have been successful while than their non-Roman Catholic counterparts have not, even though they achieved a much higher score. That creates the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Apr 2006 : Column 303</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>impression in the community that police officers working in the area are not there because of their ability to do the job but simply because of their religious background. That does not help increase the community&#039;s confidence in the effectiveness of the PSNI. The Government are prepared to introduce legislation to increase the number of recruits from the Roman Catholic community, but as non-Christians and ethnic minorities are classed alongside Protestant applicants, there is clear discrimination against both Protestant applicants and individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds. At a time when race hate crimes are increasing in Northern Ireland, the Government should be doing more to encourage members of ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland to join the PSNI.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_192">The imbalance in the RUC was mainly the result of intimidation of Roman Catholic recruits by the IRA. Applications from the Roman Catholic community were shown to rise from 11 per cent. to 22 per cent.&#151;double&#151;after the first IRA ceasefire, without any anti-discriminatory legislation being put in place. It is therefore clear that it was the removal of the threat against those applicants, rather than any unfair recruitment policies, that brought about a significant increase in applications.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_193">The Patten Commission took no heed of that fact in its report. It is inconceivable that anyone who was taking a serious look at the reasons behind the community imbalance in the RUC could have ignored the No. 1 reason why Roman Catholics were not joining. That meant that Patten was taking no account of the effect that the removal of that threat would have upon applications to the police.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_194">Catholics had shown that they had the opportunity to rise through the ranks of the RUC&#151;16 per cent. at very senior officer level were Roman Catholic. People simply want more officers on the street. They do not care what religion they come from or what their background may be. They simply want the best qualified officers who are best able to do the job of tackling crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_195">Although the scheme is designed to encourage Catholic participation in the police, the operation of the scheme is alienating many young Protestants, who are told that they are of the wrong community background to get a job in policing. There is a danger that in trying to solve one problem, 50:50 recruiting will end up creating another. Every Member from Northern Ireland has had experience of this from young people in their constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_196">The money being used to administer such official discrimination could be better spent on front-line policing services in Northern Ireland. While direct-rule Ministers constantly lecture the people of Northern Ireland about paying their own way, the Government are spending huge amounts of money on a discriminatory scheme. In recent weeks there was much publicity about the problems surrounding the provision of a new police training college in Northern Ireland. We are told that there is a lack of funding available to help build that college, and that it may be necessary to look for foreign investment to build it. At the same time we are spending millions of pounds enforcing the 50:50 recruitment scheme. The Government could help deliver world- class police training facilities, rather than enforcing discrimination in Northern Ireland.

The human rights of those who are unfortunate enough to be rejected on the grounds of their religion are ignored. Recruitment levels in the PSNI have ensured that the membership of the force from the Roman Catholic community is around 30 per cent. It is expected that by the time the review takes place, it will be around 40 per cent., in line with the percentage of the population that is from the Roman Catholic community.

 The subject of 50:50 recruitment is very emotive, but it must be put into a particular context. The hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) has said that the recruitment of members of the Catholic community to the then RUC was prohibited by the IRA, but that ignores the fact that before the campaign of violence by the IRA, the number of Catholics in the RUC was very small and totally disproportionate to the community structure.

<a name="60420-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_201">I say to those who favour the abolition of 50:50 recruitment that before the IRA&#039;s campaign of violence, there was a chill factor in the Catholic community, which believed that the RUC was a Protestant police force for a Protestant Parliament for a Protestant people. The Patten investigation into how the police in Northern Ireland could be fully supported by both communities and proportionately represented by both communities led to 50:50 recruitment, but it was not the only body to make that suggestion. In its third report on 8 July 1998, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee stated:

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for asking for clarification.

</p>





<p><a name="st_326"><a name="60420-29_spnew4"><b> Mr. McGrady: </b> 
 That was GAA rule 21, which was ignored in practice. The GAA did not and does not reflect the Catholic population&#151;it is a sector of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_202">Irrespective of that issue, I have described the attitude of the Catholic communities in Northern Ireland. In March 2001, Catholic representation in the regular officer corps was 8.3 per cent. The current figure is more than 19 per cent. That is a good increase following the application of the 50:50 rule.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_203">I can understand the problem that that appears to create for the Protestant community, but I hope that they would agree that the relatively huge, if not yet proportionate, increase in the Catholic population within the new PSNI is giving a new dimension to policing right across the communities. That support from the Catholic community is increasing daily as its members gain confidence in enlisting for the new police service.
</p>





<p><a name="st_327"><a name="60420-29_spnew5"><b> Mr. Gregory Campbell: </b> 
 Does the hon.

We do not need this false 50:50 rule to bring about a change that is occurring naturally in the absence of an IRA campaign of intimidation against those who join.
</p>





<p><a name="st_328"><a name="60420-29_spnew6"><b> Mr. McGrady: </b> 
 Between 2001 and 2003, the percentage increased from just over 8 per cent. to about 20 per cent. That was brought about primarily by the application of Patten, including the 50:50 recruitment policy, and people wishing to leave the service. How could the huge imbalance of the Catholic population in the police service have been addressed without radical action? It would take generations of natural wastage, and as a community we could not afford to wait for that to happen
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_204">There is an insinuation that inferior candidates have qualified for the PSNI and are now on the streets as police officers. That is completely incorrect. Every new recruit who becomes a police officer in the PSNI is fully qualified in every respect. The PSNI has the highest standards in terms of the quality of recruits, whether Catholic, Protestant or neither, and that is reflected in the high success rate of its officers.

Following over-subscription by highly qualified young people from our community, those numbers of suitably qualified candidates did not get positions because there simply were not the positions for them. A small element of that may have been discriminatory against Protestants.

<p><a name="st_332"><a name="60420-29_spnew10"><b> Mr. McGrady: </b> 
 The 50:50 rule is there for the obvious reason that we must ensure that the Catholic population, which the hon. Gentleman must admit was grossly under-represented, is represented within a reasonable time frame. The figure has reached about 20 per cent. According to Patten, the 50:50 rule was to continue until about 30 per cent. of regular officers were from the Catholic community. At the current rate, it will take approximately four or five years&#151;perhaps to the end of the fiscal year 2010&#150;11&#151;to achieve that 30 per cent. The Catholic population is much more than 30 per cent. but the 50:50 rule will be re-examined at that point.

<a name="stpa_207">There had to be a derogation from the European convention on human rights because of the marginal element of discrimination. However, I emphasise that it is a small element in the total rejections, and that can be proved. In accepting the slight element, we achieve the much greater benefit, even though some have made a sacrifice, of a police service that is fully representative of and fully supported by the communities so that, for the first time, young police officers can reside in some Catholic communities, just as they are returning to reside in some Protestant communities.

I believe that that arrangement has served the community very well. We can make political points about it and quote statistics, but the reality is that both communities are now providing good, well qualified young men and women who will serve our communities for years to come.

 I thank my hon. Friend for that point. In all the history of Northern Ireland, in which many difficulties have been and are still being encountered today, many Roman Catholics experienced difficulties from their community in relation to being recruited to the police or, having been recruited to the police, experienced difficulties in their family or social life. There was never a time, however, when a person from the nationalist community was told, in the police or in any other branch of public service, that they would not be successful in applying on the grounds of their religion. In the history of Northern Ireland, that never happened to Roman Catholics, but it is happening currently&#151;<i>[Laughter.]</i> It never happened, under any circumstances, and I defy anyone&#151;

 A number of false claims and arguments about 50:50 recruitment have been presented on a number of occasions. One claim that has frequently been made is that it is not working, but it is.

By 2010, according to Patten&#039;s projection, it will have reached 30 per cent. I hope that that success story encourages others to join the police service, not just Catholics but Protestants, in the knowledge that they are entering the service free from the perception that they are Protestants in a Protestant police service. The change in complexion and concept created by the 50:50 policy is there for all serving officers, not just the new Catholic officers but Protestants as well. People from all sections of the community can respect them as having been appointed on the basis of their vocational commitment to provide a policing service for the whole of that community.

If we were going to argue for open recruitment and fairness and that everything should be done on merit, we could have said, &quot;Everyone out, it is now open recruitment; it is now open sky.&quot; For a variety of reasons, clearly that was not favoured. So 50:50 recruitment and the creation of turnover by offering severance packages to serving officers alongside the retention of thousands of serving officers who were overwhelmingly Protestant was a compromise package.

People need to get that into perspective and context. The DUP opposed the Patten changes because it wanted to retain the old RUC and personnel as it was.

 My hon. Friend justified 50:50, as I do, knowing that it creates some painful instances. A young Protestant would-be recruit in my constituency spoke to me with great emotion and to great effect on the issue. I know that it is difficult and hard. When choosing between a 50:50 policy on top of retaining the thousands of people who were retained from the old RUC or total disbandment followed by total recruitment on merit, it is not so perverse or cruel to opt for 50:50 as people are suggesting.

They accept that, which shows a degree of fairness, openness and realism on their part. Moreover, the fact that the Catholic community, in the context of the new beginning to policing, is able to extend acceptance and accessibility to all members of the PSNI, regardless of their community background, is a source of hope and encouragement for us all.

Of course, the critics of 50:50 never admit that there has been a real step change in the numbers of young Protestants being recruited into the police every year.

 There is no statistical complexity. I have figures showing that 541 people were rejected because of the 50:50 policy and that 3,338 people were rejected regardless of the 50:50 policy. We all know that there was a very high number of applications and that far more people applied than there were places, but Unionist Members are trying to imply that all the candidates whose applications failed were rejected because of the 50:50 policy. That is nonsense.

Perhaps some Unionist Members would agree that, if Sinn Fein were to join the Policing Board and actively engage with and support policing structures in Northern Ireland, the need for the policy would soon be ended, because people in the Catholic community would feel much more relaxed about making their applications.

The court acknowledged that the recruitment procedure was discriminatory and cut right across article 9 of the European convention on human rights, and upheld it only because of its temporary basis.

The hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) referred to the Patten report, which recommended that all obstacles to young Catholics, including the GAA rules, should be withdrawn post-haste. The report was issued in 1999 but, if memory serves, the GAA did not withdraw rule 21 until 2005. It did not act speedily, so it is no wonder that the RUC ended up with a particular composition, which was the result, not of discrimination in the ranks, but of the undisguised intimidation and murder of Catholics who joined its forces.

<br>&nbsp;<br>discrimination against those who apply to join the police. Once again, we have heard the same threadbare arguments. We have been told that 50:50 recruitment is necessary because of the discrimination of the past, despite the fact that there was never a religious bar on people joining the RUC. Indeed, a percentage of places was held over for members of the Catholic community to join the RUC.

 No, it was not positive discrimination, because it was not a requirement that a certain number of recruits should come from one section of the community or the other. There was no system to discriminate against recruits, and the arrangement was voluntary.

<p><a name="st_404"><a name="60420-34_spnew10"><b> Sammy Wilson: </b> 
 That was the start of the troubles, when the percentage of RUC members who were Roman Catholics was in the upper teens. A systematic programme was conducted against those members, many of whom could not go home to their families&#151;many of their families did not want them to go home&#151;which led to a gradual reduction in the number of Catholics in the service.

That has placed many officers in difficult positions. However, it is completely wrong to suggest that there was any systematic attempt within the police to withhold information. I often speak to officers who had to make difficult decisions that they have had to live with. That is not a justification for the blackening of the police that has been attempted this afternoon.

He also suggested that we could have done away with the RUC entirely and started with a clean sheet, and that because we did not do that, 50:50 is justified.

No officer from England or Scotland would have been prepared to have their job decided on the basis of their religion, so the SDLP had to accept that 50:50 would not apply to recruiting people from England or Scotland because they would not have taken the insult of having their religion examined before they were found to be qualified for a job.

<a name="stpa_255">I want to consider some of the consequences. As my   hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell) pointed out, the 50:50 rule has led to discrimination against more than 3,000 people in the Protestant community. The hon. Member for Foyle can shake his head, but people who receive a letter stating that they have not been appointed on the basis of their religious background have already got into the merit pool. They have reached the required standard and qualified. They could be appointed as police officers but they are not. Those 3,000 people got through the process and received a letter telling them that they were of the wrong religion and that there were already too many Protestants in the pool, although they had qualified and been through the test. That is unfair. I do not care how anybody tries to describe it, whether as a temporary arrangement or something that helps to increase the percentage of Catholics in the police service.

<p>
<a name="60420-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_256">The 50:50 recruitment rule is expensive. The hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) can confirm that, because we have held many discussions about the matter on the Policing Board. The recruitment cost, not including training costs, of every police officer in

<br>&nbsp;<br>Northern Ireland is &#163;12,500 because of the contortions that have to be undergone under the 50:50 rule. It is not only unfair but expensive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_257">The rule is also inefficient because it applies not only to police officers but to civilian staff. In some cases, the PSNI advertised and received replies from qualified people who could do the jobs but, because no Catholics applied, no one was appointed. The most recent example was in forensics. Forensic experts were required to help with current investigations. No Catholics applied, although plenty of others&#151;everyone who is not a Catholic counts as &quot;others&quot;&#151;who were qualified did. No one was appointed because we could not get the balance. We end up without the job being done rather than making an appointment that does not reflect the 50:50 requirement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_258">The rule is unfair, expensive and inefficient. It should not be tolerated and it is disgraceful that any party that claims to stand for human rights and fairness supports it. The final defence of the arrangement presented by the hon. Member for Foyle was that this could not be discrimination because his party was against discrimination. That is what the argument falls back on. Just because his party says it is against discrimination, when discrimination is practised in its name and with its support, it is no longer discrimination.

<p><a name="st_419"><a name="60420-35_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Shaun Woodward): </b> 
 This has been an important debate that has raised several issues. While I hope to persuade hon. Members not to press the new clause to a vote, I also wish to put on record that I respect the very different views that have been expressed across the House, even though I disagree with some of them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_259">I also put on record that I share the emotions, the commitment and the rational argument advanced by the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley)? Our discussions this afternoon should do nothing to besmirch the courage, the gallantry or the reputation of former members of the RUC, or, for some, the enormous sacrifice that they and their families made. I do not wish to do anything other than echo what the right hon. Gentleman said about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_260">Let us be absolutely clear about this. The 50:50 policy is an exceptional policy and a temporary measure to enable the PSNI to be representative of its community and to do that in a reasonable time frame, with the target of increasing its Catholic composition to 30 per cent., we hope by 2010&#150;11. The policy is temporary and exceptional. I remind hon. Members of the comments in the Patten report, whether they agree or disagree with its conclusions. It stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;the main problem facing policing in Northern Ireland has been the political divide between the Protestants/Unionists and Catholics/Nationalists and the identification of the police with unionism and the British state in the minds of many nationalists.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_261">The report went on to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">&quot;This has undoubtedly had some effect on the rate of applications to join the police from the Catholic/Nationalist community, as has the active discouragement, sometimes including intimidation, which many potential recruits from that community have experienced.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_262">Why did that matter? It mattered because, putting aside the conclusions, Patten said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;community policing is impossible if the composition of the police service bears little relationship to the composition of the community as a whole.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_263">I also agree with the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound). Patten said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">&quot;The point is that communities as a whole should see themselves as having a stake in the police service as a whole. If all communities see the police as their police, there will be a better, cooperative partnership between community and police, and therefore more effective policing.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_264">It was in that context that Patten said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;It is the imbalance between the number of Catholics/Nationalists and Protestants/Unionists which is the most striking problem in the composition of the RUC.&quot;</p>

 I am afraid that, as the hon. Gentleman and other members of his party have left me very little time to respond to the debate, I cannot take his intervention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_266">Patten also said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42">&quot;The proposals that are made on composition of the police service are an essential part of meeting the five tests&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_267">that is, the human rights tests. For him, those human rights tests involved doing something to change the fundamental composition of the police force, because only a tiny fraction of the RUC was drawn from the Catholic community. Fewer than 8.3 per cent. were from that community in 1998. Today, that figure stands at nearly 20 per cent., with some 57,000 applications having been received to join the PSNI.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_268">I recognise the arguments that have been put forward today about principle, and that the tools being used to achieve this end might not be the ones that we would use if we were in an ideal position. The fact of the matter remains that we did not start from an ideal position but from one in which only a tiny fraction of a community was represented in the police force. To change that imbalance, we put forward these proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_269">The hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) referred to a range of statistics. It is important that we are not selective, so I want to put on record the basic statistics. In the first eight competitions, more than 28,000 applications from non-Catholics were received, of which 541 will have been rejected directly as a result of the temporary provisions. In other words, less than 2 per cent. of all non-Catholic applicants will have been rejected as a direct result of the 50:50 provisions. The latest campaign has seen the highest number of applications yet for the PSNI, with 7,691 applicants competing. This is the critical point, and the reason that people are being rejected&#151;nearly 8,000 applicants are chasing fewer than 500 places. That is the real reason that so many qualified candidates from both community backgrounds are unsuccessful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_270">The Government are keenly aware of how the temporary 50:50 measures also impact on ethnic minority recruitment, and we have noted the Chief Constable&#039;s concerns. As the Patten report makes clear, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Apr 2006 : Column 327</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>however, the imbalance between the numbers of Catholics and Protestants was the most striking problem in the composition of the police, above issues such as gender, ethnic minority and gay and lesbian representation, which have also been raised, though the commission rightly recognised their importance. Ethnic minorities make up 0.27 per cent. of PSNI officers. Of course, that should be considered in the context of a community in which ethnic minorities, including Travellers, comprise less than 0.5 per cent. of workers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_271">We firmly believe that these temporary measures are justified to correct an acute historical imbalance in the composition of the PSNI. Let me assure all Members, however, that the measures will not stay in place a day longer than is necessary. We are firmly committed to achieving a progressive increase in the Catholic representation in the police service&#151;for us, the figure should be 30 per cent. by 2010&#150;11. We are on course to achieve that, and it is absolutely right to be able to do so. In less than five years, under 50:50 temporary provisions, Catholic composition has increased from 8.3 per cent. to nearly 20 per cent., and it is rising.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_272">In the same period, female composition has also risen from 13 per cent. to over 20 per cent. We should be cautious about making comparisons between gender and religious background, as the issues are not the same. That was acknowledged by Patten, who recognised the need to increase the number of women in the police service but focused on the more important need of addressing the imbalance of community background in order to have effective policing. Critically, he recognised that the provisions should be temporary, lasting until the target had been reached.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_273">Hon. Members will be aware that these are exceptional measures that are reviewed triennially and will expire unless specifically renewed by an order. The current order allows for their continuation until 28 March 2007, at which time Members will have a further opportunity, both in this House and another place, for detailed scrutiny of these temporary provisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_274">Having carefully considered the amendments, and in light of the review this summer, the consultation that will take place with all the parties and the debates that will take place in this and another place later this year and early next year, before March, I ask Members to withdraw them. I respect their arguments, and we might disagree, but ultimately, achieving a balance of 30 per cent. is not only good for members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland but right for the communities of Northern Ireland.

<p><a name="st_422"><a name="60420-36_spnew2"><b> Mr. Peter Robinson: </b> 
 I shall not attempt, in the 30 seconds that remain, to wind up such a wide-ranging debate. I shall simply say that the Minister has been careless with statistics. The figures that he produced were inaccurate. Before the introduction of the 50:50 policy, the numbers had already increased from nearly 9 per cent. to well into double figures. The 50:50 policy therefore cannot take the credit for the increase.

<p><a name="st_430"><a name="60420-37_spnew1"><b> Mr. Martin Caton  (Gower) (Lab):</b> 
 What I should like to do in this Adjournment debate is, first and foremost, to celebrate the quality of landscape and environment in the Gower peninsular, the first designated area of outstanding natural beauty in Britain and the area that I have the privilege to represent in this House. I also want to celebrate the beauty and diversity of the 40 or so other AONBs in England and Wales. I shall begin by focusing a little on the history of our AONBs, and then I shall look to the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_280">Our story goes back to the period immediately after the second world war, and to the establishment of the Hobhouse committee that looked at the need to protect and enhance our most valuable landscapes and habitats. Hobhouse reported in 1947, and that report led to the legislation that became the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, which established both national parks and AONBs. Even then, national parks and AONBs were accepted as being equal in quality and value to the nation, but they were deliberately treated quite differently. The decision to treat them differently came directly from the Hobhouse report, which stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44">&quot;There are many areas of fine country in England and Wales, which are not included in our selection of National Parks, but yet possess outstanding landscape beauty, are often of great scientific interest and, in many cases, include important holiday areas. While, in the main, they do not call for the degree of positive management required in National Parks . . . their contribution to the wider enjoyment of the countryside is so important that special measures should be taken to preserve their natural beauty and interest. We recommend . . . that the Ministry of Town and Country Planning should designate areas of high landscape quality, scientific interest and recreational value as Conservation Areas.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_281">Under the terms of section 87 of the 1949 Act, those conservation areas became AONBs. Even then, Hobhouse&#039;s belief that these areas required no positive management was mistaken, as became clearer over the following decades. Indeed, that is especially clear if one compares the history of the national parks with that of the AONBs. In practice the 1949 Act did little more than create the designation &quot;area of outstanding natural beauty&quot; and make consequential provision for land use planning arrangements. Indeed, considering the flimsiness of their foundation, the most remarkable feature of our AONBs between 1956, when Gower was designated, and the end of the millennium was how much had been achieved in resisting the worst excesses of exploitation and neglect, without proactive management and earmarked resources. That said, the history of countryside protection during that period was very patchy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_282">After a lot of lobbying, the chairman of the National Parks Commission, Mr. Strang, and his secretary, Mr.   Abrahams, signed Gower&#039;s designation order on 9 May 1956&#151;50 years ago next month. We in Gower intend to celebrate that anniversary over the rest of the year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_283">So what is so special about Gower that led to it earning this early recognition, before other candidate regions? It is very special in many ways. Even though it covers only 72 square miles, its 23 miles of magnificent coastline are now designated as heritage coast. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Apr 2006 : Column 333</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Geological variety has given us a matching variety in landscape. On the south coast, we have marvellous carboniferous limestone scenery stretching between Worms Head and Oxwich bay. By way of contrast, in the north we have salt marshes, dune systems and the Loughor estuary. In between, inland Gower is notable for its attractive wooded valleys and its large areas of common, dominated by sandstone heath ridges and, most especially, the soaring sweep of Cefn Bryn.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_284">The Gower peninsula AONB includes 25 sites of special scientific interest, five candidate special areas of conservation, three national nature reserves, one special protection area, one Ramsar site, three local nature reserves, 23 Wildlife Trust reserves and 67 ancient woodland sites. It is also home to 83 scheduled ancient monuments and sites. Some 30 per cent. of the AONB is designated as historic landscape, and there are more than 100 listed buildings there. We have some 240 miles of public rights of way. All our beaches&#151;they are beautiful beaches&#151;passed the bathing water regulations&#039; mandatory and guideline standards. Last year, four Gower beaches got blue flags, and a further six got &quot;green coast&quot; awards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_285">We are also fortunate in that, in the years since the 1930s, some of the most valuable landscape areas in Gower have been acquired by the National Trust. Notable flora and fauna species on the coast include chough, peregrine and the rare yellow whitlow grass, which, I think, is still unique to Gower. The common land in the AONB also provides a valuable habitat for rare plants and animals, including southern damselfly, nightjar, black bog ant, marsh fritillary and the palmate newt. Growing on the commons we also find various heather species, royal fern, bristle bent grass, a range of mosses, bilberry, deer grass and three-lobed crow foot.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_286">During Tuesday&#039;s debate on the Commons Bill the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight), who will respond to this debate, highlighted the contribution that our commons make to national biodiversity. Gower is, literally, proof of that statement. Its commons are wildlife treasure chests, simply because they have not been agriculturally improved or subjected to regular pesticide or fertiliser treatment. However, they have come under various pressures in recent years, with different problems affecting different commons, such as increased use of artificial nutrients, overgrazing on some places and under-grazing on more, and land being torn up by motorcycle scramblers and other off-road vehicles. The Gower commons initiative has improved the situation enormously over the past five years, especially through the strategic placing of cattle grids to achieve better stock management.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_287">So that is a brief picture of Gower in facts and figures, and although such a run-down can be pretty impressive in its own way, it does not really capture the unique quality of Gower, nor its clear and historical identity as a separate and special place. It is right on the doorstep of the old industrial city of Swansea, yet city residents and visitors alike almost all comment on the feelings of isolation and remoteness that they experience in Gower, despite the fact that they are rarely more than 20 miles from the city centre.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Apr 2006 : Column 334</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_288">Although close proximity to Swansea creates many problems and pressures for Gower, in conservation, environmental and socio-economic terms, the contrast with its urban neighbour is part of what makes Gower special. From the point of view both of residents of Swansea and Gower and of visitors, the relationship between rural Gower and urban Swansea can be complementary: Swansea provides an ever-widening range of cultural, educational and leisure opportunities alongside Gower&#039;s contribution of rare natural beauty, fantastic beaches and splendid walks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_289">Over the decade since Gower&#039;s birthday, in a process that started slowly, about 40 AONBs have secured designation, ranging from the Solway coast to the north Wessex downs, from the Norfolk coast to the Cotswolds and from the Cornish coast to the Clwydian range&#151;their beauty matched only by their diversity. Over most of the past half-century, however, our AONBs have struggled under the inadequacies of the original legislation, which failed to provide them with management and financial resources similar to those for national parks. The unfairness and impracticality of that situation became more and more apparent as the decades went by and it became clearer and clearer that AONBs were not just the little sisters of national parks; indeed, the Cotswolds AONB is larger than any national park and in terms of tourist numbers, the Chilterns AONB receives more visitors than most national parks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_290">The financial and legislative weakness of the AONB system came into proper focus only in the last few years of the 20th century, with the Countryside Commission undertaking a fuller review of the working of AONBs, the establishment of an England and Wales AONB association and the distillation of some clear reform objectives. Thankfully, at roughly the same time, a legislative hook came along&#151;the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill. Inside and outside Parliament, we campaigned for amendments to require statutory management plans for our AONBs and the Government accepted the principle and introduced the   necessary changes, which is hugely to their credit   and the most important change for AONBs in their 50-year history.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_291">In recent years, we have seen a sea change in the status and professionalism of the management of our AONBs, which can and must be built upon. We have seen the Chilterns and Cotswold AONBs set up conservation boards under the powers provided to them in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, invaluable for AONBs that fall within a number of local authorities. The powers and responsibilities in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act have been backed up with financial resources&#151;until now at least&#151;through the Countryside Agency in England, superseded by English Nature, and the Countryside Council for Wales in my part of the world. The main funding vehicle in Wales that has benefited Gower is the sustainable development fund, which is being used to support 22 valuable green projects in the Gower AONB.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para13">
<a name="stpa_292">The word &quot;partnership&quot; has perhaps become too much a part of our conversations in this place and has been frequently used in the jargon of politics in recent years. But sometimes there are theories at the bottom of our jargon, and partnership really is the key to success for AONBs. That means, first and foremost, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Apr 2006 : Column 335</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>partnership at local level, involving local authorities and the local people who live in and around the AONB, encouraging them to maintain a sense of involvement and ownership, acknowledging that the aims of conservation and sustainability do not have to be in conflict with the needs of agricultural production or other forms of economic development, including tourism. That is not only possible but practical, as long as everyone recognises the exceptional quality of the landscape in which they work, although it also requires conservationists and environmentalists to acknowledge that sustainability does not mean petrification.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para14">
<a name="stpa_293">We also need an effective working partnership between the different AONBs in the country, with best practice actively disseminated and ideas readily exchanged. That is already happening through the excellent functioning of the National Association for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which goes from strength to strength, and which I am delighted to report is holding its annual conference in Swansea this year, so that it can take a leading role in celebrating the golden anniversary of Gower&#039;s designation. My hon. Friend the Minister has been invited and I hope that he and Carwyn Jones, his opposite number in the National Assembly, will be able to attend and can take the opportunity to go to Gower and enjoy its marvels.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para15">
<a name="stpa_294">There must be partnership between the AONBs, the responsible local authorities and the legislature and the Government, whether the National Assembly for Wales or Westminster and Whitehall for the UK. The all-party group on AONBs, which I chair in the House, plays a    small part in aiding communication between parliamentarians, the AONBs and Ministers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para16">
<a name="stpa_295">Most people involved with AONBs believe the future is far brighter than it appeared even a few years ago, but of course that does not mean that we should take anything for granted or become complacent. That was brought home to me just last year when the Welsh Assembly Government, in a consultation exercise about local government powers, proposed that the requirement to produce management plans for AONBs should be removed, just five years after the CROW Act had introduced that vital measure. Thankfully, they were convinced that that would have been a very big step in the wrong direction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para17">
<a name="stpa_296">Even now, the people who care about our AONBs still have their worries about future financing, when local authority budgets are squeezed; about the fact that AONBs are funded on an annual basis, when it would be more efficient to do so on a three-year programme; about how AONB interests will be picked up in the new regional spatial planning strategies in England and the unitary development plans in Wales; and, perhaps most importantly, about the fragility of some agricultural sectors, recognising the importance for biodiversity of appropriate stocking levels, especially on the uplands. However, we can deal with all those things by working together under the new legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para18">
<a name="stpa_297">As we said on the AONB association&#039;s display board that we put up in the Upper Waiting Hall, when we were campaigning for AONB provisions in the CROW Bill,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45">&quot;It&#039;s a new dawn for AONBs&quot;.</p>
</ul>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para19">
<a name="stpa_298">Unfortunately, the photograph used to show the sun rising, which I did not see until the day, was of Worms Head at Rhossili in my constituency&#151;of course, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>20 Apr 2006 : Column 336</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Rhossili is on the west coast of Britain and the photograph was actually of the sunset. That was an unfortunate mistake, but I was sure then, and am even more sure now, that that was not necessarily a bad omen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-37_para20">
<a name="stpa_299">I should like to finish, still on beautiful Rhossili, by quoting from the man sometimes described as the Gower poet, Vernon Watkins, the close friend of Dylan Thomas, whom Dylan believed was the better poet.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Mr. Caton) on securing this debate on the good work done in our areas of outstanding natural beauty. He is a tireless champion of that work. He has spoken with such eloquence, and my Department certainly appreciates his work as the chairman of the all-party group. Clearly, like me, he is influenced in valuing our AONBs by the beautiful example that he has in his constituency. My constituency, based deep in Dorset in the south-west&#151;a region blessed with numerous and varied outstanding landscapes&#151;has persuaded me of the importance of properly conserving and managing them and of the important role that they play in society and the benefits that they bring.

<a name="stpa_301">I recall my holiday on the Gower peninsula with my family some 10 years or so ago. We spent a lovely week camping there, and we enjoyed the very special landscape, the magnificent coastline and the wonderful beaches that my hon. Friend has talked about. I like to think that I have the nicest constituency in the country, but perhaps I had better define that country as England and leave my hon. Friend to claim the same for Wales.

<a name="stpa_303">I am grateful to my hon. Friend and to the National Association for AONBs for inviting me to the celebrations in July to mark the 50th anniversary of the Gower as our first area of outstanding natural beauty. I certainly intend to accept that invitation and I look forward to renewing my acquaintance with Gower. If I am given a choice between a conference and enjoying the landscape, I will certainly opt for the landscape.

Friend will, of course, be aware that my responsibilities extend only to those areas of outstanding natural beauty on the English side of the border and so I hope that he will forgive me if I concentrate on the English areas of outstanding natural beauty. I fully recognise that most of the issues of concern are similar in both England and Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_305">I thank my hon. Friend for his recognition of the high regard in which the Government hold AONBs, as well as our other designated landscapes, and of the increased funding that we have been able to provide for AONBs. Since 2000, funding for them from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has increased steadily, via the Countryside Agency, and last year amounted to more than &#163;9 million. Additionally, and in keeping with a manifesto commitment, I introduced a sustainable development fund for AONBs last year amounting to &#163;3.5 million. That equates to approximately &#163;100,000 for each of the English AONBs. The fund aims to meet the purpose of AONBs by encouraging individuals, community groups and businesses to co-operate together to develop practical and sustainable solutions to the management of their activities. It is administered with a light touch by the Countryside Agency and I am sure that it will continue to be administered in that way by Natural England, its successor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_306">I am glad that AONB management plans, statutorily introduced by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, as my hon. Friend reminded us, are providing a real focus for action and helping to facilitate co-operative working. I am pleased that I have avoided the use of the word &quot;partnership&quot;, to please my hon. Friend. The preparation of those plans has demonstrated the importance of a whole range of partners coming together to contribute to the vision and the practical management of each AONB. In delivering the goals that the management plans have set, it is equally important to move forward with that co-operation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60420-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_307">In the new delivery landscape, it will be important for our AONBs to work even more closely with Natural England than they have been used to doing with the Countryside Agency, English Nature and the Rural Development Service. In the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, we took powers to enable DEFRA, in suitable circumstances, to delegate delivery functions to AONBs, whether they are managed by joint committees or conservation boards. We also need to see AONBs aligning their actions with the priorities that are set out in the various regional strategies and frameworks, some of which my hon. Friend mentioned.

<a name="60420-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_308">As further evidence of the Government&#039;s commitment to our finest landscapes, I would point to the guidance that we produced a year ago drawing the attention of a wide variety of public bodies to their statutory duty to have regard to the purposes of AONBs and national parks when undertaking their own functions. I believe that that guidance has been generally well received. It has pulled requirements from a number of legislative sources into a single publication that has raised awareness of protected landscape issues and responsibilities to such landscapes. Previously, in some cases, that information was not particularly well known. Natural England will monitor how that works and will report on any significant problems.

<a name="stpa_309">I would also like to remind the House that the first two AONB conservation boards&#151;for the Chilterns and the Cotswolds&#151;were established in December 2004 under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act. They can provide for a more joined-up approach for large AONBs that cross a number of local authority boundaries. Early evidence suggests that the conservation boards have hit the ground running and are demonstrating the benefits of their new status.

<a name="stpa_310">Landscape is always changing through a mixture of human and natural intervention. The pressures on landscape today are many and varied. They include the effects of climate change, social and economic developments, changes in farming and land management techniques, and peoples&#039; increased mobility. My hon. Friend referred to some of the current and future concerns of AONBs. However, I can assure him that I remain committed to our finest landscapes and take every opportunity to defend them and expound their virtues when they are threatened.

<a name="stpa_311">The UK has recently signed the Council of Europe&#039;s European landscape convention, which aims to promote the protection, management and planning of all landscape&#151;rural, urban and peri-urban. I hope that we will soon be able to ratify it. We do not think that that will require immediate changes to policy or legislation because the UK already has such a good record in the area. However, we will use the convention to help to guide future policy in the normal course of review, which can only help to raise the profile of landscape to the same level as other considerations in many areas of our work.

<a name="stpa_312">I said right at the start that I was already familiar with the benefits provided by our finest landscapes for the past 50 years. They not only possess intrinsic beauty in many varied ways, but provide the facility for many forms of recreation, such as simple relaxation and reflection, walking and riding&#151;I remember getting very wet riding in the Gower peninsula on that holiday with my family&#151;getting close to nature, or undertaking more vigorous pursuits. Those, in turn, provide unseen mental and physical health benefits. There are obvious physical health benefits of going to the gym, but the mental health benefits of combining that with getting outdoors among the trees and wildlife are much greater. That is why many thousands of visitors come to the areas each year and stimulate the local and national economies. Of course, our landscapes have been the source of inspiration for artists, poets&#151;we just heard a
