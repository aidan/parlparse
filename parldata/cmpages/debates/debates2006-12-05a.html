I can tell him and the House that, two or three days ago, I had a long and very fruitful conversation with the Iraqi Foreign Minister, who told me how much better those efforts are proceeding, and how encouraged he is that people there are seeing some improvement in the situation. I very much hope that the next few months will bring the kind of improvements that he, and we, seek. On the issue of an international contact group, I can tell the right hon. Gentleman that for some time we have urged Iraq&#146;s neighbours and its colleagues elsewhere&#151;for example, in the Gulf and among the Arab states&#151;both to join the international compact to support Iraq, and to be prepared to be engaged in a wider group helping to support and assist the Government of Iraq in their endeavours.

The Government have now accepted that proposition. They abandoned what they said in November 2004 but so much time has gone by, in which so many retailers and food manufacturers have brought in competing systems, that we continue to have confusion. It would have been much better if the Government had listened to us in the first place and had put in place a system that was GDA-related and used traffic lights, and which could have commanded greater support in the food manufacturing community.</p>

We want to make sure that there are fresh foods that are freshly prepared in schools&#151;and if that is not possible as many schools do not have kitchens, technologies and opportunities are increasingly available for fresh food to be prepared elsewhere without it having to be cooked on site, and we should use them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="61205-0004.htm_para18"><a name="06120554000204">Let us look at the Government&#146;s record on sexual health. There is an epidemic of sexually transmitted infections. That was not the case up until the mid-1990s, particularly because of the tombstone campaign; the 20th anniversary of the launch of that campaign by Lord Fowler and the then Government is a couple of weeks away. That showed what is possible when a national campaign is conducted that is designed not only to focus on those who are at risk but also to change the surrounding culture. Not only did we have the best record in Europe on prevention of HIV infection, but we had a substantial reduction in other sexually transmitted infections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="61205-0004.htm_para19"><a name="06120554000205">What have we had since? Chlamydia is up 147 per cent; syphilis is up 1,653 per cent; and HIV infection is up 111 per cent. The Government have recently promised &#163;50 million for sexual health campaigns but they are actually spending only &#163;3.6 million on them. In the early 1990s, the then Government were spending &#163;15 million a year in real terms on the sexual health campaign. That figure has now fallen below &#163;5 million.</p>

<p><a name="st_o130"><a name="06120554000206"><a name="61205-0004.htm_spnew29"><a name="06120554000576"><b>Mr. Graham Stuart (Beverley and Holderness) (Con):</b> The failure of public health campaigns nationally and the failure to invest in sexual health campaigns is matched locally by deficits in the NHS. That has led to cutbacks in sexual health services in the East Riding of Yorkshire, which is suffering precisely the epidemic that my hon. Friend has been talking about. My constituents want to hear answers this afternoon from Ministers who have let the public down.</p>

When Ministers published the White Paper, they said that, in one respect, there would be ring-fenced budgets. That was supposed to be the case for sexual health, which was turned into one of their six priorities. The Department of Health&#151;strictly speaking, I should say the independent advisory group&#151;did its own survey. It went to 191 primary care trusts: 33 of them admitted that they withheld some or most of the funding; 51 said that they absorbed the entire allocation into their general budgets; and 31 said that they were withholding funding from chlamydia screening. On the latest data, only 36 per cent. of primary care trusts have been conducting chlamydia screening, but the figure for that is supposed to be 100 per cent. by March next year. The sexually transmitted infections record is disgraceful compared with that of the past.</p>

Targeting ought to be an instrumental part of the performance-management process. It is not the job of the Department of Health to performance-manage individual hospitals, trusts and health care providers on the front line. It should be the job of the Government&#151;when we are in government, it will be&#151;to deliver on public health, so when in government we will set targets that we will impose on ourselves, and against which we will be measured. In 1992, Virginia Bottomley, the then Secretary of State, published &#147;The Health of the Nation&#148; White Paper, which was regarded as the model of its kind&#151;the first public health White Paper from a major Government. Yes, it set targets, which was the right thing to do.</p>

Yet out in the field&#151;in places such as Bexley&#151;family planning clinics are being withdrawn and emergency hormonal contraception is being removed from pharmacies.

There is a book showing that there was a time, in the mid-1980s, when a campaign changedthe culture regarding protection against sexually transmitted infections. The next campaign will not be the same, but we must have ring-fenced budgets that are, in part, used nationally to deliver such a culture change.</p>

<p><a name="st_o140"><a name="06120554000219"><a name="61205-0005.htm_spnew7"><a name="06120554000586"><b>Peter Bottomley (Worthing, West) (Con):</b> The hon. Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry), who has a genuine interest in this issue, might like to consider that, by helping to change the associated culture, the number of instances of drink-driving by young men was successfully cut by two thirds in two years. Money matters, but so does the culture. Does my hon. Friend agree that if the Labour Members who keep intervening on him looked at the last two lines of the Government&#146;s amendment to our rather good motion, they would notice that the Government&#146;s justification for cutting funding for the south coast and elsewhere by about &#163;400 per person is denied by that amendment, for which they will vote? According to that amendment, the differences in morbidity and mortality will be addressed by other issues. The Government might like to give that money to the south coast, so that we can keep our hospitals and accident and emergency departments and treat people where they want to be treated.</p>

Friend makes; however, he will forgive me if I do not take a long detour in that direction. It is absolutely right that we ring-fence public health budgets, and part of the reason for doing that is so that they can be set at levels proportionate to the measures and programmes that are proven to have effect, in order that we can deal with health care outcomes directly. That does not mean, however, that that is the only way of dealing with health outcomes&#151;far from it. As colleagues in all parts of the House have made clear, in order to deal with poor health outcomes we must address a range of issues, such as relative deprivation, socio-economic status, poor housing, and diet and nutrition, among many others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="61205-0005.htm_para3"><a name="06120554000221">My hon. Friend mentioned alcohol. Alcohol-related deaths have doubled in the past 14 years and there was a 30 per cent. increase in alcohol-related hospital episodes between 1997 and 2004. Professor Roger Williams, a leading hepatologist told me:</p>
<a name="61205-0005.htm_brev0"><a name="06120554000417"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The situation is terribly worrying. We are seeing every week young women with end-stage or very severe liver disease and we never used to see as many before.&#148;</p>

The number of people using class A drugs frequently has gone up by a third, from 1.1 per cent. in 1998 to 1.6 per cent. in 2005-06. On cannabis, the Department of Health has had no influence on policy. If it had, Health Ministers would have persuaded their Government colleagues that sending the kind of messages they put out on cannabis use is deadly dangerous. There will be an epidemic of schizophrenia if young people in their teenage years&#151;many with a predisposition towards that disease in such circumstances&#151;continue to take cannabis at current rates.</p>

Where is the Government&#146;s action on that? Some 2,400 people with ruptured aneurysms go into accident and emergency departments every year; 50 per cent. of them die. What about men who are over 65? A Gloucestershire pilot&#151;I do not know whether the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda) is present&#151;looked at a screening programme.

In 1854, 600 people died from cholera caught from the infected water of the Broad street pump in London. But times change and the challenges are different today.

The figures for children dying before their first birthday are the lowest ever, and the latest figures suggest that the infant mortality gap between our poorest families and the rest of the population has stopped widening.

The healthy schools programme lays down the building blocks for our young people. Last year, we decided that we needed to highlight and prioritise healthy eating and physical activity in order for a school to become a healthy school. It is a voluntary programme, but more than 80 per cent. of schools have chosen to participate and are reporting real benefits, including the provision of at least two hours of sport and physical activity.

Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) suggested, we have found that parents who are asked about physical activity and what stops them letting their children play outside say that safety is one of the issues and that they therefore trade off playing outside against watching TV or playing computer games. That is why our work with the Home Office, local government, sports clubs and community organisations is so important in creating an atmosphere that is conducive to encouraging people to be more healthy in their everyday lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="61205-0006.htm_para9"><a name="06120554000288">Good voluntary initiatives do not end with the public sector. The food and drink industry has been working closely with the Food Standards Agency to reduce the levels of salt in processed foods, and excellent progress is being made. Many manufacturers and retailers have accepted the need for simpler front-of-pack labelling of salt, sugar and fat in food. When I came into this job, that was not a unanimous view, and they were discussing whether such labelling was suitable, but we are now at a stage where the industry has signed up to recognising its importance. We have agreed with the industry that there will be independent research to see which system works best for consumers. Early indications show that shoppers have found the multi-coloured, or traffic light,system most useful when they are running busy lives and trying to choose between one shepherd&#146;s pie and another. We will be monitoring the situation and providing independent research with the FSA whereby we can all agree on the best outcome.</p>

As has been mentioned, Ofcom recently announced its intention to restrict advertising, and we will keep a watch on that situation. That is another example of Government leadership. We made the case that there was an imbalance in the relationship between the advertising of high-fat, high-salt and high-sugar foods and children, and we wanted the regulator to apply itself to the problem. We will see what happens, and how the measure changes the balance, but we have left open the option of legislating in future, if we think that it is the right thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="61205-0006.htm_para11"><a name="06120554000290">Money and legislation have never been the Government&#146;s only tools. When a consensus can be reached, we may sometimes make quicker progress towards common goals through voluntary means, and we are open to discussions on those voluntary means. I am proud of the fact that the Government took a lead and contributed to a shift in emphasis, and to a consensus in favour of healthy choices and healthy living.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="61205-0006.htm_para12"><a name="06120554000291">The Government are impatient to ensure fewer needless deaths. We have a right and a responsibility to intervene more decisively, when that is required. The Health Protection Agency, which is unique and a true world leader, is a one-stop shop dedicated to protecting the general public&#146;s health from infections, chemicals, poisons and radiation. We are the first country in the world to introduce the meningitis C vaccine, and we immunised 13 million children in year one. Deaths from group C meningococcal disease have fallen by90 per cent. in all age groups, including among those not offered the vaccine. Thousand of children&#146;s lives have been saved and 10,000 cases have been averted as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="61205-0006.htm_para13"><a name="06120554000292">We have continued to promote the measles, mumps and rubella triple vaccine, which saves lives, and which has been shown repeatedly in research to be the safest method of gaining mass immunity to measles, mumps and rubella. I hope that all Opposition parties will support the best medical advice on that important issue. We continue to improve the protection that we offer to children in this country. In September this year, pneumococcal vaccine was added to the vaccines routinely offered to babies. It protects against a serious form of meningitis, and we expect it to save many children&#146;s lives every year. Our flu vaccination programme will offer 15.2 million vaccinations this winter, which is 1 million more than last winter.</p>

It is up to general practitioners and primary care trusts to make their orders for vaccines.</p>

The Conservatives face all ways, and they do everything that they can to avoid any long-term decision that involves change in any locality. The hon.

The explanation put forward is that mothers have a one-to-one with their midwife to discuss birth options, but surely the Minister would accept that one of the wider benefits of antenatal classes is ensuring that women receive good targeted public health messages. Some of them are about diet and exercise, which can help to get children off to a good start.

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="61205-0007.htm_para15"><a name="06120554000331">Much has been said about sport, and I want to take issue with what the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) said about the need for a lot more competitive sport. Those children who are a towards the end of the queue when the teams are being picked soon get the message and decide that they do not want to exercise because they do not want to make fools of themselves. That is not a positive experience. I have a pet hate about school sports days. Children who have little sporting ability in the traditional sense are often forced to enter races and be publicly humiliated.</p>

Too little thought is given to other ways in which children can take exercise healthily and find a method of exercise that is suitable for them. That could involve dance, games and all sorts of other things. I would ask that we try to get away from competitive sport in schools and think about increasing exercise and activity. This is happening more and more, but I worry when I hear people saying, &#147;Let&#146;s get back to good old hockey and football and other competitive sports.&#148;</p>

It is often a positive experience for families to exercise together. Recently, I went to a &#147;Skip to be fit&#148; session at one of my local schools. Everyone has done skipping at school, but this involved digital skipping ropes, and the children were quite excited. The emphasis was on learning to skip on a six-week programme with a personal improvement assessment at the end of it. The children were not measured by their peers, but by themselves. Such personal improvement initiatives are much more positive and inspiring for children than those in which their performance is compared with that of others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="61205-0007.htm_para18"><a name="06120554000346">I was intrigued by the fact that the Government have spent &#163;27,000&#151;quite a lot of money&#151;on pedometers. I have several pedometers, all of which seem to register different things. Most people wear them for two or three days and then chuck them into a drawer. What evidence base prompted that purchase? What analysis has been made of the cost-effectiveness of pedometers? We frequently talk about evidence bases: a new medicine cannot be licensed without a convincing evidence base. However, it seems that many well-meant public health interventions do not have an evidence base. With the varying inequalities in different parts of society, a little evidence about what works in different socio-economic or ethnic groups or on a gender-specific basis would be useful.</p>

A few years ago, the Select Committee on Health undertook an extensive inquiry on sexual health, and one of its recommendations, which is also one of my party&#146;s recommendations, is that sex education should start at primary school. Children at that age do not need to know everything, but it is important that they start to talk about relationships, which are an integral part of sex education. What conversations has the Minister had with her ministerial colleagues about that?</p>

Disappointingly, despite the chlamydia screening programme, even the last year-on-year increase was 4 per cent.

determinants of whether people had unplanned sex was probably the use of alcohol, which is the most commonly abused drug. Children are drinking at an earlier age. Government figures show that the cost of alcohol-related harm is approximately &#163;20 billion a year. The national alcohol harm reduction strategy was launched a year ago in a blaze of publicity, but some of those key commitments have not been met. The audit of treatment services has not been finalised and no targets have been published. Only one in 18 people who need treatment get it.

Member for Worsley, Terry Lewis, introduced a private Member&#146;s Bill on that? It was talked out and not supported by Conservative Members who then sat on the Government Benches.</p>

They have brought smoking cessation targets into communities that suffer ill health because of smoking. That link has been known for decades, yet it has been denied in this House when Members have wanted to introduce legislation to put things right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="61205-0008.htm_para20"><a name="06120554000383">The banning of smoking in public places is also good, although I should say that when the Bill was first published last year my view was that it could have been a bit better&#151;and, indeed, it was a bit better after it had passed through this House and the House of Lords and this House had a vote on it. As a consequence, we are going to bring in the biggest and most comprehensive smoking ban in public places. It is bigger than any of those that have been introduced in the seven states of the United States and than those in Ireland and Scotland, and Wales and Northern Ireland might come in before 1 July next year. It will be probably the biggest public health promotion that any Government have taken on. In campaigning against the smoking industry because of the ill health and deaths that it has caused over the years, I have received very little support from the Conservatives.</p>

week the trays of apples that a school in my constituency provides for its children. That contrasts greatly with a previous Government, who not that long ago withdrew the provision of milk in primary schools in my constituency. It is true that this Government could do better and could provide more; nevertheless, that contrast is the truth of the matter. As my hon. Friend the Minister said, it was the freshly elected then Conservative Government who, in 1980, reduced the nutritional level of school meals, and I still do not for the life of me understand why. Although this was not true of my family, for many of the families that lived on the estate that I lived on as a child, sadly, the school meal was probably the only hot meal that their children got. That any Government anywhere could reduce the nutritional levels of school meals is farcical.</p>

During an earlier intervention, I referred to an incident in September in a neighbouring Rotherham constituency that did not really put Rotherham in a good light. We had the spectacle of two parents pushing a supermarket trolley loaded with burgers, chips and the like through a graveyard and then passing them through the school railings to children who did not like the new school meals introduced by Rotherham metropolitan borough council. The council has been recognised nationally for its healthy school meals initiative, and the vast majority of the schools in my constituency have met all the standards that have been set; in fact, some were meeting them years before they were introduced. I have been interested in this issue for many years, and when I have visited schools during my time as an MP, I have always talked to them about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="61205-0008.htm_para23"><a name="06120554000390">However, during the week of the Conservative party conference, the Opposition Front-Bench higher education spokesman, the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson), said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="61205-0008.htm_para25"><a name="06120554000392">That was a dark time for Rotherham. Anyone who listens to the debate in Rotherham and who reads the letters in the local weekly paper that I am quoting from will realise what the reaction was. There was a heavy reaction against what those parents were doing. However, the result may be that we are having a better debate about food and health.</p>

I always make an effort to go to primary schools when such awards are made, because in constituencies such as mine decades of under-attainment in literacy and numeracy have led to many problems, including ill-health, as has been well recorded by public health professionals.</p>

The level of their debate was far higher than the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments about what happened at Rawmarsh school. As I said earlier, Opposition Front-Bench Members have a long way to go before they start tabling motions about public health, especially about obesity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="61205-0009.htm_para3"><a name="06120554000401">In general, public health issues are far more challenging than for the past 150 years. In the past, it was simpler to deal with things that had an impact on public health, such as sanitation, the lack of fresh water, bad housing and dirty air, before the clean air legislation of the 1950s. All those things had a bad effect on public health but they were reasonably easy to tackle&#151;be it by central Government or, in most cases, by local government. Of course, that is not to say that there is no bad housing or that housing could not be better, but its public health effects are not as great as they were in years gone by.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="61205-0009.htm_para4"><a name="06120554000402">The issues that will lead to public health problems in the 21st century are affected by the individual decisions we take each day, in terms of our lifestyles and of what we eat and drink. The Government have to tackle those things. In part, that can be done by education. Educational campaigns are a cheap and effective way of raising awareness of health problems, but evidence suggests that awareness does not always translate into changed behaviour. Adolescents do not necessarily smoke or drink less as a result of health education programmes. I have campaigned against smoking for many years and I have always felt that we will never completely stop young children trying cigarettes. There will be some success but it will never be total while cigarettes exist. The important thing is to continue those education programmes.</p>

consumption. When the Conservatives went into opposition, he got a job as vice-president of British American Tobacco. I do not know whether that was cause and effect, but the people there were not very happy with him at the time. Taxes on alcohol also reduce consumption. That does not mean to say that people will stop drinking or smoking, but there is an effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="61205-0009.htm_para6"><a name="06120554000404">One thing that we could do, and that has been effective in the past, is to bring in restrictive measures, such as the banning of tobacco advertising. Some of the big public safety areas&#151;outside this area&#151;include things such as seat belts in cars. I remember them being put in when I was first driving, when it was not compulsory to wear them. It was only when legislation was passed that take-up levels of people wearing seat belts became as high as they are today. The same could be said in relation to drinking and driving. When measurement was brought in and we said, &#147;This is an offence. You will lose your licence,&#148; things quickly got a lot better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="61205-0009.htm_para7"><a name="06120554000405">I want to finish with two points about where we should go in the future. As I said, I do not think that all these things are a matter for the state. I certainly do not think that they are necessarily a matter for the national health service. There is a lot evidence that other organisations&#151;I think that the Government call them non-governmental organisations or the third sector&#151;can have great influence in relation to what is happening in our health care system, or, perhaps I should say, individual needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="61205-0009.htm_para8"><a name="06120554000406">A note was passed around earlier about weight loss programmes in South Cambridgeshire. I have with me the outcome of research that was done on a slimming referral service in Derbyshire. The report is from the journal of the Royal Institute of Public Health. It was a collaboration between the Southern Derbyshire health authority as it was then, and Slimming World, which is a high street company that helps people to lose weight. I know that Weight Watchers does that too, so I am not advertising one against the other. The referrals are beginning to work. There is no question about that, looking at the report that I have here. It provides evidence that, sometimes, these types of referral schemes are better than going to see a dietician locally and being told to go away and lose weight, and getting advice such as, &#147;Don&#146;t eat this. Don&#146;t eat that.&#148; Instead, people sit in the village hall with somebody who has been through the process, who usually leads the class, and can tell people about how easy it has been.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="61205-0009.htm_para9"><a name="06120554000407">One of the things that struck me about this scheme is that, of the 107 patients who were originally referred, 97 enrolled, 62 completed the free 12-week course and 47 went on to self-fund the next 12-week course and did it themselves, and stayed with that weight-referral programme. There are experts out there&#151;not necessarily working for the national health service, but working close by&#151;who can help in many ways with individuals who have weight-loss issues, which, if not tackled, will certainly lead to disease and, potentially, an early death in years to come.</p>

what about the vast majority of kids, who are not much good at rugby or football at school? We always think that exercise is about people who are involved in one sport or another, but exercise could be going to school or work on a bicycle. It could be many things. We need to learn where there is evidence&#151;not just in the national health service; in wider organisations&#151;and make sure that that evidence base is the real area where we start decision making. The national health service should have been taking evidence-based decisions for the past 60 years, but, sadly, its track record on that has not been good. It is about time that we got better, especially in areas in which individual lifestyles will have an impact on public health in the years to come.</p>

I congratulate my Front-Bench colleagues on focusing the House&#146;s attention on public health as the core of this country&#146;s health policy. When we discuss the national health service and health policy, we focus too often on the machinery of health delivery, rather than the objective of delivering public health standards. The House of Commons is today holding the Government to account on the delivery of health outcomes using the national health service and all other instruments of public policy at their disposal, which is what they should be accountable for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="61205-0009.htm_para11"><a name="06120571000002">As my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) said, the fact of the matter is that there have been disappointing trends in a wide range of health outcome measures, such as alcohol and drug-related disease, the incidence of tuberculosis and sexual health. Those three measures have already been mentioned, but one could continue to list other measures of health outcome on which the value that the taxpayer&#151;and the patient, more importantly&#151;has received from the money spent on the national health service has been disappointing throughout the past decade.</p>

We were the first Government in office to do precisely that. The White Paper &#147;The Health of the Nation&#148;, which, I think, was published in 1991, set health outcome measures that defined the objectives for the delivery of health policy. The disappointing aspect of the past few years is that we have not used taxpayer pounds effectively enough to deliver those health outcome objectives.</p>

It is often said&#151;it has been said again today&#151;that the Conservative party has somehow denied the existence of health inequalities or the link between social class and health inequality, but that is simply not true. It is one of those oft-repeated assertions that does not reflect reality. Of course it is  <br>

true that social background and a wide range of other issues influence health outcomes and form someof the background to health inequalities. One of the criticisms of the Government is that their management of the health service has been insufficiently focused on using taxpayer pounds to address precisely the reasons why the national health service was established: to narrow health inequalities and to even up the experience of health treatment in different parts of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="61205-0009.htm_para14"><a name="06120571000005">It is not difficult to find out why the Government&#146;s record on delivering those objectives has been disappointing. Indeed, one does not need to look further than the July 2006 report of the chief medical officer to read many of the causes of that disappointing record. The situation is easily summarised. A vicious circle has been allowed to generate over the past decade, and weak public health discipline in health service management has led to weak commissioning. Indeed, for part of the Government&#146;s period in office, they were not even interested in the principle of commissioning. I am pleased that they now recognise the importance of commissioning in the management of the health service, but they are disabled from delivering strong, effective, evidence-based commissioning because of their long period of disinterest in both commissioning and the development of the public health discipline as the key evidence base for strong commissioning. Weak commissioning has led to misdirected spending in the NHS, which has led to poor outcomes when measured against health outcome objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="61205-0009.htm_para15"><a name="06120571000006">That has resulted in what taxpayers overwhelmingly now recognise in the record of the present Government. A huge sum of money has been spent on health care in our country&#151;a sum of money that, I am pleased to say, the Conservative party strongly supports. Government Members like to assert not only that the Conservatives are blind to health inequalities, but that we oppose the Government&#146;s health spending programmes. Neither assertion is true. What we oppose is unloading such a sum of money on the health service at the same time as weakening its management and thereby undermining its capacity to deliver good value for money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="61205-0009.htm_para16"><a name="06120571000007">Over the past decade, the national health service has failed to target resources on the real health priorities, partly because, in his time as Secretary of State for Health, the right hon. Member for Holborn andSt. Pancras (Frank Dobson) set out to abolish and destroy the structures that allow NHS management to target resources at genuine health need. Now, those structures have been reintroduced and the Government are struggling to make up the ground that they lost in their early period in office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="61205-0009.htm_para17"><a name="06120571000008">The House does not have to take my word for that, or the word of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire.

I hope that Ministers will tell the House when they intend to honour that first recommendation.</p>

Member for Holborn and St. Pancras was Secretary of State for Health did not believe in commissioning and made it clear that he intended to wind it up, so it is hard for her to make that claim for the whole 10 years in which Labour has been in office.</p>

Furthermore, he draws attention in his report to the fact that there is a twentyfold variation&#151;this is a health inequality among the different parts of the country&#151;in different PCT areas in their commitment to the public health  <br>

As well we know, of the 12 million smokers in this country, at least 8 million at any one time would love to give up smoking. I hope they now have a date to work to, so that they can plan their strategy. I am pleased that in general practice we can prescribe nicotine replacement therapy and that most practices, if not all, have nurses who are well trained in helping people to stop smoking. Coupled with the prescriptions that we are able to give on the NHS thanks to the Government, that is making an impact on the number of smokers whom we see.

Between 1988 and 2000 the number of women consuming over 14 units a week rose by 70 per cent. Approximately one in four 16 and 17-year-olds are hazardous drinkers&#151;that is, they have experienced immediate problems, such as loss of memory, injuries or failure to do what is expected of them, after a night&#146;s drinking.

They consume on average 9.8 units a week, compared with 5.3 units a week in 1990.

We need a much more sustained and consistent public health campaign to improve parents&#146; and children&#146;s understanding of the impact and benefits of healthy living.

extra funding should be available to establish and sustain training programmes for those involved in the care of children with obesity. That should be complemented with resources to allow children to gain access to specialist regional obesity services. We simply need more specialist nurses and GPs.

It was followed by a programme in which testing kits for chlamydia were made available for collection from men&#146;s toilets, including some in university colleges. Positive health behaviours must be promoted among individuals who are infected, so that they come forward to seek treatment and go on to practice safer sex. We must ensure that we go ahead with improving access to GUM&#151;genito-urinary medicine&#151;clinics. I am pleased that my hon.

strongest, pursuing hollow lines of attack without presenting clear policies or alternatives that we can debate. In their constant to-ing and fro-ing, defence appears to be the best form of attack. They have been at it for several hours without providing any proper debate, which is rather tiring. However, I thank them for raising the issue of public health in the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="61205-0011.htm_para0"><a name="06120571000063">Public health, as I said, is one of Labour&#146;s great success stories. As the Opposition said, for the first time we have a Minister with specific responsibilities for public health, who liaises closely&#151;this is a key point&#151;with officials in the Department as well as with welfare officials, with the Treasury on matters such as income equality, with education officials and, most importantly, with the social exclusion unit. Our strongest achievement in public health is the social exclusion agenda. We introduced the national minimum wage and tax credits, both of which have helped to tackle low income&#151;a major factor in poor public health. We introduced welfare reforms&#151;along with some Opposition Members who have participated in today&#146;s debate, I served on the Committee that considered the Welfare Reform Bill&#151;that command widespread consensus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="61205-0011.htm_para1"><a name="06120571000064">Public health is the key to delivering the welfare reform agenda. For example, encouraging people into work helps them to achieve better health. Today&#146;s debate, however, has had a narrow focus. We have looked at teenage pregnancy&#151;an important issue, I accept&#151;but it would be nice to broaden the debate. Since we have been in government, we have delivered phenomenal achievements in education. We have never seen anything like Sure Start and children&#146;s centres, which have revolutionised the way in which we deliver public health, enabling us to engage with young parents, including teenage mothers, in a radically different way. I have made any number of visits to Sure Start projects and children&#146;s centres in deprived communities in my constituency. I have seen children eating fruits that I have never seen before, and they were enjoying the experience. Recently, I visited a children&#146;s centre in the most deprived ward in my constituency. The vast majority of kids were from Traveller families, and a third of the children at the centre had special needs. Staff engaged not just with the children but with their parents, bringing them into contact with education, to which they have not had access before. That is public health, and we have delivered it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="61205-0011.htm_para2"><a name="06120571000065">Sexual health is an important issue, but it is difficult to discuss, both inside and outside the House. Parents, for example, are uneasy talking about sex education, sexually transmitted infections and contraception. We need to be more adult in our approach, and we must continue to raise the issue without embarrassment. The Labour proposal to employ nurses in schools is quite brilliant, as it would go a long way towards removing the embarrassment factor in sex education. I would argue, however, that the introduction of sex education at secondary-school level is too late. It should be offered in primary schools, and we should introduce legislation to that effect. It is fantastic that 80 per cent. of schools have taken part in the health schools campaign. It proves that if the will is there we can introduce change, so we should provide sex education in primary schools.</p>

Memberfor North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) and I want to answer her central question. She asked whythe Opposition have brought about today&#146;s debate. The reason is very simple: a central plank in the Government&#146;s public health policy&#151;addressing health inequalities&#151;has been a failure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="61205-0011.htm_para7"><a name="06120571000079">There has been much discussion this afternoon about the distant past, but in the near past&#151;the last nine years&#151;life expectancy has still been seven to eight years lower in the poorest parts of the country and the inequality has widened by two years for men and five years for women. The crucial reason is not a lack of good intentions, but a lack of understanding that investment in public health&#151;not in clinical services, however critical&#151;is most important for successfully addressing health inequalities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="61205-0011.htm_para8"><a name="06120571000080">The chief medical officer&#146;s annual report on public health spelled that out very clearly. He said that investment in public health was falling as a proportion of expenditure in the NHS, that the number of public health professionals was static and that public health budgets had been raided and used to fund deficits. We heard a raft of statistics showing why the Government&#146;s policy is failing. Alcohol-related deaths are up; tuberculosis infections are up; syphilis up; chlamydia up; obesity rising; smoking declining, but inequalities persist among smokers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="61205-0011.htm_para9"><a name="06120571000081">The failure to understand the difference between morbidity and mortality is critical because, in the end, the incidence of poor public health has to be matched with investment in public health and the incidence of disease has to be matched with investment in clinical services. The result of that misunderstanding is a grossly unfair funding formula.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="61205-0011.htm_para10"><a name="06120571000082">I would like to tell the House about my own area of Guildford and Waverley. The hospital and community health services budget for 2007-08 is increased by 2 per cent. because there are many older people, but it is reduced by 25 per cent. because of a lack of deprivation. What is the impact? Last year, my constituents had to wait twice as long as people in Manchester for ear, nose and throat elective surgery. They had to wait nearly twice as long for breast surgery compared with people in the Health Secretary&#146;s Leicester constituency; and three times as long for trauma and orthopaedic work as people living in the Prime Minister&#146;s Sedgefield constituency.</p>

is little point in rehearsing the arguments that we have heard. I was losing the will to live after the Opposition&#146;s opening remarks about public health, given its genuine complexity and their approach to it. I am grateful that many more thoughtful speeches followed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="61205-0012.htm_para0"><a name="06120583000011">We are considering a complex subject, but it is rooted in poverty, ill health and poor housing. The Government are tackling it properly, as they should. I remember only one line in the speech of the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) about health inequalities, but on many occasions Labour Members have identified that as the root cause of public health problems in our communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="61205-0012.htm_para1"><a name="06120583000012">I listened with interest to the hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt), who was naturally upset about the time that constituents waited for surgery. Of course, that time is much less than when the Conservatives were in power, but we are all missing a point if we do not do the work in our constituencies. However, one should not assume that South-West Surrey is the same as an inner-Manchester seat in the context of public health and waiting times. People in the former come forward much more easily and quickly for surgery&#151;there are definite health inequalities in some of our inner-city areas that we need to tackle. Until we have a proper intellectual debate in this place, that will not happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="61205-0012.htm_para2"><a name="06120583000013">I was upset to hear many Conservative Members&#146; comments about the fantastic work in our constituencies in the local strategic partnerships. They consider the way in which organisations such as local authorities and PCTs come together to tackle health inequalities in our constituencies. They deal with the fact that there may be huge inequalities in those constituencies and they have to micro-manage some aspects. That is why Sure Start has been so successful in getting into those areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="61205-0012.htm_para3"><a name="06120583000014">We have heard much about the edifices of health care and how some Members are stuck on having to defend a specific hospital because any closure is perceived as a cut, when innovative thinking is about getting away from such perceptions&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>It is difficult. I understand why Conservative Members have to laugh because innovative thinking is the real agenda and they miss the point about, for example, breastfeeding services in our town centres and getting breastfeeding champions out there, and reducing childhood obesity by ensuring that women are able and supported to breastfeed, not in some hospital but in our communities. That work is being carried out in a positive manner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="61205-0012.htm_para4"><a name="06120583000015">The ludicrous to-ing and fro-ing about who hasnot achieved what misses the point about what is happening in many of our communities. The subject is complex, but we must understand the difficulties and why young people risk their sexual health&#151;the madness on the streets&#151;and do not think about protecting themselves. There are myriad reasons for that and today&#146;s challenges are different from those of many years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="61205-0012.htm_para5"><a name="06120583000016">The new public health challenges are different and need a great deal of thought. The Government are giving them that thought and using evidence to tackle many of the problems. They have stopped the silly  <br>

Had the hon. Gentleman been here earlier to listen to my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood, he would have heard that point being explained extremely well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="61205-0012.htm_para11"><a name="06120583000031">Several public health issues have been ably raised by hon. Members today. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries) majored on sexual health, and she was quite right to do so. Ministers have said that by 2008, everyone referred to a genito-urinary medicine clinic should be able to have an appointment within 48 hours. However, as the average wait at the moment is 15 days, it would stretch our credulity to suggest that that target will be met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="61205-0012.htm_para12"><a name="06120583000032">The pièce de r&#233;sistance is that the Government have not yet launched their &#163;50 million advertising campaign on sexual health. On 11 November, almost two years after the then Health Secretary first announced the campaign, the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon.

relevant, I will announce it in the proper way. I am pleased to be an adviser to the Wessex Pharmaceutical Group, which covers a large part of the south-west, which I represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="61205-0012.htm_para14"><a name="06120583000039">My right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood referred to the fact that the chief medical officer&#146;s annual report states:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="61205-0012.htm_para16"><a name="06120583000041">Finally, how about the Government&#146;s attention to infectious diseases in general? In the year ending31 March 2006, they spent &#163;300 million less than in the previous financial year. What commitment does that show to tackling new and emerging infectious diseases, as well as the antique infectious diseases that have once again raised their ugly heads in our country?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="61205-0012.htm_para17"><a name="06120583000042">I want briefly to mention oral public health. The reason that I am interested in this subject is that, two weekends ago, I spent an enjoyable weekend learning how to put in fillings and to treat dental pain. That is something that the Secretary of State knows all about, because it is no longer categorised as a dental emergency. Oral public health means the services provided by dentists in the course of their work to ensure that there are no cancers and to give general advice on health issues. We find that, despite the protestations in the &#147;Choosing Health&#148; White Paper, access to NHS dentistry has shrunk. How on earth is that improving public health?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="61205-0012.htm_para18"><a name="06120583000043">The hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) discussed raising the age of sale for tobacco, and I am pleased to say that we support this proposal. I seem to recall that my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) was in the forefront of the argument that the age of sale should be raised to 18, and I entirely agree with him.</p>

Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)talked about substance abuse and asked about the rehabilitation places that we would establish when we are returned to government. Of course there will be a mixed provision of drug rehabilitation places, as I imagine there are under this Government, and I would cite the example of Clouds house in my constituency, which does excellent work in this respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="61205-0012.htm_para20"><a name="06120583000045">It is essential that our public health policy shouldbe firmly rooted in the evidence. Public health interventions impact on people&#146;s lifestyles, and can impact on our personal liberties. It is therefore doubly important that anything that we do in this place should be firmly rooted in the evidence. We must have fad-free public health. It is difficult to conduct large-scale randomised control trials in public health, and the Cooksey review appears largely to ignore the issue. The discipline is bedevilled by its precarious evidence base. The right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) referred to fruit, and of course fruit is important. My children enjoy it at school, but we have to assess the long-term implications of that policy. It is by no means clear that that particular intervention will be sustained in the longer term.</p>

There is evidence, however, of the efficacy of abdominal aortic aneurysm screening, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire mentioned. Between 2,000 and 3,000 lives could be saved each year by that screening, yet I know that the Minister has to date refused to meet the consultants who are conducting the pilot on that intervention, which is a great pity. Annually, that programme could save more lives than are likely to be saved by the smoking clauses of the Health Bill. We need to reflect on that.</p>

If the Minister wants a public health intervention that might work, remedying malnutrition among the elderly&#151;which, scandalously, often gets worse when they are admitted to hospital&#151;would be such an initiative.</p>

It says that there is a delay in producing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the disease, a failure to ensure that PCTs implement Government strategy once finally produced, and an ineffective awareness-raising campaign. Delay, failure and ineffective&#151;those seem to be pretty good bywords for this Government&#146;s approach to public health. The trust wonders why hepatitis C screening is not part of the quality and outcomes framework&#151;and given the scale of the damage likely to be caused by hepatitis C, so do I. It points out that the Department of Health awareness campaign on the subject cost &#163;2.5 million, as against the &#163;280 million spent on persuading people to switch to digital television. The campaign has been a failure, as the number of diagnoses has remained static. The cost of failure is likely to be enormous and I see nothing in the Government&#146;s plan for the national health service that will accommodate that failure through investment in hepatology. Given the Minister&#146;s failings on public health, she needs to give that close attention.</p>

From Harold Macmillan&#146;s home building programme of the 1950s, to our seatbelt legislation that has saved more than 60,000 lives, to the magisterial social marketing campaign of the 1980s that halted the advance of HIV/AIDS in its tracks, we have a pedigree in public health that gives us every right to table this motion.</p>

It abolished the word &#147;poverty&#148; from public policy, while allowing it to become a reality for one in three children. Too often, it has cried &#147;Nanny state&#148; when it should have offered responsible leadership. The Conservative Government left behind a battered and scarred society, in which public squalor and human misery were the reality for too many families and communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="61205-0012.htm_para29"><a name="06120582000055">Increasingly, however, the Conservative party is caught out facing two ways. In response to the announcement by my hon. Friend the Minister with responsibility for public health of an expansion of activities programmes for inactive people, the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) said in yesterday&#146;s newspaper that there is a financial crisis in the NHS, jobs are being lost and wards are lying empty, while money is being wasted on this gimmick. &#147;It is a disgrace,&#148; he said. However, the shadow Health Minister, the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) said that we have to consider imaginative solutions to get people active. He said that programmes such as &#147;Strictly Come Dancing&#148; have seized people&#146;s imagination, and that such a good way of keeping fit could keep people healthy and out of hospital.</p>

It attacks politicians for having a dialogue with people about responsible approaches to their health. Big government, it says, is watching. It says, &#147;Eat, drink and smoke.&#148; At the Conservative party conference in Bournemouth, however, almost 400 people tried to get into Forest&#146;s fringe meeting, and hospital staff were forced to turn people away, citing health and safety reasons.</p>

Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) seems extremely annoyed about the <i> Health Service Journal </i>publication. He says that it is propaganda. I cannot work out whether it is the photograph of my hon. Friend the Minister with responsibility for public health that concerns him, or whether he is offended by the photograph of feet. The serious point is that using such publications to make the issue relevant and attractive to people is far more effective than boring guidance will ever be.</p>

<b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 213</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para0"><a name="06120582000058">In contrast to the Conservative party, the Labour party&#146;s very raison d&#146;être is the belief that every individual, irrespective of race, religion or social class, has the right to fulfil their potential. My party has always believed that every child matters, that health care should be available free to all at the point of need, irrespective of ability to pay, and that successful individuals and strong communities march hand in hand in the good society. It is basic to those beliefs that without a healthy life people&#146;s aspirations and potential are blighted, and our society and economy suffer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para1"><a name="06120582000059">We are committed to an enabling state, in which we lead, educate and legislate appropriately, responding to 21st century realities with 21st century solutions. In addition, there is personal and corporate responsibility, with individuals as citizens, parents and opinion formers taking responsibility for promoting healthy lifestyles, and with companies exercising responsibility in the legitimate pursuit of market share and profit margins. We have a proud record, although we always acknowledge that there is a lot more to do on that agenda. Let me now address some of the important contributions to the debate from hon. Members on both sides of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para2"><a name="06120582000060">I always admire the honesty of the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley). In a recent debate in the House, she said that she regretted the fact that her party had misled older people and their families at the last election by saying that there was a possibility that they would receive free personal care. We will remember that when we see her party&#146;s manifesto at the next general election. She made some serious points about antenatal support and breast feeding. We are proud of our healthy start programme, but it is only a beginning. The Department is working on a new plan for maternity services in this country, which will offer choice to every parent and family in every part of the country. The nature of antenatal support and earliest interventions, such as on breast feeding, are a crucial part of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para3"><a name="06120582000061">The hon. Lady launched a strange attack on the virtues of competitive sport. She said that she was worried about young people going back to playing football and hockey. In my experience, thousands of young people around the country play football and hockey and do so happily. I accept that her point about considering the motivation of every individual young person, and giving them the opportunity to be active, is an important one.</p>

<p><a name="st_o286"><a name="06120582000062"><a name="61205-0013.htm_spnew0"><a name="06120582000641"><b>Mr. James Gray (North Wiltshire) (Con):</b> Will the Minister give way?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para4"><a name="06120582000064">I am always careful about how I respond to myright hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron). I have not yet appeared before the Select Committee of which he is Chairman. He drew attention to the historical scandal of the Conservative party paying scant regard to the question of health inequality. When the Conservatives were in government they actively talked out bans on advertising smoking and the idea of putting health warnings on cigarette packets. They removed nutritional standards from school meals. We all know about the reaction of the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson), who sits on  <br>

the Conservative Front Bench, to those parents&#151;possibly constituents of my right hon. Friend&#151;who stuffed hamburgers through school gates, saying that their children should be allowed to eat what they want. The hon. Gentleman said that he fully agreed with them. What kind of responsible action is that from someone who seeks to serve in a Government of this country? <i> [Interruption.] </i>I know that it is a funny prospect, but there we go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para5"><a name="06120582000065">My right hon. Friend was also right to point out the contribution made by the voluntary sector in local communities. It is often closer to those communities than the state ever can be in getting messages across and influencing the behaviour of individuals and people with whom it has a daily relationship. The Government sometimes have to be much better at learning how to engage with the voluntary sector to get our messages across to local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para6"><a name="06120582000066">The right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) is in denial about his time as Secretary of State. He was one of the people who refused to make the link between inequality and health, and he perpetuated that approach.</p>

<p><a name="st_o288"><a name="06120582000067"><a name="61205-0013.htm_spnew2"><a name="06120582000643"><b>Mr. Dorrell:</b> The Minister makes an assertion that is demonstrably untrue from the record. I was frequently asked whether I acknowledged a link between social deprivation and ill health, and frequently said, &#147;Yes,of course I do, and it is one of the functions of the national health service to target resources at eliminating those inequalities.&#148; The charge against the Government is that they have not done that effectively.</p>

<p><a name="st_o289"><a name="06120582000068"><a name="61205-0013.htm_spnew3"><a name="06120582000644"><b>Mr. Lewis:</b> The right hon. Gentleman was happy to serve in a Cabinet that believed that there was no such thing as society because we are simply a collection of individuals. He was also a pro-European until he sought to be leader of his party. He went to Chequers and gave a press conference, pretending that he had become a Eurosceptic overnight. That is his record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para7"><a name="06120582000069">My hon. Friend the Member for Dartford(Dr. Stoate) has an impressive track record on public health. He is right to say that the Government have taken a power to raise the minimum age for purchasing tobacco. We have just completed a consultation exercise on that and will respond in due course on how we intend to put that power into practice. He and my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis) have done particularly good work on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para8"><a name="06120582000070">My hon. Friend the Member for Dartford also raised the question of alcohol, a modern menace in society. We all accept that we need to take alcohol, and in particular drinking among young people, far more seriously. We are addressing a number of issues relating to that, such as working with the industry on sensible drinking messages and labelling, our know your limits campaign, and screening and brief interventions. We are also working with the Portman Group to appoint a chair and board of trustees of the Drinkaware Trust, which is a voluntary body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para9"><a name="06120582000071">The hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries) raised several issues, but in none of her contributions has she acknowledged that under-age conception is at its lowest level since the mid-1980s. I would imagine that she would welcome that. I agree  <br>

with her about the over-sexualisation of children as a result of gaining access to certain materials. I think we would all accept that the media and other opinion formers in society should take a far more responsible attitude to the way in which sex and sexuality are presented.</p>

<p><a name="st_o290"><a name="06120582000072"><a name="61205-0013.htm_spnew4"><a name="06120582000645"><b>Mr. Graham Stuart:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para10"><a name="06120582000074">The hon. Lady should recognise the achievements and the progress that has been made, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) did. Last week we announced an additional&#163;1 million to strengthen work on our sustained investment in targeted HIV health promotion for groups most at risk. There has been a large drop in the number of AIDS cases diagnosed and a 70 per cent. drop in AIDS deaths because of the uptake of antiretroviral therapies since the late 1990s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para11"><a name="06120582000075">My hon. Friend said that public health was a hard-core Labour policy. I would not have used that term myself, but I know exactly what she meant. She made a valid point about the work that the Minister with responsibility for public health does every day across government, ensuring that there is a joined-up approach to tackling public health. All too often, that is presented as a sole responsibility of the national health service and the social care system. We need policies across government to tackle social exclusion, and I pay tribute to her work in providing leadership inside the Government and outside in terms of the messages that we give to the general public. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire was also right to raise questions about health education in the school system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para12"><a name="06120582000076">The hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) wants a lot more money to be invested, as he would, but he also wants&#151;let us be clear about this&#151;the measure of health inequality as determining the nature of NHS funding to be removed. That sums up thetrue level of commitment to public health on the Conservative Benches. They want to remove any regard for health inequality as we make decisions about the way in which NHS funding is distributed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para13"><a name="06120582000077">My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) asked me to look at the healthy living centre in his constituency, and the desire to bring sport and education together. He also mentioned the work of the Do it 4 Real organisation. I am more than willing to consider those issues. He asked questions of the Opposition Front Bench, to which he got no answers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para14"><a name="06120582000078">The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) lectured us on the founding principles of the national health service&#151;founding principles that the Conservatives opposed at the time and which they have done everything possible to corrode and undermine when in government. Again, he never says that we are bringing up the levels of primary care trust funding, which historically have been below complement. He complained about historical underfunding. He isright: hon. Members should be concerned aboutthe cumulative effect of 18 years of Conservative Government that led to that underfunding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para15"><a name="06120582000079">My hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt), who has a great track record of having worked day in, day out in the national health service, talked about the importance of local strategic partnerships, recognising that at a local level we need a partnership between local government, the national health service, the voluntary sector and ordinary people&#151;family members&#151;to tackle the problems and raise our game in terms of public health. She made the point that that cannot be the responsibility of one Department, one organisation or one part of society; it has to be a partnership between the state, the citizen, the family and the voluntary sector if we are to achieve our objectives in this important area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para16"><a name="06120582000080">The Conservatives cannot advocate operational independence for the NHS and no targets, and then claim that they support ring-fenced funding and targets for public health. They cannot portray every reconfiguration as a cut, and then claim to believe in prevention. They cannot adopt economic policies that would mean savage cuts for the NHS and public services, and then claim to be the guardians of public health. They cannot surely keep a straight face in the context of this debate when they propose to scrap health inequality as a key factor in determining NHS funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="61205-0013.htm_para17"><a name="06120582000081">Public health is as much as anything a generational challenge. We are the party of Sure Start and children&#146;s centres; of universal nursery provision; of enhanced maternity and paternity provision; and of parenting support. We are the party of extended and healthy schools; of &#147;Every Child Matters&#148; and every family matters; of the new deal, welfare to work and affordable housing; and of the minimum income guarantee and the winter fuel allowance. We are the party that has transformed heart and cancer care and the party that has banned smoking in public places. We are the Government who brick by brick are rebuilding society, based on a new settlement between an enabling state and responsible citizens. The Conservative party may be led by a man who smiles a lot, but the British people are not stupid. They know that leadership requires a combination of sound values and practical action. A healthy future is built not on a nice smile, but on a commitment to sustained public investment and a long-term attack on social exclusion and inequality. Public squalor is the Tory legacy; public health is an expression of Labour&#146;s core values.</p>

The Government&#146;s policy on the west coast main line has been successful, but how would his policy of breaking it up and integrating it vertically succeed? There are12 rail companies that run on the west coast main line; how would the policy that he advocates be of benefit to that line?</p>

Both routes were due to be upgraded as part of the Government&#146;s 10-year plan, and both upgrades have been kicked into the long grass.</p>

Anybody who has travelled on the Maglev line in Shanghai could not come away with anything but the impression that we should look at such a project with great interest. We certainly should not automatically reject new ideas without looking at them carefully.</p>

<notus-date day="5" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 223</b><br>
the truth is that after nine years of a Labour Government, Ministers really should be able to do better than producing yet another detailed strategy document, at a time when Britain needs action, not more research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="61205-0014.htm_para12"><a name="06120595000021">I turn to the other major problem with the Eddington report. He is absolutely right to talk about the need for incremental projects, which are the best and quickest way to make a difference&#151;I have been saying that for the past year&#151;but his brief was to look at our transport needs post-2015. Are he and our Ministers seriously saying that we should wait 10 more years before getting the improvements that we so desperately need to ease congestion?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="61205-0014.htm_para13"><a name="06120595000022">What about the bigger, long-term vision that so many people in the transport world were expecting, such as a detailed analysis of the high-speed rail option. Of course, the one big idea that Eddington did put forward for Britain post-2015 was road pricing, but since that is already the current Government&#146;s policy, it is hardly a great breakthrough in thinking. I know that the Secretary of State has been desperately keen to hear the Conservative party&#146;s position on this issue and to get some political consensus, so let me finally give him what he has been waiting for, although I fear that I am going to disappoint him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="61205-0014.htm_para14"><a name="06120595000023">I do think that an element of road pricing and the increased use of road charges will be a part of the strategy of any future Government, including a Conservative one, but the Secretary of State and I differ significantly over the scale and pace of any move toward road pricing. Some road-pricing schemes will emerge locally as a result of decision making within an individual town or city; the key is whether they have local consent. It is not the job of central Government to impose them, as this current Government are trying to do by threatening to withdraw funding for towns and cities that do not obey their instructions by introducing road pricing. That is happening to cities such as Birmingham and Manchester, which have been left in no doubt whatsoever that if they do not pursue road-pricing strategies, they will lose funding for other transport schemes.</p>

<p><a name="st_o302"><a name="06120595000024"><a name="61205-0014.htm_spnew10"><a name="06120595000083"><b>Ms Gisela Stuart (Birmingham, Edgbaston) (Lab):</b> The hon. Gentleman mentions Birmingham. If we are to give local authorities the autonomy to take such decisions, would he not expect them to show at least some leadership? Essentially, Birmingham is saying nothing, and if local authorities cannot make up their minds, the Government are absolutely right to take this approach. Consultation is not simply sitting there saying, &#147;I don&#146;t know what to do&#148;; it is telling the people in what way they should proceed. What would the hon. Gentleman tell Birmingham that it should do?</p>

<p><a name="st_o303"><a name="06120595000025"><a name="61205-0014.htm_spnew11"><a name="06120595000084"><b>Chris Grayling:</b> I am sure that Birmingham councillors of all parties will be very interested to learn that the hon. Lady believes that the Government should instruct them to introduce road pricing. It is my and my colleagues&#146; view that such measures must emerge locally; they cannot be imposed by central Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="61205-0014.htm_para15"><a name="06120595000026">The truth is that the only proper role of a Government in such projects should be to ensure proper technological interoperability between schemes in different parts of the country; it would be daft to have a different box on the dashboard for each town or city that one happens to drive into.

Since then, both he and the current Secretary of State appear to have backed away from that position.

Are hospitals to open late so that nurses and porters can avoid the rush hour?

All that stands in stark contrast to the Conservatives&#146; 18 years in government, which saw two of the deepest recessions of the last century and therefore a policy of stop-go funding in relation to transport, with year-on-year budgets and arbitrary cuts to transport spending.

Far from apologising for rail privatisation, the Conservative party has in fact learned nothing from it, as we can see from its latest so-called strategy document that was published last week, which includes plenty of warm words about integrated organisations. Just as the Tories botched rail privatisation in the 1980s by fragmenting the network, they are now apparently proposing a further fragmentation by breaking up Network Rail. The party that broke up the rail network now proposes new plans to fragment the railways further. Its message to the public seems clear: &#147;Sorry we took a mallet to the railways.

The hon. Gentleman and his colleagues are right to identify road congestion as a major problem for our transport network, and they are right to identify the capacity problems experienced by our railways. They would have been right to identify the problems of declining bus use outside London, and it is remarkable in every sense of the word that they did not do so. It is quite remarkable that the party of Polly Toynbee has nothing to say about the mode of transport that is most widely used by the poorest in society.</p>

I have to tell the Secretary of State that the same fault can be seen in the Government amendment. The Liberal Democrats recognise the contribution that transport makes to carbon emissions, and we believe that to attempt to read Eddington on its own, without some reference to Stern, is a sterile effort.</p>

If our trains are failing, it surely has more than a little to do with the way in which our train system was privatised. If our bus services are failing, it has more than a little to do with the way in which they were deregulated in the 1980s. If our roads are congested, that is surely a result of the Conservative Government&#146;s view that we could build our way out of congestion. The Conservative position on road user pricing as outlined tonight is quite the most remarkable piece of work of all.

one of the rolling stock companies, who gave me an insight into the way in which the Government now approach the provision of rolling stock. He told me that the north-west franchise currently operates with 10-carriage trains; predicted growth is such that the ROSCO wants to provide 12-carriage trains, but the Government are blocking that and insisting on an increase to only 11-carriage trains. It seems bizarre. The ROSCO wants to provide the rolling stock and the train operating company wants the ROSCO to provide the rolling stock. Surely, the role for Government should be to get out of the picture and let them get on with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="61205-0017.htm_para6"><a name="061205105000023">I also welcome the acceptance by Sir Rod that aviation should pay its way in terms of its carbon cost. I do not see how we can regard the present taxation regime in aviation as being in any way sustainable. It is bizarre that we tax passengers through air passenger duty, but not freight. Surely the plane pollutes just as much, whether it is carrying freight or people. Indeed, freight probably pollutes more, because it tends to use older, more polluting aircraft. The Eddington report contains much good analysis of that sort, but still ends up with the conclusion that we need an extra runway at Heathrow.</p>

Whatever is stated in the report about Crossrail is fairly supportive of the concept&#151;that is, Sir Rod Eddington is supportive of the concept, but again, he recognises that there is a substantial financial commitment to be made by the Government. There is not much point in getting too excited about Crossrail unless and until that commitment is made. The report was, perhaps, a missed opportunity in that respect, as it was commissioned by the Chancellor. Something more trenchant on the subject of Crossrail might have elicited a rather more detailed and meaningful response from the Treasury than we have had to date.

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="61205-0017.htm_para17"><a name="061205105000043">I want to talk about a transport vision for the Thames valley. I think that it is fair to say that I have always been prepared to work on a cross-party basis on issues where a consensus can be achieved. As such, I have been pleased to work with hon. Members from Berkshire and with Thames Valley Economic Partnership in drawing up a six- point plan for investment in the Thames valley transport infrastructure. That plan, entitled &#147;Thames Valley&#151;Sustaining our Success&#148;, was presented to Transport Ministers this morning by a delegation including representatives of major Thames Valley companies such as Dell, Oracle, Prudential, Siemens, Microsoft and Vodafone, together with the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May), my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart), and myself&#151;but sadly not the hon. Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson), who has now left the Chamber. The plan states that</p>
<a name="61205-0017.htm_brev2"><a name="061205105000064"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the thriving Thames Valley provides the thrust of Britain&#146;s economic success. Its businesses and the people who work here generate a larger slice of revenue for the government than anywhere outside central London. Europe&#146;s leading financial centre is dependent on support from the global companies based in the Thames Valley for the operation of their systems.</p>
</ul><a name="61205-0017.htm_brev3"><a name="061205105000065"><ul><p class="tabletext">A modern, well-ordered road system coupled with highly efficient public transport is also a pre-requisite for success. People need to be able to get to and from work quickly, safely, cheaply, and with a minimum of stress. Those buying or selling goods and services need to have access to fast, reliable transport. Since the Thames Valley is a location of choice as European or global headquarters for many businesses, travellers need to be able to make fast, seamless connections to London Heathrow Airport. Unfortunately the present infrastructure is failing the economy of the Thames Valley.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="61205-0017.htm_para18"><a name="061205105000044">I should like to put on record my thanks to the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Lincoln (Gillian Merron), for the patient way in which she listened to that comprehensive presentation from members of all political parties and from some very powerful players in the Thames valley economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="61205-0017.htm_para19"><a name="061205105000045">The six priorities identified for investment, totalling between &#163;1.5 billion and &#163;2 billion, are as follows. First, and most importantly, there is the proposed Reading station upgrade to remove the bottlenecks on the Great Western main line. Secondly, there is the proposed AirTrack scheme, which BAA has announced that it intends to promote and which will provide rail access to Heathrow airport. Thirdly, there is the proposal for a direct link to Heathrow from the west via the Great Western main line. It is an utter disgrace that although we have the driving force of the Thames valley economy and companies that deliberately located there because of the proximity to the M4, to London and to Heathrow airport, we have no direct rail access to the major airport covering not only this capital but this country. Fourthly, there is the proposal to upgrade the north-south linkages in the Thames valley, particularly the M3 to M4 to M40 road connections. Fifthly, and more controversially, there is the proposal to widen the M4 on a phased basis&#151;luckily not around Reading but around Slough and Maidenhead. Sixthly, there is the proposal to provide a Thames valley rapid transport system. All those  <br>

schemes require significant public investment, and it is highly unlikely that any of them would see the light of day under a Conservative spending regime, past or present. However, as I said, I am pleased with the positive reception that the Minister gave us, even if she did not get her cheque book out this morning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="61205-0017.htm_para20"><a name="061205105000046">I want to highlight the Conservatives&#146; political positioning on three of those six schemes&#151;political positioning to which they have already owned up. The first of the schemes is the upgrading of the north-south M4-M40 road connections. In Reading, that would mean the construction of the long-awaited third Thames bridge, a proposal that is promoted by Wokingham and Reading councils, but blocked by the Oxfordshire Tories. In fact, the Tory tactical positioning is so complex that the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) will not even sit in the same room as the right hon. Members for Maidenhead, and for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), and the hon. Member for Reading, East, and myself to discuss the third Thames bridge, which we all support, and which our constituents desperately need. There comes a point when seeking refuge in the argument of localism cuts no ice, because there are major strategic schemes that need to happen, and parish-pump politics cannot be allowed to get in the way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="61205-0017.htm_para21"><a name="061205105000047">Secondly, I want to mention the scheme for rail access to Heathrow airport. That, at least, is an issue on which we can all agree, but it is far from clear how such rail access will be achieved. In my evidence to the Select Committee on the Crossrail Bill, I argued strongly for the inclusion of a western rail link to Heathrow. Although that is not part of the original Crossrail scheme, it will be an opportunity lost if we do not use Crossrail to resolve one of the major bugbears facing business travellers and commuters in the region. Figures presented to the Minister today by theThames Valley Economic Partnership show that the major companies in the region spend no less than&#163;8.25 million a year on taxis to run customers and clients to London&#146;s Heathrow airport from places such as Vodafone&#146;s premises in Newbury, and Microsoft and Oracle&#146;s premises in Reading, all because we do not have proper rail access. Those cabs pour out carbon emissions and clog up the roads. I doubt whether Crossrail will ever provide the immediate solution that we seek, which is why I support the AirTrack proposals from BAA, and I encourage hon. Members to do likewise. That will deliver rail access from Reading via Bracknell, Wokingham and Staines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="61205-0017.htm_para22"><a name="061205105000048">Finally, I turn to the upgrade of Reading station. Reading is the second busiest station outside London, providing direct train services to more than 360 towns and cities across Britain, as well as coach services to three of the four terminals at Heathrow airport. More than 20 million passengers use the station interchange each year, some of whom connect to it by one of more than 200 buses and coaches that serve it during peak hours. The station does not have enough platforms or track capacity to accommodate the frequency of services, especially at peak times. That is coupled with a busy junction at Reading West, which is heavily used by south-north freight services. The result is that passenger services are held up by congestion. That bottleneck affects the reliability of rail services across a  <br>

vast region, from Paddington as far north as Birmingham, and from south Wales to the extreme south-west.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="61205-0017.htm_para23"><a name="061205105000049">A core scheme addressing some of the issues has already been developed. It would cost &#163;68 million and could deliver substantial benefits to the region. The core scheme has been worked up by the Reading Station Partnership Board, which is led by Reading borough council and which comprises representatives from the Government office for the south-east, Network Rail, the South East England Development Agency, SERA and the Department for Transport. A formal bid was submitted in March this year. Ministers have acknowledged, in the House, the need to upgrade Reading station, for all the reasons that I have given. We await the final assessment of the Reading Station Partnership Board with some confidence and much hope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="61205-0017.htm_para24"><a name="061205105000050">Unfortunately, that is the point at which consensus breaks down and good old Tory tactical positioning rears its ugly head again. There was an excellent degree of cross-party support for the Thames Valley Economic Partnership submission, but by stark contrast, the submission on the Reading station upgrade was the subject of silly party political games by the hon. Member for Reading, East, to whom I gave notice of the fact that I would refer to him in this debate. He has been utterly shameless in trying to claim credit for the hard work of others&#151;so shameless, in fact, that his conduct is worthy of the Liberal Democrats. That should surprise no one; after all, he once stood for election as part of the Alliance between the Social Democratic party and the Liberals, before he discovered his undying allegiance to the Conservative party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="61205-0017.htm_para25"><a name="061205105000051">Instead of working in partnership with Reading borough council and the members of the Reading Station Partnership Board, which was formed in 2001&#151;well before the hon. Gentleman became an MP&#151;he has tried to undermine the work of the board by seeking to set up his own stakeholder group, to which no other elected representatives in Reading are invited. He tries to drum up support for early-day motions that imply that the Government are blocking progress on Reading station, when in fact Ministers have been most encouraging and supportive. However, all his spin and blustering have been to no avail&#151;he is well and truly rumbled. Only 11 MPs have signed early-day motion 2810, and the long-suffering stakeholders have recently asked him to operate on a cross-party basis and in a less partisan manner.</p>

Member for Reading, East will be overtaken by events, because it is with great pleasure that I can announce that the Secretary of State has kindly agreed to my request to meet the real Reading Station Partnership Board on 19 December to receive a full presentation of its excellent bid, which makes a powerful case for upgrading the capacity of Reading station, improving services on the Great Western main line and providing better facilities for passengers at Reading.

He finished with another rant, making an intemperate attack on my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson). His speech was as disappointing as the speech given by the Secretary of State&#151;I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman is here, incidentally, so at least I can be rude to his face.</p>

He was more interested in scoring petty party political points, rather as one would do in a school debating society, which is a great pity, because there is a great deal of cross-party compliance on the issues. We all know the problems of the transport system, including congestion on the roads and railways, and the subject deserves a more mature and sensible approach than it received from him tonight.</p>

detracted from the abilities of locally elected democracies to determine big transport infrastructure problems. Today&#146;s report by Kate Barker seeks to establish an independent planning commission to take over from local government the role of dealing with large infrastructure problems, which is regrettable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="61205-0018.htm_para3"><a name="061205105000060">I hope that when my hon. Friends write their manifestos on transport and other issues, they will sweep away the regional structure set up by the Deputy Prime Minister, including regional spatial strategy, regional transport planning boards and, of course,the grand panjandrum of the regional assemblies. If they went, along with the independent planning commission, it would do a great deal to restore local democracy. Large-scale transport infrastructure planning in localised and regional areas should be undertaken by a combination of locally elected councillors, who, knowing the circumstances better, are better able to take those decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="61205-0018.htm_para4"><a name="061205106000002">I agree with certain points raised by the Eddington report.

It is jammed in the morning, jammed at the weekends when people go shopping at the Metro centre, one of the largest in Europe, and jammed again in the rush hour at night. That road is causing a serious economic drag on the north-east of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="61205-0018.htm_para6"><a name="061205106000004">Car ownership is increasing faster in the north-east than in any other region&#151;admittedly from a low base&#151; but there are no plans to improve the A1. A few months ago, a plan was promised to try to manage the traffic better and increase capacity. I understand that the report was promised for about this time, but I am now told that it will not be published until winter 2007. Meanwhile, the economic problems get worse.</p>

Member for Reading, West. It is a much more serious matter. What has happened in the north-east is the result of the road structures of the A1 and the A19. Proposed new industrial and commercial developments have been frozen by the Highways Agency&#146;s serving what are called article 14 orders on the development plan. Those orders effectively put a stop to development for up to six months and can then be renewed.</p>

I am pleased to say that most of them have now been lifted, but the abiding legacy of the threat of article 14 orders is that quite a lot of developers who would have developed regional projects have been frightened off.

a developer incurs losses of many millions of pounds, particularly on large developments. They do not want to take that risk, which means we have lost the opportunity to create a large number of new jobs in the region.</p>

If we compare that with Scotland, just across the border&#151;I am sorry that the Secretary of State is not here&#151;it is interesting to note that &#163;3.5 billion has been allocated for transport infrastructure there in the next decade. I admit that the country has a population of about three times the size of that of the north-east, but one can see how disproportionate spending in Scotland is compared with that in the north-east of England.</p>

Member probably has a travelling tale to tell since such a large part of the job involves being in two places at once. I can speak only from my experiences but I think that the story is telling. My predecessor, Peter Pike, who was a Member of Parliament during the years when the Conservative party was in power often flew between London and Manchester because the trains were so unreliable. Thanks to the recent improvements to the west coast main line under the Government&#151;I am delightedthat the Conservative party acknowledges the improvements, although it opposed the funding for them&#151;it is now far more time efficient to take the train. I travel to Manchester or Stockport in around two hours, which is fantastic. From there, it is less than an hour&#146;s drive to the constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="61205-0018.htm_para16"><a name="061205106000017">That was a simple example with which to begin my contribution, but it proves the point. When, as consumers, we are faced with several options, we choose the easiest one. Thanks to the improvements to the railways under the Government, the easiest is often to travel by train. Our constituents are doing that, so I do not recognise the picture that Conservative Members paint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="61205-0018.htm_para17"><a name="061205106000018">Let me present some facts that I do recognise. Investment in Britain&#146;s transport infrastructure will be 60 per cent. higher next year than it was 10 years ago. It needs more investment in the future, which we are providing, yet Conservative Members were unable to say this evening whether they would prioritise that investment over tax cuts. That was revealing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="61205-0018.htm_para18"><a name="061205106000019">The Tories botched privatisation and starved the railways of the investment that they needed. They brought the railways to their knees; we have brought them the stability from which they can grow. Forty per cent. of trains have been replaced in the past five years; passenger numbers are growing at the fastest rate since the 1960s; passengers miles are growing at the fastest rate since the 1940s; and rail freight has increased by40 per cent. since 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="61205-0018.htm_para19"><a name="061205106000020">When the Conservative party was in charge, Railtrack was laying as little as 250 miles of track a year. In 2003-04, Labour&#146;s replacement for Railtrack, Network Rail, was laying well over three times that, replacing 870 miles of track that year. That leads to this evening&#146;s all important question: why is the Conservative party implying that the improvements are long overdue when the work is being done and we have a sustained strategy for them? I can conclude only that it is up to its old tricks. In the words, which areworth repeating, of the Conservative Transport spokesperson, the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) about his party,</p>

The country is getting used to this, and it is responding by asking, &#147;Where isthe policy?&#148; The answer is that the policy is all overthe place. The right hon.

amuses me all by itself&#151;has said that there is no doubt that there must be an assumption against road building. The only thing that I am left in no doubt about is that the only way to get a coherent policy on railways is to stick to the one that we have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="61205-0018.htm_para21"><a name="061205106000022">That is not to say that action does not need to be taken, however, but let us be clear about what is going on. We have economic growth, better trains, and greater reliability leading to trains becoming more popular. That creates more demand, which is creating the greater need for investment. I agree with the Conservatives when they say that if they were in power, we would not be in this situation. When they were in power, we did not have the sustained economic growth, quarter on quarter, year on year, that we have seen for the past 10 years. Nor did we get the necessary investment in the trains or the track. So it is no wonder that people did not want to travel on the railways. Does that count as success, in the Conservatives&#146; book? The overcrowding on some parts of the railway network, which we are addressing, is a symptom of our success. The question for the public out there is whether they would rather have a party that is committed to the long-term sustainable future of the network or one that is unable to say whether rail investment ranks as more or less important than tax cuts for the well-off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="61205-0018.htm_para22"><a name="061205106000023">I shall give the House a local example. Manchester is experiencing a renaissance; it is booming. Obviously, the combined effect of a Labour council and a Labour Government has worked well. Of course, there are good jobs to be had, and my constituents up the road in east Lancashire want to have them. So the trains and buses into Manchester from my part of the world are crowded. The Conservatives try to make political capital out of this symptom of our success. Would they prefer it if there were no opportunities in our great northern cities that people wanted to travel to take advantage of? Sometimes that seems to be the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="61205-0018.htm_para23"><a name="061205106000024">Yes, success has led to issues that need addressing, and they are being addressed as part of the routine policy of this Government. In the north-west, it is timely that Network Rail is currently out to consultation on its rail utilisation study. As Members will know, this contains proposals as to where future passenger demand is likely to come from, and what changes will be required to the necessary infrastructure. Network Rail, created by this Government, is adapting to the challenges faced by the network over time. I welcome this study, and also the opportunity to explain how it can be used to improve the job opportunities available to my constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="61205-0018.htm_para24"><a name="061205106000025">Burnley is a mere 30 miles from Manchester, but there is no direct train line between them. My constituents either get the bus&#151;which offers a decent service but is not always reliable at peak rush hour times&#151;or they have to change trains at Blackburn or Hebden Bridge or, I am sorry to say, they give up their jobs in the city. I do not think that people should have to choose between their careers and their communities in that way&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="61205-0018.htm_para26"><a name="061205106000032">There are various ways in which a direct line could be established. One would be to have a direct train via Blackburn, which could be done fairly easily. However, establishing a regular service would require serious investment to upgrade the heavily congested single track between Blackburn and Manchester. Or we could go round the other side of the hill and reinstate a few metres of track known as the Todmorden curve, which would allow a direct train service between Burnley and Manchester using a bit of the Calder line. Either would do, and both would be supported not only by my constituency but by the neighbouring constituencies, which would also reap economic benefits. We must remember that investing in transport infrastructure is necessary not only to relieve bottlenecks but as a tool for regeneration. People often get bogged down in the terminology of travel-to-work areas without realising that, by investing in the right infrastructure, we can enable those geographical areas to change quite substantially.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="61205-0018.htm_para27"><a name="061205106000033">The industrial revolution, which took place a long time ago in my part of the world, is a case in point. People often presume that the canals that criss-cross my constituency were built to take the textiles to market. In fact, it was the other way round. It was because of the existence of the Leeds-Liverpool canal, which was originally built to transport more basic commodities, that the cotton mills were built in Burnley. The same is true today: better rail links into the booming cities are a tool to regenerate towns such as mine. They will enable my constituents to commute to higher-paid jobs and make it easier for city folk to come and relax in a bit of Pennine Lancashire. The links between economic and transport policy need to be made more explicit. I am hopeful that the Government&#146;s response to the Eddington report will accept that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="61205-0018.htm_para28"><a name="061205106000034">I welcome the increased investment in our railways under the Government. I welcome the greater prosperity and opportunity that economic stability has brought. I believe that the public do, too, and are voting with their feet and choosing to travel by train. That leads to capacity issues, which we are sorting out. As part of that, I hope that my plea for better transport links between my constituency and Manchester in particular will be heard. As this is an Opposition day debate, my question to the Conservative party is simple: is it simply positioning itself once more, or will it put its so-called commitment to the railways above its commitment to cut taxes for the better-off?</p>

<b>5 Dec 2006 : Column 252</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para0"><a name="061205106000036">I have raised with the Minister on many occasions the urgent need for the Government to address the roads infrastructure in Norfolk, particularly the A11, which is one of the most important links between the county and the rest of the United Kingdom. In particular, he knows that an eight-mile stretch of single carriageway remains between Thetford and the Fiveways corner roundabout, which leaves Norfolk as the only county, and Norwich as the largest settlement, not connected to the national, dual carriageway trunk road network. The road cannot cope with the existing weight of traffic, let alone that which the proposed 72,000 new homes in the county, and the welcome regeneration of Thetford, will bring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para1"><a name="061205106000037">Norfolk county council has provided me with a copy of the East of England Development Agency&#146;s policy document for economic growth in the county. It is optimistically entitled, &#147;Norfolk on the Move&#148;. I tell the Minister that Norfolk&#146;s drivers know that they are likely to grind to a halt through the sheer weight of traffic on the county&#146;s roads. The problems of the A11 are stifling the economy of the area. The business community, utterly frustrated by unfulfilled promises and ever-growing delays on that stretch of road, has rolled in behind our local authorities. A compelling case was submitted to the regional assembly. The scheme is, at least for now, scheduled for the second regional funding allocation funding period starting in 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para2"><a name="061205106000038">The Minister has acknowledged, however, in an interview with the <i> Eastern Daily Press</i>, that the operation of the regional allocation arrangements is problematic, and leads to mistakes and skewed priorities. He identified the &#147;whale in the pond&#148; syndrome, which tends to de-prioritise very large schemes that eat up a substantial proportion of a region&#146;s funding. He also acknowledged that areas on the geographical edge of a region could be overlooked in the decision-making process. To my constituents in South-West Norfolk, and to those in the surrounding area, it seems that they are constantly overlooked in the decision-making process. If evidence were needed, they cite the number of times that the dualling project has been promised and then delayed. Will the Minister accept that what he has called a &#147;good and popular scheme&#148; has suffered from both those factors? Will he seek to re-designate it as being of national importance, just as economic development in Norfolk should be of national importance?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para3"><a name="061205106000039">Will the Minister take this opportunity to confirm that the Government will take responsibility for the scheme, and dispel the concern in Norfolk that it may yet be put on the back burner, leaving us isolated and frustrated by a roads infrastructure that is not fit for purpose? Will he also acknowledge his support for the dualling of the A11 and join me in calling on the Secretary of State for Transport to approve it, so that a timetable can be drawn up and work can start immediately?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para4"><a name="061205106000040">At Attleborough in my constituency, there is yet another example of the Government washing their hands of the A11. Thankfully, that stretch of the road is about to be dualled. However, the Government have turned down a simple scheme to upgrade the nearest junction on the A11 at Besthorpe, which would route traffic away from an ever-congested Attleborough  <br>

town. If carried out at the same time as dualling work, the project would have offered an economical and simple solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para5"><a name="061205106000041">The Government have refused an application for funding under the demonstration scheme, passing the scheme back to the county council, which does not have the funds to finance it. It will have to be carried out as a separate and therefore more expensive project, offering poor value to the taxpayer and yet more years of misery for the local community. Yet again, the Government&#146;s transport strategy fails to recognise the need for sensible investment in our roads, and best value for the taxpayer once again goes out the window. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para6"><a name="061205106000042">In a debate last November I raised concerns about the state of the A47 in Norfolk and called for it to be dualled as well. The road is, in many places, unsafe and unfit for the weight of traffic that it carries. Accidents are frequent and often serious, and can have a catastrophic impact on travel across the area. It is one of the most dangerous routes in the country, yet improvements on the A47 are also considered of regional, not national importance. I say again to the Minister that the responsibility lies with the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para7"><a name="061205106000043">The Minister has told me that his Department is not revisiting the method of defining road projects, but is reviewing how it works in practice. He has made time to visit Norfolk before, and I ask him to make time to come up again. Then he will see for himself how the regional allocation method works in practice and how Norfolk faces ever increasing difficulties while the method remains in place.</p>

James (Swansea, East) (Lab):</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate. We should highlight the Government&#146;s commitment to rail transport. More rail journeys are being undertaken in Britain than at any time since the 1940s. Rail freight is up by 46 per cent. since 1997. More trains in England and Wales arrive on time compared with 2001, mainly as a result of the increased investment after many years of neglect under the Conservative Government. I have worked in the rail industry and know from first-hand experience about the challenges of clearing up the mess left by that Government. The need to push forward an integrated transport agenda has been key within the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para8"><a name="061205106000045">Unfortunately, the performance of First Great Western&#151;the mainline operator to my constituency&#151;has not been so effective or matched the Government&#146;s commitment to improve rail transport. It has been named as one of the worst performing franchises in Britain, with a 79.4 per cent. reliability record. It has also recently announced changes to services to Swansea, which has caused great concern to my constituents. In particular, they are worried about the termination of the 1515 London Paddington to Swansea service at Cardiff. The changes will have a serious effect on Swansea&#146;s status as a mainline station on an important inter-city route. The proposals are a retrograde step and are being interpreted locally as downgrading the second city of Wales. Swansea is an important rail city and a key business and tourism destination; it is also the gateway to west Wales. The  <br>

proposals appear to make passengers from Swansea and west Wales less important than those in other parts of the country.</p>

<p><a name="st_o394"><a name="061205106000046"><a name="61205-0019.htm_spnew1"><a name="061205106000163"><b>Julie Morgan (Cardiff, North) (Lab):</b> I support my hon. Friend&#146;s remarks about First Great Western. If the service beyond Cardiff is going to stop, the service to Cardiff may soon stop as well. It shows a lack of interest in Wales on the part of First Great Western. Is she aware of the proposal to cut the buffet service between Cardiff and Paddington, which I have received a complaint about? Does she think that that is a strange way of improving the rail service?</p>

It highlights the factthat a company that was recently engaged in a re-franchising process, when it made many promises, is now making cuts at will and making changes that suit it, not the people that it is supposed to be serving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para9"><a name="061205106000048">The passenger flows between Swansea and Cardiff are vital to a number of local communities and businesses, and for economic development. Not everyone needs or has to travel to London on a regular basis. The daily commuter journeys between Swansea, stations along the south Wales main line and Cardiff are equally important. The commitment of First Great Western to those services is essential. As I said, it actively pursued the franchise and I am disappointed that the fine words and promises contained in its bid now appear to be nothing more than window dressing. It has ignored all representations about the 1515 service. I believe that that service is being killed off by First Great Western&#146;s failure to consult properly. The consultation period has been little more than a sham. There has been a poor response from First Great Western, which has refused to publish any submissions and has not made its decisions public before the point of implementation, thus in effect allowing no appeal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para10"><a name="061205106000049">Following closely on the heels of the refranchise bid, there has been much confusion. It is understandable that the public, who believed that the franchise proposals submitted by First Great Western would be in place for a credible period, have been left feeling confused and let down by yet more inadequate consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para11"><a name="061205106000050">The company apparently has no interest in serving evening commuters. Between 5 am and 8.30 am, there is a half-hourly service between Swansea and London. Eight trains, each carrying up to 360 seated passengers, travel the Swansea-to-Paddington route. During that period Arriva Trains Wales runs two services which can carry a combined total of 300. Several thousand are carried by First Great Western; a few hundred are carried by Arriva Trains Wales. But how do those people make their return journey in the evening? First Great Western is happy to take their business in the morning, but feels no responsibility for getting them home at night. What kind of strategy and what kind of franchise commitment is that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para12"><a name="061205106000051">Poor Arriva Trains Wales will now be expected to fill the gap left by the removal of the 1515 from the timetable. Commuters anxious to get home after a hard day&#146;s work will have to try to obtain seats on an already popular service. It is the proverbial attempt to fit a pint into a half-pint pot, and can only mean more inconvenience and discomfort for the loyal passengers  <br>

Transport links are a particularly good example of the problems of investment in infrastructure, but there are many other examples, including essential utilities and services. Energy, water supply and other important elements of infrastructure are not being planned well enough, or receiving enough investment, to match the level of house building required by the Government.</p>

The amount of reports, White Papers and documentation that has been produced on the sector under discussion seems to mask a confusion, inconsistency and short-sightedness in transport planning; that is certainly the case in my area of the country.</p>

The Government have called it one of their diamonds for growth; others have called it part of the string of pearls. They are fine words, but fine words cannot mask the disconnect between house building targets and the lack of investment in infrastructure. The Government need places like Basingstoke to generate the wealth to fund their spending plans, so they need to be prepared to invest in areas such as Basingstoke to ensure that its success is sustainable in the future.</p>

There has also recently been a significant increase in the number of accidents on our section of the motorway, some of which, tragically, have resulted in fatalities. We in north Hampshire have not had sufficient investment, particularly in our motorways and roads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para21"><a name="061205106000063">There are other local examples of lack of investment. There is a major business park in my constituency: the Chineham business park is a highly successful area of economic activity, and it is home to many blue-chip companies and major names that Members will be aware of. A part of the plans for that business park was to build a railway station&#151;Ministers might be aware of that&#151;but since those plans were put forward there has been a complete lack of funding, which means that it has not been possible to deliver that railway station. The result of that is being borne by my constituents who are now having to deal with major problems to do with traffic cutting through residential areas, because people do not have the option of travelling to their place of work by train rather than car.</p>

In some cases it is their first choice to locate, rather than Reading, because of the congestion problems in that town that the hon. Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter) highlighted. They choose Basingstoke because they have access to well qualified and highly experienced staff, but also because of accessibility. I am concerned that the large-scale house building projects that are being foisted on the local council&#151;with very little ability to resist them&#151;combined with lack of investment in transport will simply be no good at all for residents or business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para23"><a name="061205106000065">There are many estimates of how much money is required to fill the yawning infrastructure gap that there is not only in Basingstoke but throughout what is now designated by the South East England Development Agency as a western corridor area. Hampshire county council has told the South East England regional assembly that investment of some &#163;4.5 billion is needed to improve transport infrastructure in the western corridor and Blackwater valley growth area, which, as the hon. Member for Reading, West said, is one of the most important areas of economic development in the country. In my bit of that area&#151;Basingstoke&#151;we need no less than a&#163;250 million investment in transport alone to fill the gap created by the lack of investment in recent years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para24"><a name="061205106000066">I ran off a list of the projects that the western corridor and Blackwater valley area needs in terms of investment in infrastructure&#151;the document has been submitted to the Government&#151;and no fewer than 10 of the 34 projects on that list directly relate to my constituency. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity when he responds to give me some thoughts on how he will help Hampshire county council and SEEDA to plug some of those gaps. The Government are happy to set targets, but they are not prepared to ensure that the plans are in place to enable such targets to be properly thought through. That is a million miles away from the integrated transport policy that they originally promised us; nearly 10 years on from their taking office, we are still waiting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para25"><a name="061205106000067">I want to consider a couple of other examples of how the transport infrastructure gap in my constituency is not just opening up but increasing in magnitude. We have already heard a great deal about the train networks in various parts of the country. I will not dwell on that issue, except to say that my constituents not only have to endure overcrowded trains; they often have to spend an hour travelling into London, unable to sit down for the entire journey&#151;or for the journey back. The train operator promised increases in capacity, but that has yet to become a reality. I welcome the fact that my Front-Bench colleagues have given a commitment to regarding that as an urgent problem as we develop our policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para26"><a name="061205106000068">There are other pressing issues in my constituency relating to the M3 motorway, which runs directly through its centre. It is an important access route and an important part of why Basingstoke is the success that it is, but a tremendous increase in traffic on that route has not been matched by investment in measures to alleviate the problems associated with congestion and noise. I have recently tabled a number of parliamentary questions on this issue because of an increase in the number of letters that I receive from constituents on it. Government calculations indicate that the level of traffic noise on the M3 between junctions 5 and 7 has increased by about 4.5 dB in the past 20 years. To many a lay person, that might not sound like an enormous increase, but I remind Members that the decibel is a logarithmic unit, and that a 3 dB increase, as the Minister doubtless knows, equates to a doubling in sound level. If Members were to stand by the side of the M3 in Mapledurwell, a beautiful village in my constituency that is completely unshielded from the motorway by any form of physical sound barrier, they would understand why many  <br>

residents are deeply concerned at the fact the increase in traffic has not been matched by the provision of sound-avoidance measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para27"><a name="061205106000069">We thought that we had come some way on this issue under the careful guidance of my predecessor, who obtained an assurance that a noise-retardant surface would be used on the section of the M3 that passes through the centre of my constituency. Indeed, we were very pleased with the outcome of the negotiations with the Government. Only last week, however, I heard that a very firm promise might be overturned; despite a promise to re-surface the M3 completely with noise-retardant material only one lane is to be treated. That is a great disappointment to residents of the villages of Mapledurwell, Up Nateley, Nateley Scures and Old Basing, for whom that measure represented their only hope that the Government would try to alleviate a growing problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="61205-0019.htm_para28"><a name="061205106000070">The other result of increased traffic flow on the M3 that has not been coupled with a measure to try to alleviate the problem is congestion at junction 6, especially the Black Dam roundabout. All my constituents who use the M3 are very aware of that problem. The roundabout was built to accommodate a maximum peak flow of about 5,500 vehicles an hour, yet a survey last September found that it was already operating well above capacity, and the Government have no plans to try to improve the situation in the near future, despite significant amounts of house building.</p>

It is used as a relief road by motorists wanting to avoid congestion on the M3 and there has been a significant increase in traffic, which has resulted in more accidents, and the county council has had to make considerable changes in the layout of the road network.

The consequences of the lack of planning are borne by residents, and there is no better example than my constituents who live in the beautiful, historic village of Old Basing. The area has narrow lanes and few footpaths. At Old Basing infants school, which is beautiful and well respected, traffic volume is so high that even parents who live nearby are forced to use their cars to take their children to school.</p>

My constituents do not want forests of policy papers and a maze of funding streams; they want the Government to understand that Basingstoke has a transport infrastructure gap. The Government cannot ignore the problem any longer. They cannot simply hand on housing targets without providing proper plans and proper funding for increased infrastructure. If they do not feel that they are well placed to develop such plans, they should leave it to local people, who understand what is needed for our community, to draw up the plans and see them to fruition.</p>

Not only do we have track problems, which have to be sorted out by one company, and then other companies charging huge sums of money to the rail operators for relatively old rolling stock, but we have a complicated situation that involves using two rail companies to get from Llanelli to London. Yes, indeed: I have to travel with two companies&#151;Arriva and First Great Western&#151;every week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="61205-0020.htm_para4"><a name="061205106000083">It is heartening to see how many people in west Wales use the trains now, but they deserve a much better deal than they are getting. Unfortunately, the huge charges that the ROSCOs are demanding for rolling stock mean that we are still short of carriages on some trains, with people standing for considerable distances. We have some spectacular views along the coast in my constituency, but coastal erosion is causing considerable concern west of Llanelli. Since privatisation, we have yet another company that is responsible for the track. With that Tory legacy of so many different companies, it is all too easy to shift the blame around and infinitely more difficult to improve the services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="61205-0020.htm_para5"><a name="061205106000084">I endorse the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East (Mrs. James) about the First Great Western service from Cardiff to Swansea that currently leaves at 17.18, but is threatened. The new timetable comes in on Monday. Only the week before last, when my hon. Friend and I went to see for ourselves what was happening on the 17.18 train from Cardiff, we saw that the preceding train was absolutely full and that the platform immediately filled up again with a new crowd of people. When we got on the 17.18 train it, too, was full. It just does not seem to make any commercial sense to remove that train, leaving a huge number of people to try to squash into the next train. It is a real exercise in alienating one&#146;s loyal customers. I urge the Minister to do whatever he can to influence First Great Western to retain that service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="61205-0020.htm_para6"><a name="061205106000085">We also need to completely rethink our attitude to Sunday services. Our attitude to Sunday timetables assumes that no one wants to travel on Sunday, but, with increased leisure opportunities, many people would like to make greater use of the trains on Sundays for days out, weekends away, visiting friends and family, or getting to an airport to go on holiday. Current Sunday timetables make that difficult. The first train eastwards from Llanelli does not leave until after 11 o&#146;clock in the morning, and we all know how crowded the few trains that run on a Sunday evening can be, as people try to come home from weekends away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="61205-0020.htm_para7"><a name="061205106000086">Inevitably, all too often that means that people turn to their cars, with the subsequent environmental consequences. We need some enterprising thinking about providing a much better service and promoting the use of rail travel on Sundays. One excellent example of encouraging the use of the train for an enjoyable day out is the work done by the Heart of Wales Line Travellers Association, which recently celebrated its 25th birthday. Its excellent work in promoting day and weekend excursions is an example to all and we would like to see a lot more of that type of approach. People really do want to use the trains and we therefore need to continue to pull together the fragmented serviceand use a Government hands-on approach to ensure improvements in the provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="61205-0020.htm_para8"><a name="061205106000088">Our debate began with a fine performance by my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling), the shadow Secretary of State. We then heard a less scintillating performance by thegenuine Secretary of State, who failed to give the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) a commitment on the Birmingham gateway. When he responded to an intervention made by my neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski), he completely failed to understand that he was talking about an open access agreement that required no public subsidy whatever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="61205-0020.htm_para9"><a name="061205106000089">We heard a characteristically narcoleptic performance from the hon.

Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter), who gave us a glorious dinosaur attack on rail privatisation that wholly ignored Rod Eddington&#146;s praise for the private sector&#146;s vital involvement in transport. The hon. Gentleman also made an intemperate attack on my absent hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson), which was picked up by my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson), who made a powerful case for transport decisions to be taken locally by elected councillors. He gave telling examples of the way in which poor infrastructure has held back economic growth.</p>

Member for Orkney and Shetland whether he took the train back to his constituency. Perhaps the Government Whips Office should give the hon. Lady a map. For her information, Stavanger has the nearest railway station to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency&#151;perhaps he would be more interested in the location of airports. The hon. Lady then descended into a rant against rail privatisation. Labour Members must make up their minds about this: they cannot take credit for the 50 per cent. increase in passengers&#151;spectacular growth&#151;yet keep knocking privatisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="61205-0020.htm_para11"><a name="061205106000091">My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser) certainly won the award for shirt of the debate. He put forward a powerful case for the duelling of the A11 and described small junction improvements that can have a disproportionatelylarge impact. Such improvements are exactly as recommended in Eddington. We then heard from the hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mrs. James), who made interesting comments about the difficulties regarding local rail services. She criticised the franchise and the consultation process. My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) made a clear and thorough speech in which she set out very clearly and well the grievous problems that are caused when there is increased house building without any increase in infrastructure capacity to match the huge demands for various modes of transport.</p>

He warned that motorists were likely to spend up to 20 per cent. more time in traffic jams by 2010 and admitted that the targets originally set by the Deputy Prime Minister would not be met.

The British Chambers of Commerce says that we are rapidly approaching &#147;Gridlock Britain&#148; unless a determined effort is made to improve our roads, removing pinch points and managing the network better to facilitate smooth flow and reliability of journey time.</p>

There are elements of the report that we strongly support. We have consistently supported the disproportionate gains of small schemes. Paragraph 199 on page 38 of the smaller volume entitled &#147;Advice to Government&#148; points out that small junction improvements often cost below &#163;20 million, but show wider benefit:cost ratios well in excess of 4 and some going up to between 8 and 10. That was a point picked up by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk. Many smaller road and rail schemes have been supported by Members throughout the House. Will the Government clarify tonight whether it is their intention to reinstate those schemes before 2015?</p>

There is an extraordinary graph showing that the inquiry on the M6 toll took 150 days, and the terminal 5 inquiry took several years and cost &#163;60 million. These are significant delays and costs. Do the Government intend to pursue the proposal?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="61205-0020.htm_para33"><a name="061205106000115">At the centre of the report is road pricing. Eddington enthusiastically supports the creation of a national road pricing scheme, on the ground that if it were introduced it would reduce the need for infrastructure capacity increases. The Opposition are convinced that the travelling public will react to the price mechanism and change their behaviour. In order to manage demand effectively, the price must vary. We do not support simplistic congestion charge schemes. A good example of the benefits of a variable road pricing scheme is the one that I saw this summer on the SR91 in southern California.</p>

They were also jammed solid morning and evening. The four HOV lanes were converted to high occupancy toll lanes, with a varying toll. The number of vehicles doubled and the speed trebled.</p>

I do not underestimate the task for the DVLA, but when do the Government think there will be a watertight database? There are serious civil liberties issues involved. When TollCollect set up its scheme in Germany, the diffusion of information to any Government Department was banned.</p>

It is intimately connected to the progress of the EU&#146;s Galileo GNSS. As it was originally anticipated that EETS would not come into force for cars until 2012 and the system is already subject to delay on that timetable, do the Government consider that the regulatory and technical framework will be in place to meet the 2015 timetable?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="61205-0021.htm_para3"><a name="061205106000120">To summarise, the Government came to office almost 10 years ago with simplistic and dogmatic ideas that the travelling public could be forced off the roads and on to public transport. They totally underestimated the growth in traffic demand for both road and rail. They have not increased capacity to keep up with demand and have failed to achieve their targets, letting down the travelling public in a spectacular manner. Under a succession of incompetent Ministers, the Department for Transport has been excessively timid and cautious. That is compounded by the fact that we are now &#147;Waiting for Gordot&#148;. We know that the Chancellor is floundering in his search for tax revenues, and my fear is that the Treasury, which was the chief sponsor of the Eddington report, sees road pricing as a future gold mine. The Chancellor already has his man in the Department for Transport, for the Secretary of State is effectively a sleeper waiting to be woken by the great clunking fist.</p>

The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) discussed housing expansion and growth. The Conservatives frequently call for transport improvements ahead of growth, but I am afraid that that is not the way in which it works in the real world. We have to provide infrastructure investment in parallel with growth. Those things have  <br>

to be planned, because they go hand in hand. Her party has said in the past few days that it will not make any promises or commitments, and it does not have any investment to offer in her constituency or any other Conservative constituency. Her call for us to invest more heavily in advance of growth is therefore pure foolishness. She provided a shopping list of requirements, including noise treatment. Under her party&#146;s investment plans, there will be only one noise treatment for the roads in her constituency&#151;the issuing of ear plugs to her constituents. My hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith) made a powerful case for improvements to her local system. Again, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South, is happy to engage in discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="61205-0021.htm_para22"><a name="0612068000023">The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) overlooked the fact that throughout the Tories&#146; 18 years in power his party pursued a policy of under-investment and boom and bust economics. When there is no growth in the economy and people&#146;s earnings do not go up, transport demand does not go up, which is why transport demand was contained throughout the Opposition&#146;s period in office. Since the Government have been in power, there has not been a single quarter in which the economy has failed to grow. We have the fastest growing incomes in Europe, so we have the fastest growing transport problems. During our term in office, 6 million extra vehicles have come on to the roads. There are more people in work, so more people are driving to work or are driving as part of their job, which inevitably puts pressure on the transport system. Despite the huge investments that we have made, including the billions of pounds that we have put into the west coast main line, the railway system and roads, and despite the effort that we have put into all transport modalities, the simple fact of the matter&#151;this is the conclusion that Eddington reached&#151;is that unless we are prepared to face the hard questions, including the challenge of road pricing, it will get worse. Tonight, one Tory spokesman said that the Opposition were in favour of that policy, but the other one completely contradicted him.</p>

Reading, West (Martin Salter) of the former Labour Member for Reading, East. In this evening&#146;s debate, however, the hon. Gentleman launched a highly personal attack on me while I was not present in the Chamber and unavoidably detained elsewhere. I was not notified before the debate that he would be making remarks about me. When I went to the <i> Hansard </i>office to see what the attack consisted of, I was informed that I could not look at what another Member had said during the debate. That meant that I could not challenge the version of events set out in the House this evening. Please will you advise me, Mr. Speaker, on what can be done to stop this happening again?</p>

<p><a name="st_o419"><a name="0612068000555"><a name="61205-0022.htm_spnew5"><a name="0612068001138"><b>Dr. Alan Whitehead (Southampton, Test) (Lab):</b> I am pleased to have secured the debate. The subject is straightforward. As the title on the Order Paper implies, it is about doorstep lending and the interest rates that follow from that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="61205-0022.htm_para10"><a name="0612068000556">Doorstep lending lies far away from the mainstream of conventional lending as most people know it&#151;the bank loans, the credit card debts and the mortgages that we hear about in the press. It often involves sums that would be considered trifles in that world. A typical doorstep lending sum is about &#163;350, the sort of amount that someone with a flexible card or a good credit rating will navigate as a matter of course, but of course the people who avail themselves of such sums from doorstep lenders do not have access to those financial devices by and large. Indeed, many have no access to any financial devices. They may have no bank accounts, no credit rating or no savings. Most will not be home owners, and they will probably be among the estimated 2 million or so people in the United Kingdom with no access to mainstream financial services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="61205-0022.htm_para11"><a name="0612068000557">Doorstep lending fills that gap, at a cost. It may involve small loans, but it is not small business. It is estimated to have an annual turnover of about&#163;1.8 billion, and one doorstep lending company, Provident Financial, has about 60 per cent. of the market. Companies such as Provident Financial will say that the costs of servicing door-to-door collections, usually on a weekly basis, and the credit risks involved in such lending mean that they will charge a higher annual percentage rate than the more familiar credit card companies and high street banks, but the question that we ought to ask immediately is &#147;How much higher is reasonable?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="61205-0022.htm_para12"><a name="0612068000558">Provident Financial is by no means the highest-rate lender, but its average APR&#151;which is also roughly the industry average&#151;is 177 per cent., and some APRs are as high as 800 per cent. That means that those least able to shop around for their financial services and least able to carry the consequences of debt repayments are charged APRs that are not just higher than high street credit rates, but astronomically higher. It is estimated that, even when collection and risk factors are taken into account, the industry overall overcharges customers by about &#163;75 million a year, or about &#163;7 on each &#163;100 lent.</p>

from that&#151;is people getting deeper and deeper into debt, often as a result of a very modest foray into credit, and rapidly reaching a point at which repayment seems out of the question. I can cite two cases of people in my part of the world who have experienced precisely that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="61205-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0612068000562">Mrs. D is a tenant of a housing association based in Hampshire, which&#151;as a number of housing associations are beginning to do&#151;actively helped her to manage her debts when they were uncovered. Mrs. D. is a single mother with four children. She receives income support, tax credit and child benefit, but she took out an initial loan of &#163;500 from a doorstep lending company to buy household appliances and things for her children. The first loan cost her &#163;2,500 to pay back, and the next loan that she took out&#151;also of &#163;500&#151;cost &#163;3,000 to pay back. When her smallest child was born, she went to another company for a third loan, which cost &#163;4,500 to repay. The loan companies collecting her repayments on the doorstep pressed her to pay that money instead of her rent, and she rapidly went into substantial arrears. She could see no way out of her spiralling debt, and became depressed and suicidal. She was eventually rescued by the intervention of her landlord, the housing association, which helped her with benefits and arranged for her to pay the money back at a reduced rate; but she will be paying it back for a number of years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="61205-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0612068000563">Three years ago a disabled lady called Sheila, also in my part of the world, opened the door to a friendly-looking gentleman who offered her a loan of a few hundred pounds. She took out a &#163;200 loan, but the amount owed soon expanded to more than &#163;5,000. She then found herself subject to threats of physical violence, and even threats to destroy her wheelchair. She was helped by a community organisation, the South Coast Money Line, which lent her enough money to repay her debt at a manageable rate of interest. She has now repaid the whole amount.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="61205-0022.htm_para16"><a name="0612068000564">Those examples are not isolated, and do not exaggerate the depths of misery that unregulated interest rates on small loans collected on doorsteps can bring about, especially as their destinations are often people with no resources with which to extricate themselves from the trap in which they find themselves. They certainly have no access to the consumer credit choices that are available to most of the population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="61205-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0612068000565">That observation is why I give two cheers&#151;but not yet three&#151;for the various measures that have been undertaken, or are being undertaken, in this field. The Consumer Credit Act 2006 introduces an unfair credit test that makes it easier for people to take unfair lenders to court, but many people in the position I have described would no sooner take lenders to court than they would fly to Mars. The Competition Commission has just published proposals that will go some way towards ensuring transparency in doorstep lending, with comparative rates posted on the internet and lenders required to spell out the annual costs of loans, but many doorstep borrowers will not have access to the internet and will not have the credit rating or the mobility to shop around for loans, so the man on the doorstep will still have a monopoly in respect of them.</p>

administration of credit unions and community development financial institutions. I come now to the important points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon). I consider the development of credit unions and CDFIs to be very important. Credit unions are a quietly expanding success in the field of small loans; they have twice as many members as they had in 2003. However, they suffer from a lack of ability to finance the funds that they will advance for loans, and in most instances they require people to be regular savers with the union before small loans will be advanced.</p>

<p><a name="st_o422"><a name="0612068000567"><a name="61205-0022.htm_spnew8"><a name="0612068001141"><b>Mrs. Moon:</b> Perhaps my hon. Friend will be interested to know that a housing association in my constituency has loaned &#163;15,000 to my credit union so that, thanks to the Farepak debacle, it can allow people who have not got a credit history to take out loans that will get them through Christmas and take them out of the reach of loan sharks. When that &#163;15,000 is repaid it is to remain within the credit union, perhaps to help people get out of rent arrears debts and to fund future financial advice and guidance for families on low incomes in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="st_o423"><a name="0612068000568"><a name="61205-0022.htm_spnew9"><a name="0612068001142"><b>Dr. Whitehead:</b> My hon. Friend gives us an example of commendable action by a housing association. It is important to address overcoming the problem of credit unions having the money to loan to people even if they have not previously been savers with the credit unions. In terms of the organisation of credit unions, it is generally true that there must be a community of both haves and have-nots to fund them: those who are investing because they want them to work and those who are saving because they want to avail themselves of a loan at some stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="61205-0022.htm_para19"><a name="0612068000569">When they work, they make an enormous difference. A typical loan of &#163;250 from a credit union over 26 weeks would be repayable at &#163;10.18 per week, which is &#163;135 cheaper than a typical, but not top-end, doorstep lending company. So I hope that the &#163;35 million will go some way towards enabling credit unions to play a far wider role in terms of small loans, and particularly in advancing loans without a saving requirement first. I know that the Commission on Unclaimed Assets is looking into the possible use of unclaimed assets in the banking system partly to assist with that kind of funding. It is important that the funds are there for credit unions to lend from, and this could be an important route to achieving that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="61205-0022.htm_para20"><a name="0612068000570">I would like to see, as is the case in a number of other countries, a basic bank entitlement introduced to the UK banking system, just as there is a basic service obligation on utilities&#151;a basic account not for borrowing, but so that money can be administered by people with sparse means without recourse to the cheque advances, the pawnshop or the doorstep lender.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="61205-0022.htm_para21"><a name="0612068000571">If this raft of measures comes in&#151;in the case of the Competition Commission&#146;s proposals, that will not happen for another two years&#151;the landscape will be brighter for people needing small loans in the way I have described. So it may well be the case that many of the problems I have described will eventually begin to be overcome, but why not tackle the issue head-on and regulate the amount of interest that may be charged on the doorstep in the first place? Taken in conjunction  <br>

with the good and important measures that I have described, we would certainly have the change of terrain that we need, and at an early stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="61205-0022.htm_para22"><a name="0612068000572">I am not the first person to make this suggestion, either in this Chamber or elsewhere. It is, for instance, a central suggestion of the National Housing Federation, which is undertaking a great amount of work in this field, and of the &#147;debt on our doorstep&#148; campaign. The Government have to date not warmed to the idea that interest rates should be regulated. The most recent Competition Commission report did not endorse the idea. It is argued with some force that regulation might make things worse for borrowers by driving the legitimate and reputable doorstep lenders out of business and leaving the market to illegal and criminal usurers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="61205-0022.htm_para23"><a name="0612068000573">It is reasonable to seek to ensure that doorstep lending companies can make a living and can take properly into account the overheads with which they work, but there is compelling evidence that the present lending arrangements go well beyond that requirement. The priority, therefore, should be to look at ways in which lending rate regulation can work with the grain of good lending companies and not against them, rather than throwing the baby of indebtedness out with the bath-water of financial regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="61205-0022.htm_para24"><a name="0612068000574">A fruitful way of approaching this issue that I certainly endorse, as put forward by the National Housing Federation, is to look at capping in terms of the total credit charge of the loan, rather than the annual percentage rate for the loan, as we more normally do. Since most loans are for short periods&#151;less than 35 weeks&#151;the issue for the borrower is knowing what the overall sum borrowed is, including all repayments. A limit on the total credit charge for short-term loans of, say, 44 per cent. of the principal sum loaned&#151;and of perhaps 69 per cent. of the principal sum loaned for longer-term loans&#151;would ensure that reputable companies could stay in business and keep repayments to a higher but manageable amount. It would also establish a transparent context for the loan, and information on alternatives could be provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="61205-0022.htm_para25"><a name="0612068000575">The proposal would allow reputable companies to stay in business because, calculated in that way, all of Provident Financial&#146;s business would be unaffected and it would be able to manage its loan structure within these limits. It is companies closer to the limits of legality, which charge the astronomical rates that I have mentioned, that would feel the heat of the change&#151;and frankly, about time, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="61205-0022.htm_para26"><a name="0612068000576">I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister and the Government therefore feel able to look at such a proposal in a different light than hitherto&#151;not as a cap that prevents lending or drives people underground, but as a cap that provides, as in a number of other countries with such an arrangement, an honourable place for fair lending on the doorstep, and no place for those who effectively suck the life-blood out of the victims to whom they lend via their own front doorstep. That is, after all, the direction of travel of the very welcome reforms heralded by the Consumer Credit Act 2006, the funding for credit unions and the  <br>

Competition Commission&#146;s proposals. A cap on the total charge for credit would be the star on the Christmas tree of a better way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="61205-0022.htm_para27"><a name="0612068000577">What I want&#151;I am sure that this aim is shared by all Members&#151;is successfully to replace what almost amounts to mediaeval usury with a modern and fair approach to lending. People need to borrow, and those in the positions that I have described tonight willoften need to do so in gravely disadvantageous circumstances. We should seek to ensure that fair lending on the doorstep helps to solve the problems they have borrowed in order to address, rather than adding, sometimes irretrievably, to them.</p>

I shall return to that issue on Thursday and give further information to Members and to you, Mr. Speaker, on the final arrangements for assistance in the form of a good-will gesture to help those people through Christmas.</p>

Friend the Member for Southampton, Test noted, it was only last week that the Competition Commission published its report on home credit. I very much welcome the work that the commission has done in investigating this market, and its producing recommendations on how to make it work better for consumers. Home credit lenders lent about &#163;1.3 billion to 2.3 million customers in 2005. Most home credit loans are for small sums paid in cash, and 70 per cent. are for less than &#163;500. As my hon. Friend said, people who take out home loans are more likely to be young women with families, living in a low-income household in housing rented from a local council or housing association.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para2"><a name="0612068000581">There is no doubt that the home credit industry fulfils a real need for small, short-term loans. Research shows that customers are generally very satisfied with the service that they get from home credit lenders. However, because such borrowers include many who may be vulnerable and who have no alternatives in obtaining credit, it is particularly important that the home credit industry should be fair, competitive and organised in a transparent way for the benefit of those who borrow from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para3"><a name="0612068000582">There have long been concerns that that is not the case and that the charges for that form of credit are excessive. Those concerns led the National Consumer Council to make a super-complaint to the Office of Fair Trading, which in turn referred the industry to the Competition Commission, which reported last week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para4"><a name="0612068000583">The commission found that there was indeed a lack of competition in the market, whether from other credit products, new entrants to the market or among existing home credit providers. That means that customers are paying higher prices for their loans than would be expected in a competitive market. The commission found that, overall, home credit customers paid &#163;75 million a year more than they should have. That is a matter that should concern all of us, because those customers are the people who can least afford to pay such high prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para5"><a name="0612068000584">The report sets out four measures to increase price transparency and promote competition in the market. The commission will require lenders to share data on customers&#146; payment records with other lenders. As my hon. Friend noted, lenders will be required to publish details of their prices on a website, and ensure that the terms for early settlement of home credit loans are fairer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para6"><a name="0612068000585">As part of the implementation of the Consumer Credit Act 2006, we will require lenders to give borrowers a yearly loan statement, which will have to include the original loan amount, the interest rates for the statement period, the start date and remaining term of the loan, the opening balance, payments made, debits and closing balance. The competition has recommended that for home credit loans the statement should also give the total cost of the loan and should tell borrowers that they are entitled to settle the loan early, and that they can contact the lender to find out how much that would cost. It should also inform borrowers about the price information website and that they can obtain additional statements from the lender.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para7"><a name="0612068000586">We shall look carefully at that recommendation, alongside the responses to our consultation on the proposed statements, which has just closed.

Friend suggested that the Government should go beyond the remedies that the Competition Commission concluded are appropriate to address the adverse effect on competition that it found in the market. We introduced wide-ranging reforms of competition law in the Enterprise Act 2002. Among the main aims of the reforms were to take politics out of competition decisions and to provide for more transparent and accountable decision making by the competition authorities. We established the commission and the OFT as independent competition regulators, so I cannot second-guess the commission&#146;s conclusions and introduce further measures before the remedies it identified, after long and careful consideration and consultation, are put to the test. To do so would go against the aims of the Act, but I recognise what my hon. Friend said: we might take politics out of competition but we cannot take politics out of poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para9"><a name="0612068000588">My hon. Friend proposed interest rate caps of44.24 per cent. on loans of less than 35 weeks and of 69.26 per cent. on loans of more than 35 weeks. I am not sure why the amounts are so precise or what their effects would be, but perhaps we can talk about that at a later date. When the commission carried out its investigation, it gave careful consideration to whether a cap on interest rates should be imposed in the home credit sector. It consulted widely on that proposed remedy but concluded that it was not the right way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para10"><a name="0612068000589">We also thought carefully about the matter during our review of consumer credit legislation and commissioned research into the effectiveness of interest rate ceilings. Like the Competition Commission, we are not convinced that introducing interest rate ceilings will help the consumers they are supposed to protect. I am particularly concerned about the fact that if access to home credit was less easy, it might force many vulnerable consumers to use inappropriate products, or even to go outside the regulated market and end up at the mercy of illegal loan sharks, which evidence shows is a real risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para11"><a name="0612068000590">The research we commissioned looked at the impact of interest rate ceilings in a number of countries. In France and Germany, where there were interest rate caps, vulnerable consumers had less access to legitimate lenders and twice as many consumers admitted to borrowing from illegal moneylenders as in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para12"><a name="0612068000591">Consumers benefit from a competitive market offering choice, where information is available to enable them to make the right choices. The commission decided that we should set out to achieve such a market. None the less, the commission and the Government said that we will keep the issue under review. I welcome this important opportunity to ask my hon. Friends the Members for Southampton, Test and for Bridgend to submit any relevant evidence, which will be dealt with effectively in any subsequent review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para13"><a name="0612068000592">My hon. Friend suggested that it is not enough to require only larger home credit lenders, with more than 60 agents or a &#163;2 million turnover, to share data within nine months. He suggested that a wider, faster introduction of data sharing is needed to help borrowers build a suitable credit rating. As I said before, the Competition Commission has considered that. There are costs to lenders in getting data into the right format and setting up the systems needed to exchange data with credit reference agencies. That should be introduced in a way that is effective for customers, ensuring that there is no excuse for the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para14"><a name="0612068000593">My hon. Friend believes that the website proposed by the commission is a good idea, but is concernedthat the most vulnerable lenders have limited internet access and may have problems understanding the information. Finance is not an easy subject to understand, which is why I am so supportive of the measures being developed by the national strategy for financial capability, led by the Financial Services Authority. They include making financial education part of the school curriculum, providing financial education in further and higher education, rolling out seminars for employees in the workplace and providing information packs for parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para15"><a name="0612068000594">I also recognise something else. To tackle the clear inequality of access to the internet, we have invested in bringing the internet into every community. There are now more than 6,000 UK online centres&#151;places where people can access the internet in a safe, secure environment and where they can receive technical support and training. UK online centres have targeted areas where they are likely to have the most impact on inequality. They operate in all 88 neighbourhood renewal areas and in 2,000 deprived wards in England and Wales. Centres are in diverse venues, ranging from community centres to libraries, colleges and cyber caf&#233;s. Some 95 per cent. of household are within 5 km of a centre and virtually all households in the United Kingdom are within 10 km of a UK online or learndirect centre. My hon. Friend is correct: there is an issue, but I hope that he can see that we are actively engaged in ensuring that there is no inequality in access to the internet and the capacity to use it effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para16"><a name="0612068000595">I said that there would be a serious risk of driving more people to use loan sharks if we put interest rate caps on. However, we are committed to tackling loan sharks. It is often some of the most vulnerable and excluded who fall prey to illegal moneylenders, so we have been funding pilot projects in Birmingham and Glasgow to investigate the impact of strong enforcement against those moneylenders. We have invested &#163;2.6 million over two years in the project. Both pilots are performing well and prosecutions have already been secured in the midlands and Scotland, with more to follow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para17"><a name="0612068000596">Over the years, my constituency has been bedevilled by illegal loan sharks, who terrorise individuals and communities. They have no place in our communities, or on our streets or doorsteps. Such prosecutions and subsequent ones will send a clear message that there is no hiding place for those people. They do not own or control our communities and we want them out of them. They inflict misery on families and communities, particularly the elderly and other vulnerable people who are their targets, such as single mothers on benefits, those with drug and alcohol addiction, and people with mental health issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para18"><a name="0612068000597">Just last week, my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary and I announced a further &#163;1.2 million of funding for the projects. That will mean that the two existing teams will be able to continue for another year and will be able expand their operations into other areas where there is evidence of illegal loan sharks operating: for example, Liverpool, Sheffield and west Yorkshire. At the same time, I published a research report into the scope and extent of illegal moneylending and I will send my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test a copy. That, along with the evaluation of illegal moneylending pilots, will give us the best way forward after 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para19"><a name="0612068000598">I welcome the fact that my hon. Friends the Member for Southampton, Test and for Bridgend welcomed the continuing growth of credit unions. They are an important source of affordable and secure loans. One of the important ways in which we have been seeking to provide people with access to such loans is through the promotion of the credit union sector. Credit unions offer an affordable source of credit for those on low  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="5 Dec 2006">

incomes and/or those who are financially excluded and cannot get bank loans. We have invested &#163;36 million from the financial inclusion fund for work on boosting the credit union movement in deprived areas in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para20"><a name="0612068000599">The credit union movement, however, is patchy throughout the country. As my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test has quite rightly indicated, it needs a larger capital base to grow and become sustainable. The pilot projects are all about finding the most appropriate way of building a base and sustaining it. The selected credit unions were chosen to take part in the exercise on that basis. I hope that the projects will underpin the financing of loans for the poor in our communities in future years. It is absolutely right that people like ourselves should be part of the credit union movement; not to borrow, but to invest so that others can afford to borrow, while being dealt with fairly and sympathetically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para21"><a name="0612068000600">Consumers benefit from competition, but we must also make sure that the market is fair. Competition on its own will not deliver that, so we need to ensure that lenders are regulated effectively. The Government are in the process of implementing the Consumer Credit Act 2006, which is the final step in a wide-ranging reform of consumer credit regulation. The Act will improve consumer rights and redress. It will also improve the regulation of consumer credit businesses and establish a fair and competitive framework for consumer credit agreements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para22"><a name="0612068000601">Two aspects of the new Act are especially relevant to our debate. From April, we will be giving consumers the right to challenge an unfair credit relationship. We have deliberately not defined &#147;unfair&#148; so that the courts will be able to take account of all aspects of a credit relationship when deciding whether it is fair or not. That will include a consideration of what happened before and after a credit agreement was reached, as well as the terms of the agreement itself. We will also be giving borrowers the right to take their complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which will mean that they will not have to face the cost and hassle of a court process to get their cases resolved. That represents a major step forward, so I hope that hon. Members will help to promote the purposes behind the new proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para23"><a name="0612068000602">I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test for giving us the opportunity to debate this important topic. I believe that the changes that the Competition Commission is bringing forward and those under the Consumer Credit Act 2006 will result in more competition, better value and greater rights for home credit customers. I assure him that we will be looking carefully at the impact that they have in practice to ensure that that is the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para24"><a name="0612068000603">The Treasury&#146;s &#163;120 million financial inclusion fund includes &#163;45 million for the funding of a free face-to-face debt advice service in England and Wales over the financial years 2006-07 and 2007-08. Ithas also meant that we have been able to develop16 partnerships throughout England and Wales to ensure that new debt advisers are added to those already in the system. We are building capacity and opportunity. Over the next two years, approximately 100,000 people will be helped through the new programme. The majority of those 100,000 clients will  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="61205-0023.htm_para25"><a name="0612068000604">We are also heading in the same direction on our desire to ensure that there is equal access to financial services products. It might well be that other things will have to be done in future years&#151;I do not rule that out. However, I do rule out any continuing opportunity for loan sharks to prey on our people. I give the House a commitment and assurance that the work that we are doing through the pilots will help us to go a long way towards addressing the problems that my hon. Friend outlined. The evidence that he gave us was not about people operating in a regulated marketplace, but about people who were acting as illegal moneylenders. The local police and trading standards authorities have an important role in addressing such people. Those  <br>

moneylenders prey on people because they believe that they will be too frightened to speak up and speak out, but we can do the speaking up and speaking out for them. Every illegal moneylender whom we bring to court, prosecute and send to jail is another nail in the coffin of those who prey on people in our communities.</p>
