source of pride in the north-east of this country. The My hon. Friend

always maintain the independence of the British Library and the

that science centres and science museums have an important role to play

key part in making young people not just want to take an interest in
science but become scientists themselves is the work that our museums
are doing. Both the national marine aquarium and the Science museum are
doing a huge amount to make science accessible to young people and in
getting through the doors to work with schools and with parents. As she

museums up to 2008. That money was not there before. Our regional and

considerably more village halls had been supported in Scotland and

by the lottery: there has been &#163;45 million to commemorate and
preserve the experiences of those who lived and fought through the
second world war; 39,000 veterans of world war two&#151;and their
widows and carers&#151;were funded for the journey back to the
battlefields; and 11 million people participated in the veterans unite

Jowell):</b> The Government are doing a lot to promote
participation by young people. Some 80 per cent. of both primary and
secondary school children are doing at least two hours of sport and
physical activity a week, which is up from 25 per cent. in 2003. By
2010, every child who wants to, will be able to do four hours a week.
We have reintroduced competitive sport in state schools, and there is
record investment in elite athlete development. I place on record my
particular thanks to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Sport for
his work on establishing the UK school games. We are also seeing a net
increase in modern sport facilities. London&#146;s promise at
Singapore was to inspire a generation of young people through sport,
and we are proud of the progress that we have made. I am especially
proud to commend the efforts of my hon. Friend. She and the hon. Member
for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) have brought together
community organisations in Northampton to ensure that Northampton and
its young people get the maximum benefit from the possibilities of the
Olympics.</p><br>

correct to say that &#163;340 million from existing sports lottery
distributors is part of the lottery contribution to funding the 2012
games, but it is misleading to portray that money as being taken away
from wider work to promote participation and grass-roots sport. Some of
the money from Sport England, for example, is being used to fund the
new aquatic centre, which will be designed specifically to promote
community use as a legacy; the velodrome is being treated similarly.
Other spending by lottery distributors will go to Olympic-related
projects, not only in London and the east end, but around the country.

whole country benefits from the Olympics, and the comment to which he

Jowell:</b> Perhaps the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent

with the VAT point. The candidature file did not include VAT on
construction of venues for 2012 because at that time the position of
the unspecified delivery body, which had not been legislated for or
given effect, could not be anticipated. A cross-Government group signed
off London&#146;s plans and agreed that it was the right approach not
to anticipate at that point the VAT status. The issue was not raised by
PricewaterhouseCooper, who advised us on the costs, nor were issues in
relation to VAT at that point identified by the Treasury or by
departmental accounting officers&#151;[Hon.
Members: &#147;Oh!&#148;] However, what I did do when
we won the bid was to initiate an immediate review of the costs and
funding needs of the games. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the
costs of the Olympic park have been significantly reduced. The funding
needs of the games&#151;including VAT, the need for security and so
forth&#151;are a matter of continuing discussion within Government.
That is the position, delivered to the hon. Gentleman on the
Floor of the House rather than in corridor
conversations.</p><p><a name="st_o42"><a name="06110618000113"><b><a name="61106-0002.htm_spnew17"><a name="06110618001028">Jim

of remote control. A personal service is appropriate, because it will
be a difficult and worrying transition for some people.</p><br>

real success story. It has reached more than 300,000 young people and

serves.</p><p><a name="st_o65"><a name="06110618000139"><b><a name="61106-0003.htm_spnew1"><a name="06110618001054">Fiona

we will, of course, have more of the same. My hon. Friend is absolutely
right to press the point. We are seeing more in respect of extended
schools, more in our mainstream arts organisations being engaged in
schools and more specialist schools choosing the arts option. That is
where creative partnerships move from existing only in some schools to
existing across the country. My hon. Friend is right to emphasise the
success of this particular scheme. Contact with schools from a range of
artists is not just for a day or a week; we are talking about prolonged
contact with some of our most deprived children. I thought that the
most impressive report was the one from head teachers, 70 per cent. of
whom said that creative partnerships had driven up attainment across
the curriculum. That is why my Department supports the programme and is
working closely on it with the Department for Education and
Skills.</p><p><a name="st_o67"><a name="06110618000141"><b><a name="61106-0003.htm_spnew3"><a name="06110618001056">Tony

creative partnerships, serving schools in our poorest and most deprived
areas and bringing young people&#151;sometimes including those in
pupil referral units&#151;together with a range of artists. Poets,
actors and visual artists, for example, are involved over a prolonged
period to help drive up standards in schools. They seek to find new
ways of bringing the arts and creativity into schools while having a
positive impact on the rest of the curriculum. The programme is in its
third phase, so I am rather surprised that the hon. Member for Banbury

support the work of Make Poverty History, but Ofcom found that the
advert directed viewers to the Make Poverty History website, which
encouraged them to lobby the Prime Minister and the Government directly
to make the campaign a high priority on the political agenda. The
organisation therefore strayed on to the ground of political
partiality, and that is why I believe that Ofcom made its adjudication.
I know that several hon. Members regret that and find it difficult to
understand, but the matter was carefully considered in the House during

where there is a liability in tort and when&#151;as we hope&#151;it

structure under which we envisage that the scheme will operate. I feel
strongly that a rethink is needed about how the NHS handles complaints
in the round&#151;not necessarily only complaints where there is a
liability in tort. On Friday, I visited a trust that has adopted a much
more interventionist approach, by engaging with the individual bringing
the complaint to improve the patient experience and so that the trust
can learn quickly what is not going right.</p><p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="61106-0004.htm_para7"><a name="06110618000207">In an era when there is more
choice in the NHS, and patients can move around the system, the clever

looking closely at the quality of the patient experience and using
every bit of information they can get hold of to improve it. I very
much go with the grain of what my right hon. Friend says. The scheme
will facilitate a better culture, but I want to build on it, so that

seniority, and that provision will further strengthen the scheme. Not a
great deal separates the Government from the Opposition on the Bill,

hon. Gentleman that we have built into the Bill elements that will
strengthen the transparency and accountability of the process for the
patient. There is genuine disagreement between the Opposition and the
Government, but it is important that we see the scheme for what it
is&#151;an in-house, first-stage process. Under the scheme, trusts
need not go through the long process to which my right hon. Friend the
Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) alluded, but can rather engage
with the complaint from the first. They can learn from what happened to
the patient, and can then provide speedy redress, thereby improving the
experience for the patient and saving the organisation a great deal of
time. That is the right thing to do. If the first stage of the scheme
included an independent investigation, the scheme would have the same
qualities as the process that is available to patients who choose not
to pursue their complaint through the redress scheme, or who proceed to
litigation because they did not receive satisfaction through the
scheme. That is a different proposal, and it would make the scheme
entirely different.</p><p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="61106-0004.htm_para11"><a name="06110618000213">I
have to turn the subject back to the hon. Member for Billericay
(Mr. Baron). The ideas on independence put forward by the
Opposition Front Benchers, both in this House and in another place,
have varied considerably during the parliamentary passage of the Bill.
When the Bill was first sent to the Commons from another place, it
required the Secretary of State for Health to make provision for the
appointment of patient redress investigators. There was to be a panel
of independent investigators, who were to conduct investigations. The
Healthcare Commission was to maintain a list of those investigators,
and to oversee them. That model gave rise to problems of cost and
practicality, with the Department&#146;s own economist estimating a
cost of &#163;41 million a year.</p><br>

This Bill is a wasted opportunity, as is suggested by the

introducing independence is that that introduces something new that

in full their investigation report, they will decide for themselves
whether or not that investigation has credibility. If they are not
persuaded that it has, their statutory rights are not
affected&#151;to use the phrase. They can pursue that case further,
because they have been provided with a full copy of that report. That
is why I was disappointed to read the comments of Earl Howe, who seemed

that our amendment was passed because it is right in principle. It is
about patient interests, not party politics.</p><p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="61106-0005.htm_para18"><a name="06110618000250">As we all
know, clinical negligence is a mess. We can all agree on that. It is
complex, unfair, slow, costly and wasteful. We welcome the
Government&#146;s attempts to address those problems but are
concerned that the balance between the interests of patients and the
health service, as envisaged by the Government, is not right. The
redress scheme proposes a genuine alternative for the high volume of
modest value cases. We fully support those good intentions and want the

fundamentally flawed and do not best serve patient interests.</p><p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="61106-0005.htm_para19"><a name="06110618000251">Time and time

necessarily rank high in people&#146;s priorities. The

priorities. As the Minister has highlighted, the reason for that

been sent back to us by the House of Lords is because their lordships
believe that the investigation of facts under the scheme ought to be
independent of the trust in question, whereas the Government believe
that it ought to be a completely in-house process. Their lordships are
right. Patients will not have confidence in an in-house system. That is
why we shall oppose the Government&#146;s solution.</p><p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="61106-0005.htm_para20"><a name="06110618000252">Opposition Members believe that
the investigation should be overseen by someone who is independent and
unconnected with the trust and with the NHS Litigation Authority. To
us, independence is a fundamental principle of natural justice that is
enshrined in the rule against bias: no man should be judge in his own
case or cause. That avoids a conflict of interest. That is the one
common concern of the many organisations outside this place that we
have consulted. Even within this place, the Constitutional Affairs
Committee, in its report, &#147;Compensation culture&#148;, last
March, stated:</p><a name="61106-0005.htm_brev3"><a name="06110618000941"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are concerned that

Baron:</b> The Minister is going back on himself in one
respect, because the whole point of the scheme is that it should
provide a genuine alternative to litigation. One key reason why people
go to court is because they want to establish the facts in an
independent manner. If this scheme is meant to be a genuine alternative
to litigation, we should introduce that concept of independence in the
scheme itself. Most organisations outside this place would agree with
that. It is important to recognise that, if the scheme is an
alternative to going to court, we should have regard to that basic
need. Patients go to court because they want an independent assessment
of the facts. I am afraid that the Government&#146;s proposals fail
to recognise that basic point.</p><p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="61106-0005.htm_para22"><a name="06110618000256">I suggest to the Minister that
independence is important for another reason. We all want to help to
bring about a cultural change within the NHS towards greater openness
and transparency. What could be more open and transparent than inviting
someone who is independent of the trust to oversee the investigation
into all the facts? To most objective observers, a trust investigating
itself will not necessarily lead to a cultural change. After all, that
can happen now without the Bill: trusts can already investigate
themselves and the NHS Litigation Authority can already make an offer
of compensation. The Bill does not change that, yet the Government
suggest that we need the scheme to encourage such a cultural
change.</p><br>

more important to the Government&#151;the Minister has been honest
enough to admit this at the Dispatch Box, as he has before&#151;is
the ownership of the process itself. They freely concede that the
scheme is not independent. As the Minister clarified, the amendment in
lieu would not introduce the concept of independence in any way. The
Minister argues that, if trusts have ownership, they will somehow be
more likely to bring about a cultural shift in openness and
transparency. Most people will find that entirely contradictory. The
Government are trying to put the cart before the horse. NHS ownership
of the scheme might be appropriate for a health system that is
characterised by openness and transparency, but it will not in itself
get us to that point, as history has
shown.</p><p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="61106-0006.htm_para1"><a name="06110618000258">As we have
heard, the Government wish to introduce elements of independence,
rather than to embrace independence itself. It might be worth while for
the House to scrutinise quickly those elements of independence. The
Government suggest that legal advice will be available prior to any
offer. We are happy with the concept of legal advice being made
available at the time of an offer because legal rights would be
considered at that point, but giving legal advice prior to an offer
will not make the investigation of the facts independent. Such legal
advice will introduce adversarial elements, even though legal rights
are not being determined. It will cause a replication of the cost and
complexity of
litigation.</p><p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="61106-0006.htm_para2"><a name="06110618000259">The
Government also argue that the scheme will make available expert
advice, but such advice should be independent anyway. We do not need a
scheme to make medical expert advice independent. Meanwhile, it is not
clear whether medical reports will consider fact, fault, causation and
condition, or whether they will be
disclosed.</p><p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="61106-0006.htm_para3"><a name="06110618000260">The
Government suggest that the fact that patients will be able to complain
to the ombudsman is another important aspect of independence. However,
that applies to complaints of maladministration, rather than
substantive investigations of the facts. The Government also point out
that, if patients are not happy with the findings of the scheme, the
courts will be available. Perversely, that shows the failure of a
scheme that purports to provide a genuine alternative to litigation.
Advancing such an argument almost defeats the purpose of the scheme
itself.</p><p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="61106-0006.htm_para4"><a name="06110618000261">Unless an
investigation of the facts has a badge of independence to reassure
patients, the scheme will add nothing whatsoever to what can already
happen. As we have mentioned, NHS trusts already have the ability to
investigate themselves and the NHSLA has the power to make an
assessment of liability and, when appropriate, offer compensation. I
put it to the Minister that, unless the Government concede on
independence&#151;I do not expect that they will&#151;the Bill will
be a wasted opportunity in many
respects.</p><p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="61106-0006.htm_para5"><a name="06110618000262">I
wish to touch briefly on separation because I think that it is relevant
to independence. The scheme must be a two-stage process with a strict
separation between the functions of fact-finding and fault-finding. An
investigation of what happened should not be contaminated by
considerations of who was to blame. There is ample legal authority for
the rationale of such separation&#151;the principle behind the
Inquiries Act 2005 and the coroners&#146; courts&#151;so it is
happening throughout the country.</p><br>

will, presumably, be made on a without prejudice basis&#151;in other
words, it cannot imply liability&#151;but the reports will not
ordinarily be disclosable if they include the fault-finding stage,

Liberal Democrat Members have tried hard to establish two clear
principles: a clear separation between fact-finding and fault-finding,
and the independence of the process. It has become gradually more
apparent that the Government intend that investigations should be
thorough and that all the facts should be established before an inquiry
is handed over to the next stage. We would prefer a slightly more rigid
separation, but we can broadly agree that everything is moving in
pretty much the right direction. However, there remains a problem with
the NHS Litigation Authority taking over at that stage, because its job
is, in effect, to protect the NHS from over-large claims and often to
challenge such claims. Rightly, part of its remit is to protect the
public purse, but that seems counterintuitive as regards the stated aim
of the Bill, which is to be on the side of the patient. Many patient

he will forgive me for saying that he seems to be bogged down in those
mechanisms and has found fault with each idea without recognising the

Minister will forgive me if I go back to an earlier time in my life,
when I was part of the advisory group that worked up the previous
complaints system. We all, in good faith, believed that an in-house
complaints investigation system could work. He will also know, because
this will have landed on his desk now and in previous incarnations,
that we were wrong. As an NHS chairman, like the noble Baroness, Lady
Murphy, I chaired a community health service NHS trust and had to sign
off the letters responding to complaints. Very often, I felt that the
trust investigated itself fairly. Sometimes I did not. Either way,
it was equally clear that the punters outside&#151;the
patients and their families&#151;were dissatisfied because
no one outside had had a proper
look.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i>

provision is potentially flawed.</p><p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="61106-0006.htm_para24"><a name="06110618000294">An independent overseer would
be in a better position to identify the organisational dysfunctions
that we must acknowledge occur in some organisations. I am pleased that
the Minister has said that he will review the issue. Will he describe
the time scale involved? Will he also consider introducing either a
pilot scheme or enabling legislation so that trusts may choose whether
to have an independent overseer? Alternatively, there could be a few
experimental areas in which independence is tried out, so that when the
system is reviewed, we can make a full comparison to determine which
method works best in the interests of patients.</p><p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="61106-0006.htm_para25"><a name="06110618000295"><i> Question put, </i>That this

will probably recall, was debated at length in this House. Following a
free vote, an offence was created of docking a dog&#146;s tail other
than for medical treatment unless the dog is a certified working dog.
The amendments made in the other place do not in any way deviate from
that policy, but they are necessary to give full and proper effect to
it. Several amendments agreed in the other place are technical, to
address an oversight in the drafting of the delegated power, which did
not completely allow us to achieve the policy that I described in the

those types. The amendments are necessary to allow us to achieve that
very restriction.</p><p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="61106-0007.htm_para20"><a name="06110618000806">A

that.</p><p><a name="st_o157"><a name="06110618000808"><b><a name="61106-0007.htm_spnew8"><a name="06110618001631">Mr.

discretion of vets. They will generally take their responsibilities
seriously and they will require a certification that the dog will be
used for shooting in some way. It is better for vets to be able to make
a decision about whether a dog belongs to one of those breeds or is a
mix, provided the evidence is given to them by the owner. It is not up
to us to second-guess how they will arrive at that
decision.</p><p><a name="st_o158"><a name="06110618000809"><b><a name="61106-0007.htm_spnew9"><a name="06110618001632">Mr.

hard to try to make the process as easy as possible. If one looks at
the animal welfare provision in countries that have the blanket ban
that he advocates, it is apparent that it does not work in many cases,
because they do not have the accompanying ban on showing, for example,
or they have not tightened the regulations in the way we have. My
officials and I are confident that this is probably the best we are
going to get, given the will of the House as expressed in that
free vote. At this late hour, it is not even possible to revisit
that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="61106-0007.htm_para21"><a name="06110618000811">A further set of
amendments was agreed in the other place, prompted by concerns raised
by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. It was worried that vets
could be accountable if they had been misled into docking a dog
illegally and that assessing a dog as &#147;likely to work&#148;
from evidence provided was not within their professional expertise and
training. Instead, the amendments will allow a vet to certify that he
has seen the evidence required by regulations to demonstrate that a dog
is likely to

working dog exemption, for which this House voted, still in

the Minister said, tail docking and the debates it sparked in Committee
and in the Chamber have been the most emotive and controversial parts
of the Bill, but we have reached a rational and reasoned position. The
amendments, which were originally suggested by Lord Soulsby and then
taken on by the Government, offer a sensible way forward. The RCVS has
expressed concerns about veterinary surgeons being responsible for
determining whether a dog is a working dog and the legal liabilities
that would entail. When vets are docking the tail of a working dog they
want proof of the need to dock the tail to lie with the dog&#146;s
owner or handler; otherwise they will be reluctant to carry out the
procedure. The amendment resolves those
concerns.</p><p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="61106-0007.htm_para23"><a name="06110618000814">We remain
uncertain, nevertheless, about which breeds of dog the Government will
permit to be docked, as well as about what evidence will demonstrate
that a dog is to be used for working purposes, although the Minister
touched on that point in answer to my right hon. and learned Friend the
Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg). I was a

a dog may work?</p><br>

dogs; indeed, in many cases it is wholly appropriate, but I want to say
a few words about amendment No. 2. I would prefer to leave the question

authority will, by regulation, determine whether a dog is capable of
falling within the classification &#147;working

difficult when one is dealing with pure breeds, but it becomes very
difficult when dealing with crosses, especially when somewhere down the

proposed procedure is curious, because I do not see how the regulating
authority will be able to define a dog, other than a pure bred animal,

veterinary surgeon, as the Minister suggested; it gives the

not&#151;so we should wait until they are published before making a
judgment. However, although I agree that it is important that such
matters are as clear as possible, it is also important that we do not
end up with bad law, such that a vet could regard an animal as a
working dog but would not be allowed to make that judgment due to the
drafting of the regulations. In a sense, this discussion is about what
the regulations might say, and the Minister and his officials will no

other place, and reflect commitments that my colleague, Lord Rooker,
gave both in Grand Committee and in the House of Lords Select Committee
on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform. Lords amendments Nos. 12 and
19 introduce a duty to consult before introducing any licensing or

consult under clauses 15 and 16 into line with the wording of the duty
in clauses 12, 13 and 17. Lords amendment No. 53 responds to concerns
expressed by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee that
if a code of practice is revoked and not replaced there is no
parliamentary procedure governing that decision. In practice, we do not
think that that will often happen, if at all, but because it would be
an exceptional occurrence, we agree that parliamentary scrutiny of the
decision is appropriate. On that basis, I urge the House to accept the
Lords amendments.</p><p><a name="st_o174"><a name="06110618000843"><b><a name="61106-0008.htm_spnew4"><a name="06110618001648">Bill

provisions for making regulations under the legislation are important,
as they appear to widen the scope for consultation. The Opposition have
pushed for similar measures throughout, especially in Committee, when
the Minister reassured us that such technical amendments were not
necessary. It is important when drafting regulations and codes that
everyone with an interest in those matters should have their say and
not be excluded. Members with a keen interest in this Bill will have
been lobbied on various provisions by a wide range of people and
organisations, and by considering all those views we have managed to
produce a better Bill.</p><p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="61106-0008.htm_para4"><a name="06110618000844">I wish to sound a note of

be grateful if the Minister reassured us that he will consult
individuals who do not necessarily represent a specific organisation or
interest, too, and consider their views. If the Lords amendments shift
the emphasis from individuals to delegates and representatives, someone
who wants to be heard must be backed by a group. That is fine, unless
individuals are prevented from participating in the consultation,
because they are not part of a group. I am sure that the Minister can
reassure me on that point.</p><p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="61106-0008.htm_para7"><a name="06110618000847">It is
important to conduct a thorough consultation on the future codes and
regulations on which much of the legislation depends and on which
owners, inspectors, prosecutors and the courts will base their
decisions. We must wait for the individual animal codes to see how we
can ensure that our cats have enough mental stimulation and are not too
fat or too thin. We must wait to see the status of animals in circuses
and the definition of pet fairs. We must wait, too, for the codes and
regulations that govern the welfare of racing greyhounds. There is
tremendous pressure on the Minister to produce those codes sooner
rather than later, and I am pleased that he has already prioritised
greyhounds. There is a need for action now, as the stories in the
newspapers over the summer about the killing of tens of thousands of
dogs demonstrated. I hope, however, that the extra time will be used
wisely for a thorough consultation and scrutiny by
Parliament.</p><p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="61106-0008.htm_para8"><a name="06110618000848">It
would be helpful if the Minister updated us on the progress of the
production of those codes and regulations, and tell us which working
groups he has established. In Committee, he could not tell us how many
codes of practice he intended to introduce. Will he sketch out his
ideas for pre-legislative scrutiny of the codes, which are subject to
negative resolution? I hope that there will be no need to pray against
them. Will he explain how consistency will be maintained across Great
Britain in producing regulations and codes, as Scotland has a different
Act and Wales can produce its own secondary legislation? With regard to
his earlier responses, different definitions could apply to the docking
of working dogs in Wales. I hope that we will have an opportunity for
helpful pre-legislative scrutiny before the codes are introduced in
statutory instruments, and I hope that he can reassure me about the
importance of allowing individuals to take part in
consultation.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_8"><a name="61106-0008.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="06110618000979">5.15

timetable will be for that, and what attention will be given to
non-regulated
tracks?</p><p><a name="st_o176"><a name="06110618000851"><b><a name="61106-0008.htm_spnew6"><a name="06110618001650">Miss
Ann Widdecombe (Maidstone and The Weald) (Con):</b> I shall
concentrate on two issues. First, regulations are usually designed to
give effect to a Bill that has been agreed to by the House and the
measures contained therein, but in respect of pet fairs, the Government
have radically changed their position from that which they set out when
they initially brought the Bill before the House, and the banning of
pet fairs is not in the Bill. Therefore, in many ways we are completely
at the mercy of the Government in respect of what they do with
regulations on this matter, because there is nothing in the Bill to
guide them.</p><p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="61106-0008.htm_para10"><a name="06110618000852">I have
been very concerned about the Government&#146;s attitude towards pet
fairs throughout. I share the sentiments of the hon. Member for
Carlisle (Mr. Martlew), who said that this is a most
important Bill and that people with an interest in animal welfare will
welcome it. Those of us with an interest in animal welfare were
baffled, however, at the original decision that pet fairs would not be
banned. We were further concerned when the current situation was tested
to the limit in June of this year when the Parrot Society
UK&#151;apparently acting on the advice of somebody in the Department
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, whom it is said has been
involved in the drafting of this Bill&#151;organised a one-day public
bird sale to test the state of the law and proclaimed that the birds
were not pet birds, but were breeding birds.</p><p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="61106-0008.htm_para11"><a name="06110618000853">When there are such ways of
getting around the law&#151;or of attempting to do so&#151;I am
somewhat dubious about the whole of this business being left to
regulations, although I accept that I am now faced with a fait
accompli. As I understand it, the Minister is proposing that new
measures will be laid in regulations permitting occasional private and
non-commercial sales between hobbyists. I think that most of us could
say, &#147;Yes, that is perfectly reasonable.&#148;, but we should
look at the way that the law was circumvented&#151;or the way that an
attempt was made to do so&#151;with that parrot fair. Thousands were
in attendance; it was not a hobby fair at all. Therefore, we need to be
assured that these regulations will be extremely tight, and that there
will be a good opportunity for this House to examine them before they
just get relegated to statutory instruments, when it will all become a
fait accompli.</p><p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="61106-0008.htm_para12"><a name="06110618000854">The
second thing that I am particularly concerned about is the codes. I
have looked at the draft code: I have looked at it, I have blinked in
disbelief and I have read it again. Apparently, I, as a cat owner, who

cannot&#151;how much my cat should weigh in order to keep me within
the law, relevant to its bone structure, its size and its breed. I do
not have a clue about that.</p><br>

I commit an offence&#151;if this code of practice informs the
law&#151;if I do not provide for due privacy for my cats when they
visit the litter box. The code actually says that we must take
cognisance of an animal&#146;s preference for privacy. Do the people
who wrote this code have any experience of animals&#146; preference
for privacy? They do not have any preference for privacy when they are
discharging their natural functions. They will walk out during a
barbecue and do it there and then, in the middle of the lawn. However,
I commit an offence in law if I do not have regard for the
animal&#146;s &#147;preference for
privacy&#148;.</p><p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="61106-0008.htm_para14"><a name="06110618000858">That
may sound entirely humorous, but it genuinely is in the code of
practice. The more serious point is that we all know what happens when
codes and regulations get too detailed and the implementers get too
zealous: ordinary citizens who cannot get the police round when they
have been burgled find that they are on the wrong end of the law for
what most people would consider entirely silly nonsense. We have to
know that this code of practice, with all its silly detail, will be
applied only with an exceptionally light hand and only in the spirit of
the legislation, which talks about neglect, cruelty and indifference to
welfare, and that it will not penalise some poor owner who cannot say
how much her cat should weigh. I will of course make a point of asking
the vet about that when my cats go for their annual boosters, and I
will write the information down and carry it round in my pocket, so
that I can pull it out if I am ever asked for it. I say that only
slightly sarcastically, Mr. Deputy Speaker, because I know
that law has a habit of growing its own
legs.</p><p><a name="st_o179"><a name="06110618000859"><b><a name="61106-0008.htm_spnew9"><a name="06110618001653">Norman
Baker: </b>The hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr.
Martlew) rightly said that this is a good Bill which is welcomed in all
parts of the House, but ultimately the proof of the pudding is in the
eating. We have taken on trust promises from the Government to
introduce codes on a range of matters that are of great concern to
Members in all parts of the House, and we have not disbelieved the
Minister&#146;s integrity or his intention to introduce them. We were
told, clich&#233; notwithstanding, that this was not going to be a
&#147;Christmas tree Bill&#148;&#151;a phrase used regularly in
Committee and even on Second Reading. However, we must ensure that
these codes are introduced quickly and as a matter of priority, as
people would wish&#151;I concur that the issue of greyhounds also
needs to be dealt with speedily&#151;and, to pick up on the point
just made by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss
Widdecombe), that they are well written. I have no idea how much my
cats weigh, either, and I have no intention of finding out.</p><p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="61106-0008.htm_para15"><a name="06110618000860">We must press the Minister this
afternoon for some indication of what he is doing about these
outstanding matters. He was good enough to say in his introductory
remarks that he would give such an indication, and I assume that, as we
are discussing codes, he feels that this is the appropriate time to do
so. Although we have made welcome significant progress in a number of
areas, even at this very late stage in the Bill&#146;s
consideration&#151;at five minutes to midnight&#151;there remain
unresolved issues on which it is not quite clear where the Government
are going. For example, the situation regarding circuses has, if
anything, become less rather than more clear as a consequence of the

the way in which some local authorities have been interpreting it for
years: that is, to say that pet fairs are against the law and should
not be licensed. Unfortunately, there was inconsistency. Now we have a
kind of consistency in the Government&#146;s proposals in that
commercial pet fairs and markets are not to be licensed, but those

interesting that the Government basically stopped all shows during the

animal diseases are much more prevalent, the issue is about not just
animal welfare, but its interconnectedness with the fact that there is
a threat if there are large numbers of birds or animals together. Does

we do not often agree on such matters, I think that I will echo my
right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss
Widdecombe) on the nature of the consultation. In this instance, as in
so many, the Government will rely on statutory instruments. We all know
that statutory instruments are an imperfect way of legislating because
they are either approved or rejected in whole. I would like the
Government to be willing to lay before the House the regulations and
the code&#151;in so far as it is different from a
regulation&#151;in true draft for comment, before they are laid
before the House for approval. That would enable the Government to take
account of the views of right hon. and hon. Members on the draft, as
opposed to the measure for approval, and allow members of the public to
comment on the original draft. The Government would thus be able to
test the acceptability of their proposal and amend it in time so that
the House would not approve an imperfect
draft.</p><p><a name="st_o188"><a name="06110618000884"><b><a name="61106-0009.htm_spnew3"><a name="06110618001662">Shona
McIsaac:</b> As many hon. Members have said, the Bill is a
major step forward for animal welfare, because it updates 100-year-old
legislation. We should be proud of that, but as others have said, we
will be relying on regulations, which causes me some worry. As the
right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham
(Mr. Hogg) said, if there is concern about a regulation that
has been tabled, there is little that we can do about it. I was thus
also going to suggest that drafts of such regulations should be
produced before they are finally tabled to allow comment and
consultation. That would allow the organisations involved in
discussions to point out possible flaws and problems with the
regulations.</p><p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="61106-0009.htm_para5"><a name="06110618000885">I am
worried about circuses, although I will not make a lengthy speech on

me, at least at the

echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David
Lepper) said, there will be people who will try their very best to
circumvent any regulation that we put in place. That is a serious
concern. My hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr.
Morley) and I know a man in our area who will do anything he can to
circumvent any regulations that we impose in respect of tail docking. I
do not believe that he will stick to any such regulations. He will say
that a cross-breed dog&#146;s grandparent was a spaniel, for example,
and use any way he can to get around the law.</p><p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="61106-0009.htm_para8"><a name="06110618000890">Enforcement
is also a serious concern. I have recently been dealing with a case in
Cleethorpes of a small zoo. The vets who inspected the conditions in
which animals in the zoo were kept issued a damning report, but the
local authority went ahead and gave the zoo a licence to keep the
animals. We have to be careful about how we enforce the regulations
that we impose, so that we can take on those who will do all they can
to circumvent the law. Sadly, not everyone in Britain is an animal
lover, despite the excellent work that the Bill
represents.</p><p><a name="st_o191"><a name="06110618000891"><b><a name="61106-0009.htm_spnew6"><a name="06110618001665">Mr.

by trying to reassure the hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin) and
the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham
(Mr. Hogg) about consultation. Throughout the passage of the
Bill I have been prepared to hear representations from all interested
individuals, and I am sure that my successors, whoever they are, will
do the same. There is no intention to restrict consultation to people
who have a particular interest in the subject of the
regulation.</p><p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="61106-0009.htm_para10"><a name="06110618000893">As a rule, we
try to lay regulations in draft so that anyone can comment, as the
right hon. and learned Gentleman suggested. However, there is a
trade-off between the number of consultations one has in hand and their
different stages and speed. Ministers are always under pressure from
some quarters to get regulations made as quickly as possible, but it is
important that consultation takes place properly. The draft cat code is
a case in point: it was published as a draft in an attempt to help hon.
Members following a request made in Standing Committee, but we made it
clear at the time that it was merely a prototype. As the right hon.
Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) said, it was far
too long and too
detailed.</p><p><a name="st_o192"><a name="06110618000894"><b><a name="61106-0009.htm_spnew7"><a name="06110618001666">Norman

for example, those who are interested will no doubt find it and be able
to comment. However, some parish councillors in my patch complain to me
that they are consulted on matters that have nothing to do with them.
There is a balance to be struck: matters must be made available for
consultation without swamping people who have no interest in the
subject.</p><p><a name="st_o193"><a name="06110618000895"><b><a name="61106-0009.htm_spnew8"><a name="06110618001667">Mr.

authorities, but the High Court judgment of 14 June 2006 in relation to
a judicial review in the case of Haynes <i> v.</i> Stafford borough
council, which was about the issuing of a licence to the organisers of
a pet fair under the Pet Animals Act 1951, led us to review our
position. One of the findings of that review was that local authorities
could not issue licences under the 1951 Act to organisers of pet fairs
where those events fell within the activity described in section 2 of
the Act and involved the sale of pet animals as part of a business to
members of the public.</p><p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="61106-0009.htm_para13"><a name="06110618000898">In the light
of that judgment, the Government propose to prohibit the sale of pet
animals to members of the public where this is part of a business at
pet fairs. However, we also propose to make exceptions to this
prohibition in the case of koi carp shows, racing pigeon sales and
poultry sales. Such events will be licensed by local authorities under
regulations to be made under the Bill. Events where there is no selling
of animals to members of the public, or where there is selling of
animals but not in the course of a business, such as hobbyists selling
excess stock, will continue to take place.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_10"><a name="61106-0009.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="06110618000981">5.45

the standards of pet vending generally, as well as the introduction of

not sensible to include the widespread and common sales of koi carp,
poultry and racing pigeons in the ban on pet fairs, which would have
been the effect of not granting the exemption that I mentioned. We are
not aware and nobody has made us aware of particular welfare problems
at such sales which require them to be banned, and that is consistent

will give inspectors who enter premises in an emergency the powers of
search and seizure, but it does not make substantive changes. It will
serve two purposes. The first is to ensure that, when an inspector
enters premises to search for an animal in distress, he has the power
to inspect the animal when he finds it. This is a necessary
prerequisite

limited to occasions on which the inspector has entered either under

inspection under clauses 25 to 28, now clauses 26 to 29. We recognise
that, if an inspector has already entered premises using his clause 19
powers, to have to leave and obtain a warrant under clause 22 and
return would be impractical and a waste of resources as well as giving
rise to the risk of evidence being destroyed. The Lords amendments are
intended to ensure that the inspector can exercise limited
evidence-gathering powers, even though he has entered the premises

that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="61106-0010.htm_para23"><a name="06110633000031">The amendments
achieve four objectives. First, they reduce the maximum amount of any
required financial penalty from &#163;500 to &#163;250. Secondly,
they provide that the financial penalties can be used only in respect
of a set of offences specified in secondary legislation. Thirdly, they
require that secondary legislation must specify in relation to each
offence the maximum penalty for that offence or group of offences. The
prosecutor would have some discretion to set a lower financial penalty
than would otherwise be attracted by the offence in question&#151;for
example, to take account of the offender&#146;s ability to pay. There
will therefore be a maximum for that particular offence according to
the prosecutor&#146;s judgment about offender&#146;s being able to
pay. Finally, the amendments make subject to the affirmative resolution
procedure any proposed changes to the maximum hours&#151;set at 20 in
the Bill&#151;that an offender can be required to attend at a
specified place and to the maximum financial penalty of
&#163;250.</p><p><a name="st_o235"><a name="06110633000032"><b><a name="61106-0010.htm_spnew26"><a name="06110633001833">Mr.

reminded me this morning that breaking into a garden or allotment shed

down a road after removing a bicycle from a shed, breaking a lock in
the process. They were arrested and

small point that arises in amendment 5E. Subsection (1) would provide
that a financial penalty may be attached to a conditional caution for
any offence that the Secretary of State prescribes by designation. The
Solicitor-General has been kind enough to confirm that the designation
will happen through the negative, not the affirmative, resolution
procedure. That means that, through negative resolution procedure, the
Secretary of State can put into a statutory instrument any offence that
he may wish to designate. The effect is that the Government can drive
up the gravity of the offences that the financial penalty
covers.</p><p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="61106-0011.htm_para7"><a name="06110633000048">The
Solicitor-General fairly said that he did not wish domestic burglary to
be included in the designated category of offence. However, I believe
that he would concede that his successors could include domestic
burglary or, indeed, grievous bodily harm, if they were so minded, in
the designated class of offence to which the financial penalty
attaches. They could do that by the negative
procedure.</p><p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="61106-0011.htm_para8"><a name="06110633000049">Anyone who
is familiar with the procedures of the House knows that the statutory
instrument procedure is imperfect because the House either accepts or
rejects a statutory instrument in its entirety. I can contemplate a
statutory instrument that includes several offences, some that hon.
Members would not wish to be included in the designated category and
others that they would be content to welcome into it. However, we could
not pick and choose because of the procedure.</p><p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="61106-0011.htm_para9"><a name="06110633000050">In a spirit of compromise, I
ask the Solicitor-General to publish a draft of the statutory
instrument before it is formally laid so that hon. Members and, indeed,
anyone who dissents from the proposition that one specific offence
should be included in the draft statutory instrument, could object at
that early stage rather than being obliged to try to reject the whole
list by a negative prayer. I do not like the procedure, but if we must
have it, an undertaking to proceed in the way in which I suggest would
go some way towards dealing with the objections that I have always had

they do not take effect unless certain things happen. I have assured
the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) that
those things will not happen, because we have no intention of moving
the resolution or failing to ratify the treaty. I can understand the
desire to discuss the technicalities of those resolutions, but the
important point is that we would not give effect to them, as we would
not pass such resolutions or fail to ratify within the 12 months
specified. Therefore, we can comply with the conventions of both Houses
while ultimately defeating the Opposition amendments, which would, in
effect, block the treaty.</p><p><a name="st_o252"><a name="06110633000072"><b><a name="61106-0011.htm_spnew10"><a name="06110633001850">Mr.

rarely if ever used in any of the contributions from those on the

Washington to urge action on the United States, on the basis of
arguments deployed in this House that it was presenting an insuperable
obstacle to ratification and to the Bill&#146;s passage. We went to
the United States, and cajoled&#151;and persuaded&#151;the Senate
to ratify. That has now been dealt with, and the forum arrangements
have been clarified. As I have said, the Attorney-General is having
discussions with his United States counterpart. Given all those
developments, the argument about the practical effects on the
implementation of justice, and on the victims themselves, is one from
which the Opposition can no longer
hide.</p><p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="61106-0011.htm_para23"><a name="06110633000077">If

extraditable offences not by a fixed list of crimes, but by a sentence
threshold. That has the advantages of flexibility and dynamism to take
account of changing circumstances. We are currently hampered by our
inability to chase a criminal for a crime not thought of in 1972. We
want to ensure that future-proofing is written into the treaty, making
it more effective over a period than a treaty listing extraditable
offences by name rather than according to a threshold of
seriousness.</p><p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="61106-0012.htm_para9"><a name="06110633000095">The
treaty will also allow the extradition of someone who is already

whole life sentence in America is highly unlikely ever to be brought to
justice for other crimes that he may have committed here. That means
that we are selling some British victims of crime short, because they
will never see their attackers in the dock. The new treaty will resolve

UK, or should be, when it comes to exerting influence on the US. The
treaty is not of great military significance. It does not decide

Garnier:</b> No, I shall not give way. The Home Secretary
spoke for 25 minutes in a 45-minute debate and other Members want to
speak&#151;[<i> Interruption.</i>] There is no point in the Home
Secretary mumbling away; he sauntered into our debate the other day and
he has done so again today. The House takes the issue rather more
seriously than he does. The House takes justice and fairness rather
more seriously than he does and it will not be persuaded by the
ridiculous and utterly desperate arguments put by him in today&#146;s
debate, and by the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department,
the hon. Member for Enfield, North in her letter to my right hon.
Friend the Member for Witney, that if we do something we shall destroy
the whole relationship between us and the United States. That is a
feeble and ridiculous argument, and I urge the House to resist it and
the Home Secretary&#146;s rather tiresome
blandishments.</p><p><a name="st_o279"><a name="06110633000123"><b><a name="61106-0012.htm_spnew21"><a name="06110633001877">Mr.
Heath:</b> Even in the brief time available for the rest of
the debate, I want to welcome the fact that the Home Secretary came to
the House this evening to give us the benefit of his views. However, I
hoped that he would use the opportunity, first, to apologise for the
fact that his predecessor had concluded such a hopelessly unequal Bill.
Secondly, I hoped he would say that he recognised the deficiencies of
the treaty but that there was scope for renegotiation, which he was
prepare to undertake, and that he would then come back to the House
with a greatly improved treaty. Thirdly, I hoped he would say that he
recognised the deficiencies in the House&#146;s protocols for dealing
with ratification of treaties and that he would hold talks with the
Leader of the House to ensure that we had a better way of looking at
treaties in future so that such things would not occur
again.</p><p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="61106-0012.htm_para22"><a name="06110633000124">Sadly, we have
heard none of those things from the Home Secretary, which is hardly
surprising, because it was well trailled in advance that today was the
day when he would lead an assault on the Tories for being soft on
crime. If that is what he chooses to do, we have no means of stopping
him in the context of this important consideration of Lords amendments;
but if his way of exercising his choice is to present in lieu of the
Lords amendments words that he admits are entirely bogus and have no
effect, and to ask the House to conclude that that is a satisfactory
response to those in another place who are trying desperately to
improve the law of the land, he does a disservice to the House. Indeed,
he holds the House and the other place in contempt, which is a most
unfortunate state of
affairs.</p><p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="61106-0012.htm_para23"><a name="06110633000125">As
the House knows, we have always argued against the treaty because we
believe that it contains fundamental inequalities. We have voted
against it from the outset because we believe that it needs to be
renegotiated. We have not called for its early ratification because we
do not believe in ratifying a treaty based on such unequal terms, and
we are no more satisfied with it now than we were in the first
place.</p>

framework, which is not provided by the words he urges the House to

resist his position.</p><p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="61106-0013.htm_para1"><a name="06110633000127">I
want to allow some time for others to speak so this is my last point:
it is preposterous to suggest that those who argue against the treaty
for sound legal and constitutional reasons do so to give succour to
those who break the law and avoid due process in the United States or
in this country. That is not the case and it is inappropriate to
suggest it. If the Home Secretary&#146;s argument rests solely on the
removal of the statute of limitations in the treaty, he needs much
firmer grounds to argue his case in this
place.</p><p><a name="st_o280"><a name="06110633000128"><b><a name="61106-0013.htm_spnew0"><a name="06110633001878">Mr.
John Denham (Southampton, Itchen) (Lab):</b> The debate has
revealed a surprising degree of ad-hocery in our extradition
arrangements with a great many countries, not just with the United
States of America. Perhaps the point of principle on which Members need
to dwell before the vote is whether the treaty should be wrecked on the
basis of a wider flaw in many of our extradition treaties, especially
in relation to forum and what should be done when a case could be tried
in one or two jurisdictions, or worse, when somebody is judged not to
have a case to answer in this country but is still subject to
extradition requests&#151;not only from the US but from many other
countries.</p><p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="61106-0013.htm_para2"><a name="06110633000129">One of the
things that we have achieved in the debate is the promise of guidance
and, at least in relation to the United States, a clear set of criteria
and a process whereby the decisions will be judged. I have to say that
many of us would have preferred some judicial oversight of the process,
but I have it in writing from the Under-Secretary of State for the Home
Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Joan Ryan)
and we have heard today from the Home Secretary that to insert those
clauses would mean that we made this country ridiculous in its conduct
of international diplomacy and international agreements. We should not
take that step this
evening.</p><p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="61106-0013.htm_para3"><a name="06110633000130">There are

Ladyman:</b> Hon. Members will recall that during
consideration of this Bill in another place, a clause was added in
Committee that aims to allow safety camera partnerships to retain and
use surplus fine income from speeding offences to fund other transport
measures, including road safety. The clause was unequivocally
overturned by the Commons in Committee, when I explained that new
arrangements were being introduced for the integration and funding of
safety cameras from 1 April 2007, resulting in local authorities
receiving additional money for road safety through the local transport
plan process; they would receive some &#163;440 million over
four years. That will replace the current netting-off arrangements, so
there will no longer be surplus income as envisaged by the clause added
in another place.</p><p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="61106-0013.htm_para19"><a name="06110633000666">The
clause, however, was reinserted by the other place when the Commons
amendments were considered last week. It is defective in a number of
respects. For example, it refers to</p><a name="61106-0013.htm_brev10"><a name="06110633001792"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;income from the enforcement of
offences under subsection

and it could extend to income from offences detected by police officers
as well as by cameras. The clause also uses several undefined terms
such as &#147;a safety camera scheme&#148;.</p><p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="61106-0013.htm_para21"><a name="06110633000668">The legislation is at a very
late stage, and we are under an obligation to save a vital Bill. Given
that their Lordships are keen that the Government should have the power
to make such regulations, we have tabled amendment No. 1, which is
workable and is not technically defective, thus meeting their
Lordships&#146; wishes. In the event that the powers were used, that
would be contingent on having a mechanism to ensure that the
regulations neither created incentives for partnerships to drive up the
level of fines to secure additional income nor penalised partnerships
that succeed in improving compliance with speed limits, thus reducing
the income from speed cameras, by allowing them less money for other
road safety purposes. None the less, I reiterate our obligation to this
important Bill, and I therefore urge the House to support the
motion.</p>

camera had increased from 288,600 in 1997 to 1,786,000 in 2004. There
has been a commensurate increase in income. In 2000-01, seven
partnerships received just over &#163;10.3 million and spent just
over &#163;8.9 million, leaving a balance of &#163;1.3 million for
the consolidated fund. In 2003-04 receipts were &#163;112.2 million
and expenditure &#163;91.8 million, leaving an astonishing
&#163;20.4 million for the Chancellor. Not only have receipts
increased tenfold but the balance going to the Chancellor has increased

where the installation by Shropshire county council of only
&#163;12,000-worth of interactive signs at Sandford bends, where
there is a mediaeval bridge, has had spectacular results. In the three
years prior to installation, there was an average of three recorded
personal injury accidents a year. Since the signs were installed,
however, there have been no such accidents at the location. The average
cost per accident is &#163;106,710 and, in addition, the cost of
repairs to the bridge was &#163;120,000 in 2002 and &#163;40,000 in
2003 and again in 2004. Furthermore, queues, which were sometimes a

pleased that the Minister has come round to the idea of handing the
money to local agencies, which can spend the sums on small schemes such
as that which I have mentioned. This afternoon, I had a very
constructive meeting with my noble Friend Lord Hanningfield, who has
done sterling work in the other place, and the Minister&#146;s
counterpart in the other place, Lord Davies of Oldham. He confirmed
what the Minister said: that the intention is to reinstate clause 2, as
the Government accept that they were defeated in the Lords, and that
they intend to deliver the intended aims of the Opposition clause. We
are pleased that the Government have made such a concession for, I
think, the first time in respect of this Bill. However, it is
ironic&#151;I cannot resist pointing this out&#151;that this is the
one clause to which they let us make an amendment, before they withdrew
it.</p><p><a name="st_o290"><a name="06110633000672"><b><a name="61106-0014.htm_spnew1"><a name="06110633002393">Mr.
David Kidney (Stafford) (Lab):</b> I just want to say that the
new arrangements announced by the Government for next April are clearly
superior to the arrangements in the Lords&#146; desire. They are
superior because of the certainty about the money that local
authorities will get; that will not be dependent on the speeding-fine
income that they collect in their area. It is better for public
perception that people do not have to be fined for speeding in order
for local authorities to get the central grant from the Government. I
see this arrangement&#151;which I hope will be approved in a few
minutes by this place to satisfy the other place&#151;as a
supplement, so that in certain possible circumstances even more money
can go to local authorities if there is a greater income from fines
than people
anticipated.</p><p><a name="st_o291"><a name="06110633000673"><b><a name="61106-0014.htm_spnew2"><a name="06110633002394">Mr.

is that none of us wants cameras to be deployed simply for the purpose
of raising money and increasing income. It is key that if the powers
that we have introduced in this amendment, which the Lords wanted us to
introduce, were used, in order to stop that happening, it would be
necessary for some other mechanism to be used in conjunction with that.
The Government do not believe that the powers are necessary because we
have already achieved the objective that their Lordships wanted in the
first place by different means. What we have done is to end from 1
April next year the so-called netting-off arrangements&#151;the
scheme whereby camera income could only be used for more cameras and
any surplus went to the Treasury. We have said that the total sum of
the fines which will go to the Treasury in future&#151;approximately
&#163;110 million a year&#151;will be paid back to the local
authorities as road safety grants. Therefore, while the changes
introduced by the Government are in place, it is correct that the money
going back to the councils can only be used for road safety and
measures relating to
that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="61106-0014.htm_para5"><a name="06110633000680">As the Treasury
has agreed to that amount of money for four years, my hon. Friend the
Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) is also absolutely right
that what the Government have done is an improvement on what their
Lordships intended, because that income is guaranteed&#151;and there
are signs that the fine income is starting to go down. However, the
Treasury will carry on paying&#151;at this rate, for the next four
years&#151;for road safety improvements. Therefore, more of the sort
of road safety improvements that the hon. Member for North Shropshire
(Mr. Paterson) mentioned will be able to take place than
would be the case if we were to

Therein lies the answer to my hon. Friend&#146;s question: even if
infraction proceedings were not started, any lorry owner who did not
want to fit the tape would have legal grounds for objecting to our
forcing them to do so. So the sensible thing to do is to use the
mechanisms that we agreed to a long time ago in an international treaty
for mandating use of this tape. I am prepared to assure the House that

applying, wherever we possibly can, voluntary pressure to establish its
use. I know that there is the notion in the House that this tape will
provide a major road safety benefit almost overnight, but that is not
what the evidence suggests. Vehicles in countries where the tape has
had a dramatic effect, such as America, did not have conspicuity aids
fitted in the first place, so the comparison was being made between the
conspicuity of vehicles fitted with retro-reflective tape and the
conspicuity of vehicles with no conspicuity aids. However, in this
country we have already mandated the use of a whole series of
conspicuity aids on our existing vehicles. Bodies that have researched
this issue, such as Loughborough university, have said that it is far
from proven that the tape will have the great benefit that people are
suggesting.</p><p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="61106-0014.htm_para16"><a name="06110633000702">Nevertheless,
I do accept that we want all vehicles coming into this country, and our

believe that the correct way of achieving this is not to infringe the
international treaties that we have already agreed to, but to use them
and to work as effectively as we can to ensure that this is done to as
short a time scale as possible. Because this is such an important Bill,
and because we are now in the last-chance saloon and run the risk of
losing the entire Bill, I hope that my hon. Friends, at

it is better to accept my assurance that I will do everything that I
can to shorten the time scale for the introduction of this material,

conditions by 95 per cent. According to the European Commission road
safety action programme for 2003 to 2010, one of the main causes of
road accidents is poor visibility. The Minister has already cited the

this measure in eventually? He contradicts himself. US statistics show
that rear-impact and side collisions can be reduced by 41 per cent. The

with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, on which sit 57
countries. I am watching the Minister carefully to see whether he is
still with me. The regulation was made under the aegis

make proposals when its research is complete, and that the Department
for Transport will await the results of the research before taking a
view on whether any such proposal should be supported. As I understand
it, that remains the Government&#146;s position. We are obliged to
allow on to our roads any vehicle that holds an EU type approval
certificate, and since the EU has not adopted regulation 104, there is
no requirement for the holder of a type certificate to fit
retro-reflective marking. The problem seems to arise from UN regulation

obligatory. With regard to the installation of lighting and
light-signalling devices, there is a further complication from
supplement 7 to the 02 series to regulation 48, which actually
introduces retro-reflective markings as a specific device for

and it is something that we want to do. However, we believe that what
they have done is not legal or enforceable and they can try to enforce

any of their hauliers object, the Italians cannot force them to act. We
do not want to be in that position because we want this stuff to be

my question, too: when? The notion of 2010, when we are potentially
taking an action against the Italians for introducing the measure
already, does not really give a great deal of confidence that somebody
else could not try to derail things. The private sector might say,
&#147;Hang on a minute. These people aren&#146;t really serious

this is not the most important measure in the Bill and I am the last

a minor measure, which everybody is in favour of, is potentially
threatening the Bill for the simple reason that we are questioning not
what the Government are doing, but what the EU Commission might do
subsequently. Is the Commission likely to take infraction proceedings?
As the hon. Member for North Shropshire said, it will take a great deal
of time before the matter gets to court. More importantly, if the UK
were to come in behind the Italians, one would hope that that would
drive the measure forward even more quickly rather than our causing the
Italians problems. That is my dilemma. I cannot see any reason why we
should not be four-square behind trying to push this measure forwards
as quickly as possible, rather than timidly saying that it is up to the
EU Commission to get things in place by 2010, which after all is likely
to be only three years after the measure comes into some form of
negotiated stance. I am willing to be led forward in the hope that we
can get this measure put in the appropriate place and get clarity, but
at the moment I am still somewhat
confused.</p><p><a name="st_o316"><a name="06110633000734"><b><a name="61106-0015.htm_spnew9"><a name="06110633002419">Mr.

to the Minister, one would think that it was wholly without precedent
for the United Kingdom to implement a treaty obligation in advance of
the treaty requirement to do so. In fact, as he and probably all
Members of the House will realise, that is not the case. A few years
ago concerns were expressed about the practice of tethering sows in pig
farms. The Conservative Government were eventually persuaded that we
should put our pig industry at a significant disadvantage in the
interests of animal welfare&#151;well in advance of other pig
industries in other parts of the United Kingdom. They were right to do
so. They were certainly supported and pressed to do so by the then
Labour Opposition. Exactly the same principle applies in this case. All
that we want the Government to do in respect of retro-reflective
markings is to enforce something that they are going to do in any
event.</p><p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="61106-0015.htm_para12"><a name="06110633000735">The Minister

That means that between now and 2010 we could prevent 1,155 collisions

either bring infraction proceedings&#151;I do not believe that it

say that they would be a model of alacrity compared with the EU
Commission when it comes to taking infraction proceedings. I cannot for
a second believe that we would see anything that would bring us before
the European Court of Justice this side of 2010. It would be some

The Minister said that he did not want clause 16, or the two Lords

on the existing legal mechanisms. Is he saying that if we agree to
remove clause 16 from the Bill and do not include Lords amendments Nos.

that reflective markings should be affixed to vehicles, he will not
have to come back to the House to seek permission to implement that? If

earlier. I make a commitment to my hon. Friends and others that I will
do everything in my power to bring the date forward&#151;certainly to

are not trying to make things difficult for the Italian Government. We
have stated that we think that what the Italian Government have done is
illegal and unenforceable, but we are not trying to hold them up or to
force anyone to begin infraction proceedings against them. We want the

Government have done because we, like everyone else, want the tape to
be mandated, although we do not think that it will have the dramatic
safety benefits that others have claimed. The Government&#146;s good
will was shown by the fact that we commissioned the Loughborough
research to find out whether we should support the tape. The answer was
that we should, although the tape&#146;s effects could not be
quantified because the easy experiments were those that could be
carried out in circumstances in which there were no conspicuity aids on
vehicles. However, as a consequence of the research, we have tried to
get the measure through the European Commission. It will be in place by

Maria Miller (Basingstoke) (Con):</b> At whatever stage we
discuss this Bill, it is important that we remember the tragic events
that led to the call for fundamental reform of the vetting and barring
procedures in this country. The tragic deaths of two young children in
Soham led to the Bichard inquiry, which made 31 recommendations.
Recommendation 19 resulted in the establishment of a new vetting and
barring procedure in the Bill.</p><p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="61106-0017.htm_para7"><a name="06110636000020">The Bill has been some four
years in the making, yet we are still debating its details at the
eleventh hour. Unlike most of the Lords amendments under debate today,
the amendments are not the result of a disagreement with the other
place. Indeed, two of the three are the result of concerns expressed by
a Select

resolution procedure in the Bill. We have expressed that concern at
every stage of the Bill, both here and in the other
place.</p><p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="61106-0017.htm_para8"><a name="06110636000021">The third Lords
amendment that we are considering today is a legal correction regarding
the use of the word &#147;prescribe&#148;, which now, under
devolution, appears to take on different meanings in England and Wales.
Perhaps this is another example of two countries being divided by a
common language. The Government should certainly have thought about
this before they used the word in the Bill.</p><p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="61106-0017.htm_para9"><a name="06110636000022">The main focus of the Lords
amendments is the use of the negative resolution procedure. Our concern
about the Government&#146;s approach in the Bill was firmly rooted in
the Bichard report, which stressed that any new vetting and barring
scheme should be as transparent and simple as possible. We feel that
the use of vague terms in conjunction with negative resolution
procedures is not consistent with that objective, and that it leaves
too much important detail in the Bill to debate that would not be open
to public scrutiny.</p><p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="61106-0017.htm_para10"><a name="06110636000023">The Government&#146;s
excessive use of the negative resolution procedure has been overtly
criticised by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in
the other place. Two of the Lords amendments that we are considering
today are a direct response to the concerns that that Committee
expressed over the powers that the Government have articulated in the
Bill. The Lords amendments underscore the veracity of the argument,
which my hon. Friends and I have been making over the past eight months
of debate: that more of the detail of the Bill should be agreed through
the affirmative resolution procedure. We therefore welcome Lords
amendment No. 153A on devolved powers and No. 237A on procedure
verification. Both will increase the power of Parliament to scrutinise
the Government&#146;s proposals in those two important areas of the
Bill.</p><br>

Bill represents a step in the right direction and an improvement on the
present situation. I only wish that the Lords amendments provided for
even closer scrutiny of the Government to ensure that they do not use
their extensive powers in the Bill unnecessarily to extend the numbers
of people required to be monitored. Were they to do so, it could easily
unbalance the consensus that has been built up behind the Bill and
undermine the support for, and the credibility of, this important piece
of legislation.</p><p><a name="st_o337"><a name="06110636000025"><b><a name="61106-0017.htm_spnew3"><a name="06110636000076">Annette
Brooke (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD):</b> I echo what the
hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) said about the
long process leading up to the Bill&#146;s introduction, which makes
it all the more remarkable that so much redrafting has been necessary.
So many amendments were tabled late, so it is not surprising that
further changes are required at this even later stage. I am concerned
that, where there has been little time for scrutiny, aspects of the
Bill will have to be revisited because we will run into problems. I and
my party desperately want the Bill to work, but we are concerned about
the complexities and the lack of full scrutiny of what is before us
today.</p><p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="61106-0017.htm_para12"><a name="06110636000026">On
the amendments, we welcome anything that strengthens the parliamentary
process, which has to be a step in the right direction. There has been
a tendency this year for more and more aspects of legislation to be
left to regulation. Personally, I would prefer to see more provisions
built directly into the Bill, but the affirmative resolution is clearly
a step in the right direction.</p><p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="61106-0017.htm_para13"><a name="06110636000027">Amendment No. 250A was, I feel,
the result of an omission in the rush to get the Bill through in this

having said that, I sincerely hope that the Bill will work and
genuinely provide protection for our children and vulnerable

Hodge:</b> I hope that the debate can be brief because the
issues have been debated at length in both Houses over a long period of
time. As I explained when the amendment was tabled in this House, the
original wording was not about companies providing lists of suppliers
or customers or any other people with whom they have or had a contract,
but about reporting significant relationships that are likely to have
an impact on the performance or value of the business. It is up to the
directors to exercise their judgment about what should be incorporated
in the business review. They need include only information to the
extent necessary for the understanding of the development, performance
or position of the
company.</p><p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="61106-0017.htm_para20"><a name="06110636000038">The
amendment does not impose a disproportionate burden on business and the
costs, which are based on costings that the CBI provided to us when the
operating and financial review was being considered, are minimal.
However, in the discussions that have taken place in the past couple of
weeks, I was persuaded by representatives of the pharmaceutical

Jonathan Djanogly (Huntingdon) (Con):</b> The Bill is a more
comprehensive version of the measure that was first presented to the
Lords on 11 January this year. It is in three volumes rather than two
and has 1,264 clauses instead of 885. It has broken many records along
the way. One must be the 1,029 amendments that were pinged back to the
Lords last week. The fact that only a few amendments have been ponged
back to the Commons shows that they were mainly uncontentious. Indeed,
most were needed to consolidate the Bill with company legislation from
1985, 1988 and 2004.</p><p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="61106-0017.htm_para24"><a name="06110636000043">We had called for such

Government&#146;s decision to implement that just before the second
Chamber&#146;s Report stage have been unfortunate for the legislative

a good example of how making law on the hoof is clearly unsatisfactory.
I sincerely hope that the rush will not come back to haunt the

much pleasure, let me deal with amendments Nos. 245A and 245B. I shall
begin by putting the debate in context. The business review was born of
the Government&#146;s cack-handed approach to the operating and
financial review. When the Chancellor scrapped the OFR in November
2005, without consultation with the Department of Trade and Industry or
Ministers, let alone any stakeholders, the Government left companies
with a bill for the OFR preparations running into millions of
pounds.</p><p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="61106-0017.htm_para26"><a name="06110636000045">The business
review was introduced to fulfil the EU directive requirements. After
much bungling by the Government, we reached a position that was broadly
supported by the Government, business and the Conservative party. On
Report, we discussed at length our commitment to encouraging companies
to develop their corporate responsibility and we accept that the
business review, with its requirements for listed companies to report
on environmental and community issues, should play a role in that
process.</p><p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="61106-0017.htm_para27"><a name="06110636000046">However, at

wanted companies to disclose, as the amendment was so vague that it
provided little guidance on business reporting obligations.
Stakeholders were already attempting to calculate the cost to companies
in terms of compliance and related legal advice and guidance. The
Government spin machine had stated that the provision would apply to
suppliers. Clearly, however, it applies much more widely&#151;to
customers and possibly even to bank arrangements or arrangements with
Government.</p><p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="61106-0017.htm_para30"><a name="06110636000049">Following

Government&#146;s actions, business representatives met the
Government to discuss their concerns. We understand that the meeting
did not provide much comfort. The Government stated that, at that
stage, the amendment would not be changed. Due to the concern of
stakeholders and the vagueness of the wording, and in the light of the
Government&#146;s intransigence, our noble Friends tabled an
amendment to the provision, which introduced a caveat allowing
directors to refrain from disclosing information that, in their
opinion, would be seriously prejudicial to the interests of the company
or other persons involved. We were therefore surprised to discover
that, having told everyone that there would be no movement on the
matter, the Government tabled their own amendment narrowing the scope
to allow the omission of information about a person if, in the
directors&#146; view, it would be seriously prejudicial to that
person and contrary to the public interest.</p><p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="61106-0017.htm_para31"><a name="06110636000050">We support the position of our

that the public interest element should be separated by replacing

by Lord Sainsbury on the Government amendment, and on our counter
amendment, was welcome. I repeat, however, that it was all much too
late. There has simply not been enough time to review how the provision
will work in practice. For instance, can the Minister please advise the
House how directors are expected to know what may or may not be in the
public interest? Does the provision to omit information about a company
apply equally to the holding company or subsidiary of the third party
person with whom the company is contracting?</p>

relationships&#148;, not &#147;exhaustive lists&#148;. There
seems to be some belief among non-governmental organisations and

disclose. Under the Bill, it will be left to the company to determine
what a key relationship is. One might have expected the Government to

Government&#146;s amendment. As people in business pointed out, the

however, on broadening the base of auditors, so that it encompasses not
just the big four, but a wider spectrum of firms. For those reasons and

in the first discussion of the freedom of information legislation under
the Companies Bill, we have come out in favour of widening that

especially glad that the Government have given way and accepted the
proposal that the principle of freedom of information should apply to
the Professional Oversight Board of the Financial Reporting Council,
because Lord Sainsbury&#146;s arguments on the subject in the House
of Lords were becoming ever more Sir Humphrey-ish. At one stage, he
said that the main argument against the proposal was that accountants
would become more defensive in the way in which they passed on
information to the board, and so would not act in a frank way. That, of
course, is an argument against having any freedom of information
legislation, and that would be Sir Humphrey&#146;s view of that
entire field of legislation. There was no evidence to support Lord
Sainsbury&#146;s view; all that was really meant was that accountants
would have to be more accurate, and the board would have to be more
accurate in the way in which it came to its
judgments.</p><p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="61106-0018.htm_para28"><a name="0611071000048">It was also

not be ruled out, as it was under the Government&#146;s original
proposal. I am glad to join in the consensus on the very last

firework nuisance.</p><p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="61106-0019.htm_para5"><a name="0611071000062">I
have a truly remarkable constituent, Teresa Kulkarni, who has been an
indefatigable, resolute, determined and passionate campaigner on
firework nuisance for many years. She recently collected 129,397
signatures for a petition that calls for an outright ban on the retail
sale of fireworks, and for fireworks to be restricted to licensed
public displays. On Wednesday afternoon, my hon. Friends the Members
for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) and for Shrewsbury and Atcham
(Daniel Kawczynski) and I accompanied Teresa Kulkarni and
representatives of other organisations to No. 10, where we presented
the petition in two large suitcases&#151;I do not know what security
staff thought we were doing. We had to wait until the Japanese
ambassador left No. 10 before politely knocking on the door.
Unfortunately, the Prime Minister did not come answer himself, as he
was awaiting the arrival of a Head of State, whom he obviously thought
was more important. I understand and sympathise, as our petition
consisted of many bundles of paper. My hon. Friend the Member for
Kettering will testify that it really was a most impressive
performance. We handed that huge petition over to the
perplexed&#151;and good-humoured&#151;staff at No. 10. Tomorrow
night, assuming the Journal Office approves it, I shall present a copy
of the petition that Teresa Kulkarni presented to No. 10 to the House.
However, tonight I am fortunate in having secured this Adjournment
debate, because I am very concerned about firework nuisance. I have
every sympathy with the outstanding determination and tenacity of my
constituent, Teresa Kulkarni. She is concerned about the impact that
firework nuisance is having on hundreds of thousands of people
throughout the land.</p><p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="61106-0019.htm_para6"><a name="0611071000063">We all know that the firework
season is getting ever longer, and we all know that fireworks have a
very damaging impact on people, structures and animals. I want to
discuss those categories. When I describe to Members some of the
examples that have been brought to my attention of the level of
nuisance that occurs, they will realise that there are problems not
only in a few isolated cases, but across the country.</p><p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="61106-0019.htm_para7"><a name="0611071000064">I received an e-mail this
morning from Teresa Kulkarni about last night&#151;5 November. She
said that she had been to a house in King John avenue in King&#146;s
Lynn where there is a large rocket-stick wedged in a hole that it made
in the guttering. The gentleman who owns the house was out at the time,
and the rocket landed in the guttering near to the room where he keeps
his computer. That is a frightening example of what can happen during
the firework season. Let me give another example: at 4.30 yesterday, a
firework rocket landed on the roof of a house in Springwood in my
constituency.</p><p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="61106-0019.htm_para8"><a name="0611071000065">My

bus driver was forced to take evasive action and swerved right across
the junction; he cut across the oncoming part of the highway.
Mercifully, there was no car or pedestrian in the way of the bus, but
if there had been, there undoubtedly would have been a very unpleasant
accident.</p><p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="61106-0019.htm_para9"><a name="0611071000066">I have some

a prop, I would hold up a photograph of an &#147;ER&#148; post box
located on Holbeach bank. It is a traditional cast-iron post box that
would probably originally have had a &#147;GR&#148; sign on it,
before it had an &#147;ER&#148; sign. On Sunday 29
October, a hooligan put a powerful banger into that post box, and it
was absolutely ripped apart. If anyone had been in the vicinity, they
would have been seriously injured, because shrapnel flew across the
road. Indeed, all the mail in the post box was seriously damaged, and
some of it destroyed.</p><p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="61106-0019.htm_para12"><a name="0611071000069">I have looked at other

pets that have put great faith in human beings. Pets are very loyal. I
own a labrador myself, and I have owned horses and cattle in the past.
Indeed, I have owned all sorts of pets, and they have great faith in
human beings. They trust us, and we owe it to them to act in a
completely responsible way toward them. My hon. Friend the Member for

incidents involving animals. It has a huge amount of documentation on
this issue and sent me an excellent briefing entitled, &#147;Keep The
Noise Down: reduce that limit from 120 decibels to 97
decibels&#148;. It does not want to ban the retail sale of fireworks
as my constituent Mrs. Kulkarni does, but it says that there
is an urgent need to reduce the noise of fireworks. It takes the view
that getting the noise level down by about 23 decibels would have a
profound impact, in that it would protect a lot of animals from serious
nuisance and disturbance and, in many cases, injury.</p><p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="61106-0019.htm_para20"><a name="0611071000077">Let us consider some of the

of its panic and tried to dig its way under the front door in its

firework season goes on for far too long. We all know that the
fireworks season starts on 15 October and goes through to 10 November.
That is the period when the sale without licence is permitted. That is
a long season. A lot of people buy fireworks one year and store them
illegally. Often, the season will start way before the clocks go back
and will go on way beyond 10 November, which is the last date
on which one can buy fireworks from a shop that does not have a
licence. We know that the fireworks season goes on and on. In built-up
areas, that can be particularly devastating. Driving in to where we
live in south London from Norfolk last night, it was like a civil war.
The bangs and explosions went on all night.</p><p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="61106-0019.htm_para35"><a name="0611071000093">We know that there is

<notus-date day="6" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>6 Nov 2006 : Column 683</b><br>sure that the Minister will say that there is sufficient legislation on
the statute book. He will probably make the point that a number of
changes have been made. To be fair to the Government, they have brought
in a number of significant initiatives, such as making it much more
difficult for anyone under 18 to buy fireworks, bringing in a curfew on
the use of fireworks between 11 pm and 7 am and imposing a decibel
limit. We had the Fireworks (Safety) (Amendment) Regulations 2004,
which flowed from the Fireworks (Safety) Regulations 1997.</p><p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="61106-0019.htm_para36"><a name="0611071000094">The Government have taken action
and it has to be said that existing legislation is quite tough. For
example, I gather that the Explosives Act 1875&#151;it is not a piece
of legislation with which I am familiar&#151;makes it an offence to
set off fireworks in the street. That is punishable by a fixed penalty
notice attracting an upper tier fine of &#163;80. I guess that there
has probably been an inflation index. If &#163;80 was the upper tier
fine in 1875, that would be equivalent to about &#163;20,000
now.</p><p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="61106-0019.htm_para37"><a name="0611071000095">We also have the
use of general criminal law, health and safety legislation, and
environmental health legislation. Of course, it is illegal to let
fireworks off in the street, to let fireworks off in an enclosed space
if they are going to create a nuisance, and to fire a rocket or
fireworks that are going to end up on a neighbour&#146;s property.
One could argue that the existing law is reasonably tight.</p><p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="61106-0019.htm_para38"><a name="0611071000096">My point is simple. I strongly
believe that the fireworks season goes on far too long. I put a modest
suggestion to the Minister: we should have a shorter fireworks season
that lasts a limited number of days either side of 5 November. During
that period, it would be legal for shops without a licence to sell
fireworks, for people over 18 to buy fireworks and to have a firework
display in a safe place. We would have a specific fixed season. When I
was helping Teresa Kulkarni with her petition, I said to the media that
the season could be 10 days either side of 5 November. Teresa
is against that idea because she wants an outright ban on the retail
sale of fireworks. Perhaps we should have a shorter period. It could
be, shall we say, eight days either side of 5 November.</p><p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="61106-0019.htm_para39"><a name="0611071000097">If we had a specific fireworks
season, everyone would know where they stood. Under existing law, one
would be able to buy fireworks from shops that were not licensed. The
police would be able to enforce the law in a focused way and on a much
more clearly enlightened basis, because they would know what was
happening and could put more resources in. The problem at the moment,
with the long season, is that police resources are stretched. Every
time my local police are rung up with a complaint about a fireworks
nuisance incident or an incident involving an animal being frightened
or injured, or a human being injured, of course they try to
investigate, but there are so many incidents. The police want a much
shorter season because they would then be able to enforce the law more
effectively. Furthermore, the rest of the community would exert peer
pressure by saying, &#147;We have a limited season during which you
can let off fireworks at a private display, but we will have zero

Lindsay Hoyle (Chorley) (Lab):</b> Is the hon. Gentleman aware
that a poll carried out by the BBC in the north-west of England showed

events?</p><p><a name="st_o361"><a name="0611071000099"><b><a name="61106-0019.htm_spnew4"><a name="0611071000193">Mr.
Bellingham:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. Several surveys
have been carried out recently. For example, in the constituency of my
hon. Friend the Member for Kettering, the Kettering <i> Evening
Telegraph </i>organised a similar poll, which showed that the
overwhelming majority of people wanted an outright ban. Many surveys
and polls have indicated growing public support for such a ban. I think
that it has gone up from an average of roughly 55 per cent. 10 years
ago to about the 85-plus mark. That indicates that people are fed up
with this nuisance and the police&#146;s inability to do anything
about it. If the Government do not act to introduce tougher
legislation, the momentum behind an outright ban will become
unstoppable. However, I would not like that to happen because I am not
an arch-regulator. I have always believed in a laissez-faire approach
towards many things in
life.</p><p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="61106-0019.htm_para40"><a name="0611071000100">Let me give an
example of why it would be hypocritical of me to demand an outright
ban. On Friday, my seven-year old boy said that he would like to go to
a firework display. Unfortunately, we could not rearrange our plans for
Saturday so that we could take him to a large display in a village near
where we live, and he was very upset. My wife and I decided that we
would have our own private display in my mother&#146;s garden. The
garden is large and no houses around it would be likely to be in range
of falling rockets.</p><p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="61106-0019.htm_para41"><a name="0611071000101">I
went along to Tesco in Gaywood, which is in my constituency, and I was
impressed by its arrangements. It had a separate firework kiosk manned
by a competent member of staff. After looking at me and deciding that I
was over 18, she told me that the shop had a rule in place whereby
anyone who looked under 21 would be questioned. The shop was thus being
extra cautious about the 18-year-old rule. When I explained that I
wanted to buy some fireworks, the member of staff gave me the menu. I
was able to buy a box of fireworks for &#163;25, although because
there was a buy-one-get-one-free offer, I got about &#163;50-worth of
fireworks. My wife also bought some rockets from Sainsbury&#146;s. My
17-year-old nephew, Joshua Rowley, who was on his half term, was master
of ceremonies at the display. We invited one or two local friends with
children the same age as my seven-year-old, and our small family
firework display brought huge pleasure to those young
children.</p>

is a fireworks season. I leave it to the Minister, who is an expert in
these matters, to make proposals. My idea of a season stretching 10
days either side of 5 November may be too long or too short, but if we
had a specific fireworks season, surely people would know where they
stood, the police would be able to enforce it properly, and everyone
would realise that it was a satisfactory compromise.</p><p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="61106-0020.htm_para2"><a name="0611071000104">Outside the season, a licence
would be needed. If, for example, the local parish or village wanted to
have a fireworks display outside the season, it would apply for a
licence. If King&#146;s Lynn and West Norfolk borough council wanted
to put on a fireworks display during the annual King&#146;s Lynn
festival, it would apply&#151;to itself, as it happens&#151;to get
a licence. If different communities wanted to celebrate community
festivals, such as the Chinese new year or Diwali, with a fireworks
display, they would apply for a licence. If the Minister&#146;s
family decided that they wanted to celebrate a family wedding with a
few fireworks on the village green or in a safe area, they would have
to get a licence to do so outside the season. The application would be
straightforward&#151;not bureaucratic, but simple and easily
understood by
everyone.</p><p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="61106-0020.htm_para3"><a name="0611071000105">I shall

the largest ever petitions in this country on fireworks nuisance. She
has gathered a staggering number of signatures&#151;129,387. She is
saying that we have to have an outright ban, and I respect and
understand her view. I also respect and understand what the Government
have done so far: they picked up Bill Tynan&#146;s Bill and they are
trying to achieve an all-party consensus on the issue. But the nuisance
goes on. People are suffering, animals are suffering, and whole
communities are having their lives turned upside down. Action is
needed. I have suggested a sensible compromise solution to the Minister
and I submit that if the Government do not accept my solution, the
momentum behind an outright ban will become unstoppable and the
pleasure that my young boy experienced on Saturday night at my
mother&#146;s home will be gone for ever. I look to the Minister to
take action very

the issue. It conducted a survey of more than 800 local people, 88 per
cent. of whom supported a ban on the retail sale of fireworks. Many of
the national opinion polls testing political opinion conducted
country-wide by MORI and other polling organisations involve about
1,000 respondents, so to get 800 respondents in the area covered by a

I hate the word &#147;banning&#148;. Nevertheless, as we have
heard, the fireworks season now continues for six weeks&#151;three
weeks before 5 November and three weeks after it. I am sure that, like
me, colleagues will have had people coming to their surgeries during
the previous week complaining about being kept awake at all hours of
the night by firework nuisances, with fireworks sometimes going off
until 3 o&#146;clock or 4 o&#146;clock in the
morning.</p><p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="61106-0020.htm_para16"><a name="0611071000122">Fireworks

fireworks display. In the right place, fireworks are absolutely
fabulous. On the Rosedale estate, however, they are almost weapons of
intimidation. These things are launched at all hours of the day and
night, they are thrown into people&#146;s gardens and they create a
huge amount of nuisance, concern and fear. We also have the spectre of
Halloween and trick or treating, which coincides with 5
November at a similar time in the calendar. Several people think that
it is amusing to toss fireworks at houses and to intimidate people of
all ages, particularly the elderly. I would very much like the
fireworks season to be
shortened.</p><p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="61106-0020.htm_para17"><a name="0611071000123">This is a
huge problem for the police, who should be provided with more powers to
ensure that youngsters who view fireworks and toys as weapons of
intimidation feel the full force of the law. I hope that the Minister
will talk to colleagues at the Home Office about that. These things are
high explosives that kill and maim dozens of people every year; they
need to be treated with respect, and those who do not do so should be
punished by the law.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_32"><a name="61106-0020.htm_ordayhd3"><a name="0611071000174">10.7

Ben Wallace (Lancaster and Wyre) (Con):</b> I am grateful to
my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr.
Bellingham) for introducing this debate. If I am honest, the issue of
fireworks is not one that fills my postbag; indeed, 5 November is not
always remembered with the same fondness in my constituency as in other
parts of the country, because it has a large Catholic area.</p><p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="61106-0020.htm_para18"><a name="0611071000125">There is a gap between those who
use fireworks responsibly and those who use them in the very worst
environments to put fear into people and to cause damage. We need to
look to the Government to provide something other than the current
laissez-faire position. My hon. Friend&#146;s proposition of a season
for fireworks is probably the best way forward. I do not believe in
banning most things, and I get very affronted by that word. As someone
who likes to let fireworks off from time to time and make a good bang,
I believe that it is important that individuals should be allowed to
enjoy them when necessary&#151;for example, at home with small
children. I remember indoor fireworks, which have been banned by the
European Union. We should not blanket ban fireworks&#151;they are an
important part of celebrations and are used by different religions and
communities at different times of the year. While the idea of a season
is correct, we need to ensure that local communities or local
authorities have control of
it.</p><p><a name="st_o367"><a name="0611071000126"><b><a name="61106-0020.htm_spnew5"><a name="0611071000199">Dr.

the volume of

local government Bill. The Government have talked about using that
measure to devolve power, and this might be an appropriate example.
People who live in predominantly Hindu or Catholic communities, for
example, might take a different view, or have different times of year
for celebrations or for placing controls on them. However, it is
important to have those controls over the totally irresponsible youths
who have been mentioned.</p><p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="61106-0020.htm_para20"><a name="0611071000129">Earlier in this Session, we had
an opportunity to bring in legislation that would have made offences
against members of the emergency services more severe. In my
neighbouring constituency of Blackpool, the fire services have just had
an horrendous week in which they have been targeted on purpose by
irresponsible and reckless individuals. I hoped that the Government
would support that legislation&#151;I am afraid that they did
not&#151;because it would have placed more responsibility on
individuals who throw fireworks at police officers or firefighters
responding to calls. It would have meant that those offences would have
carried serious penalties, not just a slap on the wrist. That might
have brought the responsible use of fireworks into people&#146;s
consciousness.</p><p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="61106-0020.htm_para21"><a name="0611071000130">A total
ban would not be right, however, and I would oppose any such proposal.
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk that we
need to introduce the concept of a season, and to ensure that people
understand that there is a time and a place for this type of
celebration. As long as that is the case, we can all live in harmony,
rather than throw the baby out with the bath
water.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="ordayhd_33"><a name="61106-0020.htm_ordayhd4"><a name="0611071000175">10.11

I also offer my commendation to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

129,000 signatures, which is a considerable number. It is not quite as
many as the 4 million signatures presented recently in support of the

considerable number shows the level of support that she has.</p><p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="61106-0020.htm_para22"><a name="0611071000132">Over the past week, millions of
fireworks have been sold and used in back-garden displays, with hundred
of thousands more people attending professionally organised public
displays. Contacts that my officials have had with various police
forces, fire services and trading standards departments indicate that,
so far this year, the bonfire night season has been quiet in relative
terms. However, the enjoyment of those millions is threatened, as so
often is the case, by the thoughtless, selfish and, on occasion,
criminal actions of a minority.

people and animals
alike.</p><p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="61106-0020.htm_para24"><a name="0611071000134">Over the past
six years or so, the use and popularity of fireworks has grown. Part of
that rise can be attributed to a change in the type of fireworks
available to consumers. Large single-ignition multi-shot cakes were
virtually unheard of before the millennium. The popularity of those
fireworks can be attributed to their safety: they need to be lit only
once to provide a display in a box letting off anything from 12 to
200-plus effects. Obviously, this may mean that some garden displays
now have more bangs in them, as overall they contain more
effects.</p><p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="61106-0020.htm_para25"><a name="0611071000135">Fireworks do
not have to focus on noise, however. Increasing numbers of displays now
have a children&#146;s display, and the popularity of lower-noise
fireworks is increasing. I am told that, on Saturday night, Beckenham
Round Table held a hugely popular children&#146;s display, which was
not made up of large bangs and explosions, before the main display.
Such moves are to be encouraged, as they offer a sensible alternative
to traditional fireworks. However, they are not everyone&#146;s cup
of tea because, for many people, much of the enjoyment of fireworks is
the noise that they make.</p><p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="61106-0020.htm_para26"><a name="0611071000136">It is important to state that
much of the concern about noise and nuisance caused by fireworks could
be avoided if we were all a little more neighbourly and responsible.
Simply telling one&#146;s immediate neighbours, particularly older
neighbours, that one is having a back-garden display so that they can
take appropriate action is very easy to do. Similarly, if one is aware
of neighbours who have pets or if one lives near stables or a farm,
simply alerting the owner allows them to take appropriate action. Those
simple steps can drastically reduce the concern and potential harm,
especially to animals, caused by
fireworks.</p><p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="61106-0020.htm_para27"><a name="0611071000137">The hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk referred to the private Member&#146;s
Bill on fireworks proposed by the former Member for Hamilton, South,
which received cross-party and Government support and became the
Fireworks Act 2003. That very important statute has helped us control
and reduce the problems associated with the noise and nuisance caused
by fireworks. The 2003 Act was implemented via the Fireworks
Regulations 2004. Although we monitor the effectiveness of those
regulations, I think that it is still rather early to consider updating
or replacing them, particularly since in 2005, firework manufacturers
and importers as well as retailers were required to comply with a
number of new more onerous requirements on the licensing and storage
arrangements of premises from which explosives, including fireworks,
were stored or
supplied.</p><p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="61106-0020.htm_para28"><a name="0611071000138">The Fireworks
Regulations 2004 introduced a number of new controls that have been
widely welcomed by enforcement practitioners. For example, the
regulations make it an offence for under-18s to possess adult fireworks
in a public place; make it an offence for anyone other than a fireworks
professional to possess category 4 fireworks; and require
all-year-round suppliers to be licensed. The regulations also create a
curfew on firework use between 11 pm and 7 am on most nights
of the year, the exceptions being midnight on November 5 and 1 am on
new year&#146;s eve, the Chinese new year and Diwali night. They

to be extended to other fireworks as part of the pyrotechnics directive
currently being discussed in Brussels.</p><p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="61106-0020.htm_para29"><a name="0611071000139">The regulations also require
suppliers to display a sign indicating that it is illegal to supply
adult fireworks to anyone under the age of 18 and they give local
licensing authorities the power to request details of all transactions
of fireworks over 50 kg of explosive content, including to whom they
were supplied, where they themselves obtained the fireworks and the
exact weight of the transaction. Finally, in this long but important
list, the regulations require importers of fireworks to notify Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs of the intended destination of the
fireworks to be imported to help ensure that fireworks are destined for
legal storage and
distribution.</p><p><a name="st_o370"><a name="0611071000140"><b><a name="61106-0020.htm_spnew7"><a name="0611071000202">Mr.

way. He has gone through the existing legislation, which I have
conceded represents a very big improvement on what went before. Those
measures have considerable positive aspects, but does the Minister
agree that it is worth looking further into my idea of having a
specific firework season? At present, we have provisions relating to
non-licensed premises, so why cannot we go just a bit further and have
a specific season, which would allow everyone to know exactly where
they
stood?</p><p><a name="st_o371"><a name="0611071000141"><b><a name="61106-0020.htm_spnew8"><a name="0611071000203">Jim

hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace) that the
Government supported the private Member&#146;s Bill proposed by the
Father of the House, my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West

2004. They deal with issues such as the banning of certain fireworks

stand here this evening and mention the list of regulations, but none
of that would be any good without clarity in legislation and adequate
enforcement. For many years, enforcement of much of the legislation was
the responsibility of local authority trading standards departments.
Now several agencies are responsible. Offences relating to the
possession of fireworks and the curfew are enforced by the police, who
can issue fixed penalty notices of up to &#163;80. Trading standards
officers still check up on retailers to ensure that supply is to
over-18s only and that only fireworks correctly marked BS7114 are sold.
In many cases, local authorities also check suppliers to ensure that
fireworks are being legally and properly stored. I noted the comments
of the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk about the positive experience
in his local Tesco.</p><p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="61106-0021.htm_para3"><a name="0611071000145">Again, I congratulate the hon.

seriously. The Government believe that the new regulations need time to
show that they can work. The House has agreed that new regulations are
required because there is public disquiet. I assure hon. Members who
have contributed that I take those matters seriously and I am sure that
that applies to the rest of the Government. Those regulations will be
kept under close review. As the hon. Gentleman said, we have
appreciated that there is cause for concern&#151;that is the reason
for the new regulations. We need time to ascertain whether they will
