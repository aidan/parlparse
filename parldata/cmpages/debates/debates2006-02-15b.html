<p><a name="qn_o0">1. <a name="60215-01_wqn0"><b> Jenny Willott  (Cardiff, Central)</b> 
 (LD): What recent discussions he has had with the Secretary of State for Health about the impact on health services in Wales of the process for approving new drugs. [50375]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60215-01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales  (Nick Ainger): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend regularly meets Cabinet colleagues and discusses a range of issues, including health. Health matters are devolved to the National Assembly. The Assembly Government have to be satisfied of the safety and efficacy of new drugs and weigh the optimum use of resources in different prescribing choices.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60215-01_spnew0"><b> Jenny Willott: </b> 
 Given that more than 40,000&nbsp;people in Wales suffer from dementia and that four clinically proven drugs that have successfully treated the symptoms of Alzheimer&#039;s have been available for several years, does the Minister share my concern that National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence withdrew the drugs solely on the ground of cost and thus ignored any consideration of quality of life? Will he get assurances from the Department of Health that NICE will co-operate fully with the Assembly&#039;s review of the drugs approval process?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60215-01_spnew1"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 The advice that NICE gives is not based purely on cost&#151;far from it. It is based on the total efficacy of a drug. In 2001, based on the information that was available at the time, NICE issued guidance saying that Aricept was suitable for prescription and an effective drug. However, further information has been provided over the past four or five years, so NICE has reviewed its advice. That is its job. It must use the best evidence available. There clearly was not a great deal of evidence at the time at which the decision was taken, but there is now more evidence. It is vital that we get the best resources from our investment in the NHS, and NICE must deal with such issues.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Feb 2006 : Column 1404</b>

<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="60215-01_spnew2"><b> Hywel Williams  (Caernarfon)</b> 
 (PC): Will the Minister talk to his colleagues in the Scotland Office and the Scottish Parliament because I understand that the process for approving drugs in Scotland can take as little time as a few weeks, rather than the many months that NICE takes? If he finds, as I suspect that he will, that the Scottish model is superior, will he write to Welsh Members to give them his findings?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60215-01_spnew3"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman may well know, Brian Gibbons, the Minister for Health and Social Services in Wales, is doing such work now. The matter was raised during a recent debate on Herceptin because it appears that the Scottish Medicines Consortium can undertake an analysis of the effectiveness of a drug somewhat more quickly than NICE. Brian Gibbons is holding discussions with his colleagues in the Scottish Executive for the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group to find out whether they can work together to ensure that we get the right decision as quickly as possible.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60215-01_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan  (Chesham and Amersham)</b> 
 (Con): After the brave Assembly protest by Jayne Sullivan over Herceptin, the judgment this morning that a primary care trust was right to deny the drug to a patient, and the Health Secretary&#039;s confusing statement that PCTs should not reject prescribing Herceptin for early-stage breast cancer on the ground of cost, will the Minister agree to press his Labour colleagues in the Department of Health and the Assembly to sort out the confusion over the prescribing of the drug because this vital matter affects all breast cancer patients in England and Wales?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60215-01_spnew5"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 The judgment has supported the advice of the Secretary of State that every case should be judged on its merits. That is the current position and I am sure that the Department of Health will reinforce it. Doctors can choose to prescribe unlicensed drugs, such as Herceptin, if, after considering a patient&#039;s medical history, they feel that their clinical needs can be best met by using it. The Secretary of State for Health has made it clear that PCTs in England&#151;I am sure that Brian Gibbons in Wales agrees with this&#151;cannot refuse to pay for a drug on the ground of its cost. Each case must be judged on its merits, with a consideration of strong clinical evidence. The drug still has not been licensed for treating early-stage breast cancer and the drug company has not even made an application to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. I hope that Roche will make that application as soon as possible so that the processes can be gone through as quickly as possible.

 I thank the Secretary of State for repeating that mantra.

<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60215-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I am arguing for Government policy in the best interests of the people of Wales. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) does not seem to be interested in the security of the citizens of north Wales and the rest of Wales. It is not a matter of political mantra. He is defying the recommendation of Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate of constabulary that police forces need to be reorganised and that there should be an all-Wales force to tackle essential problems such as global terrorism and serious and organised crime. We simply do not have the capabilities&#151;

 The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. We do not have the capabilities in north Wales or the rest of Wales to deal with those new problems. The modern criminal uses sophisticated procedures and techniques, and without a Wales police force that has the capabilities to tackle that we will be neglecting the security not only of his constituents, but of all the people in Wales. That is not only my view; it is the view of the police. He should recognise that he is arguing against the police view and not just the Labour Government&#039;s view.

 (Lab): The HMIC report stresses the importance of security, in particular port security, yet in terms of the port of Holyhead in my constituency and of Mostyn, the recent settlement refers to cutting back on port security to the tune of &#163;150,000, which the chief constable and the police authority say will have to come out of local community policing. Will my right hon. Friend meet the Home Secretary to ensure that port security is given priority now and in any future merger?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60215-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I share my hon. Friend&#039;s concern. I met the Home Secretary yesterday to discuss precisely that matter, and today I asked the chief constable of North Wales for his assessment. The example my hon. Friend gives reinforces the case for precisely the reorganisation for which we are arguing. To compensate, there is to be a reduction in resources for neighbourhood policing, whereas if North Wales, through an all-Wales police authority, had the capabilities to deal with the new threats&#151;in this case, drug trafficking through the port of Holyhead&#151;it would not have to take away resources from the neighbourhood level. That is precisely what the reorganisation is all about.

<br>&nbsp;<br>explain whether abolishing the four police forces will mean that south Wales is made to pay more, or that north Wales has a less-well-funded police service? It is self-evident that the levelling process demands the one or the other.

<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60215-01_spnew14"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 Nonsense.

<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60215-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman says that that is nonsense, but every chief constable recognises that something has to be done. The former Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Ronnie Flanagan, says that the present arrangements in Wales are not sufficient to deal with security threats to the people of Wales. We have Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and, I think, the Conservatives, too, opposing the security interests of the people of Wales&#151;what a terrible position to be in.

 Answer.

<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60215-01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I am about to provide an answer to my hon. Friend&#151;one that comes from the lips of his own chief constable. The chief constable of Gwent said:
</p>
<ul>

<a name="60215-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">Despite my hon. Friend&#039;s rhetoric, unless we undertake reorganisation, our police officers in Gwent, north Wales and across Wales will not have the capabilities that the inspector of constabulary, who is not a politician, says that we need to deal with modern forms of threat to our security, including terrorism. If my hon. Friend wishes to ignore that, that is his decision, but I will not do so. As Secretary of State for Wales, I provide the leadership that the Government need to provide to improve security for our citizens.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Feb 2006 : Column 1407</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the question when asked of how much the police mergers will cost taxpayers in Wales. Edwina Hart, the Social Justice Minister in the Assembly, said that in south Wales there will be increase in the precept of 17&nbsp;per cent. and that council tax bills will increase by 3.5&nbsp;per cent. Why does she have the figures on a non-devolved matter, but the Secretary of State does not?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60215-01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I do not agree with those figures, whoever supplies them. The hon. Lady has not taken account of the fact that up to &#163;50&nbsp;million will be made available by the Home Secretary for police reorganisation in the coming year, and &#163;75&nbsp;million the following year. Indeed, the police forces of Wales have, in their own assessment, said that over the years savings will be made as a result of reorganisation.
</p>

<a name="stpa_o2">It is time that the Conservatives ended their opportunism on the future security of Wales.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on her interest in the issue and I read carefully the Adjournment debate that she secured on 2&nbsp;February. I can assure her that the community legal service, which gives advice to about 11,000&nbsp;people in Wales, will continue to play a vital role. The proposals to change the funding of the specialist service would not cut legal aid, but would refocus &#163;2.9&nbsp;million on front-line services in England and Wales.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="60215-02_spnew3"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 To answer the hon. Gentleman directly, the Legal Services Commission has met practitioners and the specialist advice service that previously received funding and which can bid directly for the new money for the front-line services. We will ensure that there is a first-stop shop so that individuals with welfare benefit problems can receive specialist advice on their initial approach, rather than later in the process. That is the thinking behind the proposals, and we have moved that &#163;2.9&nbsp;million from the specialist services to the front-line so that individuals can access such advice when they make their initial approach.

 I know that my hon. Friend made those points during the Adjournment debate of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan).

 The hon. Gentleman has made an interesting point. I will get a detailed response from the Assembly on the guidance to livestock markets.

 I thank the Minister for that response, of sorts. The Royal Shrewsbury hospital has had quite a few chief executives over the years, but they all say that the hospital loses between &#163;2&nbsp;million and &#163;3&nbsp;million every year in subsidies to patients from across the border in Wales&#151;the Welsh Assembly pays less per patient than English authorities. What is he going to do about it?

<p><a name="st_o46"><a name="60215-03_spnew1"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 I assure the hon. Gentleman that an agreement is in place between Powys local health board, which provides patients to the Royal Shrewsbury hospital, and the hospital, where the chief executive has told us that there is not a problem. This is the second time that the hon. Gentleman has complained that patients from Wales cost his trust a lot of money. On 16&nbsp;December, however, he wrote to the Assembly seeking an assurance that more patients will come to the hospital in order to protect services in Shrewsbury. I am pleased that he recognises the benefits that Welsh patients provide to the Royal Shrewsbury hospital.

 Well, that is news to me&#151;I am staggered by that claim. As I have said, Welsh patients are supporting services in English hospitals. The hon.

 No, I do not agree that there was a reluctance on the part of the services to act.

 Would not it be better to have a watertight law designed to catch the guilty rather than a press-release law designed to catch the headlines? The Home Secretary said on the radio this morning that he wanted to deal with those who exalt terrorism to try to get young men to behave in an unacceptable way. The Lords amendment, which we support, would create an offence of
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_o3">&quot;describing terrorism in such a way that the listener would infer that he should emulate it.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="st_o60"><a name="60215-03_spmin6"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Let me go straight to the substance of the issue and explain why I disagree profoundly with the right hon. Gentleman. First, if we remove &quot;glorification&quot;, we send out a massive counterproductive signal. It is a word that members of the public readily know and understand and that juries would understand. It is in the United Nations resolution, and removing it would send completely the wrong signal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-03_para5">
<a name="stpa_o11">However, there is another point, on which the right hon. Gentleman touched. Let me explain why I disagree so strongly with the position of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. He mentioned the terms of the amendment that he will support, which is about &quot;the listener&quot;. It does not cover written statements or images. In other words, it may deal with a sermon but not a placard. It would be incredible at this moment, after what has happened in the past few weeks, if we were to dilute the proposed law in that way.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_o4">&quot;Tony Blair is always telling us to be strong on the war on terror, but there&#039;s no point being tough the world over if we can&#039;t arrest people in our own backyard.&quot;</p>

 What kind of message does it send when someone such as Abu Hamza is at liberty to encourage murder and racial hatred for years on end, as happened under the Government? What sort of message does it convey when the Prime Minister wants to send signals, but people were on the streets two weeks ago inciting violence and murder, and no one has yet been arrested? The Government have let Abu Hamza preach hatred for seven years but have arrested people who heckle the Foreign Secretary at the Labour party conference. There are old powers that the Prime Minister will not use and new powers that we have seen abused.

<a name="60215-03_para8">
<a name="stpa_o14">It is the opinion of all decent lawyers&#151;the Prime Minister should ask one; he probably has one at home&#151;that the Lords amendment that we support covers more than written statements.

 As the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows perfectly well, the reason why there is a debate over intercept evidence is the view of the security services&#151;not held throughout our law enforcement services&#151;that allowing intercept evidence would damage our ability to prosecute terrorists or those involved in organised crime.

 I know it is a long time since I have asked the Prime Minister questions, but it seems even longer since we had an answer. Can he not now experience a deathbed conversion to democracy, as the Chancellor asked me to call it, and ensure that the people are listened to, that if they wish to retain their existing local government structures, they are allowed to do so, and that they are given an opportunity to end the drift to regional government that is unelected, unaccountable and utterly unwanted?

 There is no need for a conversion to democracy in my case. I remember that the right hon. Gentleman and I stood in a democratic election in 2001, and I also remember the result.

 I entirely understand my hon. Friend&#039;s point, and her reason for raising it. We have provided substantial funds&#151;about &#163;1.4&nbsp;billion a year in England over the past few years&#151;and will provide further sums over the next few years, but I agree with my hon. Friend that buses are often the backbone of the public transport system. They are essential to tackling congestion, meeting environmental targets and indeed reducing social exclusion. I entirely understand why it is important for us to achieve the right balance between regulation and giving bus services the freedom that they need to operate effectively.

<p><a name="st_o85"><a name="60215-04_spmin7"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Despite my connection with Shrewsbury, of which I know the hon. Gentleman is aware, I believe that it is important for all hospitals to live within their budgetary limits. He will know that health care services in Shrewsbury and elsewhere have received a massive budget increase for the years to come. They will receive further such rises, but, in the end, they must live within their means. As we are making very generous provision for hospitals, I do not think it unreasonable of us to say that there must be proper financial accountability.

 (Lab): The shooting of a police officer in Nottingham is further evidence that the culture of the gun in our society is still in the ascendant. Can the Prime Minister promise the House and the country that he will galvanise everyone, from the police to the courts, into conveying the message that those who own, carry and use guns will be detected and dealt with, and that penalties will accord with what the public believe to be the gravity of the crimes?

 I totally accept the point that my hon. Friend makes and I know that he has campaigned long and hard on this issue over the years. We will all want to give our very best wishes to Miss Bown who was so wrongly and tragically shot in Nottingham yesterday, and to all her family. Let me also say, however, that since we introduced the law establishing a mandatory five-year sentence for the possession of firearms, I think that there has been an impact, but we need to do far more, particularly in relation to organised crime. Over the next few months, we will publish proposals on organised crime that will coincide with the introduction of the new Serious Organised Crime Agency. We need to introduce tougher laws, in the way that we have with antisocial behaviour legislation and, indeed, with terrorist legislation, that make it harder for these people to operate. Much gun crime is associated with drugs, illegal people trafficking and organised crime.

<p><a name="st_o87"><a name="60215-04_spmin9"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Great question. Let me explain to the hon. Gentleman that, of course, one reason why house prices have gone up is that we have had an immensely strong economy. One fortunate aspect of

<br>&nbsp;<br>that is that the running of it has had nothing to do with the Liberal Democrats. Secondly, in London and elsewhere we have put a lot of money into trying to support first-time home buyers, and we are about to do a lot more. Over the next few years, we are going to help a lot of young people, particularly through shared equity schemes, to own a home for the first time. The hon.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o89"><a name="60215-04_spmin10"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I am happy to consider what my hon. Friend has said, and there is no doubt that the Bevin boys played a huge part in defeating Nazi tyranny during the second world war.

 I am happy to look into the hon.

Whatever amount of money we put in, there is always going to be a limit to it; decisions, however, have to be taken locally. I do not know enough about the individual circumstances of the hon.

 (Lab): Yesterday, people throughout the country celebrated Valentine&#039;s day, but for many, that day had a peculiar poignancy, given the launch in Wales and other parts of the UK of the campaign against domestic violence. During nine months of last year, more than 12,750&nbsp;domestic violence cases were reported to the South Wales police alone, and they estimate that only 35&nbsp;per cent. of such cases are actually reported. What more can we as a Government do to tackle domestic violence, and will my right hon. Friend support the role being played by my hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>I shall be happy to look into it. However, he is right about domestic violence. To date, we have invested somewhere in the region of &#163;70&nbsp;million, and we will invest even more. We are also providing support for refuges, but I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that it is very important that victims of domestic violence come forward and report it in ever larger numbers. I am pleased to say that the police service is handling such complaints a lot more sensitively. The incidence of domestic violence has not risen, but one reason for the increase in recorded violent crime statistics is that people are coming forward and reporting it to the police, who are recording it. That is beneficial. I assure my hon. Friend that we will continue to support the Corporate Alliance Against Domestic Violence, which was launched about a year ago. It is a very important signal that this Government and our country take domestic violence seriously.

 It is also true, of course, that all the waiting times and waiting list targets have been met, but I agree that there are real problems in the health care organisation in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency, where there is a very large deficit. However, it is important to recognise that we have to make sure that the vast additional investment that has gone in is subject to proper systems of financial accountability. We will work with the people organising health care in his constituency, but we cannot say, &quot;Whatever your deficit, the Government will come and bail it out.&quot; The hon. Gentleman knows that health care in his area has received huge real-terms increases under this Government, far greater than anything put in by the previous Conservative Government, but the money has to be accounted for. If services in an area are not run properly and there is therefore a deficit, I am afraid that we have to tackle that problem. I do not think that it is responsible to suggest otherwise.

<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60215-05_spnew0"><b> Mr. Andrew Lansley  (South Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Have you received any request from the Secretary of State for Health to make a statement to the House about the availability of Herceptin on the NHS? Many women across the country will have believed from previous statements from the Secretary of State that the drug would be available on the NHS, but today&#039;s court judgment makes it clear that the law and the Department of Health&#039;s policy is that its availability should be subject to a postcode lottery.
</p>





<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60215-05_spnew1"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman applied for an urgent question on this matter. I refused, and I gave no reason. I do not expect the argument to be pursued through a point of order. However, I remind him that there is health debate tomorrow, and he will be quite entitled to raise this very serious matter then.
</p>





<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60215-05_spnew2"><b> Mr. Simon Burns  (West Chelmsford) (Con):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I seek your advice and specific help. What can be done to stop the growing contempt that Government Departments display to hon. Members, with information that should be supplied to us in the form of written answers being given to journalists first? On 31&nbsp;January, I submitted a priority, named-day written question about a constituency private finance initiative scheme. I received a holding answer. Yesterday, 11&nbsp;working days later, I rang up the relevant Minister&#039;s office. The staff there were very helpful and provided me with my answer in the evening. You can imagine my amazement that it took so long to receive that reply, notwithstanding what it says in &quot;Erskine May&quot;, and when I discovered that on Monday&#151;the day before I received my answer&#151;a journalist from the local <i>Essex Chronicle</i> had telephoned the Department of Health&#039;s press department, and asked exactly the same question. The answer was e-mailed to him on Monday afternoon, but I did not get a reply from the Minister to the same question until Tuesday. [Hon. Members: &quot;Oh.&quot;] I think that that is a gross abuse. What can you do, as the defender of Back Benchers&#039; rights, to stop such abuses?

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60215-05_spnew3"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising this matter. I am very angry that information should have been given to a journalist before it was given to an hon. Member. The journalists in the House of Commons Press Gallery are looked after very well.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to establish a Renewable Energy Authority; to lay upon the Authority a duty to promote the use of renewable energy and energy conservation; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-05_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The Bill is intended as a contribution to the energy review and to climate change policy. It is only a ten-minute Bill so it cannot carry the full story on its face, but it relates to a series of measures that, if enacted, would deliver the aspirations of the 2003&nbsp;energy White Paper and more, and render the building of a new fleet of nuclear reactors superfluous.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-05_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">It is posited that by 2020&nbsp;there will be a serious &quot;generation gap&quot; caused by a combination of generating plant closures, failure to achieve sufficient energy savings through increased energy efficiency, failure to reduce the demand for electricity and an insufficient deployment of renewable energy to fill the gap. There is a powerful lobby that draws the conclusion that the logical response is to build new nuclear stations to fill the generating gap and add to reductions in carbon emissions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-05_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The Bill challenges those assumptions&#151;first, that energy savings will not deliver enough and, secondly, that renewables cannot fill the gap. Both of those statements would probably be true if we continued with business as usual, but if we took firm action the outcome for both energy demand reduction and deployment of renewables could be dramatically different. Thus the theme of the Bill is that energy savings of 40&nbsp;per cent. by 2020&nbsp;are achievable, and renewable deployment of more than 20&nbsp;per cent. by 2020&nbsp;is achievable, given the right policy framework.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The centrepiece of the Bill is the creation of a new body, the renewable energy authority, with the remit of co-ordinating and driving all aspects of policy relating to the research and development and especially the deployment of renewable energy and amelioration of climate change. It would assume many of the current functions of the Department of Trade and Industry and those of some other bodies. It would drive the renewables option as effectively as the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority drove nuclear power in Britain after the war. It would be dedicated to overcoming all the many obstacles that at present impede the progress of renewables.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-05_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">The REA would undertake resource surveys of the uniquely rich marine energy resource around the UK coast, identifying prospective sites for generators and conducting environmental impact assessments. The REA would be empowered to license the sites to appropriate developers for the installation of generation equipment. The REA would have a co-ordinating role in ensuring the availability of appropriate grid access to those sites.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-05_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">The REA would be accountable to Parliament through a Secretary of State for Energy&#151;I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy appreciates that I have promoted him, and I am glad to see him in his place&#151;and it would be funded from carbon tax revenue as set out in the proposed fiscal measures that I will come to.

<p>
<a name="60215-05_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">The planning and consenting regime both on and offshore needs reform and changes to the Town and Country Planning and Electricity Acts would flow from this Bill and would need to be reflected in the coming marine Bill. I propose that the REA should consider all applications for renewable generation, of an appropriate minimum capacity of, say, 50&nbsp;MW and grid alterations exceeding 120&nbsp;kV, and if judged to be suitable those would be &quot;qualifying applications&quot; for a streamlined and simplified planning and consenting procedure operating to a strict time scale.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-05_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">The time from notification of outline planning to a decision would be nine months and the Secretary of State would make the decision if the relevant authority failed to deliver it in that time. In some cases, the Secretary of State would be the relevant authority, but the same time frame would apply.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-05_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">Another large obstacle for renewables is the current configuration of the transmission grid and the protracted time involved in any major alterations. In addition to the planning aspects of grid restructuring, there would be duties on grid operators such that on receiving consent for installations for a generating plant the grid system operator nearest to the generator would be required to undertake a grid connection and any necessary reinforcement work to a time scale agreed with the generator, but not normally longer than a year. The grid system operator should provide priority access to the grid for renewable plant connected to it whenever it is generating, and should be under an obligation to buy the output of such plant. Those provisions reflect the German renewable energy Act. Grid system operators would be able to recoup their contractually agreed costs for providing grid access through transmission charges, agreed by Ofgem in consultation with the REA and the Secretary of State.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-05_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">There are considerable market constraints, even for proven renewables such as offshore wind, and especially for the nascent marine technologies of wave and tidal stream power, as they have not yet had the time in development or the large-scale deployment to achieve the benefits from economies of scale to get their generating costs down to commercially competitive levels. They thus need more support in the market than the current ROC&#151;renewable obligations certificate&#151;regime can provide. Even the relatively mature offshore wind process needs the help of capital grants. The REA would be expected to oversee support arrangements to give investors confidence, and the revenue needed for that support would come from a carbon tax, which I shall describe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-05_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">I also propose a raft of measures to improve energy efficiency, which include a requirement for houses in multiple occupation to meet a minimum energy rating&#151;the standard assessment procedure rating&#151;to qualify for registration, and the prohibition of the sale and use

That probably sounds like a trifling and killjoy measure, but patio heaters account for 1&nbsp;million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year&#151;as much as is saved through the changes in vehicle taxation. Their use of energy is entirely profligate and is simply directly to heat the atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-05_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">We need to enact the European Union directive on the energy performance of buildings. The only measures on energy conservation that Parliament has enacted have been through private Members&#039; legislation or the application of EU directives. We have failed to address the matter properly in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-05_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">To fund the REA and provide market support arrangements without recourse to the Treasury, several fiscal measures are proposed for consideration, the central of which is a carbon tax. It has the support of the Royal Society, the House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology and the House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs. Coupling the carrot of carbon tax credits with the stick of a carbon tax will provide a method of incentivising the market for newer renewables. It would operate by charging carbon dioxide emitting generators on their output and using the revenue not only to fund the REA but also to provide carbon tax credits for newer renewable generating technologies, to help to give them market pull. Increasing the cost of carbon will also be an incentive for investment in carbon capture and storage. We could also take further measures to encourage the use of biofuels.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-05_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">The UK has missed an enormous opportunity by not exploiting combined heat and power. The comparison between the thermal efficiency of Scandinavian countries and subsequent lower carbon dioxide emissions and the position in the UK is staggering. I advocate the establishment of a CHP obligation alongside the renewables obligation and the newly imposed transport fuels obligation.

<a name="stpa_24">With the agreement of all parties in the House, a new Bill was introduced in the autumn. Of course, there were difficult issues of freedom and security&#151;we were able to agree with a lot that the Opposition said, but not all. Following that process, the House reached an agreement on the Bill, and that included a commitment to a review of the definitions of terrorism to be conducted by Lord Carlile and to reviews of the operation of the 2005&nbsp;Act regime as well as a commitment to return to legislation, which will be introduced in the next Session, as I announced in a statement to the House a couple of weeks ago, and which was generally welcomed. I believe that that was a solid and stable basis on which to proceed, not only recognising the genuine differences of opinion but seeking to find a good way to make progress.

 The Home Secretary understandably referred to the United Nations resolution, but will he explain a tautology in the reference that he cited? He quoted the phrase &quot;justification or glorification&quot;, but that is the only part of the resolution that has in brackets behind it a further explanation: &quot;apologie&quot;.

<p><a name="st_24"><a name="60215-07_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s point. The word &quot;apologie&quot; is French. As he knows, international agreements are produced in English and French, for obvious reasons.

 Why is the Home Secretary placing such emphasis on the manifesto commitment?

<p><a name="st_32"><a name="60215-07_spnew10"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am surprised that a Member of such long-standing and constitutional weight does not acknowledge the importance of manifesto commitments when considering Lords amendments. We were not considering such amendments yesterday and the decisions taken on a free vote went beyond manifesto commitments. I mention the manifesto commitment because there is a difference of opinion between the elected and unelected Chambers. Conventionally, and for good reasons that are accepted on both sides of the House, a manifesto commitment is an important consideration when hon. Members debate Lords amendments.

The Home Secretary cited the words &quot;glorification&quot; and &quot;justification&quot; in the UN resolution, so why do the definitions in clause 20&nbsp;include no reference to justification?

 I apologise to the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) if I misunderstood the Committee report to which he was referring. Let me put the position on record. The Joint Committee on Human Rights expressed doubts due to the lack of clear intent requirements in clauses 1&nbsp;and 2.

A number of alternative definitions are used, and this House debated them on Report. I stand ready&#151;it is why I have suggested that we consider new legislation based on Alex Carlile&#039;s report&#151;to look at the new language that emerges from the UN and elsewhere as a result of the process that is to take place this year, but I regard it as significant that the Security Council included &quot;glorification&quot; in its resolution.

 I recognise that there are concerns&#151;the issue is sensitive and I share the reservations that have been expressed to some extent. However, since we last debated the Bill we have seen the most blatant glorification of acts of terrorism&#151;the events of 7&nbsp;July. The House discussed that only last week. In other circumstances where there is less publicity, might there not be individuals and small groups who continue to glorify the horrors and atrocities of 7&nbsp;July, and might not the law that my right hon.

 May I take my right hon. Friend back to what our hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan) said, and my right hon.

<a name="60215-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_31">The reason we made a manifesto commitment and why we think glorification should be dealt with as I propose is that people who glorify terrorism help to create a climate in which terrorism is regarded as somehow acceptable. They help to persuade impressionable members of their audiences that they have a moral duty to kill innocent people in pursuit of whatever political or religious ideology they espouse. In recent times, we have seen threats from extremists who claim to represent Islam. As I said in answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), leaders of the Muslim community in the UK and elsewhere have, quite properly, explained that such views do not represent true Islam. None the less, all too many people may be influenced by those who glorify terrorism and conclude that they have a duty to kill and injure innocent bystanders in the misguided belief that they are bound to do so by their faith. Our duty to those we represent is to do everything we can to prevent that from happening.

<a name="60215-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_32">Both Houses have agreed that there will be an offence of encouraging terrorism and that the offence will cover both direct and indirect encouragement. I am, however, concerned by the changes made to clause 1&nbsp;and replicated in clause 21&nbsp;by the Members of the other place. The Lords removed a provision which clarified that statements that constituted indirect encouragement included statements that glorified acts of terrorism and were statements from which those members of the audience who heard them could reasonably be expected to infer that what was being glorified was being glorified as conduct that should be emulated by them in existing circumstances. That was a clear provision in the Bill considered by the Lords. Taken with a definition of &quot;glorification&quot; in clause 20, it made what was being described perfectly clear. Moreover, it made it abundantly clear to everyone who had heard about the offence that glorifying terrorism in such a way that others might emulate it would no longer be tolerated.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Feb 2006 : Column 1434</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_33">Instead of that clear provision, which sent a strong message to all those who are involved in recruiting terrorists, the Lords inserted an alternative provision stating that

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;&#039;indirect encouragement&#039; comprises the making of a statement describing terrorism in such a way that the listener would infer that he should emulate it.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_35">That alternative is unacceptable for three main reasons. I will explain those reasons in a moment, but perhaps I should first remind the House that glorification features in the Bill as an example of what is encompassed by the concept of indirect encouragement. It is not self-contained. Glorification as an offence is a subset of indirect encouragement as an offence and can be committed only if the conditions surrounding the main offence are met, as I just said to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden). Key among those conditions is the requirement that there must be an intention that others should be induced to commit terrorist offences or subjective recklessness on that point. Glorification without intention of emulation or without subjective recklessness cannot constitute an offence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_36">As I said, the Opposition&#039;s preferred form of words is unacceptable for three reasons. First, instead of being an exemplary description of what indirect encouragement could be, it is an exhaustive description. In other words, the offence is limited so that it is committed by making available to the public a statement directly encouraging terrorism, or a statement indirectly encouraging it, but only by actually describing it in such a way that the listener will infer that he should emulate it. The Government drafted the offence carefully so that it would cover all statements that were either an encouragement to terrorism or another form of inducement to terrorism. As we designed the offence, it covered statements that constituted direct and indirect encouragement and that made explicit references to terrorism, as well as those that encouraged terrorism but did not refer explicitly to it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_37">Let me put the argument as simply as I can. The use of the word &quot;describing&quot; in the Lords amendment means that the provision would not catch, as the original wording would, glorification, praise or celebration of an act of terrorism that does not actually describe the act. Similarly, the reference in the wording inserted by the other place to &quot;listener&quot; also limits the scope of the provision. It confines the definition to statements that are capable of being heard and so, for example, would exclude statements written on placards or published on websites.

<p>
<a name="60215-08_para7">
<a name="stpa_38">The deficiency becomes particularly obvious in connection with clause 2, which deals with the dissemination of terrorist publications. Those who drafted the Lords amendments perhaps did not intend them to have that narrowing effect, but they unquestionably do have precisely that effect. I regard that as a serious problem because I do not believe that any form of indirect encouragement or other inducement to terrorism should be acceptable. It is also 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Feb 2006 : Column 1435</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a problem because the Council of Europe offence on which ours is modelled was clear on precisely that point. The offence was intended to capture &quot;public provocation&quot;, as well as other forms of encouragement or inducement to terrorism. The European convention on the prevention of terrorism includes provocation, so we should include provocation, too. Like glorifying terrorism, it is possible to provoke it without describing or referring to it.

If that is the extent of the Home Secretary&#039;s anxiety and the Prime Minister&#039;s, I am sure that they will agree that it is readily curable. If the Home Secretary gives the House an assurance that he would be happy with their lordships&#039; formula if &quot;listener&quot; were replaced by some other word that emphasises that the statement can be heard or read, we shall be able to bring these proceedings to a close very quickly.

 I have often participated in Committee, where it is possible to hold lengthy debate on minute areas of textual drafting. I am always prepared to acknowledge that text can be improved or changed. Sometimes that does not make any difference, but sometimes it does, and the difference can provide reassurance. That is why I told the Home Secretary that if that is an obstacle for the Government&#151;it appeared to cause the Prime Minister enormous anxiety at Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time&#151;it is readily curable. If he would like to provide the House with an assurance that the Government would accept the Bill with a cure for that one word, I am sure that we can resolve the debate very quickly.

<a name="stpa_39">I have given the first of three reasons why the Lords amendments should be rejected. Secondly, it is perfectly clear that people who seek to recruit terrorists do so not just by directly encouraging terrorism or by provoking people to commit violent acts but by glorifying terrorism and terrorists. They may emphasise that terrorists are heroes whose actions should be copied; that terrorists go straight to paradise when they die; that terrorists undertake glorious acts that deserve to be emulated; or that terrorists are simply better humans than those of us who are not terrorists. The single word that best captures that is &quot;glorification&quot;. It is the word that, we all recognise, covers such forms of indirect encouragement. It does not, as I have explained, cover all forms of indirect encouragement, but it does cover those forms. It is that clarity of meaning that makes the word &quot;glorification&quot; so important. Not only do our electorate know what it means, and not only was it defined with total clarity for the courts, but those who seek to recruit terrorists know what it means. If the legislation outlaws the glorification of terrorism, preachers and proselytisers for terrorism and the organisations with which they work will know that if they glorify terrorism they may fall within the parameters of the offence. If it is not included, they know that they can glorify with impunity. The 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

None the less, the Home Secretary must surely admit that the Government&#039;s proposals are vague and uncertain, and have been condemned by the Joint Committee on Human Rights.

<a name="60215-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_40">Thirdly, on the Lords amendment, I make a technical point about the drafting of the legislation. As it passed through this House, the offence in clause 1&nbsp;included a provision that referred to &quot;glorification&quot; explicitly. The only conclusion to be drawn from the removal of the word is that it will be presumed that the offence was not intended to cover glorification. This view could well be taken by the courts, it would probably be taken by our constituents and, more seriously, it could well be taken by the recruiters of terrorists. This would undermine both the legal effectiveness of the offence and its effectiveness as a deterrent, in a climate where we need to understand that individuals and organisations that promote and glorify terrorism are looking at our decisions and deciding how best to conduct themselves.

<a name="60215-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_41">Taken together, the three major reasons that I have outlined mean that we must not agree to the Lords amendments, but should insert the alternative amendments that I propose in lieu of them. We should, particularly in view of the flaws in the Lords amendments that have been acknowledged from the Opposition Benches, even now proceed on the basis of consensus. Indeed, in the spirit of consensus, we have agreed that the offence should be committed only if the requisite mens rea tests are satisfied. Those mental tests are intent and subjective recklessness&#151;that is, the offence will be committed only if someone encourages terrorism, whether directly or indirectly, including through the glorification of terrorism, intending to encourage it or knowingly taking an unreasonable risk that they will encourage it. In this context, I cannot see why there should be objection to the inclusion of a provision relating to the glorification of terrorism. I hope the House will agree to reject the Lords amendments and accept those that I proposed.

<a name="stpa_42">The Home Secretary comes to the House to make a case for the restoration of the concept of glorification.

<a name="stpa_43">What happened, although the Home Secretary seems to be unwilling to admit it in the House this afternoon, is that that idea came in for a massive amount of criticism, to the point where it was entirely rubbished and ridiculed. It was an unworkable proposal. It envisaged putting up a list which, in a convoluted way, meant that there was a 20-year cut-off period for criticisms, to try and get round the problems that it might pose in respect of the African National Congress. It was a dog&#039;s breakfast of a proposal and the Government and the Home Secretary wisely abandoned it.

<a name="stpa_44">Having abandoned the proposal, the next problem was to cope with the occupant of No. 10&nbsp;Downing street, who once he has come out with one of his populist pronouncements, which he thinks has some resonance with the press, decides that the word still has to feature. That seems to be the only reason why glorification was put into clause 1. I say to the Home Secretary that it could be removed in its entirety and the Bill, with the concept of indirect encouragement, would still be perfectly workable. In some cases, glorification might be an example of indirect encouragement, but in other cases it might not. There is no rhyme or reason why it should be there.

 In his political knockabout, does the hon. Gentleman accept that the word &quot;glorification&quot; was used in the Labour party manifesto at the general election in May? The suggestion that it was used only after the events of 7&nbsp;July by the Prime Minister in his statement in August is completely wrong. It was clearly set out in the election manifesto before the 7/7&nbsp;bombings and is a word that we have thought important, for the reasons that I have given, over a considerable time.
</p>





<p><a name="st_75"><a name="60215-10_spnew4"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The Home Secretary helpfully gave us a history of the origin of the word, which lies not in legal text, but in a pronouncement from an international organisation. It is none the worse for that, but translating pious aspirations into sensible law is the job of the House. It is not the job of the House to take every such pious aspiration and repeat it verbatim. The decision to repeat it verbatim was the Prime Minister&#039;s when he concluded that there was political mileage in doing so. He kept it up even after I think the Home Secretary pointed out to him that the original idea was entirely unworkable. <i>[Interruption.]</i> In that case, perhaps the right hon.

</p>





<p><a name="st_76"><a name="60215-10_spnew5"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke: </b> 
 The answer is straightforward. We consulted on the proposal and, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, there were a number of people who thought that it was not correctly constructed. We debated in the House how to deal with it. We made a set of amendments, in the spirit of compromise that I tried to set out. However, I repeat that the word &quot;glorification&quot; was set out in the Labour party manifesto. It is not an invented word in the populist political way that the hon. Gentleman describes.

Yet even last night, the Prime Minister&#039;s propaganda department was putting out to the press&#151;that is the way it was reproduced on the news this morning&#151;that what was at stake in the House today was an offence of glorification.

Gentleman reads the <i>Hansard</i> record of the debate in the Lords, he will see that some perfectly respectable people in the other place felt that even this amendment went too far and preferred to keep, without further ado, the straight definition of &quot;indirect encouragement&quot;.

 I disagree. Of course the Home Secretary is right that the Taoiseach does not intend people to engage in terrorism, but even in terms of subjective recklessness he is at serious risk. This is a controversial issue in Ireland. Some people look to the Easter rising as an example of what they should be doing today, and the Taoiseach will know that when he stands up and decides for political reasons that it is a risk work taking to repossess from Sinn Fein the celebration of this particular event and to restore it to the mainstream of Irish political life. That is what he is intending to do, but the way in which the Bill has been drafted by the Government does not protect him. There is no point in the Home Secretary shaking his head. The only protection that he has is the Government&#039;s discretion not to prosecute him. That is unacceptable. The Home Secretary would have a better case if this were an offence only of specific intent.

 Does my hon. Friend accept that the real problem is that the Government want to allege that by refuting this idea of glorification, Opposition Members are somehow soft on terrorism. In fact, as I pointed out in an intervention on the Home Secretary, the courts have no definition of glorification.

 I agree with my hon. Friend. We are passing law. Lord Bingham said in the Rimmington case that law had to be clear, precise and adequately defined, based on a rational and discernible principle. That is the problem. Glorification is not clear, precise, adequately defined or based on a rationally discernible principle. By plucking the concept out of the air, the Government will cause themselves and the courts that have to apply the law great difficulties. Like so many other laws that we have passed against terrorism in the past five years, when it is on the statute book, it will turn out that all the prosecutions are brought under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.

It is all very well saying that one will ultimately be acquitted if the state is foolish enough to prosecute, but most people who enjoy freedom of speech would like the reassurance that, for example, what they say at the commemoration of the Easter rising in a pub in north London in a couple of months will not land them with a knock on the door from the police afterwards.

The uncertainty is being created by some Conservative Members who are seeking to exploit that uncertainty for political advantage, thus making it much more difficult to get the message across. That is why the dialogue that the Home Office has, and that this Home Secretary has created, with the wider Asian community&#151;not just the Muslim community&#151;is so vital. These provisions are not going to affect only the Muslim community. When a person of Asian origin is stopped in the street, people do not automatically know whether they are a Muslim.

One cannot just say whatever one wants about different communities and not be subject to the rule of law. The community is mindful of that. Those who step over the line will have to be prosecuted. Within that context and the context of the law, however, the community must be able to demonstrate as it sees fit. If a cartoon is published in a newspaper that defames a particular religion, and groups of our citizens wish to demonstrate against that within the law, they should be entitled to do so.

<p><a name="st_123"><a name="60215-14_spnew0"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland) (LD):</b> 
 I do not intend to detain the House for long, as we have been over this ground several times and I fear that we are in danger of pursuing a debate that might generate more heat than light. However, I commend the closing remarks of the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) to the Home Secretary. The approach that he advocates, of going out from Whitehall and engaging with communities, is much wiser than that which the Government have hitherto chosen to follow. The obsession with introducing one piece of legislation after another on the basis that something must be seen to be done is not a sustainable approach in the long term.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_79">On the political context of today&#039;s debate, the Home Secretary spoke last week about his wish to build a consensus around terrorism legislation. I took him at his word and was disappointed on Monday to hear the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#151;I know how fond the Home Secretary is of him&#151;basically say that anyone who does not agree with the Government is soft on terror. Such language does not really assist the debate. Again, on &quot;Today&quot; this morning, the Home Secretary spoke about the House of Lords playing politics with terrorism. He only needs to read the report of the debate in another place and he will see that Lords amendment No. 5, with which we are dealing, was brought forward by Lord Lloyd of Berwick, a Cross Bencher, and supported by the Bishop of Winchester.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_80">Clearly, there is a wide concern outside the chattering classes and the political community. I know that Ministers and Secretaries of State in particular sometimes find themselves living in a bubble in which they are insulated from some of those concerns. I ask the Home Secretary to accept, however, that those of us who hold such concerns do so for sincere and deeply felt reasons and that we are not simply engaged in some sort of frolic.

<p>
<a name="60215-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_81">On the Home Secretary&#039;s point that the glorification proposal was in the Labour party manifesto, the manifesto referred not just to glorification but to those who condoned terrorism. Clearly, that proposal has been quietly and properly dropped, but it indicates to me that these days&#151;particularly in light of last night&#039;s events&#151;there is a pick-and-mix element to political manifestos. I caution the Home Secretary against relying too much on that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_82">The Liberal Democrats&#039; concerns remain as they have been throughout. First, there is the question of the vagueness of &quot;glorification&quot; as a term to be used in statute. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) made that point in relation to the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, and he is absolutely right. Three concerns were raised by the Joint Committee, of which the first two have been addressed, but the Government have made no attempt to address the third. For as long as they insist on the maintenance of the term in the Bill, they can make no such attempt, as that circle simply cannot be squared. The Home Secretary accepted in a speech today that we 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Feb 2006 : Column 1453</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>still do not have a proper working definition of terrorism. The effect of that is to have vagueness heaped on vagueness, which results in bad law. I did not come here to enact bad law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_83">The Home Secretary told us that glorification is a subset of indirect encouragement. He is absolutely right. That assertion, however, is an admission that the reference to glorification is wholly unnecessary; in fact, it is dangerous. The problem with using exemplars in that way is that they can be seen as in some way restricting the broader term of which they seek to be an example. The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) said that all glorification would be caught by indirect encouragement but that not all indirect encouragement would be caught by glorification. He is absolutely right in that. He will be aware, as those advising the Home Secretary should surely be aware, that it is a simple rule of statutory construction that to express one option is to exclude the others.
</p>





<p><a name="st_124"><a name="60215-14_spnew1"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 I do not know why this debate is perhaps more important than the last one on the issue, but does the hon. Gentleman agree that we do not come here to try to produce laws that are unclear, and that we need the definition to be made? Given the importance of the Liberal Democrats in this exercise and in the House of Lords, does he agree that in the interests of the public, whom it is our main objective to serve, we should find some means of delay to which the Government could agree? Rather than rushing the Bill through on a ping-pong basis, we could settle down over the recess and come up with a clearer definition, because neither the amendment nor the Government&#039;s proposals are adequate to deal with this serious state of affairs.
</p>





<p><a name="st_125"><a name="60215-14_spnew2"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 I would certainly never seek to disagree with anyone who suggested that the Liberal Democrats were important, and I have little difficulty in agreeing with what the hon. Gentleman has said. He is right. I shall say more about this shortly, but it seems to me that there is no real chasm between the two sides. If the Home Secretary sincerely wanted to build consensus, it would not be a particularly difficult task to undertake. It certainly ought to be possible for us and the other place between us to achieve that consensus during the recess next week. Consensus, however, can be achieved only if both sides wish to achieve it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_84">I do not think that the root cause of the problem lies in the Home Office; I think that it lies in No. 10&nbsp;Downing street. There is no political will on the Government&#039;s part to achieve the consensus, because it suits them better to dominate the political debate by calling those of us who are on this side of the argument soft on terrorism than to find a workable, sensible, legally enforceable solution.

 In evidence to the Home Affairs Committee yesterday, Lord Carlile, who used to be a Liberal Member of Parliament in the House of Commons, told us that if he had to estimate the number of clerics in the Muslim community&#151;they are, needless to say, totally unrepresentative of that community and of fellow clerics&#151;who are peddling dangerous nonsense, he would say that there were about 20. As I have said in earlier interventions, I recognise the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>sensitivity of an issue that is not as clear-cut as many of us would like it to be, but is it not possible&#151;I am not speaking as a lawyer&#151;that if the number is anywhere near 20, those clerics could be dealt with under existing law? If that is the position, as the Home Secretary would no doubt argue, is it not quite likely that they could be dealt with by means of the provision on glorification? If that is so, will not the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) concede that there is a case for doing what the Government intend to do?
</p>





<p><a name="st_127"><a name="60215-14_spnew4"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 The problem with that is that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s case has already been undermined by the Home Secretary, who has told us that glorification is a subset of indirect encouragement. That means that nothing said by the imams referred to by my noble and learned Friend Lord Carlile would not be caught by the broader and more general terms of indirect encouragement. The difficulty arises from the baggage that is attached to glorification. I shall say more about that later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_85">I want to say something about the Home Secretary&#039;s objections to the Lords amendment. He latched on to the word &quot;listener&quot;. I accept that the wording is not the best possible formulation, and it is not the one that I would have chosen. If the word &quot;recipient&quot; had been used, with one bound we should all have been free; but instead of trying to work around that, the Government chose to set up a tremendous clash between this House and the other place. As I told the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), I think that that can only have more to do with the wider political debate than with the process of securing good, workable legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_86">Then there is the question of the signal that would be sent to the courts and to terrorists if it were suggested that glorification was somehow acceptable. That has more than a whiff of desperation about it. If it is the strongest argument that the Government can come up with, they are in some trouble. As I said earlier, the Government previously used the word &quot;condone&quot; in their manifesto. When they dropped that word, did it mean that they suddenly condoned terrorism? I do not think so.
</p>





<p><a name="st_128"><a name="60215-14_spnew5"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The Government also used the word &quot;exalt&quot;. I am not entirely sure what they meant by it; the hon. Gentleman may agree that it is a rather undefined phrase. They seem to have been able to drop that without any difficulty.

<p><a name="st_129"><a name="60215-14_spnew6"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 Indeed. I shall not be too hard on the Government, because I am delighted that they dropped the reference to exaltation, a term which in my view has no place in statute.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_89">I urge the House to support Lords amendment No. 5, which effectively does away entirely with clause 1(4). That subsection, like the Bill itself, is unnecessary and, at worst, mischievous. Let me explain why it is unnecessary. I shall do so as simply as I can. I must see the legislation through the dark prism of the eyes of a prosecuting criminal lawyer, and in my time I have prosecuted the worst of them; but when I consider likely offences, I cannot think of an actual or&#151;to answer a point made earlier&#151;an imagined circumstance involving the imparting of glorification, coupled with encouragement or inducement to emulate, that would not be caught by existing legislation on incitement. I shall be happy if any Member can give me an example of a case in which I would not advise prosecution in such circumstances. I have struggled, and if I could have thought of such an instance, I should have been happy for the Bill to be given a much clearer passage. The fact that no such instance can be imagined, and the fact that the legislation is unnecessary, lead to the inevitable suspicion&#151;ventilated and articulated in this House&#151;that the motivation is to persuade the people that the Government are doing something, and, worse still, to provide an alibi for what has not been done in the past.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_90">Pre-eminent in this context is the case of Mr. Abu Hamza. I do not know why he was not prosecuted months or years ago under existing legislation. I am sure that at some stage those with responsibility, in the Home Office or in the departments directly under its aegis, will explain why Mr. Abu Hamza was not prosecuted months or years ago, together with the other clerics who are spreading violence and the concept of violence, and the encouragement of and incitement to violence that has been described to us.

<a name="stpa_91">Equally, I do not know why those who carried placards during the demonstration that has rightly been referred to many times&#151;placards that were classic incitements to violence&#151;have not been prosecuted, and were not apprehended at the time. That failure has done no favours at all to the Islamic community. I am afraid that I was not present for Prime Minister&#039;s Questions&#151;and I have been told by the Whips that I can go home whenever I like during this debate&#151;but I understand that the Prime Minister suggested that we needed the Bill in order to catch precisely those people who wave placards. I do not know who briefed the Prime Minister, but I can say for certain who did not brief him: the Home Secretary&#039;s parliamentary private secretary, my good, learned and honourable Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird), who would know perfectly well that what those placards contained was a direct incitement to violence. I do not know where that idea came from, but those holding the placards should, and could, have been prosecuted.

<br>&nbsp;<br>no place whatsoever in criminal jurisprudence and absolutely no place in this particular criminal jurisprudence. In dealing with this desperate and sensitive area of law at this desperate and sensitive time, we must ensure that the law is hard, clinical, analytical, direct and immediately understandable by any who seek to look at it. It must contain the vernacular that underlines all those elements.

<a name="stpa_93">&quot;Glorification&quot; is a word that is interpreted subjectively, as we wish to interpret it; my &quot;glorification&quot; is not others&#039;. Without a shadow of doubt, if we pass this legislation the office of the Attorney-General will be besieged by those who believe that what somebody else has said&#151;be they Islamic or Christian; it does not matter&#151;constitutes a glorification of terrorism. Demands will be made for the Attorney-General to exercise his discretion and if he agrees to do so, it will cause immense trouble and pain. If he does not, that will also cause immense trouble and pain. The problem stems from the use of this word. &quot;Glorification&quot; is wonderful from the pen of Blake or Milton; it is glorious in the music of Frideric Handel. But we do not do beatitudes in the Old Bailey; rather, we do law, conviction and punishment, which is what should have happened in the case of Abu Hamza and others a very long time ago.

In other words, the Government have not produced a single example of someone&#039;s saying something that manifestly should be prosecuted, but which cannot be prosecuted unless the word &quot;glorify&quot; is included in this legislation. If the House is to support it, the Government, the Home Secretary and the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety must prove that point. It is no good making vague, suitable-for-the-&quot;Today&quot;-programme statements that anybody who does not agree with the Government must in some way be nasty. I know that that is a basic new Labour belief, but the truth is that many of us are concerned that the law be enforced, and be seen to be enforced, impartially, particularly on a matter as serious as this.

We do not want a legal system in which the public and the individual are protected from the rigors of the law not by the law itself, but by a collection of political figures. We want a law that&#151;to paraphrase the hon. and learned Member for Medway&#151;is clear, precise and clinical; we do not want one written in such a way as to extend Ministers&#039; privileges and prerogatives.

<a name="stpa_98">Of course, there are circumstances in which the word &quot;glorify&quot; is not as otiose as we think&#151;in which it is, contrary to what the Home Secretary thinks, capable of being used unreasonably.

Member for Leicester, East said earlier, although not with the conclusion that he came to. A person who recently preached in the town of Ipswich the particular, in my view rather narrow and extreme, position of a Protestant group was stopped by the police and told that his action&#151;he felt that he was preaching the gospel&#151;was liable to prosecution on the ground of stirring up religious and racial hatred.

They said, &quot;We are law-abiding people and we do not wish to be put into a category whereby it may seem, either to us or to others, that we have broken the law. We wish to abide by it.&quot; Given their peculiar view of the nature of human law and their desire for a theocracy, that is a very difficult thing for them to say. However, I do not believe that small groups of decent people should be made, in a sense, illegal simply because we think them rather peculiar. Here, I mean &quot;peculiar&quot; in the technical sense of different from other people. I therefore point out to the Home Secretary that there is a serious reason why the word &quot;glorify&quot; should not be included in the Bill&#151;a reason akin to that advanced by the hon.

I very often find myself uplifted by those words and that music, but they are not a suitable subject for law. We have to be very careful, because people who speak about religion often do so with fervour, as it is the most important part of their lives.

 The Oxford English Dictionary definition is that the word &quot;glorification&quot; means the praise and worship of God. Does my right hon. Friend agree that there will be a grave danger that the courts will try and construe those words in the context of terrorism, which is what the debate hinges on? If terrorism and religion are conflated, would not the courts have to make a decision based on how praising and worshipping God are interpreted?

 My hon. Friend exposes why the use of the word &quot;glorification&quot; is so uniquely ridiculous, and makes clear how important it is to get this right. It is a delicate matter because it is so close to things that people feel very deeply. In a very delicate eye operation, for example, a tiny move can destroy the eye that was meant to be healed and therefore negate the whole purpose of the operation. The Home Secretary is capable of understanding and sensitivity, and that is why it is worth trying to pursue this matter.

<a name="stpa_102">My final point is a reinterpretation of my first. The matter is very delicate and so needs language that is different from that used to send political messages. As my hon.

If we used in the House the language that we used to speak to our children when they were young, we would sound pretty peculiar. Some hon.

It would be bad enough if the ethnic communities misunderstood us, but that misunderstanding could reach many small groups in society for which belief in God is the key issue.

 We have reached the stage in the debate when it is unlikely that minds will be changed. Some of us probably feel that it is more important to get on the record, so that our constituents and acquaintances know how and why we will vote this evening.

<p>
<a name="60215-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_105">Many hon. Members consider the day they are first elected to be one of the proudest of their lives. They see that they are about to engage in the governance and future of the country as a whole, and deal with the most serious issues. One of those issues is the security of the country and of the constituents whom we represent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_106">Therefore, I resent the fact that this debate has moved away from a serious discussion of the issue in recent weeks, and that the threat from terrorism is used for political advantage rather than as a spur to drawing up appropriate legislation for our statute books. I am critical of all parties in that respect. I am upset&#151;to say the least&#151;to have discovered in the weekend press that Mr. Gould is polling on behalf of the Labour party to see how terrorism plays as an issue in the political debate. I resent the allegations from all sides that people who express a view on the matter can be accused of being soft on terrorism. No one in this Chamber is being soft on terrorism; we are simply trying to find the best way to confront and end it. I am also concerned by the ludicrous examples that some Opposition Members have used, as they trivialise the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_107">The debate on this amendment centres on the following questions. Is it necessary? Do the Government&#039;s proposals represent an appropriate alternative? Is the expression of those proposals appropriate, or could there be unforeseen consequences?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_108">Many hon. Members have tried to consult as best they can on those questions. A group of us met Gareth Peirce, a lawyer who, as many will know, has been involved in terrorism cases for nearly 30&nbsp;years. We first came across her when we asked her to engage in the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four cases. She should know whether enough statutes already exist to prosecute terrorists as she has already defended people accused of carrying out terrorist acts: some were innocent, others may well have been guilty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_109">Gareth Peirce&#039;s response was very concise. Why are we bringing in this Bill? The common law offence of incitement has been a crime for more than two centuries. Incitement to murder, which has already been referred to by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), is contained in section 4&nbsp;of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which says that it is an offence to

</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-16_para9">
<a name="stpa_111">Again, incitement to violence is covered by section 4(1) of the Public Order Act 1986, which states that it is a criminal offence to use

</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-16_para11">
<a name="stpa_113">Section 12&nbsp;of the Terrorism Act 2000&nbsp;makes it an offence to invite support for proscribed terrorist organisations. Moreover, it is not as though all that legislation has not led to prosecutions, the most recent being the Hamza case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-16_para12">
<a name="stpa_114">My worry is based on my experience with legislation that is worded so broadly that it is ineffective and can be used to entrap the innocent. There are unforeseen consequences when we in this House legislate poorly. We should learn the lessons of the original prevention of terrorism legislation, which was used first of all against Irish republicans and which allowed the police and other authorities to undertake widespread sweeps of that community. Those sweeps caught up the innocent who 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Feb 2006 : Column 1460</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>were then, in many instances, subject to miscarriages of justice. We make people vulnerable when we legislate unclearly and with such a breadth of impact as this legislation would have, and that is my worry.
</p>





<p><a name="st_135"><a name="60215-16_spnew3"><b> Jeremy Corbyn </b> 
: Does my hon. Friend agree that the effect of the prevention of terrorism Acts&#151;and, indeed, the current proscribed lists&#151;was often to choke off legitimate political debate and drive some people into the arms of extremists and others with bad intentions, whereas they should be brought into mainstream political discussion and debate?
</p>





<p><a name="st_136"><a name="60215-16_spnew4"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 That is another of the unforeseen consequences of badly drafted legislation. The innocent may suffer and others may be mobilised. Protections are proposed, such as the use of discretion, and we have been given assurances on the Floor of the House about the way in which the legislation will be used. However, I remind the House of when we debated the most recent anti-terror legislation. We sought assurances at that stage from my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, who was then a junior Minister at the Home Office, on whether peaceful demonstrators would be caught by that legislation. We were assured that peaceful demonstrators would not be affected by it and would not be liable to arrest. Within eight weeks, peace campaigners demonstrating outside an arms fair in east London were arrested under that legislation despite the assurances given on the Floor of the House. The bizarre experiences at Labour party conference&#151;not just of Walter Wolfgang but the 460&nbsp;other people who were detained under the legislation&#151;gave the lie to the assurances that were given.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-16_para13">
<a name="stpa_115">My hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prentice) made the point with regard to the Kashmiris and my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) made it with regard to the Tamils. I have many Sikhs in my constituency, some of whom support the cause of Khalistan, and terrorist activity has been associated with that cause. Those constituents become vulnerable under this legislation on the issue of the interpretation of reckless behaviour because they will glorify the concept of Khalistan as a legitimate objective for people within the Punjab. They might be caught out by sweeps that bring the innocent before the courts, and an inaccurate interpretation of some of this legislation might leave them vulnerable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-16_para14">
<a name="stpa_116">The reason why some of us support the Lords amendment is that&#151;despite opposing the concept in principle&#151;it gives more certainty that the legislation will not be used in sweeps, to arrest the innocent or cause miscarriages of justice. It is for those practical reasons that I support the Lords amendment, not for any attempt to make political capital out of the issue, which I regret has been done so far. As a Londoner, I find it distasteful that the July bombings have been used to justify some of the measures in the legislation for party political purposes, rather than for their effect.

<p><a name="st_137"><a name="60215-17_spnew0"><b> Miss Ann Widdecombe  (Maidstone and The Weald) (Con):</b> 
 I admit that I have been in a dilemma during much of the passage of the Bill and, at times, I believed that the Government had got it right. For example, I believe that they were probably right about 90&nbsp;days, and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Feb 2006 : Column 1461</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I would certainly have voted&#151;had I had the opportunity&#151;for 60&nbsp;days. Therefore, I looked very carefully at this issue before deciding the appropriate course of action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_117">If my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) had made the speech that he made today a few years ago, I would have told him to have a week&#039;s rest and a pair of aspirin, but today it rang horribly true. That is why I do not believe that the examples he gave were in any way trivial. When we make law in this place, we do not make it in a vacuum. We have to consider not only what we are doing, but the atmosphere in which the law will be implemented. We have to ask whether we have confidence that the implementation of the law will be moderated by the spirit intended, rather than simply carried out according to its letter. We have to ask whether we believe that we live in a state that is moderate, restrained and limited in the way that it intervenes in the name of law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_118">A few years ago, I would have said that, by and large&#151;even then I could have thought of a few exceptions&#151;we live in such a state. The reason that I sit on this side of the House is that I believe, both intellectually and emotionally, that the power of the state to intervene in our lives, and the power of its agents to intervene in our lives, should be as limited as is compatible with the right and just functioning of society. Today, I do not believe that we live in such a state.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_119">We have the ludicrous examples of agents of law and order enforcement spending four days in the bushes to catch someone feeding birds. That is a ludicrous example, but it is real. A more worrying example is that the chief constable of Wales&#151;not some misguided Mr. Plod&#151;believes that it is appropriate to investigate the Prime Minister for making a disobliging comment to his own television set.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_120">Vastly more worrying even than that example, as I said during the progress of the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill, is that we have seen four or five examples of the police intervening when no crime had been committed or threat uttered but a view had been expressed. My right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) gave another example. Therefore, I ask myself whether I am confident that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill, if we pass it today in the form in which the Government have drawn it up, will be applied with the common-sense restraint suggested by the Home Secretary. Given all the evidence that now confronts us on how law and order is being implemented, I do not have that confidence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_121">I have a dilemma. I appreciate that the Government believe that the other place has redrawn the provision too narrowly and that people who should be caught by the Bill will not be so caught. The Opposition contend that the Government have drawn the provision so widely that many people who should not be caught will be caught. I echo the request made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash): if possible, we should not look at each other over gun barrels but do a bit of parleying. It seems to me that we are so close in what we want to do that we could achieve a wording that meets the objections of both sides. If we could do that, the issue would not be about who will win and who will lose but 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Feb 2006 : Column 1462</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>about making good law to govern our country. I believe strongly that we should make a last-ditch attempt to come up with a wording that meets the objections of both sides.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_122">I have a further dilemma because, in an ideal world, I would like to live in a society in which one could say that Osama bin Laden was the best thing since sliced bread. I would like people to be free to say that and for it to be left to social disapproval and pressure, rather than the blunt instrument of the law, to convince them that they were wrong. However, I accept that in the circumstances that is quite impossible and that 7&nbsp;July, which the Government were right to invoke, changed things and that there is now a small section of the population who are sufficiently volatile as to be incited to action. Therefore, those who incite them should be answerable under the law even if that means that we have to limit severely the exercising of free speech.

<p>
<a name="60215-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_123">I believe that has to be done and that what the Government are trying to do is right. I believe that we can find a form of wording that will suit us all and convince us all, and that we have a duty to do so. In the last analysis, however, especially after what has happened over the past few months, with the police knocking on people&#039;s doors claiming that they have offended against the law when all they have done is express a point of view and with those actions being upheld at the most senior level in the police instead of being derided, I have no confidence that the law will be applied with the moderation and restraint necessary to convince me that we still live in a Britain that prizes freedom above all else.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_124">I am not a million miles from the Government&#039;s view, so it is with great reluctance that I do not support the proposed wording. I make this final plea, however: we can get there with mutually agreed wording so let us invoke the procedures that will allow us to do so.

<p>
<a name="60215-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_125">I still have those reservations. Nevertheless, there was some movement by the Government between Committee and Report and we arrived at a form of words, which was still not perfect but allowed us to postpone discussion of our reservations until next year.

<a name="stpa_128">I find it difficult to reconcile those comments with the assurances that I and others received today from my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary that we are not drifting back. I appreciate those reassurances, but I am worried that the focus is starting to turn back&#151;certainly in terms of the signals that are being sent out, although I agree with Ministers that the signals are important&#151;to saying that if somebody says something vile or abhorrent on terrorism, priority will be given to criminalising that utterance rather than working out the most effective way of stopping the actions that the person is glorifying. My opinion about that is stronger than it was in November.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_129">Several people have given examples that are relevant, but easy to understand, such as Nelson Mandela, Chile or Wat Tyler. I want to discuss an example that is difficult and profoundly troubling for all of us. I was one of the international observers at the recent Palestinian elections when Hamas was elected with a parliamentary majority in a free and fair vote. Members of Hamas have been responsible for some appalling attacks that are unquestionably definable as terrorist. We are all agreed about how important it is that the international community make clear our abhorrence of such attacks and what Hamas should do. When I met members of Hamas in Gaza, I told them that&#151;as did some of my hon. Friends. I am told that those conversations played a part, albeit a small one, in convincing members of Hamas to embark on a ceasefire that has saved lives in that part of the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_130">I give that example in this debate because commentators are starting to notice that even though Hamas and al-Qaeda are both terrorist, they cannot be classified in the same way. People are starting to notice that although jihadist groups are calling for violence in response to the cartoons, Hamas has called on its supporters to reject suggestions that their objections to the cartoons, which are equally as strong, should involve a violent response. I am not claiming that Hamas has suddenly stopped being terrorist or has stopped glorifying terrorism&#151;it has not; it is still a terrorist organisation. However, if a young Muslim in the UK who hears about a Palestinian child being shot by Israeli troops&#151;as happened a couple of weeks ago&#151;says that he supports Hamas and that Palestinians should take up arms against Israel, I question whether the right thing for us to do would be to criminalise him and threaten him with imprisonment, rather than telling him that he is wrong and why.

<p>
<a name="60215-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_131">From all my involvement in the issue, whether it be talking to people in the middle east or in the UK, I know that to respond by immediate criminalisation of such a young Muslim&#151;sending out those signals&#151;is much more likely to win recruits for terrorism than to win people away from it.

 I beg to move, that this House disagrees with the Lords in the said amendment.

 With this it will be convenient to take Lords amendment No. 23, Government motion to disagree thereto, Lords amendment No. 29, and Government motion to disagree thereto.

 Although I am sure that our debate on these amendments will be somewhat shorter than our debate on the previous group, they are detailed and controversial and I have no doubt that they will be subjected to proper scrutiny this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_154">The amendments relate to clause 3, which extends to the internet the offences set in clauses 1&nbsp;and 2&#151;encouragement to terrorism and dissemination of terrorist publications. I am sure that the House does not disagree with the principle of the clause that knowingly encouraging terrorism through the internet should be a crime. We have all heard about the radical material that is sometimes distributed via the internet and on the worldwide web, and the damage that it can cause. However, in applying the offences in clauses 1&nbsp;and 2&nbsp;to the internet, we faced a significant problem relating to knowledge of the offence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_155">As we all know, it is possible for someone who runs a bulletin board-style website to be unaware of the content posted on it. Clause 3&nbsp;provides for a notice and take-down procedure to enable the police to notify those who are unaware of offending material of its presence and to request them to remove it from the public view. If they choose not to remove the material, they will be deemed to have endorsed it and they will lose the chance, if they are prosecuted under clauses 1&nbsp;or 2, to use the defence of non-endorsement set out in those clauses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_156">The House should bear in mind, first, that refusal to obey the notice and take-down procedure is not an offence in itself. The legal effect of refusing to comply with the notice is merely that the statutory defences in clauses 1&nbsp;and 2&nbsp;of non-endorsement are not open to be used by the person in question. Secondly, even if an individual fails to comply with the notice, the prosecution will still have to prove that they intended to encourage terrorism or to make information or assistance available to terrorists, or they were subjectively reckless about that. Those are significant burdens on the prosecution. The clause provides simply that someone who chooses to ignore the notice and take- down procedure will not be able to avail themselves of the simple statutory defence of non-endorsement; the prosecution will still have to prove the offence. The intention behind clause 3&nbsp;was to provide a method by which webmasters could be made aware of content on 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Feb 2006 : Column 1472</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>their websites, thus ensuring that they could not claim not to have known about it if they were subsequently prosecuted.

<p>
<a name="60215-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_157">The internet is a fast-moving medium. In the field of removal of child pornography, in which the UK is the acknowledged world leader, it is accepted that offensive material can change location several times in one day. Shifts in location can take place between different computer servers, across countries and across continents.
</p>





<p><a name="st_153"><a name="60215-19_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ellwood: </b> 
 The problem to which the right hon. Lady refers is an international problem, but we are prompted to act in this respect because we are trying to deal with a problem of international terrorism. What discussions has she had with ICANN&#151;the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which is the international organisation responsible for the servers themselves&#151;which would be at the heart of any attempt to solve the problem? If we control what goes out on the internet, we stop the means of communication that terrorists use so freely.
</p>





<p><a name="st_154"><a name="60215-19_spnew2"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 Personally, I have not had any such discussions, but extensive discussions are under way with internet service providers and the communications industry both in the European Union and internationally to try to ensure that we tackle those problems in relation to terrorism and child pornography. Hon. Members will acknowledge that we have made significant progress in dealing with child pornography in this area. Those discussions are under way, but the hon. Gentleman is right&#151;we face international problems, and the imperative is to maximise international co-operation on these issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_158">Locating that material and ensuring that it is removed is sometimes a difficult job, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out. It was therefore proposed and accepted by the House that a police constable could issue a notice to the person responsible for disseminating or publishing content considered capable of prosecution. The amendments made in the other place drastically change the effect of clause 3, and stipulate on the grounds of protection of freedom of speech that a judicial authority, rather than a police officer, should be capable of issuing such a notice. Moreover, they stipulate that the judicial authority should be a circuit judge, a judge of the High Court in England and Wales or an equivalent judge in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_159">The argument advanced in the other place for such a change is that it would not be in the interest of a service provider or webmaster to ignore a notice, and that a police constable was not an appropriate authority to issue such a notice, given the effect on freedom of speech. I understand some of the concerns expressed in the other place, but I hope to reassure the House that they are unfounded. First, we are working to produce guidance on the issue of notices under clause 3&nbsp;with a working group comprising members of the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and other interested parties. It is certain that a clearly stated protocol will be introduced under which notices will be issued. It is therefore not possible for a notice to be issued without serious consideration. Concern was expressed in the other place that a police officer could decide on a whim 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that material on the web contravened the provision and could issue a notice. However, I can reassure the House that that will not happen.

 I am not in a position to speculate about the effect of the provision because it is a new measure. The police, however, will look at the issue carefully. We all accept that some material circulated internationally on the web could fall foul of clauses 1&nbsp;and 2, so it is appropriate to introduce a mechanism to request that that information is removed quickly&#151;as I said, the internet is a fast-moving medium.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_160">May I set out the detail of what the special branch officers will do, as it will give the House some reassurance? An officer in the anti-terrorism branch of the police service who carries out such duties is known as the single point of contact, and deals regularly with internet service providers and the communications industry. Our relationship with the communications industry does not simply focus on terrorism, and there are a range of issues on which the police must foster good relations. The accredited single point of contact officers will ensure efficiency and good practice in their management of relationships. They will use only practical and lawful requirements for the acquisition of communications data, and they will provide a guardian and gatekeeper function to minimise the burdens on internet providers so that a huge amount of bureaucracy is not created. At the same time, however, they will ensure that there is access to the information that could help us to tackle such problems.

 The policemen who undertake such work will be specialists, if only in linguistics, because much of the material will probably be in a foreign language. However, what would happen if something were posted on the web that genuinely quoted inflammatory material, perhaps to criticise it? On the other hand, to get round the law, a posting could quote inflammatory material and pretend to criticise it but, in fact, be seeking to propagate it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_160"><a name="60215-20_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 Clearly, those are matters of interpretation of the material posted. Does it fulfil the conditions of the offences in clauses 1&nbsp;and 2? Does it appear to be material of the kind that could qualify as the offence? The original notice and take-down

<br>&nbsp;<br>procedure will be a judgment reached by the specially accredited officers who are properly trained to deal with these matters.

<a name="stpa_163">We are considering the appropriate level for the authorisation of the power. In many areas powers are authorised at superintendent level.

What&#039;s in it for us to resist it?&quot;, and will not the effect of the policy applied across the board be that all the websites will quickly find internet service providers abroad and the whole issue will become rather nugatory?

<p><a name="st_164"><a name="60215-20_spnew5"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#039;s premise that because there might be consequences, we should not try to limit the kind of information that is available. If we adopted that as a general approach, we would rarely legislate on anything. If, through the process, we can limit the amount of material that could be used to encourage people to engage in terrorist acts, it is a process worth adopting. I do not believe that the automatic response from providers will be to remove information. They have an interest in making sure that their websites, and access to the web, are relevant and interesting to the people who want to use them.

 The right hon. Gentleman will be aware that people access material and images from the web. Sometimes people who have been involved in terrorist activity have said that they were influenced by material that they were able to access. The problem is therefore real. It is important that we take every step we can to try and prevent people from being unlawfully drawn into terrorist activity. Clause 1&nbsp;includes the new offence of indirectly encouraging people to get involved in terrorist activity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_164">It is important that we seek to use all available means, because in this global world people are increasingly using technology, the internet and methods of communication other than writing a simple statement or making a speech.

 The right hon.

If her main objection to the Lords amendment is the delay, I suggest the use of circuit judges as well as of High Court judges. Circuit judges in many fields of law are always available at a moment&#039;s notice to attend, for example, interlocutory injunctions.

It does not mean that someone is guilty of an offence, but simply that they cannot take advantage of a defence that is designed to protect people who genuinely and innocently did not know that the material was on their website. It puts them on notice that the material is on their website and that they had better take it down or they may be prosecuted. However, the prosecution would still then have to prove every element of the offences in clauses 1&nbsp;and 2.

 I understand my hon. and learned Friend&#039;s point. I do not know how many people share the same problems, but I think that the internet industry is content with the provisions as we have set them out and feels that they strike the right balance. It is not looking for extra judicial oversight or for an appeal process. We must get the balance right between being able to take swift action on a very fast-moving medium&#151;the internet&#151;and ensuring that people can still avail themselves of the proper defences to any prosecutions that might be brought but cannot avail themselves of the defence that they did not know about the material if they have been put on notice.

I genuinely think that in this case we have got the balance right, with a specially trained special branch officer who works with the anti-terrorist unit, and is used to dealing with these issues, going to the service provider and saying, &quot;This material is there, you ought to take it down, and if you don&#039;t you can&#039;t avail yourself of the defence that says you didn&#039;t know.&quot; It is a very straightforward issue, and with the greatest respect I think that Members are making heavy weather out of it.

 Those are matters of fine judgment and I do not want to consider the provisions that we discussing in that way. We have some straightforward provisions that would notify providers that material was unacceptable and that they should remove it, tell them that they could choose to ignore the notice but that, if they did so, they could not avail themselves of the statutory defence that they did not know about it. The provisions from the other place would elevate this matter to too great a level by seeking to have judicial scrutiny of the process. The internet service providers have not requested that; they are happy with this process and feel that it will help to reduce the amount of such material available. This is a practical and common-sense provision, and I ask the House to disagree with the Lords amendments and to approve the original wording of the Bill.

 I have listened with interest to what the Minister has said on this matter. We share her aims in clause 3. We entirely agree that it should be possible to give a notice to take down internet material that offends under clauses 1&nbsp;and 2. We have no problem with that. The difficulty is, as the Minister will acknowledge, that the internet service provider is in a different position from the person who has put the material on the web in the first place.

<a name="stpa_173">We take the view in this country that the internet is a powerful tool for disseminating information, and that on the whole&#151;although it can be used for bad purposes such as pornography, child pornography and, indeed, terrorism&#151;the balance is in its favour in that it allows the distribution of information around the world. It is therefore in the public interest that the principle of the freedom of the internet should be maintained. Disquiet has been expressed recently that, under pressure from some foreign Governments, internet service providers and search engines have been prepared to reach accommodations with those Governments to withdraw certain material, particularly in China. That is an infringement of the ability to communicate freely. There is a serious public interest in maintaining the right to communicate freely on the internet.

<a name="stpa_174">I fully understand how the Government&#039;s provision will operate. There will be trained officers to carry out research work and serve the notices. That is all perfectly appropriate, but, as the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) so rightly said, when a person receives one of those notices, it is in terrorem. They will receive a notice telling them that they risk prosecution unless they remove the material, and that they will not be able to rely on the statutory defence of lack of knowledge. Any internet service provider that is doing its job properly and is respectful of the public policy arguments relating to the maintenance of freedom of speech will have to make a judgment as to whether the police officer is right to serve the notice. There could be instances in which an internet service provider decided that the case was borderline. It would not be the first time in our history that a police officer had made a mistake, however well-intentioned they might be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_175">In those circumstances, what could be more sensible than to provide a mechanism to reassure the internet service provider that an independent third party had scrutinised the request from the police officer, so as to establish that there was at least a prima facie case to justify the officer&#039;s action? That is all that we were talking about, when the other place inserted the judicial scrutiny provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_176">I was surprised to hear the Minister say that this would be no different from the scrutiny of control orders. She has failed to understand the nature of the review that a judge would carry out. I would assume that it would be identical to those made on an ex parte application for an injunction. The police officer would simply have to show the material to the judge, and the judge would have to make a swift assessment of whether he thought that it fell foul of clauses 1&nbsp;and 2. The judge would then give his approval. That would provide the reassurance to the internet service provider that he was taking the right decision in taking the material off the web.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_177">The Minister seemed to say that there was a great need for haste in such cases. I confess that I was a little surprised about that, because when we debated clause 3&nbsp;it never occurred to me that it, or clauses 1&nbsp;and 2, would be used as an emergency provision suddenly to remove or prosecute people. Instead, it seemed that it was part of the Government&#039;s perfectly commendable plan to ensure that the circulation of material that constituted a direct or indirect encouragement to terrorism could be controlled. The truth, I suspect, is that material of that kind is likely to have been on the web for weeks if not months or years before somebody finally starts taking action against it. That there will be some threat to the public from a delay of 24&nbsp;hours, which is probably all that would be needed in order to go before a judge&#151;in an emergency, the delay would probably be of a few hours, and the hearing could probably be done in the middle of the night were there some pressing reason&#151;does not therefore seem to be the best point that the Minister has made in the debate, although I acknowledge that I do not take exception to the broad thrust of what the Government are trying to do.

To be fair to the Minister, she has not suggested that the scrutiny measure will undermine the provisions of clause 3, as that would be rather far-fetched.

<br>&nbsp;<br>anti-terrorism legislation on the determination of a police officer. Were Mr. Wolfgang to have a website, the Bill would allow a police officer to insist on its removal. We all know that that is a flippant example and that it is unlikely to happen, but under the Bill it is possible.
</p>





<p><a name="st_188"><a name="60215-22_spnew2"><b> Lynne Featherstone: </b> 
 That is true. A host of cases might be caught, or might not. The point of judicial oversight is to confer an extra level of security to any decision that is made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_183">If a notice is served, an internet service provider will inevitably remove material that is cited as being unlawfully terrorism-related, because it will not be in the provider&#039;s interest to risk the cost, the fight and the possible prosecution for the sake of something about which, ultimately, he may not care very deeply. He might not be caught for non-compliance with the notice, but he would be caught under the provision relating to an endorsement being seen to have been given if the material were not removed within two days, and would be exposed to prosecution. Obviously, service providers would fight shy of that. No wonder they are not complaining to the Minister; I do not think they can. Accepting the notice and removing the material is the line of least resistance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_184">The judgment on material thought to be unlawfully terrorism-related becomes crucial. The Bill refers to the opinion of a constable. I am impressed by the sudden escalation of the qualifications of that constable to the level of special branch, with authority to give particular guidance; but the Bill uses the word &quot;constable&quot; nevertheless. While I have the greatest respect and admiration for our police officers, the usual remit of the police is to submit those suspected of law-breaking to the judiciary for their decision. Under the Bill, a constable will be the arbiter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_185">There is a history surrounding the opinions of police officers, particularly in respect of issues of this kind. We know that stops under section 44&nbsp;of the Terrorism Act 2000&nbsp;resulted in a 300&nbsp;per cent. increase in the number of stops after ll September. We know of the disproportionality relating to stop and search and stop and account. To my personal knowledge the Met has worked hard to eradicate such tendencies from its police officers, but that disproportionality persists. But even when a constable&#039;s discretion&#151;which is vital to police work&#151;is used, it is used to bring a suspect to justice. The constable is not supposed to act as judge and jury.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_186">Moreover, the likely consequences of making the constable, through his &quot;opinion&quot;, the final arbiter over what is unlawfully terrorism-related may expose the police to public criticism or ridicule should the &quot;opinion&quot; be obviously and substantively wrong, and subject them to unwanted publicity. The same would apply if a provider took his case to court and won&#151;although, as I have said, I doubt that that will happen. The police would become vulnerable if required to make a judgment that a police person is not trained to make, and which it is not appropriate for him or her to make. The police have enough to contend with. Their role should be to bring offenders to justice&#151;to submit to a judge those who, in their opinion, deserve a notice to remove material from the web. Judicial oversight would afford some protection to free speech, and to police officers who would otherwise be charged by the Government&#039;s edict with an inappropriate power to

We are talking about a delay of a few hours, not about going to court. The measure is akin to an arrest warrant rather than a court hearing, so the Minister&#039;s argument is somewhat specious.

<p>
<a name="60215-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_187">Judicial oversight would lend weight and seriousness to a decision to issue a notice to remove such material, which can only be a good thing; such extra protection has to be a worthy thing. The added benefit is that in referring cases to judges, constables would have more time to weigh the decision being taken; as a result, they would not refer cases so lightly. Constables themselves would consider whether a particular case was worthy of judicial oversight, which provides an extra protection.

To us, even if the cause was right, the means were wrong, and we read such histories with condemnation in our hearts and minds. It would be quite possible, however, for others to read such histories without that strong framework.

If, however, she is saying that all manner of websites could be out there that could cause this problem, that is very different.

That would also provide an added protection for our constables. The Minister said that we are talking about a very limited number of specially trained people&#151;people who need remarkable language skills and judgment in trying to distinguish between the different types of material that I have sketched out today&#151;but in fact, the Bill states that any constable could deal with such matters. That places too big a burden on constables, and might lead to pressure being put on them by people who see websites that they do not like, and who think that this could be a route to getting them closed down. I therefore urge the Minister to think again.

<p><a name="st_190"><a name="60215-23_spnew0"><b> Mr. Wallace: </b> 
 I shall be brief, but the Minister has just announced the effective expansion of some special branch duties as a way to alleviate Opposition concerns about take-down orders being put in place by a constable. In my time, I have served alongside special branch officers&#151;in the special operations unit SO12&nbsp;in Northern Ireland&#151;and I know that they are among the best officers in the police force and that they do an extremely good job. However, I also know the practicalities of Government directions such as the Minister&#039;s, and I question whether the person placing take-down orders will in fact be the sort of officer about whom she gave the House assurances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_192">Special branch officers are incredibly overworked and bear a heavy burden. Among their many other jobs they run agents, liaise with intelligence services and implement new legislation. The Bill talks about a &quot;constable&quot;, meaning a member of the mainstream special branch, but my experience is that that person will soon be merely a liaison officer attached to special branch, and then an ordinary constable who is asked to assist in a case. Inappropriate allocation of police officers to such tasks can lead to the sort of extreme events that we saw with the Manchester ricin plot. In that case, the wrong type of officer was deployed in the wrong job, and lives were placed in extreme danger.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_193">I hope that the Minister will alleviate some of our concerns, perhaps in writing if she is unable to provide the answers to my questions this afternoon. What will be the cost of the extra training for some officers? Why do the Government believe that the Bill should speak so loosely of a &quot;constable&quot;, without offering a closer definition of the expertise required? Why is the Minister not happy with GCHQ, the agency that does the job at the moment? It has linguists, and its intercept knowledge goes far deeper than that of the police force. Does not GCHQ represent the best way to go about these matters, in conjunction with a judicial appeal?

 My hon. Friend&#039;s suggestion has the additional practical advantage that it meets the point made by the Labour Back Bencher who spoke about

<br>&nbsp;<br>those occasions when the intelligence services will want to track who is accessing sites. As part of the intelligence network, GCHQ will be able to make a balanced decision about when to take a site down and when it might be advantageous to keep it up for intelligence purposes.
</p>





<p><a name="st_192"><a name="60215-23_spnew2"><b> Mr. Wallace: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing that out, and I agree with him. I suspect that Cheltenham will continue to do the job anyway, and that a constable in some police force will get a phone call telling him to go down the road to enact a take-down order. That will not make for good policing, but it will cause police resources to be used up. For example, a terrorist group may want to take an officer off duties involving surveillance or running an agent. All it need do is to put up an inflammatory website, and that officer&#039;s time will be taken up with the ensuing take-down order rather than with trying to intercept information or interdict the terrorist organisation.

<p><a name="st_195"><a name="60215-24_spnew0"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 We have heard some useful contributions&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_196"><a name="60215-24_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b> 
 Order. I remind the right hon. Lady that she needs the leave of the House.
</p>





<p><a name="st_197"><a name="60215-24_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 With leave of the House, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I shall respond to the useful points that have been made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_207">The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) made various points about international service providers. I have already indicated that regulating the international aspects of internet provision is not the easiest thing to do and that our measures broadly apply to UK service providers. We would not issue notices directly on international service providers, but would try to use our relationships with other Governments and our international partners in law enforcement to take action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_208">If a foreign Government implacably refused to take action, we might try to serve a notice on an international service provider, but that would not be our normal route, as enforcement would be difficult. Although it is theoretically possible, a prosecution would be unlikely to follow. The notice and take-down procedure is a precursor to prosecution, not an act in itself; the process prevents the provider from relying on the statutory defence that they did not know the content of their site. It is a preliminary step to subsequent prosecution, so if prosecution would be unlikely, due to international jurisdiction, it would be difficult to issue the initial notice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_209">The hon. Gentleman raised some important points about how we can develop our policies and procedures to maximise international co-operation on such issues. As I said earlier, we have a good record on such co-operation, especially in dealing with child pornography, where we are among the leaders in Europe and people are studying our organisation. We have invested a huge amount. We have specialist police officers and a specialist centre to deal with such issues, so we have good experience in tackling damaging information and images on the internet, but we can always learn from other people and we would be interested in doing so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_210">The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace) obviously has experience in that field and asked whether it would be appropriate for GCHQ rather than police officers to issue the notices. The service of the notice is very much an operational task and is not the type of thing that would normally be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Feb 2006 : Column 1488</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>undertaken by GCHQ, but that is not to say that on many occasions the officers involved would not be advised by GCHQ about the appropriate steps to take.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_211">It is important that all our law-enforcement institutions involved in tackling terrorism&#151;whether special branch, GCHQ or the Security Service&#151;work together. Our machinery must be focused on trying to use every tool that we can to bear down on terrorism. Hon. Members have acknowledged that the tools of the internet and international communications are increasingly used by terrorists and those who want to encourage people to get involved in terrorism. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman makes a good point: if we need GCHQ&#039;s advice, operational police officers should be so advised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_212">The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) has expressed his belief that judicial scrutiny is the appropriate mechanism to reassure people in these circumstances. Although I have made the valid argument about the risk of delay, I have also said that we need to find the right balance of judicial scrutiny; otherwise, every step that we take in trying to tackle terrorism could be subject to lengthy and serious judicial scrutiny. I hope that the hon. Gentleman, with his legal background, agrees that, as with everything we do in this respect, we must ensure that the judicial scrutiny is proportionate. This is a precursor process, not an offence. By saying that people cannot rely on the statutory defence if such things are not taken down from the internet, we do not require the same level of judicial scrutiny as that required if such an action constituted an offence in and of itself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_213">I ask the hon. Gentleman to think seriously about this matter. A company hosting such a site will not find that it is found guilty. We are saying, &quot;We have notified you. Therefore, you cannot take advantage of the defence that says, &#039;I did not know.&#039;&quot; That seems to be a straightforward corollary: the company has been notified, so it cannot say that it did not know. That does not mean that it is guilty of the offence. If a prosecution were to ensue, every element that relates to indirect encouragement in circumstances likely to encourage people to emulate the act, and taking account of the phrases &quot;in existing circumstances&quot; and &quot;in the context&quot;, would need to be proven.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_214">Although I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s principle about judicial scrutiny, the prospect of going to a judge in the middle of the night simply to obtain a notice that only prevents the company from taking advantage of the defence that it did not know is perhaps a little beyond the balance of judicial scrutiny appropriate in these circumstances. I ask him to think about that very carefully indeed&#151;I know that he does consider such matters properly and in detail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_215">I reiterate that the companies have not asked for judicial scrutiny, and they are content with the form of words that the Government have proposed and the procedure under which the police officers give the notice in the first place. The companies also want the process to be speedy, thus ensuring that it is as effective as possible. Our relationships and co-operation with internet service providers are extremely good. The companies are highly responsible, and they want to be involved in the fight against terrorism. They want to help us wherever they can. I would not be standing at the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Feb 2006 : Column 1489</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Dispatch Box making proposals that try to avoid being in direct contravention of the companies&#039; interests if that were not the case.
</p>





<p><a name="st_198"><a name="60215-24_spnew2"><b> Mr. Winnick </b> 
: This may not be a very helpful intervention, I am afraid. I believe that the Opposition much exaggerated the criticism about the glorification provision. I did not accept that criticism and voted with the Government, and I intend to do so again this time. May I tell my right hon. Friend, however, that one of dangers of coming into the Chamber is that we can be persuaded by the argument? It seems to me that the opinion of the constable is not really sufficient&#151;hence the reason why I said that this would not be a very helpful intervention. Despite my right hon. Friend&#039;s comments, some judicial oversight would be welcome. I shall not break with the Government on this issue, but I wish that they would consider it further.
</p>





<p><a name="st_199"><a name="60215-24_spnew3"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for his support on the other issues. I am not at all critical of the fact that he has just arrived in the Chamber&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_200"><a name="60215-24_spnew4"><b> Mr. Winnick: </b> 
 I was here earlier.
</p>





<p><a name="st_201"><a name="60215-24_spnew5"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 Indeed, I appreciate that, but if my hon. Friend had perhaps heard a little more of the debate, he would know that I am genuinely seeking to get the balance right between ensuring that we have an effective procedure that can tackle the kind of terrorist material that we see on the internet and trying to ensure that the service providers are not disadvantaged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_216">That is why I went into some detail about the level of qualifications that the officers who are engaged in this work will have. They will be accredited officers, properly trained and act as the single point of contact that currently exists in the anti-terrorism branch. They will not be simply any police constable. We are now working with the Crown Prosecution Service, the police and internet service providers on a proper protocol to ensure that the police officers who make such decisions are skilled, experienced and properly trained so that they have the specialist knowledge. I hope that this reassures my hon. Friend that the need to go to a judge in the middle of the night with such a notice is not the right level of judicial scrutiny in this process.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_217">I hope that I have been able to reassure hon. Members, but I am sure that I have not managed to persuade the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve). I genuinely believe that the Government&#039;s proposals will make the law effective and will ensure that we tackle the real problem of the use of the internet to draw young people particularly into terrorist activity. That is a widespread and growing problem, and I am absolutely determined that we will use every method at our disposal, through technology, legislation and our law enforcement forces, to make sure that we bear down on terrorism in this country and that we tackle the people who seek to use international means and technology to draw people into terrorism and to create 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Feb 2006 : Column 1490</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a climate that can increase the possibility of terrorist acts occurring in this country. Tackling such uses of the internet will be an extremely useful part of the range of the efforts that we take to reduce terrorism in this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_218">As I have said, I accept entirely that the provision may not eradicate the problem across the world, but that is no reason whatever for us not to do everything that we can in this country to make sure that we reduce the amount of information on terrorism and that we tackle the real danger of the use of the internet in promoting it. I therefore disagree with the amendments from the other place and&#151;

<a name="60215-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_227">The Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005&nbsp;was introduced last year in recognition of our need to be able to tackle the threat posed to national security by individuals whom we could neither prosecute nor deport. The Government&#039;s response to the Law Lords&#039; ruling on powers under part 4&nbsp;of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001&nbsp;was the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, which introduced control orders enabling tailored obligations to be placed on an individual to protect the public from the risk of terrorism. The Act came into force&#151;after, we recall, some fairly intense parliamentary scrutiny and debate&#151;on 11&nbsp;March 2005.

<p>
<a name="60215-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_228">The threat posed to the life of the nation by terrorism and the consequences of terrorism is a subject that has necessarily occupied this House on too many occasions. The tragic events of last July brought home to everyone the fact that this is a very real and continuing threat.

 I apologise for interrupting the Minister so soon. Does she agree, given the debates on control orders last year, that the Government would not have got the 2005&nbsp;Act on the statute book, were in danger of losing a Bill and saved it only by promising fresh legislation in spring 2006, when both Houses of Parliament could reconsider, from the base up, the principle of the Home Secretary having powers to deprive someone of or limit their liberty? Is not it a disgrace that that promise is reduced to one-and-a-half hours&#039; debate about an order on the eve of a recess, thus enabling the Government to retain powers that the vast majority of Members of Parliament in both Houses did not believe they should hold when they first sought them?
</p>





<p><a name="st_216"><a name="60215-27_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The right hon. and learned Gentleman is right to raise the undertakings that were given when the legislation was being considered. However, he, like all of us, knows that significant changes and events have occurred since that debate, not least the events of 7&nbsp;July, which interposed between our discussion of the original Bill and now. He also knows that we had a timetable for the Terrorism Bill, which we debated earlier, that it was accelerated through all-party agreement because of the events, and that it has been tackled more quickly than was originally envisaged.
</p>

<a name="stpa_229">The right hon. and learned Gentleman also knows that we wanted to reconsider control orders when we had had the opportunity to examine Lord Carlile&#039;s report.

<a name="60215-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_230">There has been cross-party agreement and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made a statement indicating that we would introduce draft legislation, which would be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny, to try to bring together much of our law on terrorism. That will provide an opportunity to reconsider the issues. That position is accepted by hon. Members of all parties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_231">The original undertakings have been affected by subsequent events. There will be an opportunity to reconsider control orders, but it is better to do that when they have been through their full cycle.

</p>





<p><a name="st_217"><a name="60215-27_spnew2"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland) (LD):</b> 
 Does the Minister accept that the reason for the long timetable for any consolidating Bill stems from the need for a definition of terrorism, on which my noble Friend Lord Carlile of Berriew is working? Does she also accept that that work would not apply to control orders and that we should deal with them in primary legislation earlier rather than later?
</p>





<p><a name="st_218"><a name="60215-27_spnew3"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes the important point that we have asked Lord Carlile, as the independent reviewer, to review the definition of terrorism. As he knows, there are some difficulties with that. The United Nations is considering a definition of terrorism, and it is not an easy matter to resolve. However, we should consider control orders in the overarching context of our counter-terrorism legislation. They are one of the tools that we can use, together with our law enforcement agencies and the legislation that we have passed this afternoon, to counter terrorism in this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_232">There is broad agreement that we should have pre-legislative scrutiny and take a good, long, cool, hard look at our counter-terrorism legislation to ensure that it is appropriate. I hope that the hon. Gentleman appreciates the sense of going through a full cycle of control orders before considering whether to make changes and amendments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_233">The UK Government must continue to tackle terrorism. As I said, control orders have a vital role to play alongside other existing powers and the new measures in the Terrorism Bill, which we debated earlier. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary set out in his statement to the House on 2&nbsp;February why he believed the powers were necessary and why we were seeking to renew them for a further 12&nbsp;months. Lord Carlile&#039;s report on the operation of the 2005&nbsp;Act was laid on the same day.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_234">Today&#039;s renewal debate takes place in accordance with section 13&nbsp;of the 2005&nbsp;Act. Section 13&nbsp;provides that the powers on control orders will automatically lapse after one year unless they are renewed by order subject to the affirmative resolution in both Houses of Parliament. I have dealt with the opportunity for legislative change and the time scale for that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_235">Prosecution is and will always remain the Government&#039;s preferred course of action in dealing with individuals suspected of terrorism and priority will continue to be given to prosecution. However, it is not always possible, for a variety of reasons. There might be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Feb 2006 : Column 1501</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>insufficient admissible evidence&#151;clearly there is a reliance on intelligence in some cases&#151;an overriding need to protect sensitive sources and/or techniques, and other reasons why a prosecution is not in the public interest.
</p>

<a name="60215-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_237">Does the Minister accept that that is unsatisfactory? What steps will the Home Office take to rectify the situation?
</p>





<p><a name="st_220"><a name="60215-27_spnew5"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 Lord Carlile makes a number of recommendations on how the position might be improved. He also makes recommendations on keeping the prohibitions under regular review. We agree with him in regard to both those recommendations. The principle behind his recommendation on providing more information is absolutely sound. We should have as much information as possible about why a prosecution is not possible, but in some cases the information is based on intelligence and we have to take into account the operational implications when determining how much information can be put forward, particularly if it is to be disclosable in proceedings. Lord Carlile also makes reference to that. So, although it is a sound recommendation in principle, we want to take a little more time to consider the operational implications for the cases involved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_238">Deportation is also an option for foreign nationals, as removal can provide an alternative means of disrupting their activity and reducing the threat to national security. Again, however, this is not always possible, although we have made considerable progress in agreeing memorandums of understanding with a number of countries, which will provide a means by which individuals can safely be returned to their countries of origin.

 We have signed memorandums of understanding with three countries. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the exact number of individuals involved. I am sure that he will understand that these are complex, difficult and sensitive arrangements, but we are determined to continue our negotiations with a range of other countries, to determine whether we can agree memorandums of understanding with them. I was pleased that Lord Carlile&#039;s report stated that the memorandums of understanding were appropriate in the context of deportation.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_240">I am pleased that Lord Carlile believes that our attempts in this difficult area are worth pursuing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_241">The Terrorism Bill that is now before Parliament will introduce some new offences, including the offence of acts preparatory to terrorism, but there will remain a comparatively small number of cases in which we are unable to prosecute but in which individuals pose a very real terrorist threat. In such circumstances, it is vital that the Government and the law enforcement agencies are able to act to reduce the risk that such individuals pose. Again, Lord Carlile has provided support for this view. His report states, in paragraph 61:
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_242">
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;As a last resort (only), in my view the control order system as operated currently in its non-derogating form is a justifiable and proportional safety valve for the proper protection of civil society.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_243">Lord Carlile has clearly thought deeply about these issues, and come to that conclusion. I would like to thank him for the way in which he has conducted his analysis of the information he has seen. As he said in the introduction to the report, he has attempted to give a proper technical analysis of the operation of the Act, but he has tried to do it in a way that is accessible to the lay reader. Technical reports often do not have those characteristics, but Lord Carlile&#039;s report genuinely strikes the right balance between good operational information and accessibility. I would also like to thank the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which has produced a very informative report and a detailed reflection of the legislation and its operation. Both reports will be invaluable in informing the House in our consideration of these important issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_244">I shall turn now to the working of control order powers. Sections 1&nbsp;to 9&nbsp;of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005&nbsp;provide for the making of control orders. Control orders are preventive orders that enable one or more obligations to be placed on individuals that are designed to prevent, restrict or disrupt their involvement in terrorism-related activity. They can be applied to any individual, whether a UK or foreign national, when the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the individual is or has been involved in terrorist activity and considers that it is necessary for the purposes of protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism. The grounds that must be set out before an order can be made therefore have two limbs&#151;that an individual is involved in terrorism and that it is necessary to make an order to protect the public. The obligations that can be set out in the order should be tailored to tackle particular terrorism activities on a case-by-case basis. Any breach of those obligations in a control order without reasonable excuse is a criminal offence punishable with a prison sentence of up to five years and/or an unlimited fine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_245">The Act makes provision for two types of order: derogating control orders and non-derogating control orders. The distinction between the two is that a derogation would be required if the obligations, individually or in total, amounted to a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of article 5&nbsp;of the European convention on human rights. We have not sought to make any derogating control orders. At this stage, we have simply made non-derogating control orders. The Secretary of State must apply to the court for permission to make an order. Under the Act, in a case of urgency, the Secretary of State himself can make the order, but 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Feb 2006 : Column 1503</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that must be referred immediately to the court, which must start considering that case within seven days. The judicial scrutiny is therefore pretty intense, arising from many of our discussions when the provisions were first considered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_246">Once the control order is made, an automatic review process is triggered. That judicial review of the Secretary of State&#039;s decision provides independent judicial scrutiny. When we considered this legislation previously, the question whether judicial review provided robust examination was debated. Lord Carlile, in paragraph 67&nbsp;of his report, says that, in his view, judicial review is a robust jurisdiction, and points out that the way in which judicial review has developed means that the courts take a close and rigorous interest in such issues.
</p>





<p><a name="st_223"><a name="60215-28_spnew2"><b> Mr. Kenneth Clarke: </b> 
 The Minister is giving an extraordinary description of what she makes sound like a robust judicial process, which was at the heart of the reluctance of both Houses of Parliament to let the Government have the Bill 12&nbsp;months ago. Will she confirm that, throughout the process, the Secretary of State has to have only reasonable suspicion that he has got the right person and that that person is involved in terrorism, and that a court can set aside what the Secretary of State does only if the judge is satisfied that the Secretary of State&#039;s decision is seriously flawed? Therefore, as long as the Secretary of State can say that he has reasonable suspicions and grounds to suspect that someone is involved in terrorism, there is little that the court can do.
</p>





<p><a name="st_224"><a name="60215-28_spnew3"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 I am aware that the right hon. and learned Gentleman has extensive legal experience, and he will know, as I do, that the courts take their responsibilities on judicial review extremely seriously. We had a long debate on what the appropriate standard of proof should be. For non-derogating orders, we decided that it should be reasonable suspicion. Were there to be derogating orders, we decided that it should be on a balance of probabilities, because the standard of proof should be higher. That was debated at great length in both Houses of Parliament, and the legislation was passed on the basis of that standard of proof. As he will know, the courts will need to consider whether the Secretary of State acted reasonably in coming to his conclusion, whether he took into account all relevant considerations, and whether he excluded all irrelevant considerations. He will also know that judicial review is no rubber-stamp process and entails rigorous consideration by the courts. Indeed, Lord Carlile expresses that view from an independent standpoint.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_247">Once a control order is made, the automatic review process is triggered. Control orders have a maximum duration of 12&nbsp;months, and can then be renewed by the Secretary of State. After 12&nbsp;months, however, a separate right of appeal is provided, which is another safeguard. An individual can also make an appeal for an order to be revoked or an obligation to be modified when there is a change in circumstance. Again, a separate right of appeal is provided when the obligations are varied&#151;another safeguard built into the system. I therefore feel that the Act provides full judicial oversight and proper rights of appeal.

<a name="60215-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_248">In addition to those individual rights, there are reviewing and reporting requirements, including an independent review by Lord Carlile and the report that the Secretary of State must bring to Parliament every three months&#151;which he has done on three occasions so far, I think&#151;on his exercise of the powers, giving information such as how many orders have been made. The system contains robust safeguards, subject to reporting requirements and independent oversight. A delicate balance must be struck between safeguarding society and safeguarding the rights of the individual, and I think that the 2005&nbsp;Act strikes that balance.
</p>





<p><a name="st_225"><a name="60215-28_spnew4"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 The Minister will know that the report from the Joint Committee on Human Rights focuses on the human rights of the families of individuals affected by control orders. It speaks of the unjustifiable interference that often takes place, the severe impact that it has on the human rights of those family members&#151;rights to family life, freedom of association and freedom of expression&#151;and the mental suffering and anguish to which they are often subject. What rights will those family members have in respect of the establishment of a more satisfactory regime?
</p>





<p><a name="st_226"><a name="60215-28_spnew5"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The Secretary of State considers the impact on family rights before making a control order. He has information about those important issues. Representatives of families have raised them with the courts, and they can be considered by the courts when each case is automatically reviewed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_249">Family rights are important, but they are part of that delicate balance between safeguarding the rights of the individual and safeguarding the rights and security of the wider community. I understand the implications for families, but we are dealing with people who are deemed to be a threat to national security, who cannot be prosecuted or deported but whose activities need to be controlled to protect the security of the nation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_250">The renewal debates here and in the other place are a further requirement of the Act. Affirmative resolution is required in both Houses of Parliament.

<p>
<a name="60215-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_251">Lord Carlile made recommendations for improvement in the operation of the control order regime, including a procedure to monitor closely the necessity and proportionality of control order obligations and fuller information from the Government on why a prosecution cannot replace a control order. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has welcomed the recommendations. He has said that he will need to consider them after consulting the Intelligence Services Commissioner and the director general of the Security Service, as required by the Act.

<p><a name="st_229"><a name="60215-29_spnew2"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 I am most grateful to the Minister for giving way. Given events in America, Madrid, Bali and elsewhere, her saying that we engaged in a theoretical debate on this issue is extraordinary. Surely she remembers what happened to this country at the hands of the Irish Republican Army, and she has seen what other terrorist groups have done to other countries. This is no theoretical debate.
</p>





<p><a name="st_230"><a name="60215-29_spnew3"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 No, it is not, but the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that, in discussing control orders, the tenor of the debate in some quarters was to underplay the threat. Many people in the House did not recognise to the extent that he clearly does the real and ever-present terrorist threat. I am on record as saying that it is indeed a real and serious threat following events not just in America but throughout the world in the past decade, during which time many countries have been attacked. The point that I was making was that in some quarters the reality of the threat was perhaps not recognised; that threat has now been put beyond any doubt.
</p>





<p><a name="st_231"><a name="60215-29_spnew4"><b> Mr. Kenneth Clarke: </b> 
 With the greatest respect, the right hon. Lady is totally misrepresenting the atmosphere that surrounded the introduction of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. I recall saying that I expected major terrorist outrages to be committed in this country in time

<br>&nbsp;<br>to come, and that there was no way of guaranteeing that we could prevent them. Sadly, I&#151;along with the right hon. Lady&#151;was proved right on 7&nbsp;July. The argument was whether the best way to protect ourselves against terrorism was to leave aside the normal principles of the rule of law and to give rise to the possibility, sooner or later, of cases of gross injustice by giving the Secretary of State the right to deprive someone of their liberty, and by denying them the chance of defence or of proper judicial review. That remains an issue, to which the Government promised they would one day return.
</p>





<p><a name="st_232"><a name="60215-29_spnew5"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The right hon. and learned Gentleman will have noticed that I chose my words carefully. I used the phrase &quot;in some quarters&quot;, and in doing so I was not including him. However, it is undeniable that some people were not seized of the real and serious nature of the terrorist threat.

<p>
<a name="60215-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_260">Reference has been made to miscarriages of justice, and I refer Members to Lord Carlile&#039;s report, in which he points out that although he regards control orders as a last resort, he also considers them a proper, justifiable and proportionate way of proceeding. He had access to all the papers, cases and information on which the Secretary of State based his decisions. He says that he would have reached the same conclusions, but that that does not necessarily mean that those conclusions were correct. That is why it is important that judicial consideration be given to all such cases, and that there is a series of checks, balances and safeguards to ensure that we get the balance right between individual rights and the security of the nation. That is a very difficult balance to strike, but everything that I and the Government have done has been aimed at ensuring that we strike that balance in the right way and preserve the essential freedoms that are so precious to us, while at the same time ensuring that we bear down in the best way that we can on those who would commit terrorist atrocities against this country.

In the early part of 2007, we will introduce draft legislation, which will be subject to proper pre-legislative scrutiny. We will try to achieve as much consensus as we can in getting our counter-terrorism law right and making it as robust and fair as possible. Such legislation is in the interests of this nation, and I am sure that all parties will take a very active part in scrutinising it and making sure that the powers are properly framed and used.

This time last year, that was definitely a cause for concern and I, for one, was not convinced that the Government would give the right level of scrutiny to a measure with which I disagreed. However, Lord Carlile has said that the scrutiny has been appropriate, and we should acknowledge that the Home Secretary has done his job to the extent that Lord Carlile is happy to congratulate him.

<a name="stpa_268">The Minister said that several hundred people were out there, but the fact is that a maximum of 18&nbsp;individuals have been placed under control orders.

Secondly, he said that we must ensure that the police reach clear conclusions that the evidence needed to prosecute individual controlees is not available. The report supports the Government&#039;s case for control orders, at least in the short term, but Lord Carlile told the Home Affairs Committee yesterday that 20&nbsp;imams were trying to recruit in prisons and universities.

 I did not get the impression from Lord Carlile that the people concerned were actually committing a crime as such, but their sermons are undesirable, to say the least.

<a name="stpa_271">I turn to the practical working of control orders. I wonder whether the limited surveillance resources that we have allow control orders to be exercised properly.

<a name="stpa_272">That question leads me to speculate about the limited number of infringements of control orders.

I appreciate that I may be treading on ground of which the Minister is not necessarily aware in great detail, but I would be grateful if she would reply, verbally or in writing.

That is the point that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe made earlier.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_274">Secondly, the Joint Committee asked whether procedural protections are compatible with article 5.4&nbsp;of the ECHR and the right to a fair trial in determination of a criminal charge and to a fair hearing in the determination of civil rights under article 6.1. Thirdly, it asked whether controlees are being subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment, contrary to article 3&nbsp;of the ECHR. Fourthly, the Joint Committee wondered whether the control order regime has a disproportionate impact on the rights of family members&#151;we have already heard about that particular proviso&#151;under articles 8, 10&nbsp;and 11. Lastly, it asked whether the control order regime is being applied disproportionately to foreign nationals in breach of article 14&nbsp;of the ECHR. Those are serious charges against the control order regime and I would be interested to hear how sure the Government are that they could survive a challenge in the courts on whether they are able to derogate from those aspects of the ECHR, or whether they would get egg on their face. Again, if the Minister can give me some reason to feel confident about that it would reassure me.

<a name="stpa_276">In a speech on 2&nbsp;February, the Home Secretary referred to the Government&#039;s attempts to find a legal model to provide the necessary safeguards to allow intercept material to be used as evidence in court. That will allow us further to minimise the use of control orders and, I trust, to get rid of them completely in due course. My experience of the use of intercept makes me aware that we must be extremely careful to defend technology, techniques and sources. Of course, my experience of those techniques is about 10&nbsp;years out of date and I have no doubt that both time and technology have moved on, but if intercept evidence is admissible in court, we shall be able to obtain more prosecutions and fewer people will be held under control orders, so I welcome what the Home Secretary said about it. Any further light that the Minister can throw on the matter will be welcome.

 First, I acknowledge the contribution made in preparation for the debate in the report by my noble and learned Friend Lord Carlile of Berriew and in the trenchant report issued yesterday by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Both take a careful and detailed look at the subject. The tone of the two reports is not necessarily immediately compatible, but it is clear on a close reading that their conclusions have a great deal in common, even though they may not be expressed with the same force.

<a name="stpa_281">It is worth reminding the House of the parliamentary history that has brought us to where we are today. On 16&nbsp;December 2004, the House of Lords ruled that the detention of the nine foreign nationals held at Her Majesty&#039;s Prison Belmarsh was incompatible with the European convention on human rights. The powers created by the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001&nbsp;were found to be in breach of ECHR on two counts. First, they only offered the possibility of indefinite detention where lesser restrictions on liberty could have been more proportionate. Secondly, they were discriminatory by reason of the fact that they applied only to foreign nationals. Either the detainees would be released, or new and proportionate restrictions had to be devised in the space of a few weeks.

<a name="stpa_283">We had serious reservations on two points, however. We believed that the standard of proof required for the Secretary of State to sign a non-derogating control order was too low and that the standard of proof should have been raised to that of whether an offence had occurred on the balance of probabilities.

<a name="stpa_288">The Committee, however, reserves its strongest criticism for the way in which the various restrictions on liberty available to the Home Secretary in designing a control order have been used.

We were given to understand that that meant 24-hour house arrest, but that a vote of Parliament would be necessary to approve a formal derogation of the sort that was required by the Belmarsh legislation. The Act, however, neglected to set out any criteria for determining the dividing line between the control orders that would require a derogation and those that would not. This is a question that will ultimately be tested in the courts. In the meantime, can the Minister tell me where she thinks the line lies? What legal advice has she received and how sure can she be that the pro forma list of restrictions that was reproduced in Lord Carlile&#039;s report does not cross that threshold?

The Minister may not be able to answer that question tonight, but I suggest that it is something that the Home Secretary should inform the House about.

When one sees conditions framed in such terms, one can certainly understand why. Why are not more neutral phrases used, such as &quot;place of worship&quot;, instead of &quot;mosque&quot;? Do not the documents lend credence to those in the community who argue that the Government&#039;s anti-terrorism powers are used disproportionately against Muslims? Will such an approach build the inter-community harmony on which the Government put so much stress?

In the closing debate on the Prevention of Terrorism Bill, the Home Secretary produced a timetable for further legislation that would have given the House the opportunity to consider in detail and change the control orders regime. A commitment was given to produce a draft Bill in the late autumn of 2005&nbsp;and introduce a substantive counter-terrorism Bill in spring 2006. The events of 7&nbsp;July led to renegotiation among the three main parties. It was agreed that control orders would be decoupled from other new offences and considered in a separate Bill in the early part of 2006.

<a name="60215-30_para44">
<a name="stpa_315">The Home Secretary indicated in his statement on 2&nbsp;February that he favoured a further rethink, with draft legislation produced in spring 2007, followed by a Bill that would almost certainly be carried over into the next Session. I have no difficulty with the concept that a consolidating Bill is necessary. Such a Bill is inevitable because of the extremely rushed way in which we deal with much of the terrorism legislation that comes before the House. It is almost certainly inevitable as a result of the way in which the Government use programme motions, which mean that Bills do not receive proper scrutiny. The principal reason given for the time scale 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>was the fact that the various reviews on the definition of terrorism needed to be concluded, but the definition is not central to the operation of control orders, although it is central to other measures, such as those in the Terrorism Bill.

 My hon. Friend is making important points. The events of July may have given the Government room to drop back from their earlier timetable&#151;he was right to point out that that has happened&#151;but the Government asked Lord Carlile to review the definition of terrorism to avoid conflict on another matter and the process is not the sort of force majeure that should allow the timetable on control orders to move.

Although the renewal of the powers is deeply unsatisfactory, we shall not oppose the order, for the simple reason that we believe that there should be a credible alternative on the statute book before we take that step. However, if the Terrorism Bill is passed by Parliament, that will change. The new offences of acts preparatory to terrorism and encouragement to terrorism are designed to plug gaps in the law and should have a major impact in the area that we are discussing tonight, and by the end of the year we shall have a good idea of how those powers are working.

<a name="stpa_322">Let me remind the House of the circumstances in which the 2005&nbsp;Act was passed, which gave rise to the need for the order before the House tonight. The Government were in a state of acute crisis when they produced that legislation and they came within a whisker of losing the entire Bill because they could not persuade the House of Lords, certainly, and a substantial body of opinion in this House that they were entitled to have control orders in the form that they preferred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_323">The legislation aroused great public concern&#151;it was the dominant political issue of the day. There was a great crisis, with the Prime Minister&#039;s views on how Parliament should be handled and how the matter should be resolved clearly in conflict with the views of his then new Home Secretary. The public were aware that, for the first time, the Government were proposing that someone in this country should be deprived of their liberty, or have substantial constraints put on their liberty, on the order of a politician&#151;the Secretary of State&#151;and not of a judge. It was a dramatic change to all our traditions. I am not criticising the Home Secretary, who is a distinguished holder of his post and whom I hold in regard, but a fundamental principle was being changed in the proposal that a politician, not a judge, should be able to deprive a person of their liberty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_324">On the question whether there would be any judicial review the Government resisted even the involvement of a judge, and a modest system was then put in place. Finally, there was tremendous debate in both Houses about the standards that were set for the Secretary of State before he could use his powers. The Bill, alas, was eventually accepted on the basis that under non-derogating orders it was necessary only for the Secretary of State to have reasonable suspicion of someone who was subject to those orders. There was no requirement that he should be certain that he had the right person and there was no balance of probabilities to assess whether someone was probably responsible or had threatened to do things of concern. It was merely sufficient for the Secretary of State to have reasonable suspicion about someone and for the threat to be so grave that the powers should be used.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_325">That was the nature of the crisis facing the Government. I do not believe that the Bill would have survived the process to which we give the absurd name

The procedure was rushed, as the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) reminded us&#151;proceedings on the Bill took two and a half weeks from start to finish, and it was drastically rewritten&#151;and we were promised a repeat of the legislative process in spring 2006&nbsp;in which the principle of control orders and many other things in the measure could be addressed. That undertaking has not been honoured.

<a name="stpa_326">There is all-party agreement because of the arguments about 7&nbsp;July which, I am afraid, did not change anything. It was exactly the kind of thing that we had discussed, arguing about how best we could defend ourselves against such an eventuality. May I suggest to Opposition spokesmen that the constant allegations that we are soft on terrorism may have begun to have an effect if they result in our raising these important matters? Everyone retreated&#151;it is no good one or two hon. Members saying that we should have held the Government to the spring 2006&nbsp;arrangement and that we should have had a proper Bill and a proper debate. Instead, we have the order, which was trailed during those debates. Some people including, I believe, myself&#151;I am not sure, as I have not read the debate recently&#151;predicted that the offer of renewal within 12&nbsp;months and early legislation would be reduced to a routine debate in which only a few Members would participate and in which the motion would go through on the nod. Twelve months ago, both Houses were full of hundreds of Members consumed with passion for the great issue of civil liberty, saying that the Government of the day should not have their way unless we were satisfied that a British citizen&#039;s fundamental rights were safe. The number of Members in the Chamber today scarcely reaches double figures, and the debate, which is restricted to an hour and a half, is being held on the eve of a recess. The vast majority of hon.

If we are not careful, we are in danger of the tremendous near-constitutional crises of 12&nbsp;months ago being reduced to renewal orders such as this 12&nbsp;months later and steadily becoming part of the routine background of politics and our law, where what we all thought were great principles 12&nbsp;months ago are regarded as silly and fuddy-duddy and will never again be revisited.

Because of the rushed Bill 12&nbsp;months ago and because of today&#039;s debate, neither House has ever had a chance to consider properly and at length the principles of control orders and of whether a politician should be allowed to deprive someone of his liberty without a trial and without that person having any opportunity of knowing exactly what is the basis of the charges that are being made against him.

 The hon. Gentleman may recall that I was very concerned about control orders in the first place, but perhaps for somewhat different reasons from those of the hon. Gentleman, who speaks eloquently on these matters, and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe. Does he agree we should insist upon habeas corpus, a fair trial, and due process within the terms of our own legislation instead of getting caught up in the tortuous attempts to provide for compliance with the European convention on human rights, which creates more problems than it solves?
</p>





<p><a name="st_246"><a name="60215-32_spnew2"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 I made my position clear in the previous debate. I believe that, as the hon. Gentleman says, we should apply habeas corpus and have due process of law. If the Government wanted to propose alterations to those processes, they should have done so swiftly with primary legislation and a thorough debate. We had a debate about the enactment of control orders and the promise of an opportunity of primary legislation, that would be fully debated in this House within a limited period of time. That has not occurred and has yet again been put off.

 I will do my best to respond to the remarks that Members have made. Although, as has been said, the House is not particularly full, that did not undermine the quality of the contributions that they made to the debate on these very important matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_354">I am grateful to the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) for recognising that the Home Secretary has considered all these cases in detail and in depth, personally making the decisions and looking at the intelligence and information. Lord Carlile confirms that the Home Secretary has fulfilled his duties in a very responsible manner. I am also grateful to the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) for his comments about the Home Secretary&#039;s approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_355">We regard these matters as extremely serious and important because they inevitably involve constraints that are put upon people to limit their freedom of action. They are certainly not taken lightly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-32_para16">
<a name="stpa_356">The hon. Member for Newark raised some practical issues about the surveillance resources made available to the police and the security service to allow them to monitor control orders. He will have heard me say on previous occasions that we have substantially improved the resources available to the police, special branch and the Security Service. There have been dramatic increases in the numbers of people working in those services, and we are confident that there are sufficient resources for the control order regime, as it currently operates, to run effectively. I cannot go into any further detail than that&#151;I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not expect me to&#151;but there are certainly enough resources in place to ensure proper monitoring of the conditions that have been imposed on people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-32_para17">
<a name="stpa_357">The hon. Member for Newark, among others, raised issues that were highlighted in the report by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Let me go through some of those briefly, as I cannot give an in-depth analysis in the time available. Members asked about non-derogating control orders being operated in a way that amounts to a deprivation of liberty. The orders were considered by the court and made with the permission of the court, which did not consider that they amounted to derogating control orders. None of the people concerned, all of whom are legally represented, has made a legal challenge to say that the prohibitions placed upon them are such that in total they would amount to a derogating order.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-32_para18">
<a name="stpa_358">There has been no legal challenge to that effect. Lord Carlile says that the prohibitions are restrictive in some cases, but he does not believe that they fulfil the definition of deprivation of liberty, although they approach the cusp of that. Those are his words and he clearly takes a careful view. The fact that the orders have not been challenged is important because it is always open to those subject to them to make such a challenge.

<p>
<a name="60215-32_para19">
<a name="stpa_359">The compatibility of the procedural protections with the provisions of the European convention on human rights has been questioned. It is important to stress that we do not accept that control order proceedings amount to a criminal charge, which engages all the rights that pertain to a trial situation. We are considering an application for a civil order and the proceedings are regulated by civil rules of procedure. As I have said, it involves a two-stage test. First, is there a reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in terrorism? If so&#151;the second test&#151;is it necessary to make the order to protect the public from whatever action the person might commit? There is therefore a range of civil procedure regulations for making control orders. I am not convinced at this stage that the view of the Joint Committee on Human Rights constitutes the right approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-32_para20">
<a name="stpa_360">Hon. Members asked whether the subjects of control orders suffered inhuman and degrading treatment. We do not accept that to be the case. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture has visited the UK and it will report on some issues in March. Our view is that the prohibitions do not constitute inhuman and degrading treatment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-32_para21">
<a name="stpa_361">My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) asked about the families of those subject to control orders. Those are serious questions and we are trying to get the balance right&#151;Lord Carlile said that proportionality was key. He is satisfied that, as a last resort, control orders are a proportionate &quot;safety valve&quot;, as he put it, to protect the public. Lord Carlile had access to all the information and intelligence and he said that he would have made the same decisions as the Home Secretary. With great respect, Liberty has not had access to that information and intelligence. It cannot therefore strike the balance between prohibitions on a person who is involved in terrorism and for whom it is necessary to make an order and the rights of the family. One has to see the situation in the round, with access to the information about how dangerous the individual may be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-32_para22">
<a name="stpa_362">We are considering circumstances in which there are fairly dangerous people whom one cannot prosecute for various reasons, or deport. We therefore have control orders. The alternative is no prohibitions or restrictions on them and allowing them to walk the streets in freedom. I am sure that many people would be seriously worried about that.

 Is my right hon. Friend aware that the Joint Committee on Human Rights met on Monday and that it divided on several paragraphs in the report? I draw that to hon.

<p><a name="st_250"><a name="60215-33_spnew2"><b> Dr. Evan Harris </b> 
: On the court judgment that the control orders do not require derogation, I draw the Minister&#039;s attention to the paragraph in the Joint Committee report that points out that the obligations by themselves may not amount to a deprivation of liberty but that they may be combined with other obligations. Lord Carlile drew attention to the fact that duration, which is not known at the outset, and all the specifics of a case may have a bearing on whether it amounts to a deprivation of liberty, which would require article 5&nbsp;derogation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_251"><a name="60215-33_spnew3"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 I have made the point that none of the orders has been subject to challenge. I take the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about the totality of the restrictions, and I shall come to the length of the orders in a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_363">On the question of discrimination, we reject the possibility of the orders being applied disproportionately to foreign nationals. Control orders are made on the basis of risk, not of nationality. Indeed, there is a control order in place on a UK citizen at the moment. The orders last for only 12&nbsp;months, and have to be reviewed and renewed after that period. All the circumstances have to be looked at afresh. It is possible that, after an order has been in place for a year, the danger that was posed by an individual might have decreased&#151;in regard to their contact with other individuals, for example&#151;but all those issues would have to be examined. Lord Carlile expressed a genuine concern that orders should not remain in place for years and years, but they can be reviewed after 12&nbsp;months.

<a name="stpa_364">The hon. Member for Newark mentioned memorandums of understanding and asked what would happen if no memorandum were agreed. I can assure him that we detain people pending deportation only if we are satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of their being deported. That is why we are so keen to work on getting the memorandums of understanding in place as quickly as possible. We have had some success, and we are continuing to work on that.

<a name="stpa_365">The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) mentioned the standard of proof. We have debated that issue at length, and the House decided on an appropriate standard. He asked whether the obligations passed the threshold. We sought the permission of the court in relation to the orders containing more stringent conditions, and the court did not think that they amounted to derogating orders. He also mentioned the pro forma that contained a prohibition on attending a mosque. I am informed that that is simply an example from an individual case, and that it is not a pro forma that applies to everyone. These obligations are tailored to the individual concerned. They do not pick out people from a particular faith or community.

During the Russian repression, samizdat literature was an early sign that things were breaking up; nowadays the internet gives activists the necessary oxygen of publicity, which is being clamped down on in China.

<a name="60215-35_para20">
<a name="stpa_433">Over the past 25&nbsp;years the Chinese Government have done an enormous amount to reduce poverty levels within China and to promote economic development. Impressive growth rates fuelled by a strong trade performance have enabled the country to take about a third of a billion people out of poverty. The World Bank estimates that in the 1980s and 1990s, China was responsible for 75&nbsp;per cent. of poverty reduction in the developing world. The 11th five-year plan, which is expected to be approved at the forthcoming session of the National People&#039;s Congress, aims through harmonious development to reduce further the number of Chinese people living in poverty.

<a name="stpa_434">As so often when talking about China, the numbers can be difficult to digest, but it is clear that the scale of transformation taking place in China is unprecedented and will have a global impact. We should not forget that China experienced great turmoil in the last century. War and famine have left a deep impression, so it is not surprising that many Chinese people focus on the right to an adequate standard of living, as set out in article 25&nbsp;of the universal declaration of human rights. The Chinese Government know that their citizens are judging them on their ability to continue to deliver economic well-being.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-35_para22">
<a name="stpa_435">Economic growth has been accompanied by fundamental changes in Chinese society and a growing appreciation by individuals of their rights. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire that a great deal of change has occurred. Since the economic reforms began, there has been more freedom to move around China and to travel outside the country. Chinese citizens no longer need official permission to marry or divorce. There have also been welcome moves to develop the rule of law and some engagement with international institutions and foreign Governments on human rights issues. China ratified the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights in 2001. It also welcomed a visit by the UN working group on arbitrary detention in September 2004, and a visit by the UN special rapporteur on torture in November 2005.

<a name="60215-35_para24">
<a name="stpa_437">But for all the progress China has made, we continue to have a wide range of serious human rights concerns.

North Korea has an even worse regime than China, and we know that many of those people face all sorts of problems when they go back to North Korea.

<p><a name="st_277"><a name="60215-36_spnew1"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend knows that we raise those issues directly with the Chinese authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_441">Obviously, we are not the only country that is concerned about the human rights situation in China. We encourage others, particularly our EU partners, to pursue a similar policy of critical engagement to help improve the situation. China is re-emerging on to the world stage and is taking an increasingly proactive role in international affairs, while rapidly becoming a global economic power.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_442">The UK wants a stable, predictable Chinese state to play its hand in world affairs responsibly and in accordance with international rules. That will enable everyone&#151;whether Chinese, European or from another region or country&#151;to benefit from the process of globalisation. It is clearly in the UK&#039;s interests to have a relationship with China on a number of levels and in a range of areas. We hope that, through our engagement, we can have an open exchange on how we and China view the international system and can both play a positive role in it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_443">I should like to add a word about how trade figures in our relationship with China. Strong trade and investment links are essential in building relationships 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Feb 2006 : Column 1533</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>between countries, and both the UK and China benefit enormously from two-way trade. Isolationism is unhelpful. The British Government and others were rightly keen to see China join the World Trade Organisation, and China&#039;s WTO membership is good for the world trading system. However, there is no question of a trade-off between human rights and trade in our dealings with China. In our view, it is perfectly legitimate for the Government to support British exporters who are involved in the Chinese market, but such support is not at the expense of a robust approach on human rights.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_444">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the recent press coverage about the decision of Google to co-operate with the Chinese censors and, a few months ago, many non-governmental organisations expressed concern about the decision of Yahoo to share details of a journalist&#039;s user account with the authorities. The journalist, Shi Tao, to whom the hon. Gentleman referred, was subsequently sentenced to 10&nbsp;years in prison. It is a matter for Google, Yahoo and other internet companies to answer questions about their decisions to co-operate with the Chinese Government on internet restrictions. However, I would like to make it clear that the UK Government are very disappointed that the Chinese Government are taking such a hard line on limiting freedom of expression and information. We believe that both are essential to the development of a modern, stable and sustainable society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_445">We have raised our concerns about the course that the Chinese Government are pursuing. We made freedom of expression a theme of our bilateral human rights dialogue with China in June 2005. We led a series of EU petitions during our presidency on a number of freedom-of-expression cases of concern to the EU, including the case of Shi Tao. We were pleased that one of the prisoners, Jiang Weiping was released early from prison in January this year. We have also, of course, regularly raised at high levels the jamming of the BBC World Service in Mandarin and the blocking of the BBC Mandarin language website.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_446">I should also like to respond to the hon. Gentleman on China&#039;s one-child policy. The UK Government have never questioned China&#039;s right or need to implement family planning policies, but we have made it clear that we believe such policies should be based on the principles of the international conference on population and development&#151;that is on consent, not coercion.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Feb 2006 : Column 1534</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_447">We have noted recent developments in China that outlaw any coercion in the course of family planning activities. We have raised concerns about reports of enforced sterilisation and abortion and expressed concern about the treatment of activists protesting about this policy. We did so most recently in the case of Chen Guangcheng, a lawyer who has campaigned about abuses of the one-child policy in Shandong, and we led three EU petitions on his case during our presidency, the most recent being on 29&nbsp;December.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_448">Let me briefly consider our concerns about the freedom to practice religious belief in China. We have serious concerns about the treatment of Christians who are not members of state-sanctioned religious organisations. We are equally concerned about the ongoing political education campaign in Tibetan monasteries and the way that China implements policies on religious belief in Xinjiang. At the initiative of the UK, freedom to practice religious belief was a focus of the most recent EU-China human rights dialogue held in Beijing in October 2005.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_449">Our specific concerns about the way the Chinese authorities view religion and try to control it are well documented, and I spoke about the situation of religious believers in China at some length during a parliamentary debate in July last year. In view of the time, let me just add today that our exchanges at the EU dialogue confirmed our views about the severe restrictions in place in China. We urged the Chinese Government to review their policies on religion as they are certainly not in keeping with the provisions of international legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60215-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_450">In conclusion, I want to assure the hon. Gentleman and the House that the UK Government will continue to do all that they can to encourage improvements in the human rights situation in China. The Department for International Development remains engaged on poverty alleviation; the Department for Constitutional Affairs is supporting schemes to train Chinese lawyers and judges; and the Foreign Office will continue to engage robustly on human rights issues of concern. We will advocate change through our embassy in Beijing, through our regular UK-China human rights dialogue and through our project work. I assure the House that Ministers will continue to raise specific human rights issues with our Chinese counterparts at every appropriate opportunity.
