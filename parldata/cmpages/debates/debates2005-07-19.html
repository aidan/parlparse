 Political violence in Algeria has decreased significantly since the 1990s, and few incidents have been reported in major cities, including Algiers, within the past two to three years.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50719-01_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  (Mr. Jack Straw): </b> 
 The Thessaloniki summit in 2003 offered western Balkan countries the prospect of eventual membership of the EU, if they fulfilled certain political and economic conditions, including co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. The June 2005 European Council reaffirmed that position. The future of the western Balkans lies in the European Union, which is the best guarantee of a peaceful and democratic future for the region, by contrast with its history of ethnic bloodshed and conflict.

<a name="stpa_0">We all want to see negotiations with Croatia that lead to full membership of the European Union, beginning as soon as possible.

So far, sadly, such co-operation has not been adequate.

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="50719-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 The same point applies to Serbia and Montenegro, and to all the territories that were formerly part of the Republic of Yugoslavia. We see their future inside the European Union, but that must be on the basis of full co-operation with the tribunal in The Hague and on other matters. Serbia and Montenegro is at an earlier stage than Croatia. It is looking forward to agreeing a stabilisation and assistance arrangement with the EU, but that, too, depends on full co-operation and, in particular, on the delivery of Mladic and Karadzic.

 (Lab): My right hon. Friend&#039;s words, particularly in respect of Serbia, are very important. It is absolutely clear that Serbia&#039;s long-term destination is within the European Union. Will he make it clear to the population of Serbia that the people who betray the Serbs and, indeed, the Montenegrins, are not western European politicians, who do not have it in for that country, but those in Serbia who will protect Karadzic and Mladic and want to keep Serbia isolated for their own narrow and corrupt purposes?

</p>





<p><a name="st_16"><a name="50719-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 In our bilateral relations, the name that we recognise is the Republic of Macedonia. The difficulty in international forums is that because of a longstanding historical dispute between Macedonia and Greece the name that is recognised is that of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Discussions are taking place between Macedonia and Greece, and once those are resolved, the name issue will be resolved. This is a further indication of the tortured past that haunts the present in the Balkans.

 I look forward to such an invitation.

I want to express the sincerest sympathy and sadness that we all feel at a such tragic loss of life. It is especially devastating for one family to suffer a death and five injuries.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his question. Even during the past couple of days, which I have spent in Brussels, I have been pressing our case, notwithstanding the fact that agreement could not be reached on the future financial perspective at the European Council last month, and I am glad to announce that the Council reiterated the position of the previous Council in December, in regard to the intention to open accession talks with Turkey on 3 October, during the British presidency. Of course, significant progress has still to be made by the Turks in relation to the Copenhagen protocols, but many would agree that the Kurds and other minority groups in Turkey have a great deal to gain from the process of reform and democratisation that has being taken forward apace by the Turkish authorities to date. Of course this will be a long process&#151;we are talking about at least a decade&#151;but now would be precisely the wrong time to send a signal that there are arbitrary barriers facing any individual country.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Gentleman&#039;s question, it is fair to recognise the scale of work that has already been done in Turkey. It has made enormous progress over the past two years, through the adoption of a series of constitutional and legislative reforms such as the abolition of the death penalty, new protections against torture, greater freedoms of expression, greater cultural rights for Kurds and others, and a reduction in the military&#039;s role in the Government. As I sought to reflect in my earlier response, we recognise that there is significant progress yet to be made, but the House should none the less be heartened by the pace and scale of the progress already achieved.

 (Lab): When the Minister does visit Turkey, I would urge him to visit the Kurdish areas in the south and east of the country and to have discussions with the Kurdish people there. While progress has been made on the recognition of linguistic rights, for example, I fear that many of those rights are simply not working on the ground, and meetings and discussions with those groups would be of great benefit to him. Will he also consider the use of the military by the Turkish Government in south-east Turkey, where it has been used to oppress many Kurdish groups? Will he also remind the Turkish Government that the banning of organisations is not necessarily the best way of ensuring that they have free political representation? It is much better to promote an inclusive society in which all communities feel able to be, and are, represented at national level.

 On my hon.

We receive full reports on their view of the situation on the ground. I would note, however, the progress that has been made, not just in terms of the legislative changes that I have mentioned. Broadcasting in non-Turkish languages, including Kurdish, started on national television and radio in June 2004, and I understand that Kurdish music cassettes, CDs and newspapers are now far more freely available, and that Kurdish plays and concerts are taking place.

<p><a name="st_41"><a name="50719-03_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  (Mr. Jack Straw): </b> 
 I chaired the summit in place of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister while he returned to London following the terrorist atrocities of 7 July. At the summit, the CAP as such was not discussed. However, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister called for reform in all G8 countries, and pressed colleagues to agree on a date by which to end export subsidies.
</p>





<p><a name="st_42"><a name="50719-03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bailey: </b> 
 Does the Foreign Secretary not agree that the benefits of the deals made at the G8 conference on aid to Africa and development would be lost if the EU CAP export subsidies continued to undermine the economies of those self-same African countries? Will he pledge&#151;notwithstanding the demonstrations that have taken place in Brussels over the last couple of days&#151;to press for an end to the CAP regime and export subsidies to developing countries?
</p>





<p><a name="st_43"><a name="50719-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right about the damaging effects of those export subsidies, which, in the case of wheat, powdered milk and sugar respectively, are estimated to lead to prices approximately 34 per cent., 50 per cent. and 24 per cent. below EU costs of production. They have a destabilising effect on natural producers outside the European Union. We are pledged to seek 2010 as the end date for the subsidies. Whether we succeed will depend on whether we secure the full support of our EU colleagues, and then on whether success is achieved at the World Trade Organisation round in Hong Kong in December.
</p>





<p><a name="st_44"><a name="50719-03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Stephen Dorrell  (Charnwood)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Foreign Secretary agree that it is simply self-indulgent of European Union leaders to go to the G8 summit and sign up to the aspiration to make poverty history, while at the same time defending the present structure of the common agricultural policy? Will the Government focus their advocacy of CAP reform on structural reform of the policy to open European markets to agricultural products from elsewhere in the world? Do the Government accept that the implication of that is reduced EU expenditure, which should lead to a reduction in the overall level of the EU budget?
</p>





<p><a name="st_45"><a name="50719-03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I agree with the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s last point. Fundamental reform of the CAP must constitute a straightforward reduction in total financial support for it. However, I do not consider EU member states with a different view to be capricious. Their view is connected with their politics, and the strength of their 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="50719-03_para0">
<a name="stpa_5">To those who think that the answer is to renationalise agricultural support, I say that that is not the answer, because it could lead to a degree of national competition that would in turn result in increased subsidies for European farming.

 (Lab): I am sure my right hon. Friend agrees that &quot;reform&quot; can mean as much or as little as we want it to mean, whereas &quot;abolition&quot; is very clear. Will he include abolition as at least one option for debate during the EU presidency, and examine its full implications?
</p>





<p><a name="st_47"><a name="50719-03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I have thought about that, because I am an open-minded sort of guy. I have thought about it a lot, because at first blush the criticisms of the CAP are so intense that it would seem to follow naturally that its abolition was the answer. I am afraid, however, that we cannot escape the fact that if we abolish the CAP&#151;including any common policy preventing national state aid from going to the agriculture industry&#151;we could end up worse off, with a bidding up of agricultural subsidies in each of the existing EU member states. We need the continuation of a common regime which will bring down the totality of agriculture spending, while shifting the balance of that spending away from direct support for production to rural development&#151;which is what we have tried to do in this country.

<p><a name="st_49"><a name="50719-03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was paying attention to what my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe said&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is very clear, because reform of the common agricultural policy is in the White Paper and is also embraced by the policy priority of future financing. One cannot reform the future financing of the European Union without reforming the CAP, which is 40 per cent. of the total spent. As to how that reform is to be achieved, we do not need a Green Paper or a White Paper to spell out the key elements&#151;a reduction in the total amount of spend and a shift in the balance of that spend. What we need is to secure the agreement of our EU colleagues, which is what we are now seeking to do.

<p><a name="st_50"><a name="50719-03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Brady: </b> 
 The Foreign Secretary has obviously not read the written answer of 6 June, which did not mention CAP reform at all. He is also being a little vague in his answer. Perhaps it is his inability to give a straight answer on CAP reform that led the French Foreign Minister to tell the <i>International Herald Tribune</i> today that the idea of reforming the EU budget before 2014 is &quot;not serious&quot;. Will the Foreign Secretary now prove how serious he is about CAP reform by publishing detailed proposals to reform it? Specifically, if it is irrational for 40 per cent. of the EU budget to be spent on agricultural subsidy, what percentage would be acceptable? Given that Ministers now say that they do not expect any change overnight, will he also set out the timetable? There is a rare agreement across the House that we have a real opportunity to reform the EU for the better. If the Foreign Secretary refuses to answer those simple questions, the British people will be forced to conclude that the Government are wasting that golden opportunity.

 We have no policy as such on regime change&#151;except in the Conservative party. Without context, regime change is an abstraction. Our focus is on ensuring that all other states live up to their international obligations. Where they fail to do so we seek to change their behaviour.

 I think that the House will take that answer with a pinch of salt. Will the Foreign Secretary accept that there is inconsistency in a policy that takes us to war against a country that has no weapons of mass destruction, yet chooses to ignore countries such as North Korea, which is developing nuclear weapons programmes, or, even worse, Burma, which is using chemical weapons against neighbouring countries? I anticipate that in his reply the Foreign Secretary will fall back on the United Nations, in which case will he explain why there is no UN resolution condemning either country?

<p><a name="st_61"><a name="50719-04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I am indeed going to rely on the UN charter, as it is one of the fundamental foundations of international law. It is not a question of falling back on it; it happens to be the whole of the explanation. In the case of Iraq, there were 12 years of mandatory chapter VII resolutions that authorised the use of force&#151;all necessary means&#151;in 687, 678 and subsequently 1441. In the case of the Democratic People&#039;s Republic of Korea and Burma there are no such resolutions. Why? Because of the difficulty of securing international consensus.

<p><a name="st_80"><a name="50719-05_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hunt: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for his answer. While I appreciate the diplomatic and commercial significance of the decision on the arms embargo, I am sure he will agree that the decision also has tremendous military significance for the people of Taiwan. Does he agree that our policy towards Taiwan must be consistent with our policy towards Afghanistan and Iraq, where we have always recognised the fundamental importance of allowing and promoting people&#039;s right to determine their own destiny?

<p><a name="st_81"><a name="50719-05_spnew7"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 Despite having no diplomatic ties with Taiwan, we enjoy good relations with it in areas such as trade, investment, culture and, indeed, education. However, sometimes a fallacy creeps into the discussion about the review of the arms embargo. I point out that the embargo that is in place at present does not cover areas such as avionics, radar and satellite and communications systems, so although it is important to be respectful of the points of view of all parties, which will be covered by the review, we should be absolutely clear about the effect of the review that is under way.

 I am not aware of the comments to which my hon. Friend refers. Of course concern has been expressed about the anti-secession law that was recently passed.

Are the Government concerned about that? Does it weigh heavily with them in respect of their consideration of lifting the arms embargo? Are they in favour of China actually selling arms and weapons to Mr. Robert Mugabe so that he can subdue the poor people of his country?

 The Foreign Secretary has already made clear the extent to which we deplore the actions of Robert Mugabe&#039;s Government in Zimbabwe, even during the course of these questions. The general point that the hon. Gentleman raises is important, which is why we have been advancing the argument for an arms trade treaty. It is fair to say that support for such an idea is limited to a fairly small number of countries, but I assure the House that we will try to expand the group greatly to get a consensus for negotiation in the United Nations on such a treaty.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50719-06_spnew4"><b> Lorely Burt  (Solihull) (LD):</b> 
 I beg to move,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">That leave be given to bring in a That leave be given to bring in a Bill to impose conditions on the sale of parkland by local authorities; to make provision about the circumstances in which a planning application may be rejected by a local authority and about rights of appeal in such circumstances; to prohibit repeated planning applications in certain circumstances; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_1">This Bill is intended to give communities a greater say in building developments and in keeping the green heritage that shapes the character of their lives. My constituency of Solihull, like many leafy suburbs, is characterised by green open space, parks and many lovely old properties. But that character is being eroded by threats to that green open space and the constant destruction of those houses and the erection of blocks of luxury flats in their stead. The flats or, to use developer speak, &quot;apartments&quot;, stick out from the rest of the housing nearby like sore thumbs. Residents hate such development, and more than half of my postbag relates to residents calling for action to stop windfall developments of that kind.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_2">If councillors want to stop the developments, they are constrained by central Government planning guidance and policy, which permits developers to appeal against council decisions and to make councils pay all the costs if the council loses. So councils may be reluctant to object to planning applications, but if the council will not bite the bullet and refuse a planning application, local people have nowhere else to turn. They cannot object in their own right because there is no third-party right of appeal. If the developer does not appeal, he can make fresh applications again and again, wearing down a community, blighting residents&#039; lives for years and years until they either move away or lose the will to carry on fighting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_3">We understand that current planning law was designed to achieve higher intensity development that reduces the necessity for building on open space and green belt. We applaud that, but by designating people&#039;s gardens as brownfield land, planning guidelines have had the unintended consequence of enabling developers to target windfall developments in preference to true brownfield sites. Developers, like any other business people, are in business to make a profit. If they can develop a soft target, instead of tackling polluted and more difficult inner-city true brownfield sites, they will do so. It is like putting a goat in a garden and telling it to eat thistles and not the flowers: unless it is restrained, it will go for the prize begonias every time. But when a developer seeks to build in someone&#039;s garden, there are often things more substantial than begonias in the way&#151;in other words, trees.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_4">Often, the first thing a developer will do before an application is submitted is to fell any trees so that their presence cannot be used as a justification for refusing planning permission. And unless those trees are fortunate enough to be sited in a conservation area, or have tree preservation orders on them, there is not a thing that anyone can do about it. That is our first problem.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1113</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_5">The second problem occurs if a council decides to sell off green open space, parkland or some other green amenity as defined in PPG17. In Solihull, despite large petitions objecting, the council has determined that it will sell off more than six hectares of open space to fund the redevelopment of the local leisure centre. Despite the fact that the local community is up in arms, the council is ploughing ahead with destroying our green heritage. When that parkland is gone, it will be gone for ever.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_6">What happens when the council has another project it needs to fund? What other bit of parkland will it sell off then? Soon Solihull, whose motto is &quot;Urbs in rure&quot; or &quot;town in the country&quot;, will have to change its motto to simply &quot;Urbs&quot;, or even &quot;Urbs &#039;r&#039; us&quot;, because there will be no &quot;rure&quot; left to talk about.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_7">People care passionately about their local environment, but they have no say in the decisions taken in their name other than to vote out those who have made the decisions at election time. By then, it can be too late.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_8">Sometimes the sale of green space affects too small an electorate to enable those people to vote out the perpetrators. There has to be a way of addressing the balance and of giving local people a say in what the character of their local area should be. So that is the problem, and I shall outline how I propose that the provisions in the Bill would tackle it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_9">First, there is the issue of public green space. Councils have a duty to consult local people before green space is sold off, but where the council is determined to impose a course of action, consultation can be a sham. I therefore propose that local communities should be given management control of council green space, effectively making it true common land. That would mean that they would have to agree to any change of use or sale. This is already the case in rural areas where there are still commons, and the locals vote on any development proposals. If we extended that principle to public green space, local people in urban areas would then have the responsibilities as well as rights over their green environment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-06_para11">
<a name="stpa_10">I believe that windfall developments are a largely unintended consequence of PPG3. I propose amending PPG3 to redesignate garden land as greenfield land. Under the sequential test of PPG3, true brownfield land would then have to be developed before garden land could be considered. An exception for extensions into back gardens of existing properties would need to be made. If a development involved the building of more than one property, the rules of PPG3 could apply. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1114</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I further propose a third-party right of appeal so that where councils were unwilling to refuse an application that contravenes the local plan, local people themselves could appeal to the Secretary of State.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-06_para12">
<a name="stpa_11">Next is the blighting of communities by continuing re-applications for planning permission. The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 will abolish twin-tracking of applications when it is introduced. That will give some relief. However, there is nothing to stop a developer continuing to reapply for different developments on the same site. I propose that after three applications have been turned down within three years, local residents should be given a rest and that no further applications would be eligible for consideration within a further three years. That would enable an almost acceptable application to be modified and re-submitted while protecting local residents from the constant pressure of continuous new applications&#151;a sort of &quot;three strikes and you&#039;re out&quot; formula.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-06_para13">
<a name="stpa_12">The only trees that are currently protected from destruction are those that are subject to preservation orders, or trees that are in conservation areas. I propose that our leafy suburbs and urban areas should be protected by extending to all urban areas the rules regarding felling and works to trees over a certain size or age. That would put the onus on developers and on everyone else who wants to destroy trees over a certain size or age to notify the local authority. Trees are not only beautiful and worth preserving in their own right; they are the green lung of our communities. We cannot have leafy suburbia without leaves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-06_para14">
<a name="stpa_13">Central control of planning is needed in some circumstances, but one size does not fit all at a local level. People want, and should have, more control over the planning decisions that affect their lives, and the Bill would give it to them.

 I am always suspicious of business motions, particularly no explanation is offered for them. I hoped that at least a brief explanation would be forthcoming. I am concerned, because an earlier business motion, to which, I freely admit, I did not pay sufficient attention, precluded the amendment of instructions to the Crossrail Bill Committee. Paragraph (b)(i) of the Government instruction is particularly offensive, as it prevents the Committee from considering extensions beyond Maidenhead to Reading. An earlier business motion limited the powers of the House to provide effective scrutiny of the Bill, and I am now concerned about the implications of the present business motion. The Government owe us at least an explanation of the need for it.

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="50719-07_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Derek Twigg): </b> 
 The motion before the House deals with the committal motion and the instruction on the Crossrail Bill. The committal motion formally commits the Bill to be considered by a Select Committee. It sets out the size of the Committee, how it is to be appointed and how it is to operate. Those essentially logistical provisions are well precedented. More importantly, it also sets the petitioning period. Hon. Members will see that we have given people nine weeks, until 16 September, to lodge a petition. Traditionally, petitioning periods have lasted two to three weeks&#151;we are giving people three times that amount of time. The instruction is required to help ensure that the hybrid Bill process that is used for Crossrail is fully compliant with the environmental impact assessment directive. It is designed to guide the Select Committee in its consideration of comments on the environmental statement. Second Reading establishes the principle of the Bill, but that principle is not considered by the Committee. Where comments on the environmental statement relate to the matters that the Committee has a remit to consider, the Committee will take them into account in its assessment.

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="50719-07_spnew2"><b> Derek Twigg: </b> 
 That is the case, but a Select Committee can consider other related matters.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker.

He explained the elements of the debate and we understand that, but if he does not answer that question, would it be in order for me to put a point of order to you, asking why we need the motion?

 A number of the issues that hon. Members have raised and will raise on the committal motion will be debated during the afternoon and evening. The committal motion is self-explanatory. Clearly, it is for the Select Committee to consider the matters. If the Committee wanted to consider the principle, it would have to come back to the House. It is for the House to decide, but what we wish to set today is the principle, and that is what the committal motion does.

It cannot be true both that it is up to the Select Committee to decide what it wants to consider, and that the instruction, if passed, circumscribes what it can consider. Both those statements cannot be true. I sympathise with the Minister. The issue is detailed, complex and controversial and I do not want to fall out with him at this stage, because I shall ask him for many things in the course of the debate.

 It is touching that the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) and the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) have cited the case for the procedure to include the extension of Crossrail to Reading. On mature reflection, the Minister may wish that his answer had addressed these points. The Department for Transport is consulting on safeguarding the route from Maidenhead to Reading in response to very strong lobbying from the business community and Reading Members of Parliament&#151;we have established a cross-party consensus. Those of us who have an interest in seeing the Crossrail project proceed, but who are also concerned about its impact on existing high-speed services and freight lines and the roll-out to Reading, wonder why the instruction to the Select Committee is so prescriptive. I invite the Minister to open the door to wider discussions on the consequences of Crossrail, which all hon. Members want to approve in principle, because important details have not yet been examined.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_16">The hybrid Bill process is, by its nature, complex. The Select Committee will have about 12 months of detailed consideration to take on board all the points and concerns. Hon. Members are concerned that the Committee may be fettered by the tightly drawn terms of its instruction, on which we will vote today. I hope that the Minister will reflect on the concerns expressed by hon. Members who support the principle of Crossrail, who want Crossrail to work for the people of London, but who also want it to work for people who seek to commute into London from various constituencies to the west and the east. I hope that that has helped the Minister.

<a name="stpa_17">I support the Crossrail project, but this is not the way to win friends and influence people. If we are to achieve consensus, which the hon. Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter) and others want, we must have a wide debate on Second Reading and in the early procedural stages to allow all the issues to be put on the table.

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="50719-08_spnew8"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 I entirely accept that. I am trying to ensure that we end up with an east-west rail link through London from the west to east that will serve people from the west country and the Thames valley, come into and through the capital, and go out to the eastern home counties and East Anglia. That has been on the agenda of this country and this Parliament for many years&#151;certainly throughout your speakership, Mr. Speaker, and before that.

<a name="50719-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_18">I want to make three points about why I hope that the Government will reconsider this rather surprising business motion, of which I was not aware in advance. I thought that I was coming here to debate the Second Reading of the Crossrail Bill and that, having debated its principles and substance, we could debate the remit that we give to the Select Committee when we ask it to get on with the detailed consideration of petitions against the Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="st_34"><a name="50719-08_spnew9"><b> Martin Salter: </b> 
 Before the hon. Gentleman treats the House to his three substantive points, may I seek clarification from the Liberal Democrats that they join the other parties in supporting the principle of the western terminus for Crossrail being in Reading rather than in Maidenhead, as proposed?
</p>





<p><a name="st_35"><a name="50719-08_spnew10"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 I think that the answer is yes, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington will confirm that when he speaks on our behalf on Second Reading. I am speaking on the basis of a London constituency interest.
</p>





<p><a name="st_36"><a name="50719-08_spnew11"><b> Peter Luff: </b> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>





<p><a name="st_37"><a name="50719-08_spnew12"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 Just once more, as I want to make my three points and move on.
</p>





<p><a name="st_38"><a name="50719-08_spnew13"><b> Peter Luff: </b> 
 Is it the hon. Gentleman&#039;s understanding, as it is mine, that the purpose of this business motion is to ensure that the subsequent debate and votes occur today? I wish that the Minister had confirmed that, but he would not do so. I would welcome that outcome. I support Crossrail in principle, but this instruction turns me against the whole thing because of its restrictive nature. I would like separate debates and votes on the separate issues.
</p>





<p><a name="st_39"><a name="50719-08_spnew14"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 That prompts me to make my first point. We have waited a long time for this Bill. It was due in the last Parliament and never came. It was in the Queen&#039;s Speech and we hoped that it would come early in this Parliament, but it was put back; it was trailed but did not happen. We understand the reasons for that&#151;I am not being over-critical&#151;but we now have to get moving. The trouble is that we are up against the buffer of the last three days of the parliamentary term before 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1120</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the summer recess. I can understand the dilemma: how does one have a Second Reading debate without any filibustering or delay that would prevent us from forming the Select Committee?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_19">I cannot speak for colleagues in other parties, but certainly my colleagues and I would facilitate having the procedural debate later tonight or tomorrow, which would be entirely possible. There would be no difficulty if we were allowed to send the Committee a brief saying that it could look at the whole range of issues. That would not divide the House&#151;it would produce a consensus and we could vote on it. This is a serious request to the Secretary of State, who knows these issues very well. Let us have Second Reading of the Bill, which will, I believe, receive the approval of this House in due course, but please do not fetter the hands of the Committee at this stage because there will be complaints that it is not addressing the issues properly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_20">My second point is that there is a large degree of consensus. The first parts of the Secretary of State&#039;s instructions and those in the name of the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) and of my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington and others are the same. They both call for a process dealing with the environmental impact and for the principle of the Bill to allow debate on where the termini should be. It is fairly obvious that if we are to have a great railway line through the country, the decisions on the locations of the termini are central and should be discussed by the Select Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_21">The instructions agree that intermediate stations should be provided in eight places: Paddington, which is obvious; Bond Street; Tottenham Court Road; Farringdon, with an interchange with the north-south Thameslink line; Liverpool Street, with an interchange with the mainline station; Whitechapel; the Isle of Dogs; and Custom House. So far, there is consensus. The difference is that my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington and the other signatories to the third instruction ask the Committee to consider three important questions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-08_para7">
<a name="stpa_22">The first question deals with Crossrail&#039;s effect on freight and other passenger services. That is an obvious consideration. When a great new railway line is established, the knock-on effect on other users&#151;passenger and freight&#151;should be considered. That is not unreasonable but sensible. The Government, who, to their credit, keep saying that they want an integrated rail network, should accept that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-08_para8">
<a name="stpa_23">The second question requests that the Committee be allowed to consider whether the line could be part of the integrated rail network. We all want that. If one travels from, for example, Hull to Plymouth and happens to go through Oxford or Reading, one wants to know that there will be some interconnection. If one makes a journey down the east coast to Cambridge, one wants to ensure that there is a connection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-08_para9">
<a name="stpa_24">The third question is obvious. Now that we have won the Olympic bid and have the great opportunity of the games, which I have always supported and now welcome&#151;it is fantastic for London&#151;we need to ensure, given the Government&#039;s claim at the outset that we did not need Crossrail for the bid, that we do not commit ourselves to building something that disrupts the necessary work for delivering the transport for the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1121</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Olympics, for example, the east London railway line extension and other projects to which we are committed. It is no good doing a Boston and digging up the whole of London because of Crossrail when we are trying to fulfil commitments in the east end and in south-east London, where I live.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-08_para10">
<a name="stpa_25">The second substantive point is, therefore, a request to the Government to give the Committee the job of examining the logical questions on the Order Paper.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-08_para11">
<a name="stpa_26">The third point&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;It is the fourth.&quot;] No, it is the third substantive point, which is about procedure. If the Government are uncertain about willingness to co-operate, will they accept assurances from colleagues of all parties that we are all willing to co-operate with getting the Bill from the Floor of the House into Committee before the summer so that we can get on with the job as soon as possible? Nobody wishes to delay progress. If the Government would be reasonable about the process, hon. Members would be reasonable about how we handle the Bill. I therefore beg the Government to withdraw the motion and allow us to do orderly business so that the Committee can get on with its job.

 I intend to cover all the points that have been raised in relation to the instruction and the procedures, and to give the Government&#039;s view on them. However, as I understand it, if the House agrees to the business motion now, there will be a vote on the   principle of the Bill&#151;its Second Reading&#151;at 10 o&#039;clock. We will then reach motion No. 8, which is the Government&#039;s instruction, and if the House does not like it, it can vote it down. Then, as I understand it, the Opposition&#039;s instruction to the Committee would be considered. However, the business motion gives the House the opportunity to vote on these matters.

<a name="50719-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_27">London has relied on railways and underground lines built largely by the Victorians and it now needs Crossrail if it is going to cope with the needs of the 21st century. The Bill will provide the powers needed to build Crossrail, a new railway that will bring enormous benefits not only to London, but to the south-east and the wider United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_28">As I suggested in the previous debate, I want to cover three main areas. The first involves the procedures involved with a hybrid Bill. During that part of my speech, I want to cover the points raised by. Members on both sides of the House relating to the instructions. The second area involves what the Bill does, and the third covers the proposed route. That might help. Members to time their interventions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_29">The procedures in relation to a hybrid Bill are unusual, so the House would benefit from some discussion on that before we come to discuss the route. I hope that, subject to stretching your patience, Mr. Speaker, I shall be able to give way to all Members who wish to raise points. I recognise that a Bill of this importance, and which impacts on the interests of a large number of people along its route, is bound to be controversial&#151;not necessarily on party political grounds, although some hon. Members are against the proposal on principle&#151;and it is in the interest of the House to debate these matters properly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-09_para3">
<a name="stpa_30">I now come to the nature of the Bill. The last hybrid Bill to be introduced into the House, over a decade ago, dealt with the channel tunnel rail link. Hybrid Bills are used for projects of such national importance that it is appropriate for the Government to take the lead in strategic development. However, because they deal with specific private interests, they are dealt with differently in both Houses of Parliament. A hybrid Bill has aspects of both a public and a private Bill. It is introduced by the Government and, like any public Bill, contains provisions that either affect everyone or affect particular classes of people.

<a name="50719-09_para4">
<a name="stpa_31">The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) and my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter) asked how Crossrail would link into the national network, in relation to trains running to the west of Paddington. I shall come to that issue later in my speech, but I mention it because it will be dealt with by an unusual procedure because this is a hybrid Bill. If we give the Bill a Second Reading, it will go to a Special Select Committee that will have the power to hear petitions against it. That is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1124</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>where people who have concerns about their property or about disturbances, for example, will have an opportunity to be heard. That Select Committee will sit a quasi-judicial capacity. It then goes to a Standing Committee&#151;most of the House will be familiar with that as it is a normal procedure on a Bill&#151;then on to Third Reading and then to another place, where exactly the same procedure is followed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-09_para5">
<a name="stpa_32">It is patently obvious that because the Bill has such long stages in both Houses it will take some considerable time to go through Parliament, which means that there ought to be ample opportunity for just about every possible complaint and comment to be heard. As a word of caution, however, the last Crossrail Bill fell precisely because there was a lack of clarity as to the reason for the Bill in the first place&#151;because it was a private Member&#039;s Bill, the House never decided on the question of principle&#151;and it eventually collapsed under the sheer weight of objections. I very much hope that we can avoid that fate.
</p>

<a name="50719-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_33">The procedural position is that if the Bill gets its Second Reading tonight, it will be sent to a Select Committee, in accordance with the instruction that we have tabled&#151;to be fair, I think that all the instructions do that&#151;with an opportunity for members of the public and others to petition against the Bill, so that their objections can be tabled, and which the Select Committee can then hear. The point is that there will be ample opportunity for members of the public and Members of both Houses of Parliament to have their concerns dealt with.

</p>





<p><a name="st_63"><a name="50719-10_spnew3"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 On no possible view will Crossrail be open for services before the current Greater Western franchise is completed. Indeed, if discussions go on much longer this afternoon, it might be some considerable time before Crossrail opens. The franchisees who are bidding for the Greater Western franchise at the moment know of Crossrail and what the plans are, as they have discussed them with the Department. On any view, however, that franchise expires before Crossrail services will be running, so I do not think that that is a problem.

Indeed, successive Governments have got into awful trouble by being over-prescriptive. Nevertheless, because of difficulties we have encountered in the past and because I think we must get people to focus on a particular proposition&#151;which is the subject of the Bill&#151;we have tabled an instruction to the Select Committee to regard the principle of the Bill as including a proposition, namely, the provision of a railway running from Maidenhead in the west to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east, with a prescribed number of named stations on its route. That does not preclude the Select Committee from considering possible variations, and if it heard representations relating to other matters it would not be precluded from saying so to the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_35">I note, incidentally, that every amendment to our instruction includes a restriction relating to the environmental impact, so the principle has been accepted to that extent. I fear, however, that if we do not issue our instruction, the Committee will receive only the most generalised instruction. The whole process could continue for months, if not years. There is a serious risk that one of two things could happen: either we might not reach a conclusion, or the costs of the project could rise beyond any reasonable level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_36">The purpose of our instruction is to tell the Committee that the House has given the Bill a Second Reading and that the principle of the Bill ought to include the establishment of a railway line that is specified in the instruction.

<br>&nbsp;<br>&quot;Thou shalt not consider anything else&quot;&#151;for example, matters relating to any one of the stations along the route. It is open to the Committee to say that a station is in the wrong place, or that there ought to be a station somewhere else. We cannot tell the Committee, &quot;No, you cannot consider any of those things.&quot; However, unless we have a stab at instructing it on what it ought to be considering, we run a serious risk of allowing this Crossrail project to meet exactly the same fate as others in the past. The whole thing could run into the sand.

 I speak as a Member who served on the Select Committee that considered the original Channel Tunnel Bill&#151;not the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Bill&#151;19 years ago. That Select Committee sat for almost six months and had to deal with an enormous quantity of petitions and it clearly lacked the sort of detailed instruction that is being proposed today, which should make it possible to decide what priority to give to a range of petitions. Given the risk of so many petitions clogging up the Committee&#039;s work and diverting it from its priorities, I hope that my right hon.

Separate Committees in both Houses will consider these matters further and there will be an opportunity for more general debate, as I have described.

<a name="stpa_49">I shall outline the purpose of the Bill. Crossrail will deliver extra capacity on the rail network in London and, importantly, will provide&#151;as hon. Members have already mentioned&#151;a vital new link in the strategic rail network, into which it will be integrated. The main purpose of the Bill is to secure the powers necessary to build Crossrail, and that will consist of new rail tunnels running east-west through central London, connecting directly the existing surface rail routes to Maidenhead and Heathrow in the west and Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. By connecting the major London rail terminals at Paddington and Liverpool Street, it will enable interconnecting main line train services to cross the centre of London, through a number of new purpose-built stations. So, Crossrail will be part of the existing railway network either side of the London tunnels, and that adds a very important dimension to London&#039;s railways.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_50">Crossrail will be regulated by the Office of Rail Regulation. Once built, its operations can be devolved to the Mayor of London or to Network Rail because the railway will serve London and the wider network. That will bring significant benefits. London&#039;s present transport system faces significant problems in meeting demand during the rush hour and we need to deal with the congestion and overcrowding on much of the network during peak hours.

 The Secretary of State mentioned a few minutes ago that the Bill was not perfect and accepted that certain reasonable amendments might be needed. I am particularly concerned about clauses 21 to 31, which appear to give Crossrail priority over all other rail users. There is much concern around the House about that. Is he prepared to look at that point specifically to ensure that we try to get the advantages of Crossrail without damaging interoperability with the existing rail network?
</p>





<p><a name="st_93"><a name="50719-12_spnew3"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising an important issue. The Bill is designed to enable Crossrail to be constructed and, to do so, it is necessary to take powers not only to acquire land but, crucially, to allow the Crossrail services to run. Now that the Government have strategic control of the direction of the railways as a result of the Railways Act 2005, we clearly have an interest in ensuring that we have a railway network that not only serves London and its commuters, but is part of the national network. We are putting into London a new stretch of railway, while

<br>&nbsp;<br>inevitably using existing railway lines, so it is necessary to take powers in the Bill to ensure that the Crossrail services can run. However, I make it clear to the House that, although the Crossrail services are important, it is equally important that we maintain the other services that run into London, such as the lines that come up from the west of England and south Wales and, at the eastern end of the tunnel, the trains that run on the Great Eastern and East Anglia network generally.

<p>
<a name="50719-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_51">As I said, the Bill will give us the power to devolve the track itself to Network Rail or to the Mayor of London, but I am absolutely clear that we cannot have a railway where one bit operates to the great disadvantage of the other bit. Crossrail will not just carry the sort of metro services that run in the inner part of London, but link the City of London with areas to the west, using existing services, as well as Crossrail services to some extent. We want the Heathrow Express to continue, as does BAA, which operates it. Crossrail must also tie into the largely commuter services that come in from East Anglia, as well as not just cross-channel but Kent services.

 With due respect, the comments that the Secretary of State has just made appear contradictory. The whole point about the national rail network is that access to it is determined by the Office of Rail Regulation, so the balance of priorities between certain train operating companies and the freight services is determined by that office. The Bill will take that power away from it and enable the Secretary of State to require that certain services are given priority. He cannot justify the statement that Crossrail will be a normal part of the national rail network operated by the Office of Rail Regulation and support the Bill.

 I do not think that that will happen. It might help the hon. Gentleman if I say that the Government and BAA, which owns Heathrow, have had many discussions about how Crossrail, Heathrow Express and Airtrack will tie in. Those discussions will continue. The current intention is that Crossrail trains will run to terminal 4, with the Heathrow Express running to terminal 5&#151;obviously, both will call at terminals 1, 2 and 3. The current Airtrack proposal is that it will be able to come into terminal 5, but those proposals are not especially advanced at present, so that has not yet been finalised.

<a name="50719-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_55">Given the history of the railways, some fragmentation is inevitable, although that is not all to do with what happened 10 years ago. BAA built its own railway as a separate entity from the main railway network. However, Heathrow Express runs perfectly sensibly and well with the existing network, so Crossrail can do exactly the same thing. My specific answer to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point is that BAA and the Department are having extremely useful discussions. The intention is that Crossrail will go to terminal 4, so it will not squeeze out developments at terminal 5.

 The Secretary of State is being generous in giving way and helpful by answering questions. He implied earlier in response to a question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East (Mrs. James) that there would be few problems because the two fast lines into Paddington from the west and Wales would remain as they are now. However, it is quite common to find that all four existing rails into Paddington are used, so passenger trains that are meant to be on the fast rails are going on to the slow rails even now, before any construction has begun. Many of my constituents in Bristol are worried that the powers that are being taken

</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_56">Another reason why the four tracks are often in use is because freight also uses the line, and a lot of important freight comes from the west country&#151;

<p><a name="st_102"><a name="50719-13_spnew1"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Perhaps that is an instruction to me as well, Mr. Deputy Speaker. My hon. Friend raises an important point on which my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West and others have also touched.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_57">My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West (Doug Naysmith) is right that trains coming into Paddington experience delays. That is partly because the lines to the west of Paddington, like those in many other parts of the network, could have done with investment to improve signalling and track capacity over many years. I shall not get into the argument about that problem again because we all know why it happened. Part of the Crossrail proposal is to spend something like &#163;1 billion on upgrading those lines and making it easier for freight trains to get on and off the main line. If a freight train comes off the main line and goes into a siding at the moment, it can effectively block the line for six or seven minutes. That might not seem like a long time, but if that happens several times a day, the problem soon mounts up, so that is one reason why my hon. Friend&#039;s trains sometimes get held up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_58">The intention is that Crossrail will use existing slow lines, not the fast lines. The fast lines will benefit from the additional electrification to ease freight train access to which I referred, and fast train services ought to be able to run. Some of the stories appearing in Bristol and further south-west about 40 per cent. cuts in capacity are absolute rubbish. It is one person feeding off another and such stories are not justified. There is no way that I would sanction anything in London that would result in a 40 per cent. cut in trains from the south-west of England.
</p>





<p><a name="st_103"><a name="50719-13_spnew2"><b> Dr. Naysmith: </b> 
 I am pleased to hear it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_104"><a name="50719-13_spnew3"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I am glad that my hon. Friend thinks that. The south-west of England is very important to the country and such scaremongering is nonsense. Crossrail will use the slow lines and also subsume some suburban lines. He should not be concerned about any adverse impact on trains from points west of Paddington, especially long-distance ones. Overall, the additional investment from Crossrail on lines to the west of Paddington will be beneficial not just to intercity services but to suburban services. In fact, the project will contribute much-needed investment to that part of the line, which has been overdue for some time. I hope that I have satisfied him on that point. If not, no doubt he will let me know.

<p><a name="st_105"><a name="50719-13_spnew4"><b> Martin Salter: </b> 
 I certainly associate myself with some of the concerns expressed by other hon. Members. The Secretary of State said that Crossrail will be a vital rail route, connecting with the rest of the rail network.

 Not entirely, no. My hon. Friend is a little unkind to Maidenhead&#151;there is no reason why trains should not stop there. Reading was not included in the proposal because taking the train out there would add considerably to the expense of the project, not least because substantial resignalling around the Reading area would be required and there are problems with capacity at Reading even at the moment.

<p>
<a name="50719-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_61">The Secretary of State is discussing the powers that he is to take for funding Crossrail. As he knows, businesses in London are very supportive of the principle, but there is concern that they will be asked to contribute considerably to the cost. In central London, where the congestion charge is at last being quantified as having a negative impact on the retail, leisure and tourism industries, there is concern that an extra levy on businesses could reduce even further their viability and hence not even the expected amount of money will be raised. Is he coming to that issue or will he reassure businesses in London that they will be able to continue to exist?

We think that Crossrail will cost some &#163;15 billion or &#163;16 billion at today&#039;s prices. The Bill envisages construction between 2008 and 2015, and, if one looks at the money that would be spent in those years, adjusted upward to take account of inflation, that is the probable order of magnitude.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_63">I said last year that my Department, together with the Treasury and Transport for London, would take forward work on alternative funding mechanisms that could be used to raise a contribution from London. Most London business organisations are willing to contribute, because they perceive the direct benefit that London as a whole will receive. However, in light of the work that is being done by Sir Michael Lyons in reviewing local government funding more widely, it makes sense to see what he recommends before deciding the detailed balance of funding on Crossrail. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor and I have therefore decided to defer the consultation on alternative funding mechanisms until after the Lyons review.

<a name="stpa_64">It is important to demonstrate our commitment to the project, which is underlined by the fact that we are taking this Bill forward to establish the principle and route of Crossrail.

It is a huge challenge, both in terms of funding and in respect of the wider fiscal position, so we need to get the funding right and to take the time to make that happen.

 The issue was considered as part of the cross-London rail links project and all the information is available in the Library.

Friend the Member for Reading, West that, in terms of time gained, the studies that were carried out showed that most people would find it quicker to get from Reading into Paddington and then change; it would be quicker to use the existing high-speed services than to use Crossrail, which would be a local service. The studies were carried out and the hon. Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson) is welcome to examine them. I may have said that construction costs were based on 2008 to 2015. If I remember rightly, it is 2007 to 2013.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_65">As I have said, there is a new central tunnel section for the stations to which I referred earlier.

These are matters that the petitioning process is designed precisely to address so that we can ascertain what we can do to try to address concerns, if that is possible. We have tried throughout the process to examine all the options and to come up with those that are the least environmentally damaging and the least inconvenient to people.

In addition to that, a number of plans have been put forward as alternatives to Crossrail, on which Members may wish to touch. However, I believe that the proposition that we have before us gives us a realistic chance of getting something constructed. It will take time, however, and it will be expensive.

He has been generous in giving way and he has answered some pretty technical and complicated questions. I think that he has largely overcome the original confusion that was sewn about the remit of the Select Committee. I think that the House will be grateful for the understanding tone that he has adopted towards this difficult and complex issue.

<a name="50719-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_70">The country needs infrastructure. Building high-capacity routes in a densely populated country is an evermore complex and controversial endeavour. I hope that at least in principle, if not in every detail, we can make the issue of Crossrail something that has cross-party support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_71">Britain is crowded. In the past few centuries, we built our infrastructure very well&#151;we constructed ports, canals, railways, airports, roads and now, by virtue of this project, we will construct railways again. As we build more, however, everything becomes entwined, and as we are not building any more space, inevitably the facilities that we are trying to construct for the betterment of our life overlap and compete for that space. That is nowhere more so than in our capital city, which is congested, highly populated and has many intense traffic movements from day to day. We have built in and out of London; we have built the M25 around it, but we have not built anything across it. The project will go from east to west, and from west to east. Inevitably, it must be a Government endeavour or at least a Government-authorised endeavour, so that the powers needed to implement it are enshrined in law. That is what the Bill attempts to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_72">The Bill has been a long time a-coming. Any infrastructure project of this scale needs some push and drive. The people working on it need to adopt a &quot;get on with it&quot; attitude, balanced, as is clear from our deliberations today, by acute sensitivity to local and private concerns. Over the years, as I have said in previous debates with the Secretary of State, the country&#039;s infrastructure planning has been bedevilled by short-term horizons. The project attempts to take a longer view, and tries to solve a problem before we are completely bunged up and are compelled to do something about it. I lived in Singapore in the mid-1980s, and as we look across the world from west to east, we can see that that country had great planning horizons, and built great capacity, in excess of what was thought necessary at the time. As a result, it has a world-standard metro and a world-standard airport, which has capacity for even more flights.

We must, as the Secretary of State largely did, look at the route, its planning and construction, as well as its interrelationship with the plans for construction projects for the 2012 Olympics. We must look at funding&#151;the Secretary of State did not say very much about that, so we may wish to return to the subject later.

All of us can cast our mind back to the channel tunnel, a comparable infrastructure project that was always bedevilled by increased costs and insufficient funding to underpin it, such that it almost went bankrupt. We need to make sure that Crossrail is fully underpinned and can definitely go ahead.

: It is unsurprising that Government Front Benchers have not confirmed this point, but there is little doubt that Crossrail will not be constructed before the Olympic games. In my constituency, Charing Cross road will be closed for some two years during the construction phase, when the whole of central London will become a building site. Many of my constituents will welcome Crossrail after it has been constructed, but they are concerned about the impact of construction on day-to-day life. It is inconceivable that large-scale construction will take place before the 2012 Olympics.
</p>





<p><a name="st_125"><a name="50719-15_spnew9"><b> Mr. Duncan: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has hit on a serious point. We have been told that the likely completion date for Crossrail is 2013&#151;if one allows a couple of years for slippage, it is 2015&#151;and the Olympics will take place in 2012. If the hybrid Bill process is completed in both Houses in two years&#039; time and the Bill is enacted, will significant construction get under way before the Olympics? I hope that the Minister answers that question in his winding-up speech. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Secretary of State spoke for nearly an hour, but every word was worth it, and we are grateful for his thorough approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_83">I do not want to speak for much longer, because I know that today&#039;s debate is an important forum for other hon. Members to express their concerns for their individual constituencies. My right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) and her constituency neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie), are concerned about the question, &quot;Why not Reading?&quot;, which has been answered, although not conclusively, this afternoon. My hon. Friends the Members for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), for Witney (Mr. Cameron), for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) and for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) are concerned about the knock-on effects. My hon. Friend the Member for Romford (Andrew Rosindell) is deeply concerned about the construction of the depot in his constituency, and if he succeeds in catching your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have no doubt that he will enthusiastically explain the matter in great detail.
</p>





<p><a name="st_126"><a name="50719-15_spnew10"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown  (Cotswold) (Con):</b> 
 My hon. Friend used the analogy of squeezing a quart into a pint bottle. Will he accept that Paddington is the narrow part of the bottle? However much one speeds up the process, it is not possible to get more trains in and out of Paddington, which means that lines to the west will not be developed further. In other words, Crossrail will fossilise our rail services, which we would like to expand to allow more people to travel on the railways.
</p>





<p><a name="st_127"><a name="50719-15_spnew11"><b> Mr. Duncan: </b> 
 A wag once told me that I, of all people, prove that one can squeeze a quart into a pint pot&#151;or, perhaps, a pint into a half-pint pot.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_84">My hon. Friend&#039;s point is valid, and the hybrid Bill process is designed to study such issues in detail. We have not seen a hybrid Bill dealing with such a project for a long time, and it will be interesting to see whether the procedure has stood the test of time and can cope with a project of this magnitude.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_85">Before I finish, I should like to return to the interrelationship between Crossrail and existing networks and the regulatory regime. Many in the industry who have made representations feel that the Bill undermines the principle of independent regulation. They think that its powers could negatively affect Network Rail&#039;s ability to deliver services and that it challenges the wider principle of independent regulation, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead suggested. Taken together, clauses 21 to 26 allow the Secretary of State to override the existing processes and access rights that are designed to ensure that timetables reflect the needs of all route users. They enable the Secretary of State to instruct&#151;not just permit, but instruct&#151;the Office of Rail Regulation to amend existing track access agreements to give priority to Crossrail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_86">That appears to establish a regime not of equity but of preference, and therefore challenges the even-handed approach that the ORR is currently required to display. The existing regulatory structure allows the ORR to operate in a balanced way, taking account of the overall need of the entire rail network, but the Bill fundamentally undermines and changes the ORR&#039;s role in that respect. It will allow control of the Crossrail tracks to be taken away from Network Rail and force the ORR to give priority to Crossrail trains over those of other operators. That would give Crossrail trains exclusive access to half the track capacity on the routes between Paddington and Maidenhead and between Stratford and Shenfield, which would substantially reduce the capacity available to non-Crossrail users on those routes, force reductions in current service levels, and make future growth impossible. A serious knock-on issue of capacity and track congestion flows from the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_87">One of the main representations that we have received, which is very strongly felt, concerns freight. The industry has expressed concern that there is a real risk that large quantities of bulk materials&#151;including aggregates, cement, fuel oil and domestic waste&#151;and high-value goods such as cars and manufactured products in containers will be forced from rail by Crossrail services. It is important, in trying to maintain a cross-party consensus, that the Minister should provide a good rebuttal of that suggestion if he can.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-15_para8">
<a name="stpa_88">The railway industry has made every effort to advise the Secretary of State of its concerns. In reply, he said that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;there are no plans to acquire permanently part of the Network Rail network for dedicated use for Crossrail services&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-15_para9">
<a name="stpa_89">He also said:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;It follows that Network Rail will operate and manage services on Network Rail&#039;s network including Crossrail services.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-15_para10">
<a name="stpa_90">There are none the less concerns that such powers remain in this hybrid Bill. We are concerned that the Secretary of State&#039;s words are not matched by the black and white text of the Bill; and in the end, as we have learned to our cost in many other areas of legislation,

<a name="stpa_91">I do not want to detain the House any longer because many Members want to speak. This project has been a long time a-coming. We should like to see a broad coalition of support behind it, but one that is sensitive and responsive to the local needs and concerns detailed by many right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House. Looking to the welcome award of the Olympics to Britain in 2012, we want to hear that that project will not unreasonably delay the Crossrail project. In short, I say to the Government that they should get on with this if they mean it, but if they do not, they should not raise false hopes and lead everyone a merry dance. We should like it to happen; let us make it happen.

Ilford station is between Stratford and Shenfield and my constituency also contains the stations of Seven Kings and Goodmayes.

The platforms in those stations will need to be extended, which will involve considerable reconstructive engineering work, the removal of waste, many vehicles and possible disruption to the lives of many of my constituents.

<a name="50719-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_97">In east London, there is a problem with overcrowding on the Central line. I was on a train that was going into Liverpool Street station this morning, before I transferred to the Jubilee line at Stratford, where I can be guaranteed to get a seat. I certainly could not get one when I squeezed myself into a crowded carriage at Ilford station at about 7.30 this morning. That also applies at 8.30 and at 9.30; there is always pressure on that line into Liverpool Street.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_98">One of the consequences of Crossrail will be to increase capacity. It will also mean that people do not have to get out of the trains from Shenfield at Liverpool Street; they will be able to go beyond it and across London. They will no longer have to decant themselves on to the Central line, the District line or the Jubilee line, or perhaps go round the Metropolitan line to get on to the Northern line.

<a name="stpa_99">I have referred to the underground system. The other important benefit will be the links to the docklands light railway, the East London line and other routes that come into and across the city. The Secretary of State said that Crossrail had to form part of an integrated national network. That relates not only to the lines that come in from hundreds of miles away but to those in the greater south-east region, with its many millions of people who need to cross our capital city either for work, leisure or other reasons. Crossrail will at last give us the opportunity to create sensible, integrated cross-London routing and connections, which we would not otherwise have.

Crossrail will provide people from all of the UK with the ability to travel more easily across our capital city. It will provide an integrated link between different parts of the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-16_para9">
<a name="stpa_101">Crossrail represents an historic opportunity&#151;an opportunity that we missed a decade ago. When I first came into this place in 1992, I remember asking Steve Norris questions about it. Later, my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson) dealt with the matter, followed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar). Still later, it was the responsibility of the present Secretary of State for Defence, whose constituency name has changed but who, at the time, represented Motherwell. All kinds of Ministers have passed through during that period, and we had the frustration of not seeing the Bill introduced until right at the end of the previous Parliament. At last, we have a historic opportunity, which, as a country, we cannot afford to miss. This country needs Crossrail, London needs it, and millions of people will benefit from using it once it is built. I am therefore positive that we must go ahead.

 Clearly, there must be co-ordination. In relation to Pudding Mill lane station and other works, which are to be used both for the Olympics and Crossrail, planning of the engineering work will be necessary. Such issues need to be discussed before that work starts, and clearly, phasing is required. I am not an engineer or an expert, but I am sure that those who are experts can find ways of doing it. Obviously, it is vital that we have a successful Olympics, and that we have Crossrail built and running as soon as possible afterwards. We all need to recognise the realities and the practical issues, but I am sure that it is not beyond the wit of men and women to find a solution.

<a name="stpa_105">Crossrail is not without its critics, who come in all shapes and sizes. They include community groups that will be directly affected and, perhaps more surprisingly, Network Rail and many other players in the rail industry. I shall say more about that shortly, but first I shall focus on four main subjects: responses to the Crossrail Bill environmental statement, the rail industry&#039;s fears about the impact on freight and passenger services, the impact on the Olympics, and Crossrail&#039;s funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_106">The responses to the environmental statement may be the best indicator of what local communities will think of the Bill. A range of issues were raised and it is difficult to say which are the most important, but I shall list just a few: availability of the statement, alternative alignments for the central tunnel, alternative schemes, construction working hours, noise and pollution, location of spoils, spoil mountains, and locations of shafts and work site. One of the most significant issues, however, was whether the proposals complied with the relevant European Union directives. I know that the Government took on board concerns about the process by extending the time frame and making information more readily available, but I hope the Minister will confirm that he is satisfied that the statement complies with those directives in all respects.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_107">Many responses questioned the availability of evidence that alternative alignments had been considered. That applied to alternative alignments through Spitalfields and Whitechapel. There was also concern about proposed sites such as the one at Hanbury street, which I know also concerns some Members, and about the disposal of spoil at Mile End. I am sure that many if not all Members have been lobbied about alternative schemes by organisations such as Superlink, and I shall say more about that as well. The environmental statement acknowledges the requirement for an outline of the main alternatives studied by the applicant or appellant, but many respondents assert that it has not been met.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_108">The Bill has months, if not years, of work behind it. There is little evidence to suggest that Superlink has devoted the same effort, time and expenditure to its proposals: indeed, it is clear that it has not done so. It has, however, raised issues with which I hope the Minister will deal in a way that addresses my concerns and those felt, I suspect, by other Members. One of the main issues is funding. I appreciate that this is a hybrid Bill and that we are not here to discuss funding, but it must be a source of anxiety, given the scale of the project and the fact that so little is known about how it will be financed.

 The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the all-party group had discussions with Superlink earlier this week. I have to say that, personally, I was not at all convinced of the viability of its proposals. Questions are raised about the reliability of a system that is so dependent on existing operators and existing lines. Another problem is that Superlink has not actually published a route, so I do not know whether it proposes to tunnel under my high street or under my main station.
</p>





<p><a name="st_145"><a name="50719-17_spnew6"><b> Tom Brake: </b>

<p><a name="st_146"><a name="50719-17_spnew7"><b> Mr. Pickles: </b>

 If Superlink indeed has a secret plan, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, it would be entirely appropriate for it to be made a matter of public record. We must be able to see what the proposals amount to and what the proposed route is. It would be entirely honest to proceed in that way.

 I am going to rise to the defence of Superlink. It does not have the resources of the main Crossrail promoters.

<a name="stpa_112">The industry&#039;s view, with which I am sure all Members agree, is that Crossrail should be integrated in, and operated as part of, the national network&#151;the Secretary of State gave some reassurance on that point&#151;that it should be subject to the existing regulatory framework and managed by Network Rail within the existing operational structure. It believes that amendments will be required to recognise the rights of existing rail users, to ensure that there is sufficient capacity for existing and future rail users and to safeguard the independence of the Office of Rail Regulation. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us that no such amendments will be required, as the Government already intend those points to be covered by the development of the Bill.The industry has specific concerns about the Bill&#039;s impact. There will be a new-build project, similar to the channel tunnel rail link, and a major construction project around existing rail services. The Minister will not be surprised that the industry&#039;s solution involves Network Rail taking responsibility for changes to the existing infrastructure, although the new-build could be handled separately. There are great concerns about fragmentation, a theme that has run through many contributions, although to give him his due, the Secretary of State has partially addressed them. As the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) said, the industry has concerns about the operation of Crossrail and its integration with the existing network. I hope the Minister will be able to satisfy the House that those concerns are over-stated.

<a name="stpa_113">I have a few further points. A huge amount of work will be required for the Olympics. I understand that the Olympic team, the Crossrail team, Transport for London and the Mayor&#039;s office are all working closely together to ensure that there is proper integration and that the major works for Crossrail are not undertaken precisely when we need the transport network running smoothly in London. However, there is concern that the Crossrail Bill and the London Olympics Bill take different approaches to the Office of Rail Regulation.

<a name="stpa_117">The Bill is welcome and long overdue. It has the   potential to transform an unexceptional public transport system in London into a world-beating one. However, there is consensus among Opposition parties and other partners that the measure will require detailed scrutiny and that its remit must be allowed to extend to issues such as integration. Taxpayers, especially London-based taxpayers, whether business or private, will be paying for the project for many years to come. London has already had one millennium dome inflicted on it; it cannot afford another. Nor can it afford a 15-mile stretch of tunnel that improves services for London&#039;s commuters at the expense of the rest of the country.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_119">I am pleased to support the Second Reading of the Bill, which is hugely important to the future of transport in London. Transport is widely recognised as London&#039;s Achilles heel. It regularly features as one of the downsides of life in what is otherwise recognised as one of the most vibrant and successful cities in the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_120">The problem of poor transport in London reflects continuing failure over much of the second half of the last century to invest adequately in transport infrastructure. As the Secretary of State rightly reflected in his speech, there must be severe worries about London&#039;s future economic success if that inheritance of under-investment in transport is not made good. That is one of the key factors that we should bear in mind.

<br>&nbsp;<br>easing congestion on existing transport links. Developments in areas such as Southwark, Canary Wharf, north Greenwich, Canning Town and Stratford have all been enormously helped by the new Jubilee line. Crossrail has similar potential to ease congestion in central London and to support new development and regeneration, not least in the Thames Gateway area, which will be served by two links from Liverpool Street, one north of the river to Shenfield, the other passing through docklands south of the river to Abbey Wood.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_122">The scheme is not a new one. As we all know, it was first proposed in 1989, about 16 years ago, and progress has been painfully slow. Why is that? We all know that it is because of the cost. The scheme is highly expensive, depending on two new tunnels bored through central London&#151;major engineering works that have been conventionally costed at about &#163;10 billion, but, as the Secretary of State commented, the likely out-turn figures may be between &#163;15 billion and &#163;16 billion. That inevitably poses important and difficult questions about how the costs should be met, and specifically what the balance should be in the contributions respectively of the fare-paying users of the service, the general taxpayer and the business interests that stand to gain, some very significantly, from the project.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_123">The scope for substantial increases in values of property and of development sites adjoining and surrounding stations is increasingly understood. How best to recover a proportion of that planning gain is less well understood. In my view, it is essential for us to look carefully at this, in respect of Crossrail and other new rail and infrastructure developments, because I believe that this holds the key to making possible development that might otherwise not be regarded as economic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_124">What is not, in my view, sustainable is the defeatist notion that because of the scheme&#039;s high cost, further delay is inevitable or even desirable. We have already seen too long a delay in bringing forward the Crossrail scheme. Further cost-driven delay would be not just a mistake but counter-productive, as the ultimate costs of delivering an essential element for the resolution of London&#039;s transport problems would be even higher.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_125">A similar mistake to which, unfortunately, the scheme has already been subject, is the false economy of eliminating necessary and desirable elements so as to reduce the cost. That has occurred with the Woolwich station, which was an integral part of the earlier proposals, but which has been deleted from the current scheme&#151;albeit with the site of the station still safeguarded&#151;purely for cost-saving reasons. If ever there was an illustration of the penny wise, pound foolish mentality, this is it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_126">Woolwich is a major transport hub for a significant area of south-east London and is the focus of ambitious regeneration plans. Badly hit by the recessions of the 1980s and early 1990s and the decline of the traditional heavy industry that was the source of Woolwich&#039;s prosperity in the 19th and 20th centuries, it is at last beginning to see revival, with successful regeneration of the former Woolwich arsenal site. That incipient recovery would be given a huge boost by a new station involving rapid transport links to central and west London. The regeneration benefits of a Crossrail station at Woolwich are enormous.

<p>
<a name="50719-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_127">Not only would that opportunity be lost if the scheme progressed without a station at Woolwich, but there would be very serious transport disadvantages. There would be literally no stations over a six-mile section of the railway between Custom House and Abbey Wood. Furthermore, potential passengers from a wide swathe of south-east London would have no easy point of access to Crossrail. The only south-east London station would be Abbey Wood, which is not well placed to meet the needs of travellers from much of the Greenwich and Lewisham areas, and does not have the benefit of being a major transport hub, as is a Woolwich.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_128">Supporters of Crossrail in south-east London to whom I have spoken in recent months are almost unanimous in recognising the very substantial transport and regeneration benefits of a Woolwich station. Most are astonished at the proposal that the trains should pass underneath Woolwich without stopping, when there is a very suitable location for a station already safeguarded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-18_para12">
<a name="stpa_129">Those of us who represent the London borough of Greenwich are sadly familiar with short-sighted thinking of that nature on previous infrastructure projects. The original Jubilee line proposal did not include a station at North Greenwich. Without it, the regeneration of the former British Gas site, derelict and heavily polluted, would never have taken place, with 12,500 new homes now being built on that site&#151;a major contribution to the Thames Gateway&#151;and the millennium dome. Whatever people feel about the millennium dome&#151;I think particularly of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake), who made a predictably negative comment, probably not thinking about it&#151;this project has had a huge impact on the regeneration of formerly derelict and abandoned industrial land, and the dome will provide a magnificent site for the gymnastics in the Olympic games in London in 2012. None of that would have happened if there had not been a station at North Greenwich. Fortunately, common sense prevailed. The North Greenwich station was built and it has been not just a catalyst for regeneration, but is proving to be a thriving transport hub.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-18_para13">
<a name="stpa_130">A few years later we went through an eerily similar process with the docklands light railway extension to Greenwich and Lewisham. Believe it or not, one of the cost-cutting proposals before that scheme got the go-ahead was to eliminate the station at Cutty Sark, one of London&#039;s most popular tourist destinations. Once again, our community in Greenwich had to run a high-profile campaign to reverse that false economy. Fortunately, we won. Cutty Sark station is now one of the most heavily used on the DLR network and the very idea of DLR trains passing underneath that site but not stopping is self-evidently ludicrous.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-18_para14">
<a name="stpa_131">I must question the sense of the Department for Transport in once again proposing to eliminate a very significant station in the borough of Greenwich as a cost-cutting measure. Conspiracy theorists&#151;I am not one&#151;might suspect a vendetta against our part of London. I prefer to attribute this to a cock-up rather than to a conspiracy. That is why I tabled an amendment instructing the Select Committee to have regard to the benefit of a station in Woolwich and its economic, transport and regeneration implications.

<a name="50719-18_para15">
<a name="stpa_132">I shall briefly raise two points before concluding. The issue of conflict with freight and other users of the railway has been raised by a number of hon. Members, not least the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan). It is a very important issue and we have a specific concern about south-east London. A very large aggregates depot, which serves the Thames Gateway area and is likely to be a major source of aggregates for the Olympics and Crossrail as well as the Thames Gateway development, is sited in my constituency near the Angerstein junction. IT includes a freight link for very large quantities of aggregate brought in from the midlands by aggregate industries. Representatives of those industries have written to me, rightly expressing concern that their business could be affected by the proposals. It is not just a question of potential conflict for access to the track; there are also implications if reduced access were to lead to increased track access charges, which could make the rail transport of aggregates non-economic, in which case there would be a very substantial transfer of aggregate from rail to road, with huge environmental implications. Those issues need to be looked at very carefully indeed.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_133">Finally, I shall say a few words about the timetable for the Crossrail works and the interface, in more senses than one, with the London Olympic games. Two major infrastructure projects on that scale will undoubtedly put pressure on the capacity of the construction industry. There are implications for prices, skills and general capacity issues. There are also conflicts relating to one or more sites where works would need to be undertaken for both Crossrail and the Olympics. Those difficulties will need to be carefully addressed, but I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench will not allow these challenges to be used as an excuse for further substantial delay in the Crossrail project.

There are great citadels of wealth in Canary Wharf and the City of London, with hardly a local person working in them. In the City of London, where tens of thousands of people work, there are only 88 Bangladeshis working in white collar jobs. Less than 10 per cent. of the people who work in Canary Wharf come from Tower Hamlets, and no one is able to give us a demographic breakdown of that 10 per cent.

The possibility of tunnelling from the ends instead of going through Spitalfields was produced after the environmental statement and after it was demanded by residents, who are not engineers.

Some 60 per cent. of the population of Spitalfields Banglatown are of Bangladeshi origin. A growing and visible Somali minority lives in the area and there is a small indigenous white community. There is also a new group of young, upwardly mobile professionals in the area, who moved there precisely because it was the area that it was, but for six or seven long years it will be a ground zero.

It will go past people&#039;s houses&#151;inches from their windows in some cases, and feet away in others. Ten-tonne lorries will come and go through this small, densely populated, poor, disadvantaged and multiply deprived area at the rate of one every five minutes, with consequent dangers for children at local schools and the health of local people&#151;and male life expectancy in that part of London is already 6 per cent. less than that throughout London as a whole.

They are doing to the east end what they would not dare do to the west end because they would not get away with it in the west end. The political representatives in the west end would raise such a hue and cry that it would be politically impossible to do such a thing.

<p>
<a name="50719-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_160">Last year, almost 1 billion journeys were made on the London underground and, in the 10 years since 1994&#150;95, there has been a 40 per cent. increase in mainline rail travel between London and the south-east and a 22 per cent. increase in mainline rail journeys in London itself. Our population as a city is predicted to grow by 700,000 by 2016, which will increase the demands on our rail infrastructure. During the gestation of Crossrail from the first Bill to this, my constituency has seen the development of Heathrow airport, with a fourth and now a fifth terminal. As a result of lack of investment in public transport, journeys by car, lorry and other vehicles to that airport are making my constituency the most air polluted in the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_161">Concerns about the timing of the construction of Crossrail have been mentioned. It is disappointing that we cannot plan major projects such as the London Olympics and Crossrail to coincide. However, I wholeheartedly welcome some parts of the Bill. Clause 34, for example, disapplies the prohibition in section 25 of the Railways Act 1993 on public sector operators providing passenger services. That is a major commitment to public service operation. One might even describe it as an advance for democratic socialism, but I do not want to go too far.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_162">There are a number of concerns about the Bill, such as network control. When we debated the Railways Bill      earlier this year, we identified unnecessary fragmentation and lack of clear lines of accountability and control as the worst features of the privatisation of      rail. The Railways Act 2005 therefore gave Network Rail additional responsibilities for railway infrastructure. That was reinforced in the Warwick agreement between the Labour party and the trade unions, which clearly stated that Network Rail was to oversee all rail engineering work. I would welcome ministerial confirmation that Network Rail will have responsibility for the oversight of maintenance and renewals on Crossrail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_163">Concern has been expressed about freight and it is important that we ensure that Crossrail will bring environmental benefits. We are therefore looking for assurances that freight currently moved by rail on the great eastern and great western main lines is not put in jeopardy. Crossrail could temporarily cut off a number of freight terminals on both those lines and lead to the closure of the rail-connected concrete plant in Royal Oak. It would be useful to have a ministerial assurance that freight currently moved by rail will not lose out because of the Crossrail project.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_164">Mention has been made of the costs of the project. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow that, given that the legislation will make such a hefty requirement of the public sector should costs fall on it, it is extraordinary that the Bill does not identify where funding will come from. I suggest that the rail proposal will significantly benefit London&#039;s business community and that the project therefore provides the Government with an excellent opportunity to explore some innovative ways of meeting the Crossrail costs from the private sector. The very principle that those who benefit should contribute to the cost of the scheme should be in the legislation.

<br>&nbsp;<br>published in June 2004 on behalf of the passenger transport executive showed, for example, that the city of Lyons can raise more than &#163;100 million a year from a dedicated payroll tax that can be levied on all firms, both public and private, at up to 1.75 per cent. of the company payroll. Lyons has a population of about 1.4 million; by comparison, London&#039;s population is in excess of 7 million. A payroll tax levied at, say, 1.63 per cent. would raise more than &#163;500 million a year. Over five years that would amount to &#163;2.5 billion towards the cost of the Crossrail project in the capital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_166">As the railway will greatly assist the airport, I suggest that we look to BAA for a contribution. At its annual general meeting on Friday, BAA announced profits of more than &#163;500 million. Surely it can pay something towards a project of major benefit to the airport. In Paris, there is also a levy on employers and half the revenue raised from traffic and parking fines goes to transport investment. The RMT-commissioned &quot;Funding London Underground&quot; report last year looked at the state and the city of New York, which fund grants and subsidies accounting for 46 per cent. of the metropolitan transportation authority funding. A large proportion of subsidy comes from hypothecated taxation, which in principle at least is targeted at non-fare paying beneficiaries of the scheme in the private sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_167">Mention has been made by my hon. Friends of the increase in land values. Now is the ideal time to explore the concept of land value taxation on those who will benefit directly from the development of Crossrail. Experience of the Jubilee line demonstrates just how land values and property prices can soar in an area and provide an adequate source of financing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_168">In London, we have long complained about lack of investment in the manufacturing of rolling stock. In the past few years, there have been significant job losses in the rail manufacturing and maintenance sector at sites including Birmingham Washwood Heath, Eastleigh and Derby, as well as in the capital. It is regrettable that the new high-speed trains for the proposed integrated Kent franchise will be built in Japan and not in Britain. Crossrail gives us the opportunity to kick-start a recovery in the manufacturing of railway stock in the UK as a railway workshop. I therefore encourage the Government to bring all their influence to bear to ensure that new rolling stock for Crossrail is manufactured and maintained in Britain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_169">Having objected to the original Crossrail scheme, largely because of the implications of the development of the Heathrow express for my constituents, I should say that such objections no longer exist in my constituency, except in companies that want some certainty about the development of the project. Companies and homes have been blighted for a long time as a result of the proposals. We desperately need a decision in principle and on the time scale. We want clarification of precisely which areas of land will be affected and for what period. That will allow companies such as Leemark Engineering and H. G. Timber in Hayes and Lafarge Aggregates to plan in the short term for the length of their operation on their present site and, if necessary, in the long term, for relocation.

 My hon. Friend rightly talks of the need for a decision in principle because uncertainty is a problem, but does he agree that, before that can be taken, people who might support the Bill need to know about the ongoing revenue consequences of the capital programme? Until that is known, how can we expect people to support the programme with hard cash?

<p><a name="st_158"><a name="50719-20_spnew2"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 That is a good point&#151;the issue needs to be addressed in the ongoing debate. The benefits to a number of constituencies, to the environment and to the economy of London and the south-east and of the country as a whole, warrant some public sector commitment to the ongoing revenue funding, and that should come from public taxation. I accept that there might be growth in the subsidy that will be required, but that burden can be borne by business and through public taxation in the long term. That is why I urge the Government to look now at both the capital and revenue costs and establish a system such as those across Europe and the United States that enable projects to be adequately funded from hypothecated taxation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_170">The issue of certainty leads me to that of compensation. There is reference in the Bill to the usual compensation for compulsory purchase. I hope that we have a debate on the Floor of the House about the compensation that will be awarded to people for protection of their homes following any environmental impact and for any relocation. I am concerned that the levels that were discussed when the issue was first considered 15 years ago will not be adequate to meet the demands of relocation, or even the costs of short-term operation, as affected by transportation issues and other environmental impacts of the construction of the rail.

 I have long been a supporter of Crossrail. Indeed, I believe that Crossrail is a very good idea. However, the handling of the Bill so far suggests that Crossrail is a very good idea that is going badly wrong, in several ways. First, it is going wrong in relation to the impact on services on the main rail network; secondly, it is going wrong in relation to the interaction of Crossrail with the main rail network; and, thirdly, it is going wrong in relation to the impact that it will have on the principle of independent economic regulation, because of the powers that the Bill will give to the Secretary of State to give priority to Crossrail over and above the judgment made by the Office of Rail Regulation.

However, I am concerned to learn that the legal advice is that the instruction is just that and that it will not be possible for the Committee to consider matters not in the instruction&#151;specifically, the termini.

 As I understand it, the legal opinion is that the Committee can look at matters that are within its terms of reference, which encompass the Bill and the instruction. In those circumstances, it is hard to see how the Committee will be able to consider the issues of Reading, the Olympics or the wider implications for the rail network, both freight and passenger, that that the Crossrail project may have.

<p><a name="st_161"><a name="50719-21_spnew2"><b> Mrs. May: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. Several of us were comforted by the comments made by the Secretary of State earlier, but if the Committee will not be able to consider the location of the termini&#151;and whether the line should be extended to Reading&#151;it will make a mockery of the Secretary of State&#039;s remarks this afternoon and of the Government&#039;s intention to consider whether to safeguard the line through to Reading. I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify the position when he winds up.

<p><a name="st_162"><a name="50719-21_spnew3"><b> Peter Luff: </b> 
 It may assist my right hon. Friend and the House if I say that I have sought advice on that point. The clear advice that I have received is that the instruction is precisely that&#151;an instruction&#151;and it would not be possible for the Chairman of the Committee to go beyond Maidenhead in consideration of the Bill. That is the advice at present, and that is why I would like a debate on the instruction, but we are denied that. It is important that the Minister give a definitive undertaking on that point when he winds up, because otherwise I will be obliged to vote against the instruction.

<p><a name="st_163"><a name="50719-21_spnew4"><b> Mrs. May: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a valid point. I hope that the Minister will give a definitive view on that issue, but I also hope that he will go further. If the legal advice that my hon. Friend mentions is indeed correct, and the Committee will not be able to go beyond the specific instruction from the House, I hope that the Minister will tell us how representations can properly be made in the debate on the Bill on the possibility of extending the line to Reading.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_174">The Crossrail line could be of enormous benefit to my constituents, but the services proposed would unfortunately ensure that they would receive a worse train service than they currently receive. The extension of the line to Reading could provide benefits, not only for my constituents using the Maidenhead and Twyford stations and the two branch lines to Henley and to Marlow and Bourne End, but for the constituents of my   hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson) and the hon. Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter). The hon. Gentleman earlier made an unkind reference to Maidenhead when he said that rail

Members: &quot;Hear, hear.&quot;] I am grateful to my hon. Friends for their support for those wonderful places.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_175">The branch line will be affected by the services, but the main line network will be particularly affected, because after Crossrail, Maidenhead station will receive only four services in peak hours. Far from having fast and semi-fast services direct to Paddington or stopping only at Slough, the services will in future stop at 10, 11 or 12 stations before Paddington. I have recently had a significant debate with First Great Western&#151;indeed, I raised the matter in an Adjournment debate&#151;about the fact that its December timetable last year extended the length of the journey from Maidenhead to Paddington from 20 or 21 minutes to 25 or 26 minutes. The Crossrail proposals would see that time double to 40 minutes or longer. The benefit of Crossrail to my constituents would be if one could take a fast or semi-fast service from Maidenhead to Paddington and then access the west end or the City without changing. If the journey to Paddington is on a stopping service, the benefit will be lost.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_176">I have described the impact on passengers from Maidenhead, but those who access Twyford station, either directly or by the branch line from Henley through Wargrave, will face an even worse problem. They currently enjoy up to seven services an hour in peak times, but that would be reduced to two services an hour under the Crossrail proposals. I noted that the Secretary of State said that Crossrail would bring benefits to the south-east. He also said that it would be wholly beneficial to suburban lines, but I have news for him. For Maidenhead and Twyford suburban lines, it will not be wholly beneficial.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_177">The Secretary of State also said that one need not worry about services to the west of London, because those went on the main line and Crossrail would go on the relief lines. The whole debate about the December timetable from my constituency has revealed that all the stopping services and the suburban services have been moved from the main line to the relief lines, and they will have to share those lines with Crossrail. It simply will not be possible for the services to be improved from what they are today. In fact, the services will deteriorate. I am therefore surprised by the categoric statements that the Secretary of State made earlier about the benefits of the proposal for everybody in the south-east. Taking the line to Reading would have significant benefits for my constituents, because those travelling from Twyford would be able to use the service, provided that the services to Paddington were fast or semi-fast.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_178">The biggest physical effect on my constituency would arise from electrification of the line, which would lead to gantries being built on Brunel&#039;s bridge at Maidenhead. That bridge remains the longest brick arch bridge in the world and it is part of our national railway heritage. The view across Brunel&#039;s bridge would be changed by the erection of electrification gantries. I have raised with Crossrail and Network Rail the possibility of a third rail system, but that is apparently out of the question because it would be far too expensive and the systems could not be mixed and matched along the line. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1164</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>However, I urge the Government to ensure that the debate about electrification includes consideration of innovative ways to ensure that the impact on Brunel&#039;s bridge is as light as possible. We recognise that there will be some impact, but Crossrail, sadly, has shown no desire to try to ensure that it reduces that impact as far as possible. That is an issue to which I shall return during consideration of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_179">The Bill gives the railway the possibility of taking over Guards Club park. That means that lorries will be taken through a residential part of Maidenhead into a park that is used by families, including children. It is a major benefit to Maidenhead. Sadly, Crossrail has refused to consider innovative ways of accessing the work site at Brunel&#039;s bridge. For goodness&#039; sake, it is over a river, and the park is next to a river. It would be possible to use the river to provide some access for the heavy materials that need to be moved in, and not bring them in by road through the park. I hope that that will be able to reduce the use of the park.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_180">There are two further points that concern me. The first point is whether Crossrail is part of the main rail network. My constituents have no desire to be part of the Mayor of London&#039;s transport scheme. The idea that Transport for London could take responsibility for the line through to its terminus at Maidenhead fills me and, I believe, most of my constituents with horror. I trust that the Minister will be able to give us a definitive statement that the project will be part of the main rail network and that it will not be handed over wholly to the Mayor of London, for him to increase his orbit and ambit through the west of London on to Maidenhead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_181">Central to whether the project is part of the main rail network is the question of independent economic regulation. I challenged the Secretary of State on that question. The Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to give Crossrail priority over other rail services. At present, the situation is clear: there is a balance of priorities that is struck by an independent economic regulator, which is the Office of Rail Regulation. I have a tinge of sadness that we have moved away from the previous rail regulator, Mr. Tom Winsor, who was known for his trenchant comments to the Government about what was happening on the railways, to the Office of Rail Regulation, which I fear that few people have heard of since it took over from Mr. Winsor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_182">In January 2004, in a statement on the future of the railways, the Secretary of State said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;the principle of independent economic regulation for the railways is essential and will be central to our proposals.&quot;&#151;<i>[Official Report, 19 January 2004; Vol. 416, c.1078.]</i></p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_183">Those were proposals for the future of the rail network. Sadly, the Bill is entirely contrary to that statement. The Bill will take Crossrail away from the Office of Rail Regulation and enables priority to be established outside of that regulator. That has implications not only for Crossrail and the railways but for independent economic regulation throughout the raft of industries and utilities in this country. I urge the Government to think again on that aspect of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_184">Crossrail could be of enormous benefit to my constituents, but what is proposed in the hybrid Bill that is before us is not of benefit to them. I trust that, over the next year or more, we will be able to ensure that the Crossrail that is built is one that reflects a good idea and is of benefit to the south-east, and not the proposal that, sadly, is going badly wrong today.

<p><a name="st_164"><a name="50719-22_spnew0"><b> Jon Cruddas  (Dagenham) (Lab):</b> 
 I echo the support for the Bill offered by my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), who spoke about economic development in the east of London. A durable Thames Gateway requires integrated transport links that offer access to town centres and job generation sites. Crossrail is to be welcomed as it will develop a rail spine for the London Thames Gateway, providing fast-track links between London&#039;s three central grid districts of Canary wharf, the City and the west end. Crossrail is needed to help manage the huge population movements into and within the boundaries of the capital. I shall focus primarily on that important element in my contribution. However, concerns about the present route and its impact on local communities deserve to be discussed and the very nature of the hybrid Bill will allow those detailed concerns to be considered. It is to be hoped that compromises can be found to accommodate affected residents, including those whom I represent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_185">Let us consider Crossrail in terms of population movements into London. London&#039;s population stands at about 7.3 million, just short of the combined population of Rome, Paris, Vienna and Brussels. As far as I can ascertain, it is the only major European capital that is growing. The Mayor of London&#039;s plan estimates a further population growth of about 800,000 by 2016. That is about an extra 17,000 people net per year. London is seen increasingly as a world city, with about 50 separate national and ethnic communities scattered across it and about 300 languages spoken.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_186">According to figures provided by the Office for National Statistics for the period 1992&#150;2003, annual inflows of international migrants into the capital more than doubled from under 100,000 to about 200,000. At the same time we can assume that many of the recently estimated stock of illegal workers are resident in the capital. We do not know whether the latest survey estimate of about 570,000 such individuals includes independants. We can assume that London retains a disproportionate number of those currently within the asylum application process&#151;for example, a high proportion of the 280,000 individual failed asylum seekers, as estimated by the ONS. These figures do not appear to include dependants. In short, the dynamic at work in terms of population flows into the capital is extraordinary, but it remains unquantifiable in terms of the real levels of immigration and economic activity. It can be said, however, that the figure of 7.3 million is likely to be a severe underestimate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_187">Against that backdrop we can consider population movements within London. The extraordinary movement of people into the city requires a suitable public policy response in respect of public services and resource distribution. Yet we must assume that the baseline for public policy making severely understates the number of people living in the city. Rapid immigration has occurred alongside dramatic inflation in property prices, which has pushed immigrant groups, both legal and illegal, into the poorest parts of the capital and those areas with the lowest-cost housing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_188">My constituency sits at the centre of the Thames Gateway. It covers much of the London riverside area&#151;that is part of the gateway&#151;and has a massive amount of brownfield land. It has the lowest-cost housing

<br>&nbsp;<br>market in Greater London. There is a growing private housing market through the consequential effects of the right-to-buy policy. Across the London riverside area, and excluding Barking town centre, we anticipate building about 20,000 new homes over the next 10 to 15 years. Population growth estimates range up to about a 60,000 population increase in the small borough over the next 10 years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_189">Before that development, the population was already increasing dramatically through the dynamic internal population movement within the capital. The trend decline in the borough&#039;s population has dramatically reversed over the past few years. There are some estimates that the population has increased by anything up to 20,000 since 2001. This in turn is likely to lead to an underestimate of population movements locally in terms of both illegal migrants and those within the asylum system. Those facts are useful in terms of considering some of the macro-economic London-wide considerations in the Crossrail debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_190">The only way in which we can manage population movements into the capital is to seek to rebalance the city and open up the east side. The economic centre of gravity must move to the east as we, in effect, tilt the capital. That is why the Thames Gateway debate is so important. The interest in it has been reinforced over the past couple of years by the strategy of national Government who have established the Thames Gateway as a national priority, with its own dedicated Cabinet Sub-Committee, MISC 22. That policy is obviously conditioned by the housing crisis in the south-east.
</p>





<p><a name="st_165"><a name="50719-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. Mark Field </b> 
: How does the hon. Gentleman believe that there will be a shift in the planned development in the Thames Gateway, which I think that we all support, much as it means the centre of gravity, as he rightly said, of London going eastwards? How does he feel that that will be affected by our winning the Olympic bid and the obvious focus of regeneration over the next seven years, specifically in the Lea valley?
</p>





<p><a name="st_166"><a name="50719-22_spnew2"><b> Jon Cruddas: </b> 
 I was about to touch on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_191">It seems that Crossrail is an illustrative example of the infrastructural investment that is needed to the east side of the city to handle dramatic population movements into and within the city. It is needed also as a lever for other transport infrastructural links into the central spine that is thereby created.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_192">Business development and relocation, as well as the decanting of the population will result from the Olympic bid. I am part of the London riverside action group, which anticipates a great deal of business relocation as a result of the development of the Olympic site. All roads lead back to the transmission belt or the transport infrastructural network that is being developed across the east side of the city, the spine of which remains Crossrail. Because of population movements and the needs of the east side of town I was always in favour of Crossrail going through the royal docks, Barking, Dagenham and Rainham, rather than along the Shenfield line. That proposal disappeared a few years ago, but it is part of the joined-up strategy that we all seek.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_193">Returning to the dynamic of the housing market, growth is constrained across the economy because of the lower interest rate which, however, may ignite south-

<br>&nbsp;<br>east house price inflation. As a result, a priority for the Government&#039;s macro-economic strategy is surely house building in the south-east. That would allow for medium-term economic growth, everything else being equal, accompanied by a lower rate of interest. Similarly our prospective entry into the euro, if anyone is still interested in that, is conditioned by applying the brake on the housing market in the south-east. If we are seeking both macro-economic inhibitors on growth and the management of the population growth in the capital, all roads lead eastwards. Nationally and in the offices of the Mayor of London, Crossrail is seen as the key infrastructural project needed to support macro-economic strategy and managed population growth. It will help to rebalance growth by supporting house building and simultaneously offer London a route map to manage its population within the capital&#039;s borders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_194">For the Government and the Mayor the case for Crossrail rests on technical macro-economics and pan-London population issues. I look at the issue very differently, however, and regard Crossrail as offering a local case for infrastructure. The city&#039;s dynamics far exceed the ability of public policy and national Government to keep track of it, let alone get ahead. London is growing dramatically, and the official, lagged statistics do not even begin to tell the real story. The state tends to operate within static models of resource distribution on the basis of outmoded population statistics. Those formal statistics do not begin to quantify the real patterns of immigration, on which we tacitly rely to underpin the growth of public services and the private service sector in the capital. Immigration also builds the labour market flexibility so desired by the business community, as reflected in recent comments by the Governor of the Bank of England. Yet we hide away from the debate about immigration and its macro-economic consequences.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_195">The development of the Thames Gateway often appears to be a technical abstract debate conducted by the regeneration professionals, but in reality it is occurring in communities like mine as we speak. It is not some future blueprint for 2015 but a method for understanding the day-to-day momentum of the capital. Because the state is ill-equipped to deal with that dynamic as a result of lagged decision making and an underestimate of the population, huge tensions have developed. In my own constituency, for example, the local community is experiencing rapid transformation. It is growing and changing rapidly to help accommodate movements into and within the city. That change is taking place against the backdrop of a long-term legacy    of underinvestment in public services and infrastructure together with patterns of enduring poverty. Fundamental tensions result from those legacies, contemporary changes and the sustainability of future developments under the banner of the Thames Gateway.

 The proposed route of Crossrail runs north of the Thames Gateway. Given the need to assist with regeneration, does the hon. Gentleman agree that an earlier proposal for the route to run south of the area would help solve the transit issues that affect his constituency and my adjoining constituency?

<p><a name="st_168"><a name="50719-23_spnew1"><b> Jon Cruddas: </b>

<p>
<a name="50719-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_196">The tensions in my community are manifest in the form of the far right and British National party activity. There have been five council by-elections in the past year, and the BNP have averaged 33 per cent. of the vote. Its members seek to pull the community apart, playing on its limited resources, great need and the rapid change that will continue in future. That is the context in which I view the debate on Crossrail. It is a test case for the Government&#039;s aim to build genuinely sustainable communities. That is why I preferred the original plan to build Crossrail along the north shore of the Thames Gateway through Barking, Dagenham and Rainham before looping round to the south of the Thames. That proposal has been lost, but if we are seeking to manage the huge population movements across the city within the capital&#039;s borders, the Shenfield line is not logical.

<p><a name="st_169"><a name="50719-23_spnew2"><b> Mr. Pickles </b> 
: I agree with the hon. Gentleman.
</p>





<p><a name="st_170"><a name="50719-23_spnew3"><b> Jon Cruddas: </b> 
 I am not sure why that proposal was abandoned. If our aim is achieve spatial economic policy making and an accompanying transport infrastructure, it would be interesting to know why that route was dropped in the debates that preceded today&#039;s decision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_197">In my locality, we do not have a sustainable agenda because population movements far exceed resource distribution year on year against the backdrop of a difficult economic and social legacy. The debate about regeneration in the Thames Gateway needs to be presented anew, and with greater urgency. Over the past few years we have become preoccupied with debates about institutions, including the setting up of an urban development corporation and the role of the London Development Agency, the sub-regional regeneration partnerships and the boroughs, at the expense of the project&#039;s vision. We have become preoccupied with housing units as a result of the state&#039;s macro-economic concerns. Locally, that has contaminated the regeneration debate, especially as it has arisen alongside growing distributional tensions about resources as the community undergoes dramatic change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_198">Three developments in the past two weeks may signal a change of direction in the development of east London. First, the successful Olympic bid will become a vehicle for driving resources into the east of the city. Secondly, the recent terrorist atrocities have allowed us to reconsider the vibrant and global nature of the city in which we live, its engine being immigration. Thirdly, the debate about Crossrail demonstrates what is needed, not for some future community, but for our dynamic city today. I hope that the cumulative effect of those three developments will initiate a new debate about economic development in east London that allows us to go back to the first principles of the vision that we are trying to achieve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_199">Moving from the abstract to the specific, I shall focus on the concerns of my local community. It goes without saying that investments of this scale throw up genuine local concerns. A previous hybrid Bill, for example, led to concerns about the channel tunnel rail link, which goes underground in my constituency as it heads into the centre of town. The Crossrail Action Group has voiced many legitimate arguments about the location of the proposed depot in Romford. Although the depot is outside Dagenham, residents who live in Salcombe, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1169</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Coombewood and Saville roads in my constituency have genuine concerns, especially about the increase in heavy goods vehicles using the local highways. Serious problems relate to road safety, and I am concerned that a deal may have been agreed between Havering council and Crossrail to amend the preferred route for HGV vehicles entering and leaving the proposed construction site at Westlands playing fields. That outcome is unacceptable to my local council and to me, as it would clearly increase the danger posed by traffic to schoolchildren travelling to and from Warren comprehensive school, of which I am a governor, as well as Warren junior and Furze infant schools. We must address such issues as the Bill proceeds, for example when the codes on construction practice are agreed and when the location of the depot in Romford is decided.
</p>





<p><a name="st_171"><a name="50719-23_spnew4"><b> Andrew Rosindell </b> 
: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the full council of the London borough of Havering passed a resolution only two weeks ago strongly opposing all the Crossrail proposals, including one on that issue?
</p>





<p><a name="st_172"><a name="50719-23_spnew5"><b> Jon Cruddas: </b> 
 I am aware of that. The borough of Barking and Dagenham supports the development of Crossrail, although it is concerned about some of the local implications of the re-routing of the HGV traffic that I mentioned away from some of the roads in the Romford area into Whalebone Lane North and the junction with the A12 in my constituency. We will have to work through those issues. Indeed, the Secretary of State gave responses that will ensure that we can work them through. I hope that accommodations and concessions can be made in the interests of all our constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_200">Overall, Crossrail is vital to the UK and to London, and to the communities of east London. It is a key building block for managing the growth of the city and providing the infrastructure for effective strategic London planning over the next decades. I therefore strongly support the Bill and appreciate the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate, and particularly grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) for bringing Isambard Kingdom Brunel into our considerations. My reading of schedule 8 suggests that technically the bridge that he built, which was such a triumph, and the bridge that was subsequently built to exactly the same design when the line was widened could be demolished, although I do not believe that the Secretary of State would condone such an act of vandalism.

<a name="stpa_201">It is good that Brunel has been mentioned in the debate, as he built the first Crossrail. There is nothing new about what we are debating today. The first trains to go across London were Great Western trains, which went underground at Paddington and all the way to Aldgate. They were not viable and were withdrawn. I am sure that economic conditions in London have changed since then, but it is worth noting that there is nothing new about Crossrail&#151;we have had it before.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_202">In principle, I support the idea of improving east-west rail links. Crossrail is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make a difference to transport in the south-east, which could also benefit long-distance travellers, including those from my constituency, but if the country is to spend the kind of money envisaged by the Bill, we need to provide more than the Crossrail project offers. We all agree that we must do something. The project outlined in the Bill is something, therefore we must do that. That dangerous train of logic must not seduce us into thinking that the Bill automatically deserves our support tonight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_203">I shall speak primarily about my constituents&#039; interests. That is what I am here to do, and I am clear that the Bill is in direct contradiction to their interests. It is the end of all the dreams that we have in Worcestershire along the Cotswold line of improving the service to the level that we ought to have. Only last week, I believe, the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster), jointly with the chamber of commerce for Hereford and Worcester, wrote a letter to the Secretary of State asking for the track between Oxford and Worcester to be dualled all the way and for a better service. They should have done that when the Strategic Rail Authority&#039;s route utilisation strategy was up for grabs. That was the time to do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_204">If the Bill passes tonight in its current form, forget it. It is not worth spending the money on doing that because there will not be the capacity between Reading and Paddington for the additional services that we want. The Secretary of State spoke reassuringly about maintaining current service levels. Current service levels between Worcestershire and London are a scandal. They do not need to be maintained; they need to be dramatically improved. Since the new Adelante rolling stock has gone on to the First Great Western service, loadings have gone through the roof. It is standing room only on most trains. There is a market there crying out to be met, to take people off the roads and put them back on to the railways. Forget it, if the Bill passes.

<p>
<a name="50719-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_205">The Bill may well be an emperor, if not with no clothes, then with very few indeed. The aspect that could persuade me is the Reading-Maidenhead issue. If we could end the railway at Reading, not Maidenhead, with fast and semi-fast services instead of the ridiculous proposed crawling services beyond Paddington, I might be persuaded. I could happily get off a train at Reading, change to a semi-fast service into the centre of London, near where I wanted to be, but I am not prepared to get off a train at Reading, which I will almost certainly have to do, with fewer trains going through to Paddington, make a journey to Maidenhead or God knows where else, and then get on to the underground when I get to London. It is just not acceptable.

<a name="stpa_206">We must consider the instruction to the Select Committee. I have raised the matter privately with the Secretary of State and he may by now be in a position to give definitive guidance. It is clear that the instruction is an instruction: it is what it says on the can. The Select Committee can do nothing but obey it. The Government are instructing the Select Committee not to consider anything beyond the terminus laid down in the Bill, which is Maidenhead. That means I must vote against the instruction, because it is fundamentally wrong. I hope that when the Minister winds up, he will be able to

He said those were matters more properly left to the Standing Committee stage of the Bill. Because of Bill&#039;s hybrid nature, some of those have cross-reference to the private sector implications of the Bill and should be considered by the Select Committee. I do not accept his argument in totality, although it has a good deal of validity.

It began as one, but the more I considered it, driven by the issue of capacity between Maidenhead and Paddington, I realised that it was not just one or two objections, but such diverse elements as the impact on the existing rail network, funding, the narrowness of the design, the regulatory framework, and the failure to examine alternative solutions beyond the proposal in the Bill.

<br>&nbsp;<br>of my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper), who is extremely concerned, as am I, about the capacity issues. The fact that the attendance is relatively sparse tonight probably owes something to the change of business. Let us consider my hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-23_para17">
<a name="stpa_213">Crossrail will pose serious difficulties during construction and beyond. It is a massive project. It will be comparable to a combination of the second phase of the channel tunnel rail link&#151;the tunnelling under London and into St. Pancras, which is new build&#151;and the west coast route modernisation, which is a major construction project. It will be lengthy and undoubtedly very disruptive to existing services. Along the two principal routes 2,200 freight, commuter, long-distance passenger and airport services per day will be affected. The Great Western route from Paddington to Maidenhead and the Great Eastern route from Shenfield to Liverpool Street will be seriously affected. The most noticeable impact will be on train services during engineering periods that require route closures. That will put huge pressure on other transport modes. If the work is carried out during the Olympics, God help us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-23_para18">
<a name="stpa_214">Paddington will have particularly serious problems. The Bill allows for it to be shut for a month for construction purposes. We can bet our bottom dollar that it will end up being more than a month. Operations will be severely affected for several years during the construction of Crossrail, mainly because of the closure of Eastbourne terrace for that period and the changes required to the operational railway network. Network Rail&#039;s initial analysis suggests that some parts of the station will become unusable and that passenger flows will be severely affected. Taxis are a particular difficulty, because it would be a problem if Olympic athletes could not get taxis at Paddington.

<a name="stpa_215">I shall not labour the point about freight terminals, which have already been discussed, but the severe disruption might mean that building materials and other goods are not delivered to London by rail and are displaced on to the roads, which would have severe environmental effects.

<a name="stpa_216">I have discussed the construction phase, but what about the operational phase? Demand will be high and the operation will be intense. The network is already close to capacity, but the Bill will create no new capacity between Maidenhead and Paddington and between Shenfield and Liverpool Street. After construction, the capacity for freight and passenger services running west of Paddington to Cornwall, Devon, Bristol, north Somerset, Gloucestershire, south Wales, west Wales, Oxfordshire, the south Cotswolds and, of course, Worcestershire will be reduced from four lines to two. That is a lot of services to fit on to two lines.

They effectively enable the Secretary of State to determine the minimum level of principal Crossrail services and to instruct the Office of Rail Regulation to amend or even terminate existing track access agreements to make way for minimum Crossrail services. They give priority to Crossrail over all existing passenger and freight services and undermine the concept of the independent regulation of the railway. If

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;In the absence of a draft timetable for Crossrail services, it is difficult to assess how existing passenger and freight services could be readily accommodated. Furthermore, it is not possible to assess without knowledge of the Crossrail service plan if proposed infrastructure changes will adequately meet the existing and future needs of the industry . . . It has not been possible for Network Rail to conclude if the infrastructure proposed for Crossrail services will be sufficient to meet future needs without compromising the needs of other route users.&quot;</p>

<a name="50719-23_para25">
<a name="stpa_221">We have addressed the issue of funding, so I will not labour the point, but it is another reason why I am worried. The Secretary of State said that the project will cost about &#163;15 billion, and I think that his estimate is correct. The Treasury has apparently given the Department for Transport a 10-year budget, which does not include Crossrail. I hope that the money is available.

<a name="stpa_223">On the narrowness of the design in relation to Reading, the scheme could have brought so much to the south-east, the south-west and the west midlands, but those possibilities are being destroyed by the ridiculous obsession with Maidenhead. We all thought that fast and semi-fast services would run from Reading, but it seems that Crossrail will simply take over existing stopping services from the west into Paddington. Crossrail will not extend to Reading, which is a major rail junction. Richard Branson&#039;s Cross Country trains go through Reading. Indeed, one can travel to almost every place in the country that is worth visiting&#151;for example, Edinburgh, York, Darlington and Bournemouth&#151;from Reading, which is the logical place to end Crossrail.

<a name="stpa_224">I was brought up near Maidenhead, a wonderful town where my great, great, great, great grandfather was once mayor, but it is an arbitrary place to end a railway&#151;it is not a natural terminus. The Bill will rob a lot of value out of the First Great Western franchise and transfer services to Crossrail. Half the Crossrail services will not even go under London and will stop at Paddington, having crossed nothing except the Thames at Maidenhead. The project looks wonderful, but, as I have said, is the emperor really wearing any clothes?

With a bit of tunnelling, a little imagination and a few improvements to access, the London underground could be transformed into an underground for the 21st century. We are ignoring that option in favour of Crossrail, because Crossrail is a shiny new toy.

<a name="stpa_226">I shall not labour my concerns about the regulatory framework, but I share the worries expressed by other hon. Members. The Department for Transport has consistently acknowledged that this is a kitchen-sink Bill, but it claims that the situation is all right because the extensive powers, which it may not need, reassure the funders. However, I know that if Ministers are given powers, they will use them. I do not think that the Secretary of State currently intends to use those powers, but when push comes to shove, he will be tempted. Ministers should not be given dangerous toys unless they really need them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-23_para31">
<a name="stpa_227">We have not examined the sensible alternatives to Crossrail, which has mesmerised people. I have not dismissed Superlink, which is a better scheme than Crossrail. It would use a similar tunnel under central London, but, unlike Crossrail, it would link directly to regional centres and airports across the south-east, including Heathrow and Stansted, which would relieve pressure elsewhere. Superlink would attract four times as many passengers as Crossrail, which would halve the cost to the taxpayer per passenger. Although Superlink is a bit more expensive than Crossrail, it is fundable in a way in which Crossrail is probably not.

<p>
<a name="50719-23_para32">
<a name="stpa_228">Superlink is compatible with the core section of Crossrail between Canary Wharf and Paddington, and it includes vital but small modifications at each end of that section to enable the major investment to deliver its full potential. Crossrail will not provide transport links to serve the areas of projected housing growth in the south-east and to relieve road traffic, particularly in the Thames Gateway. If Crossrail proceeds, it will pre-empt such infrastructure improvements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-23_para33">
<a name="stpa_229">Crossrail is of little benefit to constituencies on the fringes of London or in the area around it, while Superlink would serve all of those areas. By taking travellers directly to their central London destinations, Superlink would more effectively relieve congestion on the London underground and free up key national rail routes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-23_para34">
<a name="stpa_230">Interestingly, Superlink&#039;s analysis of congestion benefits was not challenged in the Cross London Rail Links analysis of Superlink. A railway that would solve the problems of Milton Keynes and Cambridge and address the east-west issues is a much more attractive option than Crossrail.

 I welcome the Bill and acknowledge the Government&#039;s commitment to the Crossrail project by bringing it forward as a hybrid Bill. I also welcome the Secretary of State&#039;s wish to put some certainty into the Bill by defining the limits of the Crossrail network. That is essential if the scheme is to be practical and affordable. The project is important to the nation and will have national rail links, but it is, in essence, a London railway and it needs to be looked at in those terms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_232">The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) referred to Superlink. If I have got the jargon right, that proposal is essentially a commuter scheme, whereas Crossrail is a metro scheme. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) made some complimentary references to Superlink. If that is Liberal Democrat policy, it would be of interest to my constituents.
</p>





<p><a name="st_175"><a name="50719-24_spnew1"><b> Tom Brake: </b> 
 Let me make it clear that what I said about Superlink was that it raised some issues to which it was worth the Government responding; that is not quite what the hon. Gentleman is saying.
</p>





<p><a name="st_176"><a name="50719-24_spnew2"><b> Mr. Slaughter: </b> 
 That is the most enthusiastic view of Superlink that I have heard. As the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) said, it did not publish the route, but it showed us a map. I believe that although Ipswich and possibly Worcester were on that map, Acton main line was not.
</p>





<p><a name="st_177"><a name="50719-24_spnew3"><b> Peter Luff: </b> 
 I would love Worcester to be served by a fast service direct through to Canary Wharf, but it was nowhere near the map. The hon. Gentleman is making mischief. He says that Crossrail is a metro service. People going from Maidenhead into west London do not want a metro service: they have a perfectly good rail service. Crossrail diminishes the quality of the service for many people who currently use it; and a metro is not very attractive.
</p>





<p><a name="st_178"><a name="50719-24_spnew4"><b> Mr. Slaughter: </b> 
 I may be old-fashioned, but I thought that the links to the national rail network were the London terminals of Paddington and Liverpool Street, which seem to do a perfectly good job. The principal job of Crossrail is to provide much-needed relief to central London and to the western and eastern arms; that is why 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1176</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>it has received a warm welcome from business, local government, trade unions and transport groups. Even those who intend to petition against parts of the Bill generally preface their objections with an endorsement of the scheme. My constituents largely fall into that category by giving it a clear but not unqualified welcome. I shall come on to the objections in a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_233">The benefits to the national and London economy, to employment and, in particular, to the transport network were set out in the Secretary of State&#039;s speech, and I do not intend to repeat them. The good sense of having an east-west through route connecting to national rail services and the tube is so apparent that it has been advocated for some 50 years. The commercial and operational benefits are complemented by the relief that it will bring to tube lines already operating at capacity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_234">The specific local benefits to my constituency are significant. Ealing Broadway will be the principal interchange station on the west arm of the route. The station itself will benefit from much-needed reconstruction. Commuters will experience improved services and journey times to many destinations, as well as the new routes that will be opened up to the centre of London. Acton main line station will be rebuilt and the number of trains increased from two to four per hour, reversing the cut in services made last year. The facilities at all stations along the line will be improved and the stations extended to accommodate longer trains. That is all good news for rail users in the western part of my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_235">However, there are three concerns about the project as currently set out. First, there is a belief that the good news in the Bill could be better. Twenty-four trains will run through the central tunnel at peak times. In the east, those will continue on one or other of the Shenfield or Abbey Wood branch lines; in the west, 14 trains will be turned round at Paddington. The central conceit of Crossrail is to make a once-in-a-generation improvement in the cross-London rail network by linking up the existing extensive but disparate web of overground and underground lines. However, no attempt has been made to interchange with the West London line at Shepherds Bush or the North London line at Acton.It is difficult to tell whether the service to Heathrow from local stations will improve. BAA, which has just introduced the Heathrow Connect service, says that it will not. It is an issue not only of timetabling but of fares. If the premium fares that are currently charged for travelling even a few miles by rail to Heathrow are to continue, many non-business users are likely to boycott the service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_236">The second caveat, and the basis of a groundswell of local opposition to Crossrail, is the effect that it will have on the local environment, particularly the loss of a substantial area of open space comprising allotments, school playing fields and natural habitat for a number of protected species. The London borough of Ealing and numerous local organisations from the Acton area will, with my support, petition the Select Committee on those issues. The significance of losing irreplaceable open space in inner- city areas cannot be overestimated. In this case, the sites are well used and have been for several generations. They are, admittedly, part of the original Great Western estate and stand on railway land, but so does much of the residential property and other amenities in that part of Acton. The specific areas of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1177</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>land marked out for compulsory purchase include a sizeable part of the playing field and nature reserve of West Acton primary school and the whole Noel road allotments site.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_237">The teachers and pupils of the school and the residents who till the allotments are not naive, and I doubt that they believe that even armed with rakes and hockey sticks they could stop a &#163;10 billion railroad crossing their land. However, it transpires that the land grab in Acton is wholly unnecessary, as alternative brownfield sites along that part of the route could be substituted. The same applies at Ealing Broadway, where it is proposed to take over Haven green&#151;a protected area of green space in Ealing town centre&#151;instead of using a nearby car park for storage and construction works. I presume that that can only be for reasons of cost and convenience to the contractor. Some six years ago, similar proposals to take over those greenfield sites were turned down at the planning stage because alternative brownfield sites were available, and it remains the view of the local authority that those sites are there. Of course, the powers given by the Bill will subsume such local planning powers. Moreover, as the history of the site suggests, the proposed extensive works at Acton yard would envelop the community open space, yet they are not germane to the Crossrail scheme itself but part of separate development proposals for the freight yard. Local residents fear that were the Bill to be passed but Crossrail to be abandoned, the compulsory purchase powers given by the Bill might be used to advance other interests. That lose-lose option would mean no playing fields, but no new rail service either.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_238">That example illustrates my third and final reservation about the Bill. Are the powers to take over existing interests, in particular the compulsory purchase of landholdings of existing users, necessary to fulfil the requirements of the Crossrail scheme? Many substantial interests with a locus in my constituency will petition on these points, including BAA, EWS Railway and Cory Environmental. I do not intend to recite the objections in detail here, as other hon. Members have mentioned them, but the general point is well made. It cannot be right for any greater powers to be taken by the Secretary of State with a view to passing them to the nominated undertaker than are necessary for the construction and operation of the Crossrail route, or for there to be no requirement to consider and negotiate the rights of existing users. If that dictum applies to other major players on the Great Western lines, it should also apply to neighbouring communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_239">It is always easier in such debates to dwell on the points of difference than on the layers of agreement. I conclude by repeating that the Bill will find general and enthusiastic support in my constituency, not least because it is an essential addition to the London rail network.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) and my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) made about the instructions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_240">The Secretary of State was persuasive. He managed to make me feel at ease and that I should not be so worried about whether the instruction constituted a firm set of locks on the Committee. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire took legal advice and told hon. Members that our original fears, and the reason why I tabled an instruction, were well founded because the Government&#039;s instruction would preclude the Committee from considering the possibility of, for example, moving on to Reading or moving the termini from Shenfield to Stratford.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_241">I agree with my hon. Friend. I cannot imagine any circumstances in which the Secretary of State would stand at the Dispatch Box and mislead the House. I have no doubt that he spoke in good faith&#151;perhaps the advice that he received was simply wrong. If so, will the Under-Secretary assure us in his winding-up speech that he will ensure that the Committee is instructed to give life to the Secretary of State&#039;s undertakings? If he does that, we can all leave the debate feeling that something significant has been achieved. I ask him for a specific response to that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_242">The Secretary of State said something startling in his introduction. The issue that dare not speak its name, which has rumbled gently through the debate, is the source of the money. I was therefore startled when the Secretary of State said that he was waiting for the Lyons committee to report. That is a bizarre reason not to be forthright in the Chamber. If the Secretary of State genuinely believes that the reform of non-domestic rates and the rebanding of council tax, even with an additional band, will find the money for Crossrail, he is deluded.

<p><a name="st_180"><a name="50719-25_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hayes: </b> 
 The Secretary of State is not the only one who is deluded. In an answer to a written question from me a week or so ago, the Under-Secretary declared that the cost of Crossrail would be &#163;10.063 billion, rising to &#163;10.292 billion. Today, the Secretary of State said that the cost was likely to be &#163;15 billion or &#163;16 billion. There is genuine doubt about the money and I was therefore somewhat surprised. Mick Lyons was surprised that he had to deal with it and I am sure that my hon. Friend is just as surprised to hear that news.
</p>





<p><a name="st_181"><a name="50719-25_spnew1"><b> Mr. Pickles: </b> 
 With such increases, the Government would undoubtedly cap Crossrail if it were a local authority. However, the hard truth is that if we are genuinely waiting for Lyons and the money is to come from an amalgam of council tax and non-domestic rates, the price box will increase and we are likely to experience significant rises in rail, underground and bus fares to pay for Crossrail.
</p>





<p><a name="st_182"><a name="50719-25_spnew2"><b> Peter Luff: </b> 
 One of the House&#039;s prime functions, along with scrutinising legislation, is to vote money to the Government. Does my hon. Friend know&#151;I do not&#151;of any mechanism whereby the House can consider the financial questions around Crossrail?

<br>&nbsp;<br>to be considered. We are being asked to vote for probably the largest civil engineering project in Europe this century, without any genuine certainty about how it will be financed. I do not doubt Crossrail&#039;s economic importance or the significance of the engineering feat. It will reduce congestion in London and unblock the clogged lines in our capital. However, I am unhappy about the far-reaching powers that the Bill transfers to Crossrail. It threatens the stability of our railway network in terms of the timetable and fair competition. It also threatens the independence of the Office of Rail Regulation and puts the projected growth of freight at risk.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_243">My hon. Friends spent some time considering the Office of Rail Regulation and I will not repeat those points, save to say that the contention of my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead about her constituents&#039; desire to look to the Office of Rail Regulation rather than the Mayor of London is true for the people of Brentwood and of Shenfield. We must acknowledge that Crossrail&#039;s effects will be felt not only in the capital, but across country to and beyond Cardiff.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_244">Freight has been one of the great successes of the modern railway network. We have reached double figures in the percentage of freight that is carried by rail. We are at a crucial point when significant sums of capital investment have been made in freight, and we are moving from transporting goods for which time was not critical, such as aggregates, coal and oil, to goods for which time is critical. If, at this crucial point, we restrict the ability of freight to be moved on our railways, we risk the disappearance of all that investment and the genuine possibility&#151;at a time when our roads, especially the A12, are massively overcrowded&#151;of freight being transferred from rail to road. That would be ironic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_245">I am worried about other consequences. Four tracks are available for 20 miles from London. Crossrail will take two of them, forcing other services on to the fast lines. That remains a worry to me and my constituents. Crossrail&#039;s route and plans would fit more easily into a railway pattern of the 1980s rather than 2005 or 2015. It is depressing that there appears to be no genuine grasp of the growth of docklands, the extension of the Jubilee line or the strategic importance of the Thames Gateway, about which the hon. Member for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas) spoke so convincingly. That is why the project starts at Maidenhead and ends at Shenfield. None of the developments that I mentioned existed when the original plans were made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_246">The Shenfield line runs at full capacity. Thousands of people travel on it in overcrowded trains, and the slightest delay causes a major snarl-up. Crossrail does not add to the capacity. To be fair, Crossrail claims a slight increase in capacity&#151;from eight to 10 carriages, operating at a greater frequency at what it describes as &quot;peak and other times&quot;. That can be achieved only at the expense of freight and other users.
</p>





<p><a name="st_184"><a name="50719-25_spnew4"><b> Peter Luff: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is making an important point. The estimates that I have from the rail industry show that Crossrail&#039;s plans could mean halving services from Oxford to London, from two trains to one train an 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1180</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>hour, and halving services from Norwich to London. I hope that the Home Secretary will therefore vote against Second Reading.

<p><a name="st_185"><a name="50719-25_spnew5"><b> Mr. Pickles: </b> 
 It would be good for law and order if we kept the Home Secretary in Norwich. Every cloud has a silver lining.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_247">If Crossrail were to operate as planned, with 24 trains an hour through the central tunnels at peak times, it is far from clear that the network could accommodate such a service on top of existing and anticipated rail passenger and freight traffic. Freight operators estimate the use of only two tracks for 40 freight trains a day in each direction to and from Shenfield, plus nine intercity and outer-suburban off-peak trains. We also have to remember, when we are talking about the line from Shenfield to Liverpool Street, that 10 to 20 trains a day cross the important crossing from Forest Gate to the North London line. That, too, has a knock-on effect. My constituents will end up with disruption, inconvenience and, in the end, a worse service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_248">Crossrail will make the line from Shenfield unstable in terms of timetabling and vulnerable in terms of disruption. That might be justified if Shenfield&#039;s sacrifice were in the national interest. For some time, I have been asking railway organisations why Crossrail should start at Shenfield. No one has ever come up with a convincing logistical or engineering reason. A couple of months ago, a senior representative from Crossrail gave a presentation to a packed meeting in my constituency. He conducted himself with his customary charm and was listened to attentively and politely by my constituents. I asked him to tell us why the line should start at Shenfield. He is an obliging man, and he did so. I was startled by his first point, which was that Shenfield was traditionally the end of the line; it was therefore where the train drivers had lived and joined their trains.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_249">I am the very proud grandson of a railway worker. Shenfield and Hutton Mount were among the wealthiest places in the United Kingdom in a recent survey of household incomes, with property prices to match. A house in Shenfield or Hutton Mount would, frankly, be out of reach of most Members of this House and, unless train drivers&#039; salaries have greatly increased in real terms since my grandfather&#039;s day, of most train drivers. In April and May, I walked the streets in that area and I cannot recall meeting any member of the railway industry other than members of the board of Network Rail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_250">I point this out not to poke fun at Crossrail, but to illustrate the flimsiness of the case for Shenfield. Taking over the existing Metro services and control of all the lines will add nothing to the project except extra cost. Shenfield is the end of the line because it has always been the end of the line. With the permission of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire, I should like to take up the Hans Christian Andersen theme again. This is another example of the emperor&#039;s new clothes. The line will end at Shenfield because it has always ended at Shenfield, for no particular reason. Surely it would make better sense to end Crossrail at Stratford. It is a much more natural terminus, which is important, as other hon. Members have pointed out. It is strategically placed for the natural expansion of London and it would be cheaper to construct. Also, the cost benefits of the project become more evident from Stratford onwards.

The inclusion of Shenfield has led to some very questionable logistic decisions by Crossrail, one of which involves Romford. I cannot understand why we should build a depot in the middle of Romford, costing &#163;400 million, when there is a perfectly good one going spare near Paddington that is soon to be vacated by Eurostar. The purpose of my tabled instruction is to allow the Select Committee to study the options in this regard, and I hope that the Minister will allow our constituents and other concerned parties such as Brentwood council to talk to the Select Committee about the possibility of having a proper terminus at Stratford.

 This shows the value of public debates&#151;an interesting thought has just occurred to me. I have been fixated with the idea of extending the line westwards. My hon. Friend is talking about shortening the eastern section by bringing the terminus further into London, and that is a powerful argument. Ealing Broadway now commends itself to me as the terminus in the west. It is on a cheaper line and is a natural rail junction, albeit not as powerful or impressive as Reading.

 There is some merit in that suggestion, but the point made by the hon. Member for Dagenham about the southern route, which would move it more naturally into the Thames Gateway, also had merit.

I want to make one narrow point on this issue, and I would like one of my constituents to speak for the rest. My constituent, Mr. Cloke lives at 15 Herington Grove, and although his house is shown as being likely to be affected by significant adverse noise impact, it does not qualify for noise insulation. Nos. 11 and 17 Herington Grove do qualify, however. No. 17 is interesting because it is not a building but part of the garden of No. 15, which does not qualify.

We have deep concerns regarding all the proposals affecting Romford by Cross London Rail Links Ltd. The aim of that extensive petition was not to prevent the betterment of public transport services in London and the south-east, nor to halt Crossrail&#039;s plans completely, but to try to encourage Cross London Rail Links Ltd. and the Department for Transport to reconsider some of their proposals for Romford, which in my view will have a devastating impact on the local community and disrupt the lives of many people there.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1183</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Bill. Speaking as both the local Member of Parliament and a local resident, I back my constituents wholeheartedly in their campaign against what can only be described as outrageous proposals for our local area, particularly affecting the communities of Crowlands&#151;the district of Romford between the London road and Crow lane&#151;Rush Green and Gidea Park. Crossrail proposes to construct a 24-hour maintenance depot and sidings in those highly populated residential areas of Romford.
</p>





<p><a name="st_189"><a name="50719-26_spnew2"><b> Mr. Slaughter: </b> 
 Whether the hon. Gentleman wishes to have a depot in his constituency is entirely a matter for him, but I wonder why he wishes that it was going to be in my constituency, as I gather that he does from questions that he has asked. Crossrail had, I think, 42 options for the depot and chose Romford. He seems keen for it to be sited in Shepherd&#039;s Bush.
</p>





<p><a name="st_190"><a name="50719-26_spnew3"><b> Andrew Rosindell: </b> 
 I am keen that it goes in the location that will cause the least disruption to people&#039;s lives, which certainly is not Romford. I accept that other locations might also be contentious and that needs to be examined closely in the Select Committee. Wherever Crossrail finally decides to place its depot, if the Bill goes through, I hope that it will not devastate people&#039;s lives as is currently proposed in my constituency of Romford.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_260">The depot proposed in Romford is set to be approximately 2.5 km in length, running through both the Romford Town and Brooklands wards. Railway sidings and an access route for vehicles are to be constructed in Squirrel&#039;s Heath ward, also in my constituency. The proposal for a depot in central Romford will undoubtedly have the greatest impact on the lives of local people, taking away playing fields and open spaces and generating a vast amount of noise and pollution, and it is likely to turn a fairly quiet residential area of Romford into something like an industrial site. No way, Madam Deputy Speaker.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_261">Let me take you, Madam Deputy Speaker, on a journey from west to east of the proposed Romford construction works, starting from the access tracks to be placed on the Westlands playing fields, an area of green belt land often used by local community groups, as well as the adjoining St. Edwards&#039;s Church of England comprehensive school and sixth-form college. Understandably, the school strongly opposes Crossrail&#039;s proposals, which would lead to the immediate loss of sporting facilities on Westlands playing fields and 50 per cent. of its own sports area, into which much investment is currently going, not to mention the overall long-term impact on the school if it is to be situated adjacent to a large Crossrail work site, with all the associated noise, dust, disturbance and congestion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_262">A proportion of the land equal to approximately two thirds of the Westlands playing fields is to be used temporarily as a Crossrail work site, depriving local children and residents of its use for about four years and eight months, including one year and nine months of enabling works. The Westlands playing fields are a key recreational facility in the affected area and are also used by the constituents of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas). The Romford constituency also has lots of other green space and park land, most notably Oldchurch park, which is now being used to build a new hospital. Out of a total of 13 sports pitches on the fields, eight will be lost temporarily, and three permanently. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1184</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Residents understandably feel that, once the fields have been reinstated, if it proves to be the case that local sports teams have relocated, the local authority will seize the opportunity to show those fields as surplus to requirement and sell the remaining land for development in accordance with guidelines set out by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_263">The Government claim to put children first and have expressed concern over the number of obese children in Britain today. Perhaps the Minister can tell me how children in Romford are supposed to exercise without such recreational facilities as playing fields. That issue has also been highlighted by Sport England. To compound the loss, the disruption, including the arrival and departure of as many as 10 construction lorries a day, is due to last a child&#039;s whole secondary school life and will span 16 to 20 sets of public examinations overall, ranging from key stage 3 standard assessment tests to A-levels. We are all aware of the stress that children face at the time of examinations, and to add such distraction is nothing less than irresponsible from a Government who are supposedly concerned with the future of our younger generation. Not only will the use of the green belt land be detrimental to schoolchildren, patrons and residents, but the ecology of the area will be seriously affected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_264">The adjacent land known locally as Westlands Rough is the last remaining field of the Thames Chase to be left untouched within the London borough of Havering. To lose that green belt site would deprive the local community of the enjoyment and education of observing many species of wildlife and fauna, as well as taking away an area that many people use and enjoy for taking their dogs for walks. My Staffordshire bull terrier, Buster, who is well known to many Members, will be devastated if this treasured area of green space is wrecked by Crossrail&#039;s plans. Some species found on the site are of high conservation priority and are all unique to this part of the London borough of Havering. Such a site cannot be replaced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_265">The dive-under from Westlands playing fields will bring trains from north to south of the Great Eastern main railway line, causing prolonged noise to residents in that area from slow-moving trains 24 hours a day, and particularly throughout the night and early morning when they will either go in for maintenance or leave ready for the morning rush. That will affect local residents on both sides of the main line. An area to the south of Crow lane is to be used as a work site and adjoins many residential properties. That is approximately 4 acres of green belt land that forms part of the Dagenham corridor&#151;the barrier between the London boroughs of Havering and of Barking and Dagenham. In addition, a new bridge to carry Crossrail would have to be built over a local road on the south side of the line after the underpass. Again, that would cause major disruption, with road levels perhaps needing to be altered. The lengthening of the walkway due to the additional bridge will have negative effects for pedestrians, a high proportion of whom are schoolchildren of both primary and secondary school age.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_266">Yet another public worry is the loss of public recreation ground as a result of disruption in an area known as Jutsums park. A major gas main is being rerouted. Moreover, there will be a loss of established 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1185</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>trees and plants whose planting was paid for and carried out by the local community. Crossrail itself admits that users of Jutsums park will be

<a name="stpa_267">during construction, which will make it very unpleasant to use. The disruption of the parkland is in addition to the permanent loss of Oldchurch park playing fields, less than a mile away.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-26_para16">
<a name="stpa_268">Continual erosion of those facilities will leave the youth of the area little recreational space that is free of charge. That means that we are in danger of seeing more gangs of youths congregating on street corners with nothing to do, especially in the town centre. As might be expected, my constituents and I are deeply concerned. We fear that the knock-on effect of Crossrail&#039;s proposals could be an increase in youth crime in Romford.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-26_para17">
<a name="stpa_269">Crossrail has also proposed the building of a service road between Jutsums lane and the depot building towards the eastern end of the construction works. The road is to be built on the embankment and will run approximately 4 m from the ground. Vehicles will thus be level with the upstairs windows of people&#039;s homes. Inevitably, that will cause even more disturbance and invasion of privacy. The depot will take five or six years to build, which means at least six years of constant disruption, congestion, dirt, noise pollution and light pollution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-26_para18">
<a name="stpa_270">Those negative factors will affect residents, some of whose homes are about 100 m from the proposed depot site. The Higginses, with their small children, are an example. Not only will access to the road be less than 10 m from the side wall of their house but the proposed maintenance depot will be 100 m from the bottom of their garden. When they bought their home 20 years ago, Mr. and Mrs. Higgins were well aware of the existing railway line, but they did not expect to live next door to a 24-hour maintenance depot.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-26_para19">
<a name="stpa_271">The plans affect my constituents throughout Romford. Local roads will become more congested, with a plethora of construction traffic. Vehicles travelling to service the depot, both during and after construction, will journey down residential roads, not only damaging roads but putting pedestrians at risk. The depot will also dramatically change the skyline of the area, dominating the view from many residential properties. It is to be built on land that has already been raised by between 3 and 4 m, to make it level with the existing railway line.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-26_para20">
<a name="stpa_272">According to the requirements of the Greater London assembly biodiversity document, recognised by the Government as being in league with Agenda 21, brownfield land unused for human purposes that has reverted to its natural state can be classified as greenfield. The Crossrail action group and I believe that that applies to the Romford gasworks land that is to be used for the depot development. The depot itself will be 12 m high, which means an overall height of 15 to 16 m&#151;around double the height of the average house in the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-26_para21">
<a name="stpa_273">In answer to a written question from me, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Halton (Derek Twigg), confirmed that the depot would be operational 24 hours a day. With lighting conducive

<br>&nbsp;<br>to worker safety and high-pressure commercial washing taking place throughout the night, residents are sadly unlikely to have a night&#039;s peace if the depot development proceeds. Moreover, a parcel of land next to the depot area and to the rear of the residential properties is to be used as a route control centre and a large car park. Although the facility itself may not be particularly noisy, residents fear that further disruption will accompany shift changes during the night. The facility does not form part of the depot and can be located anywhere along the route. The construction of the depot will necessitate the removal of a gas holder, which will leave residents exposed to associated contamination. I do not consider it justifiable for the lives of residents, some of whom have lived in their homes for more than 60 years, to be disrupted to such a dreadful extent.

 Has not Crossrail shown complete disregard for the needs of my hon. Friend&#039;s constituents?
</p>





<p><a name="st_192"><a name="50719-27_spnew1"><b> Andrew Rosindell: </b> 
 My hon. Friend&#039;s words echo the views of all my constituents. We originally thought that the development might benefit us, but over time we have realised that there will be very little benefit and it will wreck many people&#039;s lives. Many elderly people who live locally are in fear of what they may have to face in their twilight years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_274">Although it was asked for details of the elimination of the other depot sites considered as long ago as July 2004, Cross London Rail Links did not see fit to release the information to Havering council, Havering&#039;s Greater London assembly representative Roger Evans and the Crossrail action group until May this year, although the document is clearly dated December 2003. Having looked at the reasons for deselection of some of the alternative sites, I deduce that different criteria have been used from one site to the next. The Romford option is the most expensive and the most logistically difficult to build, yet it appears that the use of so-called brownfield land for the depot, although it is in a residential area, is being made to fit Crossrail&#039;s criteria. How can that possibly be? I hope that the Minister will tell us later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_275">Towns usually build up around industry of this kind, rather than the other way about. I ask for Cross London Rail Links to be directed back to the drawing board, and told to consider land that has already been used for this purpose at Ilford or North Pole. I also ask for all sites considered to be rated with the use of the same criteria, rather than differing criteria depending on location.
</p>





<p><a name="st_193"><a name="50719-27_spnew2"><b> Mr. Pickles: </b> 
 My hon. Friend mentioned the North Pole depot, to which I also referred. Eurostar will lose it in 2007. Does it surprise my hon. Friend that Crossrail has not even considered it as an alternative?
</p>





<p><a name="st_194"><a name="50719-27_spnew3"><b> Andrew Rosindell: </b> 
 I agree. I find that not just surprising but astonishing. If there is one message to be conveyed from our side of the debate, it is that the Minister should reconsider that aspect. The North Pole site would clearly be appropriate and would avoid much disruption in my constituency and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>effect, while there has been no mention of that in the selection of Romford, although hundreds of homes will be affected. The depot at North Pole, just west of Paddington and on the proposed Crossrail route to Heathrow, is currently used by Eurostar, as my hon. Friend said. That new, modern depot, built to maintain the most modern trains, will be vacated in 2007 when Eurostar switches its maintenance to a new depot being built at Temple Mills with &#163;400 million of taxpayers&#039; money. If Crossrail used North Pole, it would probably save the taxpayer the &#163;430 million construction costs of the Romford depot, and save my constituents in Romford from massive and unnecessary disruption. Crossrail has not been able to give a convincing reason for its inability to use the North Pole site.
</p>





<p><a name="st_195"><a name="50719-27_spnew4"><b> Mr. Slaughter: </b> 
 I did not think that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) mentioned North Pole. I believe that he mentioned a depot near Paddington. North Pole is relatively near Paddington, but is actually at Shepherd&#039;s Bush. If only from my earlier intervention, the hon. Member for Romford (Andrew Rosindell) must know that Crossrail considered it as an option and rejected it, partly because it is in west London rather than east London and therefore logistically inappropriate and partly because there may be other plans for the North Pole depot. He cannot hang his argument on that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_196"><a name="50719-27_spnew5"><b> Andrew Rosindell: </b> 
 There may be other plans and Crossrail may have considered them, but it has not pursued that option. What I am asking today is for the Minister to revive that option and look further into the details. A decision has been taken, but not a fair decision, so other alternatives need to be considered. Will the Minister assure my constituents that he will investigate why this option has been decided and ensure that the North Pole alternative is given serious and urgent consideration?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_277">Other effects of the work in Romford include the extension of an underpass widely used by residents ranging from children to the elderly. It will be extended from 43 to 75 m. Associated works at Romford station will cause considerable disruption with yet more work sites and more construction vehicles. The affected residents are effectively stuck in the area, because once Crossrail reaches planning stages and starts showing up a negative on searches, residents will be unable to sell their homes, causing blight to many home owners in my constituency. I feel that that is totally unfair to my constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_278">I turn now to the effects of Crossrail in the Gidea park area of my constituency, where railway sidings and an access route are being proposed. The residents of Cambridge avenue, Amery gardens and the surrounding area will have imposed on them a large area for the storage of Crossrail trains&#151;yet more disturbance, noise and pollution. Gidea park is another quiet residential area and although the Liverpool Street line runs through the community, using the land at the rear of residential properties for that particular purpose is an entirely new development, to which most local people are completely opposed. There is also the access route for vehicles proposed via the Southend arterial road, where lorries will thunder past residential properties and around the sides of people&#039;s homes, causing no end of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1188</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>disturbance. As the local MP, I speak on behalf of all local residents from the area who feel that this plan is totally and utterly unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_279">It has also become increasingly apparent that affected residents in the area will have little to gain from the development or from the Crossrail service itself. As such, I believe that connecting the Great Eastern Shenfield line into the Crossrail scheme could prove a serious mistake&#151;a view shared by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar. From what I can see, the &#163;1.5 billion that it will cost far outweighs the potential benefits to passengers from Romford. There will be only a slight increase in capacity and, by the time that the whole scheme is commissioned, it will have been absorbed by the growth of towns along the eastern route. There is no real evidence that journey times for passengers on this branch will decrease substantially. Most commuters from Romford walk from Liverpool Street station to jobs in the City and there is also a good interchange at Stratford on to the Central line. Since the Crossrail scheme was revived by the central London rail study, the Jubilee line has been constructed, allowing passengers to travel directly to Canary Wharf and the west end, reducing the congestion on the Central line.

<p><a name="st_197"><a name="50719-27_spnew6"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner  (Isle of Wight) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way and for giving the House so much information about the impact of this development on his constituency. Does he agree that any development of this kind will have the effect not only of increasing traffic and travel, but of enabling people to travel far further to work than they otherwise could&#151;in other words, to live perhaps in Essex and work in Middlesex, which under other circumstances would be wholly irrational and likely to force people to relocate? We are not improving the environment, but merely enabling more and more people to travel further and further, damaging the environment as they do so.
</p>





<p><a name="st_198"><a name="50719-27_spnew7"><b> Andrew Rosindell: </b> 
 I have great sympathy with my hon. Friend&#039;s point. We all want progress and greater access to travel, but there are many different ways of doing it. I am increasingly of the view that the important thing to focus on is smaller developments&#151;localised, but clearly focused on what will be achieved. Huge developments may not necessarily improve the situation but most certainly have a big impact on the environment. The debate will become more detailed and complex as time goes on.

<a name="stpa_280">Crossrail has told Romford residents at meetings held by the Crossrail action group that they will be able to board direct trains to Heathrow airport. However, in answer to another of my written questions, the Minister confirmed that all trains to Heathrow will, in fact, start from Abbey Wood with no direct service from Shenfield. We have also learned that Crossrail trains are unlikely to run to Heathrow&#039;s new terminal 5 because of capacity conflicts. It appears that passengers from the Shenfield branch will need to change trains to get to Heathrow and then change again if they want to use flights from terminal 5. The case for incorporating the Shenfield line into the Crossrail scheme seems to depend on the assumption that it will, in turn, release capacity for more services from Stansted airport into Liverpool Street station.

It could make more sense to build it that way round now that we have secured our bid to host the 2012 Olympic games. As Lord Coe has said in many of his presentations, the Olympic site is already served by nine railways, and the Olympic Javelin will provide a fast shuttle to Kings Cross. Rather than disrupt rail services in the critical period before the Olympics, why do we not concentrate on getting the Heathrow and Abbey Wood branches up and running? That will reduce the initial costs of the scheme, while the Shenfield branch can be added later, if required.

 I am sure that the whole debate has been a delight for every last train spotter. It seems that almost every railway siding from Essex to Worcestershire has been mentioned; in particular, we have had a tour d&#039;horizon of Romford, courtesy of my hon.

<a name="stpa_286">When, or perhaps if, Crossrail is built, our capital city&#151;one of the great global cities&#151;will have the beginnings of a railway system fit for the 21st century. Why then have the Government seen fit to impose a procedure more suited to the 19th century in proposing this hybrid Bill? What of democratic accountability, and consultation with the countless residents whose daily lives will be blighted and affected? We have heard about that from several contributors to the debate. Why is the ultimate decision about whether the project is funded, and thus can proceed, left to two men, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Transport, who do not represent anyone on transport issues in this House? It is a devolved matter for their constituents in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath and in Edinburgh, South-West.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_287">There is no doubt that London desperately needs proper investment in its infrastructure, because if London fails economically, the whole of the United Kingdom fails with it. Jobs, at least those outside the public sector, that fly from our capital city usually leave our shores entirely. Any Government action that diminishes the relative commercial importance of London is unlikely to benefit Glasgow, Leeds, Manchester or Birmingham; instead, it will be European or increasingly south-east Asian cities that will reap the benefits. It is in that context that we must ensure that investment in the transport infrastructure of our capital city is fit for purpose in an innovative, rapidly evolving world of commerce.

<a name="50719-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_288">Crossrail is a plan that will integrate the mainline railways to the east and west of London, through the construction of two tunnels, directly beneath the centre of London, from Paddington to Liverpool Street. As the Secretary of State said in his opening comments, the project was agreed by the Government as long ago as 1990 but the necessary private Bill failed to get through the House of Commons four years later. Finally, on grounds of cost as much as anything else, the Conservative Government pulled the plug on that scheme in 1996. Many Members who have spoken in the debate may not be entirely aware that the proposal goes back as far as 1948, so surely few would dispute the fact that Crossrail is an idea whose time has genuinely come.

<a name="stpa_290">I am the Member of Parliament whose constituency is most obviously directly affected by the proposal, which is not to demean in any way the contributions made elsewhere. However, as the central part of Crossrail goes right through my constituency from Liverpool Street in the City of London to Paddington station, I wanted to list some of the concerns on the record in advance of petitions by residents associations, local businesses and individual members of the public. The funding of infrastructure projects here in our capital city has historically been highly contentious. Sadly, if anyone believed that adding a new layer of devolved government, as this Labour Government did in creating the Mayor and the Greater London assembly only five years ago, would make things easier, they were sadly mistaken.
</p>





<p><a name="st_202"><a name="50719-28_spnew3"><b> Mr. Walker </b> 
: Does my hon. Friend agree that traditionally too much of London&#039;s money has been sent to the regions to fund infrastructure projects in the north of England and Scotland, and not enough retained in London to guarantee the future of this great city and its ability to bankroll this nation of ours?

<p><a name="st_203"><a name="50719-28_spnew4"><b> Mr. Field: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that observation. I know that he is a serving councillor in the London borough of Wandsworth, so I expect he sees both sides of that argument, from the suburbs and from central London. I think he is absolutely right.

<a name="50719-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_291">It is clear that the financing of this project remains entirely up in the air. I think we are the first to accept that businesses are willing, and have shown themselves willing, to make a contribution, but equally they want to see the colour of the Government&#039;s money. They want an idea of the likely funding structure. My greatest worry is that although we could spend months, perhaps years, talking about Crossrail, unless there is a fairly clear idea of the source of the financing, all that discussion will come to naught. It would be somewhat intellectually dishonest for any Government to advance such a scheme without having a strong idea about where the finance will come from. Without such clarity, the great worry is that many years could be spent in discussions, with the result that many lives and many properties and businesses could be blighted in the manner described by a number of Members across the House.

<a name="50719-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_292">There is little doubt that the creation of Transport for London under the direct responsibility of the Mayor of London has at least provided a structure for transport decision making here in the capital, but the terms of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 were couched in such a way as to ensure that financial control remained firmly in the hands of central Government. I do not believe that can truly be a sensible way to proceed, although I accept that Crossrail has an importance that goes beyond the capital city. In view of Mayor Livingstone&#039;s record of financial profligacy, such 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1192</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>control of finances might generate a collective sigh of relief from many London council tax payers who have already seen a whopping 105 per cent. increase in the mayoral precept on the London council tax over the last five years. Indeed, the prospect of Mayor Livingstone being issued a blank cheque for Crossrail is enough to make anyone shudder.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_293">Nevertheless, the stark financial reality is that all too often this Labour Government have regarded London as a convenient cash cow. The creaking London infrastructure, especially but not exclusively that of transport, treats residents and wealth-creating businesses alike with some disdain. Most independent commentators would estimate that every year, some &#163;12 billion of public funds is transferred from the capital to the rest of the UK and some &#163;1.5 billion of that is from business rates alone. There is little doubt that this is beginning to have an electoral effect, and the Government should beware.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_294">Issues of quality of life and the cost of living were increasingly important for my party in the capital during the general election campaign, and the swing from the Labour party to the Conservatives in London was greater than in any other region of the United Kingdom. I am proud that I have four hon. Friends&#151;my hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling), for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes), for Putney (Justine Greening) and for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond)&#151;in seats that would have remained in Labour hands had there been only an average national swing. On the grounds of electoral self-interest alone, I hope that the Government are now listening to the voice of London. I appreciate that the trend that I have articulated has been echoed by an increasingly worried cohort of London Labour Back Benchers.

<a name="50719-28_para14">
<a name="stpa_295">We now seek an investment commitment to Crossrail at the earliest opportunity, although I accept that there is no clear pathway to its funding. I am the first to admit that it is a complicated situation. No one is suddenly going to produce &#163;10 billion, &#163;15 billion or &#163;20 billion&#151;I think we all realise that by the time Crossrail is built the cost is likely to be at the higher end of that range&#151;but over the past year the Mayor has been given what he and his new friends in government have euphemistically called &quot;prudential borrowing powers&quot; to complete the east London link, which is of course a crucial part of our Olympic 2012 successful bid, and therefore the programme for the future. In essence, that is a financial sleight of hand because the Mayor is allowed to borrow some &#163;2.9 billion from future council tax receipts to complete the east London link. Despite the national importance of that transport project, the money will still come from London&#039;s local taxpayers. Apparently, that will be the case for the whole Crossrail scheme.

<a name="stpa_296">In their desperation, London&#039;s largest businesses have tried to engage with the Government and offer some money on the table. As the Minister will be aware, the current proposal is for an additional 3 per cent. surcharge on the business rate over 50 years or, indeed, for some added-value capture scheme that reflects the projected long-term increase in property values as a result of the infrastructure being created. That is understandable&#151;everyone can support it in principle&#151;but the difficult is, of course, how that bit of any increase in the value of a property is calculated. Understandably,

I hope that the Minister will give at least some indication today about where he envisages some of the project&#039;s funding will come from.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-28_para16">
<a name="stpa_297">Inevitably, when the works start, there will be an immense amount of disruption to many London residents and businesses. As I mentioned in an earlier contribution, given the disruption in central London alone, I personally believe that it is very unlikely that we can go through the whole process of getting the Bill on to the statute book in enough time for work to begin before the Olympics. Nothing would be more disruptive than two or three years&#039; upheaval in central London in the midst of the Olympics. In all honesty, I suspect that the Government already recognise that and therefore the timetable is being postponed to the middle of the next decade.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-28_para17">
<a name="stpa_298">I hope that my hon. Friends from other parts of the capital and beyond will forgive me if I focus my comments on my constituency, which has some important aspects to mention. I am assured that, although some of my constituents oppose Crossrail as a matter of principle, others, even those who face disruption in their lives, recognise many of its overall benefits. However, they are worried that, without a proper funding commitment and therefore a realistic timetable for how quickly work will commence and finish, their properties will be blighted. That has not been made any easier by the fact that the erstwhile chief executive of Crossrail, Norman Haste, quit it mid-May, before the necessary parliamentary approval process commenced. To a large extent, the Government had made his job increasingly impossible by dragging their feet on the funding required to make the whole Crossrail project viable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-28_para18">
<a name="stpa_299">It is now of key importance that a full public consultation exercise takes place on Crossrail&#039;s precise route in central London. The initial proposal suggested three possible routes. I am alarmed by the current proposal for a route just south of Oxford street because it is certain to cause massive disruption to the residential population of Mayfair, as well as damage to a large number of listed buildings and other residential properties. Some Members&#151;I say this perhaps for the benefit of Labour Members&#151;may assume that Mayfair is somehow full of hugely wealthy investment bankers who live in large, multi-million pound houses. Nothing is further from the truth: the biggest number of complaints have come from two very large Peabody Trust buildings: one off Binney street and the other in Brown Hart Gardens in Mayfair. Indeed, the great bulk of the population of north Mayfair is made up of people who live in social housing, many of whom have done so for decades and their families may have done so for several generations.

I am sure that my constituency neighbour, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon.

<a name="stpa_302">The housing association tenants in Mayfair often have no choice about where they live, as I have said, but they face the risk of severe disruption to their community. In Gilbert street in Mayfair, for example, the 1930s educational facility will be torn down to make way for a terminus to support the Crossrail link. The apartment blocks in the area will be subjected to a minimum of six years&#039; building work&#151;several hon. Members have cited that time scale. Trucks will go in for at least 12 hours a day to dispose of rubble and a great deal of underground drilling with take place day and night. A shaft measuring 30 ft wide and 25 ft deep will be sunk to expel all the stale air. The residents feel that they have been neither properly informed, nor consulted. The building work will seriously disrupt the quality of life for countless local people, yet many residents are already in poor health, with some elderly and others similarly vulnerable.

The Crossrail northern interchange route would link the Barbican, King&#039;s Cross and St. Pancras, and Baker Street here in central London, and connect with all airports and tube lines. It would adjoin business areas along the Marylebone road and wide areas of regeneration that would otherwise not be touched by Crossrail.

In the short term, their concerns include the environmental impact of the noise, dust, vibration and traffic congestion over the next three or four years, which are inevitable in any Crossrail development work. They are keen that the Bill should contain rules that will constrain construction activities to offer no less protection than those that apply to other contractors working in the City of London.

As I have said on many occasions, we do not have direct access to the London underground. Much investment across London goes into the underground and much of the debate about London&#039;s transport is concerned with it. However, many parts of London are not served by it and we rely heavily on Network SouthEast and, where that fails, the only alternative for travel from my constituency to central London is the car.

It has long been the experience of people from my constituency that they look on as developments take place along the riverfront. Such developments are welcome, but the planning for those schemes includes little thought about how the wider community can link into those schemes and benefit from them.

<a name="stpa_314">Most of the jobs that will be created over the next 10 or more years will be in the Thames gateway area, the Isle of Dogs, the City, the west end and around Heathrow. Crossrail will be vital for people who want to access these areas. Most of my constituents currently travel towards central London. In the past, London had a transport network that was rather like spokes of a wheel. People have been living in suburbs and have travelled in on rail networks. If they were lucky enough to live near the tube or &quot;on the tube&quot;, they travelled by that means into central London. The development of the Thames Gateway and east London will change that fundamentally. I am already being approached by people who want to work on the reconstruction that is taking place in the Thames Gateway area. They want access to the Thames Gateway for training so that they can have the opportunity of taking the jobs that will be available.

<a name="stpa_315">The future travel patterns of people from my part of London will change completely as development gathers pace.

<a name="50719-29_para13">
<a name="stpa_316">The cost of introducing a station along the Crossrail route after it has been built would be extremely costly. That is why I want to draw attention to the amendment that was tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), although it was not selected. He asks in that amendment for a railway station at Woolwich to accommodate the future needs of people from south-east London who will need to have access to the Thames corridor and the Thames Gateway area, to travel to the wider areas to which Crossrail will offer connections. We need a station at Woolwich.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-29_para14">
<a name="stpa_317">Woolwich is in a strategic position in south-east London, where it could become a transport hub for that area. It makes no sense to bypass a strategic centre. It would make a mockery of the transport policies that have been published over many years, which are full of well-meaning statements about integrated transport, if we did not take the opportunity to make Woolwich a transport hub. We have the opportunity for a major infrastructure development to do just that, to become an integrated transport hub for an area of London that for too long has been deprived.

<p>
<a name="50719-29_para15">
<a name="stpa_318">The proposals are for Crossrail trains to travel past Woolwich, the first stop south of the river being Abbey Wood. I welcome the fact that there is to be a station at Abbey Wood. However, that cannot be considered to be a strategic location for a major station and a major development such as Crossrail. Woolwich is bypassed because it is cheaper to do so. Such second-rate planning has dogged us for too long.

<a name="stpa_320">For too long the needs of south-east London have been overlooked. Twelve of London&#039;s most socially deprived wards are in the area around Woolwich. The fact that the east Thames corridor has been overlooked for too long is recognised in the Thames Gateway development programme. We cannot overlook the level of deprivation that exists south of the river in areas such as the one that I represent. If my constituents cannot access Crossrail, they will suffer enormously as developments along the Thames Gateway take place. I have already mentioned that we do not have direct access to the London underground system. We also face the problem of a lack of planning for surface transport. For example, we have seen no major developments in bus networks.

<a name="stpa_321">Last week, I spoke to a group of young people who were hanging around in my constituency and asked them what they did with their time. Our local cinema is close to North Greenwich station, which is in the north of my borough. I asked, Do you ever go down to the cinema? Do you ever make your way down to the new facility there?&quot; They said, &quot;It is too far. The bus takes too long.&quot; We have had the Jubilee line in my borough for more than five years, but there is no direct bus link. If those young people wanted to use our local bus network to travel to the cinema close to North Greenwich station, it would take two hours out of their day. No young person will consider that. A commuter travelling to London to work will not consider that transport as an option, so a heavy burden is placed on the south-east rail network, on which there is too much reliance. It is frequently overcrowded and that forces people on to our roads. Larger schemes such as Crossrail must meet the wider needs of existing communities as well as communities that will be developed along the Thames Gateway. Buses are not regarded as an alternative for travelling into central London, so access to Crossrail is essential if we are to provide a decent transport network for people in south-east London.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-29_para19">
<a name="stpa_322">The Thames Gateway is one the biggest regeneration areas in Europe. A total of 200,000 homes will be built there, and there is capacity to build 30,000 more homes than are envisaged in the Government&#039;s housing strategy. Some 150,000 jobs will be developed in the area. Inevitably, people focus on the Thames Gateway when they talk about Crossrail, but we must look at the wider community. According to the Thames Gateway partnerships, development will benefit south-east London, but that depends on how we define south-east London. History teaches us that if we do not pay attention to problems at the outset it is expensive to put them right after the development is complete. The docklands, for instance, were developed before the docklands light railway was built. The Jubilee line was built through the docklands much later. The lack of public transport infrastructure proved to be a major fault in the development of the royal docks and it was some time before people could experience the wider benefits of the area.

<a name="50719-29_para20">
<a name="stpa_323">I can only demonstrate what we are planning to do with Crossrail by making a comparison with the opening of the Hammersmith and City line.

<br>&nbsp;<br>trains on the Jubilee line did not stop at Canary Wharf, people would wonder about the benefits of such a transport link for the communities it was intended to serve. The failure of Crossrail trains to stop at Woolwich will have a similar effect on south-east London. The area has been a poor relation of public transport development in south-east London for far too long, and we will not countenance a failure to develop Crossrail there.

 London is a world city, and as we are competing against New York and Tokyo it is important to take note of the improvements that have been made to the connections between the mass transit system in New York and one New York airport and the augmentation of the coach system in Japan with a direct rail link into Tokyo station.

<a name="stpa_327">Other benefits will come. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas) was right to point out that the potential benefits go beyond the dry language of regeneration.

<br>&nbsp;<br>with the project, subject of course to financing. It is difficult to see it being a strong point for London if visitors to the London 2012 Olympics would be subject to such constraints. It is important to bear in mind that the proposals for Crossrail come forward at a time when Thameslink 2000 is still on the books as a project for London. The Thameslink project is further advanced in the planning approval process and the planning inspector has concluded that that scheme will be beneficial. His concerns relating to specific issues at Blackfriars, London Bridge and Borough market have been dealt with. Crossrail cannot be completed by 2012, but the Thameslink project could well be completed by then and provide beneficial links with the Olympic Javelin service to and from St. Pancras.

<a name="50719-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_329">Improved passenger distribution from the King&#039;s Cross-St. Pancras hub would link in well with the cross-channel rail link domestic services coming in in 2009, as well as providing greater capacity for the north-south axis, which is important for London&#039;s transport. Greater capacity will also be provided on the heavily congested lines around London Bridge, a major pinch-point on the existing rail network. That is important to my constituents in Croydon.
</p>

<a name="50719-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_330">It is good that the Bill reflects a strong intention to consult transport providers and Transport for London.

I listened carefully to the comments of the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) about proper compensation. I hope that within the lines of deviation that are provided for in the Bill, flexibility will be possible, bearing in mind the effects of the Croydon Tramlink Act 1994 and the fact that people outside the lines of deviation have yet to receive any compensation whatever, even though the tram system has been in place for some time.

<a name="stpa_333">I understand that Crossrail is a metro scheme, not a regional commuter scheme, which exists to support the Mayor&#039;s transport strategy, but I am not sure whether that should be the case. Its scope should be much more ambitious&#151;I would prefer a regional service linked to major transport hubs, which would make economic and environmental sense. Crossrail will not serve new and growing population centres, so the projected additional revenues barely cover the projected additional operating costs. A potential nightmare scenario involves more traffic on regional roads outside London as freight is pushed off the tracks and passengers decide that they cannot and will not accept a slow stopping service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_334">I am also concerned whether the project is fundable. At the moment, it will succeed only with heavy taxation of both business and individuals. Crossrail&#039;s funding gap is about &#163;6 billion or &#163;7 billion, although it may be more than that&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) has suggested that it could be as large as &#163;15 billion or &#163;16 billion, which is possible, and it is unrealistic to expect either business or individuals to pay such a huge shortfall. We should not forget that Londoners will probably face a substantial bill for hosting the 2012 Olympics. Perhaps the Minister will provide us with an estimate of the cost burden of both Crossrail and the Olympics on Londoners in his winding-up speech.

<p>
<a name="50719-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_335">I am puzzled why a railway that will serve so much of east London will not include a link to London City airport, which has poor transport links. Crossrail will not integrate with the south-east&#039;s airport network&#151;both London City airport and Heathrow have poor transport services, and Crossrail will not serve Stansted at all. Is that really the integrated transport system that this Government promise us year after year?

<a name="50719-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_336">I was offended by the view expressed by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#039;s Bush (Mr. Slaughter). The idea that national transport hubs should only be located in London fails to take account of the important role played by the regions. I am worried about the powers that the Bill confers. The chief executive of the BAA was right to express concerns that the Heathrow Express may find itself part of a compulsory purchase order under those powers. After what happened with Railtrack, that could further undermine economic confidence in the viability of big rail projects. The powers appear to require the rail regulator to favour Crossrail above all else. That could have an enormous impact on freight and commuter passenger services, which concerns First Great Western. I seek the Minister&#039;s assurance that freight and commuter services will have full equality with Crossrail&#039;s metro service.

The project&#039;s slogan&#151;&quot;Crossing the capital, connecting the UK&quot;&#151;will certainly not be believed in my constituency. It is proposed that Crossrail should go through the relatively small communities of Iver, Burnham and Taplow, terminating at Maidenhead, while ignoring Reading, a town with a population of more than 130,000 that lies only a short distance to the west. If the project really

<br>&nbsp;<br>were to connect the UK, surely the fact that Reading railway station is already served by no fewer than four different franchises&#151;First Great Western, First Great Western Link, South West Trains and Virgin Trains&#151;would make it an attractive candidate for inclusion. Outside London, only Birmingham New Street is a busier station than Reading. My predecessor in Reading, East clearly understood that, as do those of all shades of political opinion in Reading when calling for the scheme&#039;s extension.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_338">As the Secretary of State said, the extension of the scheme to Reading comes with a price tag. For approximately &#163;300 million, the line between Reading and Maidenhead could be electrified&#151;a small additional expense on a project estimated at &#163;10 billion, but one that would bring many more passengers, and therefore revenue, with it. However, that would not be the end of the story for Reading. In addition to the electrification of the line between Reading and Maidenhead, the station would require resignalling, rebuilding to cope with the extra capacity required, and remodelling of the east and west junctions. The cost would be significant. However, the money should be provided by Network Rail, whose duty should be to upgrade Reading&#039;s platforms, signalling and junctions because it is already a bottleneck. Severe constraints on the First Great Western main line are placing serious capacity constraints on current and future rail operations on the regional and national rail network. I hope that the Minister will commit to meet me and local authority officers to discuss the funding of the expansion of Reading station.

<a name="stpa_339">With the UK&#039;s version of silicon valley based around Reading, our local businesses strongly require a direct link to Heathrow airport in addition to our direct link to Gatwick. The lack of such a link is a barrier to the future development of our town and the wider economy. Those wishing to travel to Heathrow via the existing rail service are forced to endure a wasted trip travelling from Reading to Paddington and then westward again on the Heathrow Express. Given such a significant and diverse business presence in my constituency and the surrounding area, the failure to provide such a link is, frankly, unacceptable. I would appreciate the Minister&#039;s thoughts on that and on how, for the sake of the Thames valley regional economy, it could be addressed.

<a name="stpa_340">It is extremely important to the regional economy that an upgrade at Reading is included in an improved version of Crossrail, whether now or in future. I therefore ask the Minister that the route as far as Reading be subject to safeguarding. That would give some comfort that an improved scheme may be designed to improve Reading at some point in the future. I am advised that that would require private legislation, but it would help if he could confirm that Ministers would be minded to approve such legislation.

<a name="50719-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_343">The Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary were confused about the instruction; let me be clear. The instruction&#039;s purpose is to interpret for the Committee the principle of the Bill. The Committee will not be permitted to accept petitions that do not deal with that principle. The custom of the House is clear: those who petition the Committee must have locus standi. In other words, they must have a special or direct interest in the concerns of the Bill or the instruction.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_348">Perhaps the most profound concern is the doubt about the funding of the project. As I said earlier, in a written question only a week ago, I asked the Under-Secretary for the latest estimated cost of the Crossrail scheme. He suggested that it was &#163;10.29 billion. Yet today, the Secretary of State said that it was likely to be &#163;15 billion or &#163;16 billion. It has risen by between &#163;5 billion and &#163;6 billion in the space of a week.

<br>&nbsp;<br>last assessment, which was made in 2004. The price that I cited earlier is in cash terms and reflects the fact that construction did not start in 2002 but would start, on the current plans, in 2007. The prices are consequently increased. I was therefore giving the House the up-to-date cash position. I reiterate that the figure of &#163;10.2 billion was at 2002 prices.

<p><a name="st_218"><a name="50719-31_spnew3"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 No, the hon. Gentleman is wrong about that. The prices reflect the fact that the construction of Crossrail would, on any view, take place over many years. So some of the money would not actually be paid until the far end of the period. In order to get a cash figure, therefore, we needed to make a calculation as to how much would be involved. The price that I quoted simply reflects the fact that one set of prices was at 2002 prices, and what I was giving the House was the cash figure that we estimate today. That is the reason for the difference. This is a perfectly conventional way of doing it, but it is important that the House should get the right picture.

 No, I must move on. I am going to mention the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) favourably in a moment. He might want to intervene on the back of those compliments, rather than in haste now.

<a name="50719-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_349">Had the Government been more precise about some of the matters that I have just mentioned, much of the doubt and speculation that their uncertainty has inevitably fuelled would not have arisen. The Secretary of State may shake his head, but I have met many people associated with Crossrail&#151;as he and the Minister will have done in the course of their business&#151;both from the railway industry and from London business, who endorse the fact that there is a lack of clarity. The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich made an important contribution earlier. He said that we must be careful about what he described as counterproductive cost-driven delays. He went on to say that elements of the project that were eliminated to save money might in the end deter investment. Those were profound points that the Government would do well to note. I have never understood why the right hon. Gentleman now finds himself on the Back Benches.

<br>&nbsp;<br>starts throwing stones at the Government over Crossrail, he might like to ponder his own party&#039;s record on the issue, and the uncertainty that was created in the 1990s when the Bill did not proceed because of administrative confusion and a lack of leadership from the party of which he is a member.
</p>





<p><a name="st_223"><a name="50719-31_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hayes: </b> 
 The House would not want me to delve into the realms of ancient history when we have important matters before us to consider tonight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_350">There are real doubts about the funding of the project. There are even more profound doubts&#151;I almost hesitate to say it&#151;about when the Treasury really backs it. I have no doubt about the commitment of the Secretary of State and his ministerial team, but is the Treasury really behind the project? As Thomas the Tank Engine might have said, this is a case of &quot;Hurry up, Gordon!&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_351">There is also considerable concern about how the construction of the project could disrupt other services. The rail industry estimates that the construction will affect 2,200 freight, commuter, long-distance passenger and airport services per day, along two principal routes. In particular, freight terminals along both routes could suffer significant disruption. On the Great Western route, 12 terminals, mostly on slow lines, would be permanently affected. My hon. Friends the Members for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) and for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), and the hon. Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter) made the point that there is a real issue of disruption caused by displacement. We heard that that could even have an effect as far afield as Norwich and Oxford. The idea that this project should be considered solely as a metro service, and solely as the concern of London, when it has these wider implications, is way off beam.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_352">In addition, a number of constituencies will be particularly affected. In the west, Crossrail will terminate in Maidenhead, which has an extremely busy commuter station served by fast and semi-fast trains at peak times. As my right hon. Fried the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) made clear, the introduction of Crossrail not only threatens to replace those with a slow stopping service, but might reduce the number of trains, and worst of all damage that aesthetic masterpiece, the Brunel bridge. Can we really ask the people of Maidenhead to endure this for five or six years for a worse service than they have at the moment?
</p>





<p><a name="st_224"><a name="50719-31_spnew9"><b> Mrs. May: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for reiterating the points that I made earlier about the impact of Crossrail on Maidenhead. The residents of Maidenhead will not only get a worse service and have to suffer the view of Brunel&#039;s bridge being destroyed by the electrification gantries, but the station at Maidenhead will have to be completely redeveloped. At the moment, there is no feeling that there is even the space available for the proposed depot. Is not that yet another reason why the line should go to Reading rather than stopping at Maidenhead?
</p>





<p><a name="st_225"><a name="50719-31_spnew10"><b> Mr. Hayes: </b> 
 As the hon. Member for Reading, West and my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson) said, there is a case to be made for that, and the Select Committee should certainly consider it, which is precisely the argument of a variety of Members 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1207</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in relation to its remit and terms of reference. When I heard the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead, I thought to myself, &quot;With a determined and articulate representative like that, it is no wonder that she saw off the Liberals in Maidenhead and will always do so when the test comes.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_353">Speaking of Liberals, there are a variety of local environmental concerns, and the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) pointed them out. There are also fears that far from being a regional railway, Crossrail is now a metro scheme&#151;no longer part of an integral railway network. Some say that the project is increasingly being driven by the Mayor of London&#151;hardly the best person to deliver a train service to the people of Berkshire, Essex, Kent or elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_354">There is much local opposition to the proposed 24-hour maintenance depot at Rush Green. The petition had 2,302 signatories, and what a feisty campaigner they have in my hon. Friend the Member for Romford (Andrew Rosindell). I tell him, the people of Romford and the House that when we are returned to office, which will be before the project starts if this Government have anything to do with it, we will reprieve the people of Romford and consider seriously the alternative highlighted tonight by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles)&#151;the North Pole depot west of Paddington. When the Eurotunnel rail link is complete, that depot will become vacant, and it seems to be a suitable alternative to blighting the lives of the people of Romford, as has been properly drawn to the House&#039;s attention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_355">In an intervention, my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) expressed concerns about Heathrow. The BAA has expressed its concern:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;The Bill as drafted, combined with Crossrail&#039;s projected services, would decrease the proportion of rail passengers travelling to Heathrow.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_356">According to a preliminary study by an independent transport consultant commissioned by the BAA, the replacement of the dedicated non-stop Heathrow Express services with stopping Crossrail services could result in the loss of 3 to 4 per cent. of Heathrow airport&#039;s public transport share. Such a result would mean that the objective increase in public transport access to the airport as required by the Government&#039;s White Paper, 2The Future of Air Transport&quot;, would not be realised. The current proposals will take over paths and platform space already safeguarded by BAA for the Airtrack project which would link Heathrow with Waterloo for the first time. Moreover, terminal 5 does not have the capacity to accommodate the Heathrow Express and Crossrail. Crossrail&#039;s proposal therefore implies that either Airtrack or Heathrow Express to terminal 5 is no longer possible. Surely it is not too much to ask that we maintain good public transport access to Heathrow airport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_357">As my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton said, the Bill as currently drafted threatens fundamental principles of independent regulation&#151;another point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead and others. The powers under the Bill, if exercised, could negatively affect Network Rail&#039;s ability to deliver services and challenge the wider principles of independent regulation. That would threaten business confidence, with wider implications for future private sector investment.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-31_para15">
<a name="stpa_358">The Crossrail Bill also creates a potential conflict. It instructs the Office of Rail Regulation to give priority to Crossrail. Clause 15 of the Olympics Bill, however, would place the ORR under an obligation to assist in the development of the Olympics, with a clear implication that it should give priority to the Olympics. Which is to come first? We heard nothing about that from the Secretary of State. Will the Minister clarify the matter, as I would have expected the Government to be absolutely clear about how Crossrail and the Olympics interact and overlap?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-31_para16">
<a name="stpa_359">The Bill also threatens the expropriation of private property rights. It gives the Secretary of State power to take over, without compensation, Heathrow Express, in which BAA has invested around &#163;750 million over the past decade.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-31_para17">
<a name="stpa_360">The Select Committee must be allowed to satisfy itself in regard to: concerns about Crossrail&#039;s construction; powers taken under the Bill; and railway planning in the context of the Olympics. That is why we tabled our instruction to the Committee. The Government must address other important questions. What potential is there for capacity growth? Have the Government affirmed tonight that Reading remains the objective beyond Maidenhead, or have they merely confused the House because of their own confusion? Does the increasing involvement of the Mayor of London mean that Crossrail will remain a metro service, or will it eventually serve regional needs?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-31_para18">
<a name="stpa_361">It is claimed that Crossrail will provide indirect benefits by releasing capacity at Liverpool Street station so that more trains can run from the Lee valley to Stansted. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire pointed out, train operators have said that that will not work because the route is already at the limit of its capacity elsewhere. Is there potential for capacity to expand to services to Stansted and other growth areas?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-31_para19">
<a name="stpa_362">In his opening statement, the Secretary of State said very little that could remove the uncertainty surrounding the funding of the project. In public, business leaders say they are behind the project, and indeed they and we remain behind it in principle. In private, however, they tell me of their grave concerns about their contribution. It is not simply a question of size; they are also concerned about whether they will have a meaningful say in the project&#039;s management. If business is expected to make a major contribution, it will expect to have some say in the governance of Crossrail. I do not think that that is unreasonable, but the Government and Crossrail have only just addressed the issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-31_para20">
<a name="stpa_363">We must get this project right. If Crossrail does not happen, that will undermine business confidence and the Government&#039;s ability to deliver part-funded infrastructure projects in the future. We know that the Government have committed themselves in a very significant way. An investigation of Crossrail in 2004 revealed that 265 staff members were involved in    planning the project. According to another investigation, rents on prestige offices in St James&#039;s park for Cross London Rail Links, the parent company, were costing &#163;745,000 a year. In answer to a question that I tabled recently, the Minister said that in the last financial year those office costs had trebled to

<br>&nbsp;<br>&#163;1,907,000. He also revealed that his Department had spent &#163;1,937,000 on consultancy in the last financial year, in answer to a question that I tabled on 12 July.

 I understand that the Superlink project is privately funded and I have met representatives. I do not necessarily share my hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_364">Crossrail has been spending &#163;1 million a week for the last three years, and now it wants even more money so that it can do the same for the next three years. Yet we do not know whether digging will ever begin on either of the two tunnels, or whether a single piece of track will ever be laid. There is still no clarity, there is still no business plan, there is still no well-defined vehicle for investment, and there is still no certainty about the budget. Perhaps it is the Treasury&#039;s doubts about the scheme that threaten to undermine it. Those doubts will surely grow in the light of the successful Olympic bid.

Londoners, however, deserve better than the mixture of muddle and delay that has characterised the Government&#039;s approach to this project&#151;and throughout that time, millions of pounds of taxpayers&#039; money has been spent. I suspect that under the present Government Crossrail will remain a ghost train on a phantom line.

<p>
<a name="50719-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_368">I want to respond to points made in the debate about the petitions and the instructions. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, it is for the Select Committee to consider the petitions that come before it. The Government have tabled an instruction that sets out the specific proposition of running a railway between Maidenhead in the west and Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east, with intermediate stations. The purpose of the instruction is to give the Committee a clear sense of the shape and form of Crossrail. The Secretary of State made it clear on several occasions that he expects the Select Committee to be able to consider representations about and objections to the route. If the Select Committee believes that the objections have merit, it can report them to the House. The Secretary of State spelled out that the Government have chosen to take a light-touch approach to the instructions, so I expect the Committee to consider any representations that it receives. I want to make it clear that, if the Committee thinks that it cannot consider any matters that it judges have merit, the Government will be prepared to consider the terms of the instruction so that the House has every opportunity properly to discuss the Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="st_231"><a name="50719-32_spnew4"><b> Mr. Duncan: </b> 
 That is very confusing. What the House says does not depend on what Ministers then say can happen but on what this House says Ministers and Committees can do. Has the Minister confirmed with the Clerks of the House that what the Secretary of State says is right&#151;that those who petition to say that the route should be extended to Reading can be entertained? Can that happen or not?

The Select Committee can do that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_233"><a name="50719-32_spnew6"><b> Peter Luff: </b> 
 That is a wholly inadequate assurance. What the Government are saying is that they might find parliamentary time if the Select Committee objects to the nature of the instruction before it, but what the House needs tonight is an assurance that the Committee can look at the Reading option. That is what the Secretary of State said in his opening speech, but the Minister is falling woefully short of that now.

I understand the environmental issues that he raised that affect his constituents and I am sure that he will petition strongly during the Select Committee process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_376">It is important to remind the House of the benefits that Crossrail will bring. I have touched on some briefly but I want to continue to outline some of those that contribute to the Bill&#039;s importance. First, Crossrail will support the development of London as a world city and its role as the financial centre of the UK and Europe. Secondly, it will support the economic growth of London and its key regeneration areas by tackling congestion and the lack of capacity on the rail network. Thirdly, it will improve rail access to and across London, reducing existing journey times.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_377">But Crossrail is a project of national significance.

<p><a name="st_255"><a name="50719-33_spnew10"><b> Mr. Duncan: </b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. This is a serious point. We are in a very grey area between what the Minister is saying and what the House believes it may be voting on. All I am saying is, may I, through you, invite the Minister to make it absolutely clear that petitions can include Reading, so that there is no doubt in the eyes of tonight&#039;s proceedings or potential judicial review about what we are voting for?
</p>





<p><a name="st_256"><a name="50719-33_spmin2"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making but that is rather more a matter of debate at this stage than a point of order. But perhaps the Minister would like to respond.
</p>





<p><a name="st_257"><a name="50719-33_spnew11"><b> Derek Twigg: </b> 
 No, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I have made the position very clear. [Hon. Members: &quot;No you have not.&quot;] I am not going to go over the ground again. In terms of the transport benefits, Crossrail will enable better access to the capital for the hundreds of thousands of workers who commute into London every day and provide strategic interchanges for local, national and international business and leisure activities. I commend the Bill to the House.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. May I ask whether you have had a request from the Secretary of State for Defence to make a statement to the House on the future of the Saxaford RAF station in Unst in Shetland? It has been reported to me today that it is the intention of the Ministry of Defence to make a statement on the future of Saxaford on Thursday, which would be the last sitting day of this Session. I am reminded of the comments of Mr. Speaker in relation to the conduct of the Ministry of Defence in dealing with the future of the RAF bases at Lossiemouth and Leuchars. The RAF station at Saxaford has been an integral and valued part of Unst&#039;s community for many years. Unst is one of the remotest&#151;

The council simply holds them in trust for the community, and particularly for the vulnerable groups that use them most. The council has a duty to ensure that the halls are kept in a state of good repair and can be used at reasonable cost by the community.

<p><a name="st_296"><a name="50719-36_spnew1"><b> Alison Seabeck  (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab):</b> 
 I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise an issue that seriously concerns many of my constituents, the police and other organisations. The debate is particularly relevant as we approach the school summer holidays.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_380">What are micro bikes or mini motos? They are small&#151;the diameter of the tyres is typically between 4 and 6 in. They have two-stroke engines, which means that they are capable of speeds up to 35 mph, although fitting a supercharger allows speeds up to 40 mph. That is much faster than, for example, the speed limit in home zones, which is 20 mph. They can be bought from shops, second hand or on the internet.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_381">Micro bikes can be used on the road if the driver has the proper equipment and if they are taxed, insured and MOT-ed. I sought clarification, because a number of local people were unclear about that point, and the Department for Transport wrote to me on 15 June:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;It has always been our opinion that vehicles powered by a motor (whether combustion or electric) are mechanically propelled and therefore are defined as motor vehicles . . . This means that, in our opinion, to be used on the road mini motorcycles . . . would be required to meet all the attendant requirements under the Road Traffic Act 1988, such as compliance with stringent construction regulations, registration, road tax, insurance and MOT testing. The rider would be required to hold an appropriate driving licence&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_382">we will return to that point&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42">&quot;and wear a suitable motorcycle helmet.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_383">That is not happening in Plymouth.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_384">When parents buy those bikes for their children, I am sure that most of them intend the bikes to be used legally, but unfortunately that is not the case. A number of parents think that the bikes are toys, but they are toys capable of 40 mph. How are the bikes marketed? In Plymouth, people tell me that retailers are responsible and provide appropriate advice when they sell those machines. At last weekend&#039;s successful Plymouth motor show, I overheard a vendor tell a potential customer that the bikes should not be used on the roads, but that advice is either not being listened to or simply being ignored.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_385">I saw the danger posed by those bikes when I visited a park in Barne Barton in my constituency with Councillor Williams and Councillor Blackburn. It was a lovely sunny April day and the park was full of toddlers, when two mini bikes suddenly raced down the hill and through the park. They were piloted by a 10-year-old and a 14-year-old, who were completely oblivious to the fact that two-year-olds and three-year-olds have no sense of danger and would not leap out of their paths. Parents frantically pulled away their children as the bikes scooted through the park, out of the park, along a public road and back to the top of the park, where two new riders took over and did exactly the same thing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_386">The police were called and attended very quickly, but as soon as they arrived, the motor cyclists disappeared. One of the police officers, who was very experienced, said that he is frustrated that he cannot chase those youngsters on to the public road for obvious safety 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1227</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>reasons&#151;the bikes are very small and can barely be seen above a car bonnet, so the danger is all too apparent. To their credit, the police returned to the park later in the day and apprehended one of the bike users, which was a positive outcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_387">The problem is extremely widespread, and I gather from colleagues that they have similar problems. In Ernesettle, I saw a father and son on public land. The son, who was six or seven years old, was admittedly fully kitted out with helmet and leathers and riding on the grass, but the father had none of those things&#151;he had bare legs, nothing on his head, and a bike without a registration plate, and was on the public road riding alongside the child. They left as I approached.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_388">The problem gets worse in woodland areas such as Whitleigh and Ham woods, where it starts to approach serious antisocial behaviour whereby local residents are being harassed and threatened by people using these small bikes. I shall read from a letter that was sent to me by someone who lives in the Whitleigh woods area and wrote anonymously because they were afraid of reprisals. They say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;There is no pleasure in walking through the woods or sitting or working in the garden anymore. In fact I dread any nice weather. To invite friends round for a barbecue is totally out of the question as the motorcyclists can descend at any time and I get so frustrated and angry that there is no point in arranging anything.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="stpa_389">The writer goes on:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44">&quot;I have tried to speak to these youngsters to appeal to their good nature but they will not even speak to me but race off&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_390">That person says that their life is being made an absolute misery. Sadly, that letter is not unique&#151;I have had letters, phone calls and petitions on the same subject.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-36_para12">
<a name="stpa_391">What should be done? There are several areas of possible action, and perhaps information that could be beefed up, and I should like the Minister to consider them. I admit that some may require interdepartmental discussions. First, although it is probably too late now, there should be an information campaign in schools, perhaps with posters. In areas where there are particular problems, letters should go home to parents explaining exactly who can use these bikes, how they should be used, and where they can be used legally, as well as the penalties for breaking the law, which can be quite severe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-36_para13">
<a name="stpa_392">Secondly, when the law is broken and the culprit is caught and convicted, of course the penalty should be paid. However, the courts need to be clear about the status of these bikes. Anecdotally, there are comments that some magistrates see them as being in a different category from full-size bikes, yet they are just as dangerous and potentially lethal. The police already have powers to confiscate them, and there is a view locally that if they have been used illegally, they should not only be confiscated but crushed and taken out of the market so that the young people who are buying them might begin to focus on just how serious offence they may have committed.

<p><a name="st_297"><a name="50719-36_spnew2"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson  (Coventry, North-West) (Lab):</b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important Adjournment debate. The citizens of Coventry share many of the frustrations and inconveniences of those of Plymouth. Does she agree, and can the Minister confirm, that the police do have powers to impound bikes if fines, which can be &#163;200, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1228</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>&#163;120, &#163;80 and &#163;15 per day, are not paid within seven days? The bikes are being responsibly retailed, but police and magistrates are too unsure of their powers to give effect to them.
</p>





<p><a name="st_298"><a name="50719-36_spnew3"><b> Alison Seabeck: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for reinforcing the points that I have made. I wholly agree with him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-36_para14">
<a name="stpa_393">We have new legislation that relates specifically to antisocial behaviour and gives the police new powers in other areas over and above those specific to these machines, but they seem mainly to deal with larger groups of youths, and the bikes are often used singly or in pairs. Could riders be the subject of on-the-spot fines for using them in an antisocial, if not an illegal way? I welcome the powers that allow the police to establish dispersal zones. It may be possible for the woodlands area to become a dispersal zone but if that happened, could the behaviour within it be proscribed? Could the use of motor bikes in that area be specified or would innocent young people, who might be gathering in the woods for harmless purposes, be caught? That is the last thing I want. I would therefore welcome clarification on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-36_para15">
<a name="stpa_394">Thirdly, I have seen no registration numbers on the bikes. I assume that, if they are to be used on public roads, they should be registered. To be honest, I have doubts about whether they should be allowed on public roads because they are invisible to most car users. I would therefore welcome it if my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary discussed with his colleagues in the Department for Transport whether we could realistically consider banning them from public roads.

 My roving advice bureau on the roads around Woolmore road in Erdington on Friday was dominated partly by the complaints of householders about the bikes and partly by the noise of the bikes themselves. I have serious doubts about whether they can be used safely and reasonably anywhere. They are a menace, they make an appalling noise and they must be dangerous. The message has to go to the police, local authorities and parents to use all their powers fully to clamp down on them.
</p>





<p><a name="st_300"><a name="50719-37_spnew1"><b> Alison Seabeck: </b> 
 My hon. Friend&#039;s description exactly applies to my local area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-37_para0">
<a name="stpa_395">My fourth point is about adverts and whether those placed in local papers and on the internet can be controlled. To give only one example, Shop.Com advertises the machines under the heading &quot;Boys Stuff&quot;. The opening paragraph states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45">&quot;Experience the rush of motorbike racing in the park or the garden, with no licence required!&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_396">That encourages illegal behaviour effortlessly. I do not know how many people have gardens that are large enough for riders to achieve a speed of 35 mph but there are not many in my part of Plymouth. Simply to excite people, the advert continues:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;Serious thrillseekers and hedonists should waste no time in climbing aboard one of these.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="stpa_397">It tells people that they can achieve
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;amazing speeds of approximately 37 mph, which feels mindblowing when you&#039;re a matter of inches from the ground.&quot;</p>

<a name="50719-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_398">It may well be mind-blowing but the thought of a child going at such a speed is terrifying.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_399">At the very end, the advert states that it is illegal to use the bikes on the public highway but only after it has stimulated people, misled them and encouraged illegal behaviour. I would therefore like measures to ensure that, wherever the bikes are sold&#151;in shops, second hand or on the internet&#151;they are accompanied by a clear health warning about how and where they should be used.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_400">Fifthly, will the Home Office please discuss with other Departments the way in which we can encourage the establishment of areas for safe, off-road use of the bikes? I have evidence from around the country of police forces&#151;to their credit, it is largely police forces&#151;who are trying to find venues for off-roading. The police in Plymouth are trying but the site that they found was opposed by residents on the ground of noise, which my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon) highlighted earlier. In Torbay, PC Chris Lancaster is fighting for the young people in his area and thinks that he has found a venue. In Portsmouth, PC Andy Burnham, who is no relation to the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)&#151;I do not believe that he has a second career&#151;is trying to set up a summer scheme, which provides helmets and a safe venue where young people can enjoy the micro and mini moto bikes. I am sure that, when used properly, they are great fun and we do not want to spoil anybody&#039;s fun.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_401">As the summer holidays approach, I want to put on record my genuine anxiety that some extremely serious accidents could happen. The use of the bikes has increased significantly and there is a lack of public and especially parental awareness about how they should be used legally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_402">As a parent, I have to say that the thought of a 10-year-old going through a public park at 35 mph with no safety equipment is shocking and frightening. I hope that the Home Office will do all that it can through its agencies to distribute information, as well as considering how we can clamp down on the illegal use of these machines without spoiling the fun of the genuine rider.

They also exit the field at speeds of up to 35 mph, racing across the pavement into the road, nearly knocking down pedestrians in the process and sometimes going into the path of passing cars. It is only a matter of time before a serious accident occurs. Indeed, in Warmley, not far from my constituency, at the end of June a six-year-old boy was knocked down by a mini-motor bike driven by a 16-year-old who rode off, leaving the little boy covered in blood.

There is a range of powers that can be used to deal with the illegal use of these vehicles, especially when they are being used in an antisocial manner.

<p>
<a name="50719-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_407">It might be helpful if I say a little more about the type of vehicle and bike to which we are referring in this debate. The term &quot;mini motos&quot; covers both petrol-driven mini-motor bikes, which are fast vehicles, as well as the slower go-peds, which is the common name for electric and petrol-driven scooters. Quad bikes are sometimes classed as mini motos, but there is a fundamental difference between them, which I will explain in a little more detail later in my speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-37_para13">
<a name="stpa_408">Petrol-driven mini-motor bikes are small bikes that replicate racing bikes and off-road scrambler bikes. They stand only 23 in high, and my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport clearly illustrated the problems that that can cause. They have an engine size of about 50 cc, and some can travel at speeds up to 60 mph, which I know will be of concern to my hon. Friend. They can cost up to &#163;500. Go-peds look similar to the old fashioned push-scooters that you and I might remember pushing around in our younger days, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but they have an engine block around the back wheel, and can travel at speeds around 20 mph. They can cost up to &#163;1,000. However, there are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>
<a name="50719-37_para14">
<a name="stpa_409">The term &quot;mini moto&quot; and the problems associated with their irresponsible use are relatively new phenomena. It is probably fair to say that many members of the public, particularly parents, are generally unaware of the health and safety implications of these bikes, or of the legislation governing their use. These vehicles are being sold without any age restrictions and are becoming increasingly popular among young people. Prices continue to fall and the number of retailers selling them has also increased. Currently, the majority of such vehicles are bought over the internet, through mail order and from specialist shops, but some high street stores are beginning to sell lower-priced, lower-speed models.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-37_para15">
<a name="stpa_410">There is a growing sport around mini motos, but in many instances, as my hon. Friends have described, they are being used illegally. Information on the number of incidents associated with mini motos is not collected centrally by the Government, but the Home Office has received some general information on their misuse, which suggests that the problem is increasingly widespread. Colleagues in the Department for Transport are also concerned about the implications for road safety, because the majority of users are riding illegally on roads and pavements without any safety equipment. Mini motos are sold as toys and are not manufactured, licensed, taxed or insured to be ridden on a road.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck) on securing this debate, on a subject that is a huge problem in Wellingborough. I will be brief. As such vehicles should not be used on the roads, is such use to be made clearly illegal? There seem to be some doubts within the police on this issue.

<p><a name="st_304"><a name="50719-38_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I was about to clarify that point. The advice given to my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport by the Department for Transport is accurate. It is possible for a mini moto to be ridden legally on a road, but for that to happen it would have to meet certain construction standards, such as the requirements demanded by European directive 2002/24/EC. It would be prohibitively expensive to convert such a vehicle to that standard. Quad bikes, however, are built to that standard, so it is possible for them to be properly licensed and used on the road. By and large, however, mini motos are bought, sold and used as toys, and are not built to the standard that would allow them to be taxed, licensed and used on the roads.

<a name="50719-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_411">As far as the Department for Transport is concerned, there are no age restrictions on the purchase of any motor vehicle. The restrictions are placed instead on how and where vehicles can be used. Let me make it absolutely clear, bearing in mind that mini motos are unlikely to be used legally on the roads due to the excessive cost of conversion and raising the standards as I have described, that the only place where they could be used legally is on private land and with the owner&#039;s consent, which in many instances, particularly in constituencies such as that of my hon. Friend the

<br>&nbsp;<br>Member for Plymouth, Devonport, would be land owned by the local authority. Steps could be taken by retailers, for example, who could make information much more readily available when the bikes are purchased about the legal position on the use and requirements of mini motos. While many such vehicles are purchased by adults who then give them to their children as gifts, the relevant Departments will examine the possibility of encouraging retailers to do more about this issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_412">The most commonly used legal power for dealing with mini motos is under the Police Reform Act 2002. It allows a constable in uniform, after giving a warning to the rider, to stop and seize a motor vehicle if he or she has grounds for believing that it is being used in a careless and inconsiderate manner, that it is being used illegally off-road, or that it is being used, or is likely to be used, in an antisocial manner, causing harassment, alarm or distress. If the police confiscate vehicles using that power before the owner can take back the vehicle, a release fee of around &#163;120 must be paid. Information coming back to the Home Office suggests that that is proving to be a successful tool for dealing with misuse, notwithstanding the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West.

<p><a name="st_305"><a name="50719-38_spnew2"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </b> 
 Precisely on that point, will the Minister confirm that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency&#151;which I know is not his immediate department responsibility, but there must be liaison between the two Departments&#151;has taken legal advice, and that because such vehicles have no tax, they categorically cannot be driven on roads, and the police therefore have absolute authority to impound them and apply the fines? Whatever we do to encourage more responsible marketing and retailing, we cannot inhibit the internet trade. The only effective measure is therefore to make defying the law prohibitively expensive. Will he clarify that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_306"><a name="50719-38_spnew3"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I can certainly confirm that to be used legally on the road, such a vehicle would have to meet a high standard. It would be prohibitively expensive to convert one for the purpose. It is clear that people do not buy these vehicles intending to use them legally on the road.
</p>





<p><a name="st_307"><a name="50719-38_spnew4"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </b> 
 What about the tax?
</p>





<p><a name="st_308"><a name="50719-38_spnew5"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The question generally does not arise, for the reasons that I have given. It is clear, however, that when the vehicles are used illegally they can be impounded. The release fee has to be paid, and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport suggested earlier, if it is not paid, the vehicle can be crushed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_413">When one of these vehicles is ridden on the pavement, the police can treat that as an offence under the Highways Act 1835. The maximum penalty is &#163;500. When the rider is a child, the police may choose instead to warn him and advise his parents as necessary. The police also have powers of arrest when there are reasonable grounds for believing that such action is necessary to prevent the rider of the mini moto, or motor cyclist, from causing physical injury to himself or to any other person.

<a name="stpa_414">When someone commits a driving offence but does not hold a current driving licence, for example by virtue of his or her age, a court can still order the endorsement of the offender&#039;s licence. The offender may not have a licence, but when he or she applies for one, the endorsement will automatically feature on it.
</p>

<a name="50719-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_415">Local authorities also have powers to manage such problems. They can make byelaws under section 235 of the Local Government Act 1972, prohibiting the use of mini motos, or any other vehicle for that matter, in particular areas. While byelaws cannot duplicate general legislation, they can be used to prohibit the use of mini motos in shopping-centre car parks, pedestrianised areas and the like. Furthermore, local authorities are required under section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to take reasonable steps to check their areas periodically for existing and potential statutory nuisances. My hon. Friend mentioned the noise made by some vehicles. If they are causing excessive noise, a local authority can serve a noise abatement notice and can seize the vehicle that is causing the nuisance. If a person uses mini motos repeatedly and causes excessive nuisance in the community, the local authority can apply for an antisocial behaviour order to prohibit him or her from using them.

<a name="stpa_416">I am pleased to be able to tell my hon. Friend that last week, in response to the increase in problems associated with mini moto misuse, officials from the antisocial behaviour unit at the Home Office held an action day on the issue. It was attended by more than 100 staff from all over the country, bringing together local authorities, police and others to share ideas and good practice. The purpose was to encourage staff to take action against the misuse of mini motos, and attention was drawn to a number of specific interventions.

<a name="stpa_417">It is important for us to do all that we can to raise awareness of the issues, as my hon. Friend has been able to do this evening. She made some very sensible suggestions about the use of leaflets, campaigning materials and information that can heighten awareness among members of the public who may not appreciate the dangers and the legal position. I want to encourage local authorities to work with trading standards authorities, and to ensure that local retailers are acting responsibly. That may involve the production of appropriate leaflets that retailers can distribute when vehicles are sold.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_418">It is worth engaging the support of local petrol stations, especially in areas where misuse is recognised as a problem, to ensure that petrol is not sold to anyone under 16. If under-age sales are suspected, trading standards authorities can carry out test purchasing, which may result in the removal of a licence to sell petrol. Local authorities and police can also use their reporting systems to gather intelligence if they have antisocial behaviour hotlines, or information provided through neighbourhood and community wardens. That information can be used to target problem areas with high-visibility patrols or leaflet drops.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50719-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_419">Local authorities can also help to discourage misuse by making physical improvements to public areas. My hon. Friend suggested designating certain areas safe for the use of mini motos, and I think that that would be a good idea.

<a name="50719-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_420">There is a great deal of work going on. If more action days are required, the Home Office will be happy to sponsor them, but I think my hon. Friend has done a service to the House and her constituents tonight. I assure her that we will keep a close eye on what happens. I hope that in the coming months we shall see a far more responsible approach&#151;
