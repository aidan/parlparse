The House will know that today at noon the nation will remember those who died in London in the terrorist attacks.

I should be grateful if those responsible for chairing Committees would also make appropriate arrangements. Instructions will be issued to heads of departments so that those members of staff who wish to observe the two-minute silence should be enabled to do so. The House will also wish to know that I have received very many expressions of sympathy and condolence from the Speakers and the presiding officers of other Parliaments in all parts of the world. I will place these in the Library for the information of all Members.

<br>&nbsp;<br>across the country continue to benefit from the substantial increases in funding from the Government. On the detail of the dedicated schools grant consultation, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Schools has consulted members of the F40 group, including Gloucestershire, and she will meet a delegation from the country to discuss that precise point.

 (Lab): I thank the Secretary of State for that information. My schools welcome the three-year plans for budgets, particularly because in the past they have not received their annual budgets until July or August, which made budgeting extremely difficult.

</p>





<p><a name="st_7"><a name="50714-01_spnew6"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I understand very well the points that my hon. Friend is making with such commitment. Schools need more funding, and they need to be able to introduce more school sports, particularly in the light of the recent announcement on the Olympic games. The dedicated schools grant will help all schools, because it allows them to plan with certainty on the basis of budgets that, for the first time, are set for three years. That stability is important for head teachers.

 (Con): The Secretary of State will be aware that it is not just Gloucestershire that is affected; schools in Kent are concerned about the new funding system, and they are particularly worried that it will not be able to cope with the extra costs of work force reform. What reassurance can she give schools in Kent that have made representations to her that work force reform will be properly covered by the new funding formula?
</p>





<p><a name="st_9"><a name="50714-01_spnew8"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I have received representations from Kent about the implementation of planning, preparation and assessment time, which will come into force through legislation this September. Teachers have called for such a provision, and it is right that we make funding available to allow schools to plan for the coming years with predictability and certainty. That is the key to the dedicated schools grant. It is the very first time that a Government have been able to respond directly to requests from head teachers so that they have the certainty to allow them to plan, including for PPA time.

 We will set out our plans for improving information, advice and guidance for young people in the youth Green Paper, which will be published shortly.

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50714-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Crabb: </b> 
 Is the Minister aware that despite the hard efforts of many careers advisers and other professionals, figures from her Department show that the number of    16-year-old males not in full-time education, employment or training has risen by a massive 68 per cent. since 1997, and that unemployment among 16 and 17-year-olds is at its highest since records began in 1992? I strongly urge the Minister to look again at the problem of youth inactivity and in so doing to utilise the skills and experience of organisations such as Fairbridge, Weston Spirit and the Prince&#039;s Trust, which have a far better track record in tackling social exclusion than her Department.
</p>





<p><a name="st_14"><a name="50714-01_spnew12"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman knows, Connexions has met its target of returning to education, employment or training young people who were out of any of those three situations. There is a problem with statistics, in that the national statistics have been derived from different sets of data, and we are examining that. I believe the hon. Gentleman was quoting the national statistics. Connexions&#039; statistics are derived from its own direct contact with young people and represent what it has achieved, but I accept that we need to make sure that the national data and Connexions data are aligned. That is a top priority for the Government and a key target that we are actively pursuing. We want every young person to be in education, employment or training, because that is how they will improve their life chances for the future.

I know that she will not want to pre-empt her plans for the careers guidance service, but can she at least tell us that those plans will have two principles at their heart: first, that they will apply to everybody, so that all our young people will get quality careers guidance, which has not been the experience under Connexions; and secondly, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 948</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that they will enshrine the principle of independent careers advice, which is so important to ensure that young people get the full range of choices open to them?
</p>





<p><a name="st_16"><a name="50714-01_spnew14"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 I understand the expectation and anticipation in the various sectors as regards the Green Paper, but I will not apologise to the hon. Gentleman for the delay. We had a general election and it was important that we got the recommendations right. There is a great deal riding on the proposals in the Green Paper, and if not for the events of last week, it would probably have been published by now. I hope that nothing will come in the way of publication very shortly. The principles that the hon. Gentleman outlined are important to us. It is important that young people get impartial advice, that they can relate that advice to their experience in schools, that schools have some accountability for the advice, that it is as expert as possible, and that it is informed by the views and experience of employers. We have tried to bring all that into the recommendations that we will shortly produce.

 (Con): When the Minister produces her plans later in the year, may I urge her to involve business more in careers guidance, and also to consider students with higher academic achievement? Connexions seems to have done a good job in some areas for those who are less academic, but not such a good job for those with higher academic achievement.
</p>





<p><a name="st_18"><a name="50714-01_spnew16"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 I agree on the point about business. We want to ensure that that is built into the system. I know that employers and the CBI feel strongly about that, as do we. Young people should get a range of advice about all the academic, vocational and careers opportunities at an early stage, so that that can inform their curriculum choices. We are trying to achieve that. On Connexions more generally, it has done well with children with additional needs. That is undisputed. There are Connexions services that provide good information and advice, although I accept that the Ofsted picture is more variable on that front. We are trying to ensure that we build on the best of Connexions in what we produce.

 (Lab): What assessment she has made of the work of the union learning fund in assisting women to improve basic skills.  [11919]
</p>


<p><a name="st_19"><a name="50714-02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Phil Hope): </b> 
 The union learning fund is a major success story. It has helped to train nearly 12,000 union learning representatives in more 3,000 workplaces, and it has brought more than 167,000 workers back into learning. The scheme increasingly engages women workers and helps them to improve their basic skills.
</p>





<p><a name="st_20"><a name="50714-02_spnew0"><b> Gwyn Prosser: </b> 
 My hon. Friend shares my enthusiasm for the union learning fund&#039;s excellent work with non-traditional learners all over the country. Will he pay special tribute to the work of the GMB union, which is doing a grand job in the southern region training care 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 949</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>workers from basic skills to NVQ2? What is he doing to ensure that the union learning fund provides equal opportunities for women, and what would be the impact of scrapping the whole scheme, which is the Conservative party&#039;s plan?
</p>





<p><a name="st_21"><a name="50714-02_spnew1"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 I know the importance of the union learning fund, because, when I visited a factory in Leeds called Pittards a few weeks ago, I was deeply impressed by the way in which union learning representatives were involving shop-floor workers, many of whom had not engaged with learning since they left school 20 or 30 years ago. I pay tribute to the GMB, which is one of the unions that has been involved for many years in training social care workers through the union learning fund. The scheme is being extended to those industries with a higher proportion of women workers, such as social care and retail. I must tell my hon. Friend that 80 per cent. of the workers involved in the learning opportunities at the Transport and General Workers Union Leeds learning exchange are female, and that some 75 per cent. of the skills for life learners at the three Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers centres in Greater Manchester are women.

</p>





<p><a name="st_23"><a name="50714-02_spnew3"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 Yes; I welcome the 192 signatures to the early-day motion in support of the union learning fund. Indeed, some Opposition Front Benchers have broken ranks with the Tory&#039;s policy of abolishing the union learning fund to support that EDM, and I am delighted that they have done so. Some unions and employers include training and skills in collective bargaining agreements, and the Department of Trade and Industry is currently reviewing the statutory basis for that practice. I remind hon. Members that we have already introduced a statutory right to time off with pay for union learning representatives to carry out their duties. It is a shame that the Conservative party has pledged to abolish the union learning fund, because at least 15 Conservative Members would clearly benefit from the leadership training courses.

 My hon. Friend will have heard the exchange between my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and various hon. Members on Question 1. He also knows that my right hon.

</p>





<p><a name="st_28"><a name="50714-02_spnew7"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will be aware that all local education authorities receive the same basic per-pupil funding entitlement according to the age of the pupils. Differences in funding occur between LEAs, so there is top-up funding that recognises the incidence of factors such as additional education needs, deprivation, sparsity where there is rurality, and problems in recruiting and retaining staff. That explains the differences between LEAs that seem on the face of it to be similar.

 (Lab): On the additional money for the deprivation factor, does my hon.

Does she further acknowledge that new evidence submitted by F40&#151;the fair education funding forum&#151;in response to the recent consultation showed how every school could get precisely the correct amount of money for all the children who come to their school from deprived backgrounds?

 (Con): If she will make a statement on her policy on allowing good schools to expand.  [11922]
</p>


<p><a name="st_33"><a name="50714-02_spmin2"><b>The Minister for Schools  (Jacqui Smith): </b> 
 We strongly support the expansion of successful and popular schools where they believe that they can sustain high quality for their students. We have therefore provided that all schools may publish their own proposals to expand, and introduced a presumption that proposals by successful and popular schools should be approved by the local school organisation committee and the schools adjudicator. That will enable more parents to gain a place for their child at the school of their choice.
</p>





<p><a name="st_34"><a name="50714-02_spnew12"><b> Mr. Wilson: </b> 
 Is the Minister aware of the inept decision of Reading local education authority not to allow Emmer Green primary school in my constituency to take 25 additional children despite the support of teachers, governors and parents? That has led to a chain of events unfolding whereby this week the LEA spent tens of thousands of pounds on going to a judicial review challenging the rights of local parents to send their child to a local school. Does the Minister think that that requires her Department&#039;s intervention?
</p>





<p><a name="st_35"><a name="50714-02_spnew13"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concerns about the position at Emmer Green primary school. I am sure that he understands, however, that in order to maintain the considerable progress that we have made on reducing class sizes in primary schools, there will sometimes be occasions where it is not possible for all parents to get a primary school place. That is part of the background to the issues that the hon. Gentleman mentions. Of course, it is also important that local authorities carry out their responsibilities in respect of planned school places. It is right that that happens at a local level and takes parents&#039; concerns into consideration. Reading recently produced its school organisation plan for 2005&#150;10 spelling out its plans for how it can ensure that more parents are able to get places in the schools that they want. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be engaged in discussions about that with other partners in the area.

 (Lab/Co-op): Does my right hon. Friend agree that our priority should be making all schools good schools? Is it not about time that the Government addressed the fact that the vocational menu is not right for some children, who need a mix of both vocational and academic subjects? The chief inspector of schools says that A-levels will not be around in 10 years, as does the head of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. Something is going on and we should be doing something about it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_37"><a name="50714-02_spnew15"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 I strongly agree with my hon. Friend&#039;s first point about the need to ensure that all schools are good schools. I know that he shares our appreciation of teachers&#039; work in improving standards in the past seven or eight years so that there are fewer failing schools and more successful schools from which parents can choose. He also makes an important point about the progress that we need to make in ensuring that options are open, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 952</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>especially for older students, from the age of 14, to pursue an academic route or a vocational route and for there to be equal esteem. We have made considerable progress on increasing flexibility, for example, in key stage 4. However, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made clear in the 14 to 19 White Paper, there is much more that we can do and we are moving quickly towards ensuring that that progress continues.

<p><a name="st_38"><a name="50714-02_spnew16"><b> Mr. Mark Lancaster  (North-East Milton Keynes)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Minister know about Walton high school, which the Prime Minister visited recently, in Milton Keynes? It wants to expand but cannot currently expand its sixth form. The strip of land required was originally valued at &#163;12,000 and was a reserve site. However, English Partnerships has recently revalued it at &#163;234,000. Although the Minister cannot comment on that individual case, will she look into the matter? Does she believe that it is right that unaccountable and unelected Government quangos should be able to hold schools to ransom in that way?
</p>





<p><a name="st_39"><a name="50714-02_spnew17"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right: that does not fall within my area of responsibility. If he wants to send me further details, I shall consider them. However, I am sure that he knows that all Government agencies have a responsibility to ensure value for money for the assets that they own. That does not undermine our concern to ensure that, whether we are considering the development of new sixth forms or the expansion of popular and successful schools, we do even more than we have been able to achieve up to now by, for example, changing from 1 August the regulations on the speed and ease with which it is possible to make applications to expand schools. That should ensure that such expansion happens more often.

</p>





<p><a name="st_41"><a name="50714-02_spnew19"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right that we need to ensure the expansion of popular and successful schools to meet parents&#039; needs in a way that recognises the financial position and the requirements of all parents in an area. He makes a good point, which the Conservative party, in its rush to slogans rather than solutions, missed during the election campaign. I hope that Conservative Members will not continue to miss it. Another important factor is that, to enable the expansion, we need investment, especially in capital. Too often, Conservative Members have voted against the additional resources that we are investing in schools, which enable the expansion of successful schools and the renovation and rebuilding of existing schools.

<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 953</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>only 379 when there are more than 50,000 appeals from parents whose children do not get into their first choice of school. Is not it time to make the process easier? The Minister referred to the changes that the Government announced last week. Although they will make the process quicker, they will not make it easier. Is not it time that popular and successful schools can expand and that the expansion is not blocked by unpopular schools or LEAs?
</p>





<p><a name="st_43"><a name="50714-02_spnew21"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 Since we changed the policy in 2003 to enable the expansion of popular and successful applications, we have received 20 applications and approved seven.

That is why we are changing the regulations from 1 August and are willing to put in the capital to make it happen.

 (Lab): What progress has been made since 1997 on literacy standards at key stages 1 and 2.  [11923]
</p>


<p><a name="st_44"><a name="50714-03_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Schools  (Jacqui Smith): </b> 
 Literacy standards in primary schools have increased dramatically since 1997. In 2004, 78 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved the target level 4 of the national curriculum in English, an increase of 15 percentage points compared with 1997. At key stage 1, 85 per cent. of seven-year-olds achieved the target level 2 of the national curriculum in reading, and 82 per cent. achieved level 2 in writing, compared with 80 per cent. in 1997.

 I thank my right hon. Friend for that reply. As we approach the end of the school year, I should like to pay tribute to all our teachers for the hard work that they are undertaking to achieve those results. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear!&quot;] Will my right hon. Friend tell me how our literacy standards compare with those of other countries?
</p>





<p><a name="st_46"><a name="50714-03_spnew1"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 First, I completely agree with the emphasis that my hon. Friend places on the efforts of teachers to bring about these improvements. She is absolutely right to commend their efforts. She also raises   the important question of how we compare internationally. Increasingly, in this globally competitive world, the ability of our young people to acquire literacy and numeracy skills is crucial. I am sure that my hon. Friend will therefore be pleased to learn that in a recent Progress in International Reading Literacy study in 2003, England&#039;s 10-year-olds achieved the third highest score out of the 35 countries surveyed. That is a credit to those children, their parents and their teachers.

 (Con): The figures that the right hon. Lady has cited have actually plateaued at 78 per cent. for at least five consecutive years, so it is clear that more needs to be done. That is why we very much welcome the Government&#039;s decision to hold a review into the use of synthetic phonics in the teaching of reading. That will go 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 954</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a long way towards raising reading standards among the one in five 11-year-olds who are failing to reach the required standard. Will the right hon. Lady assure the House that, if Jim Rose finds in favour of synthetic phonics, the national literacy strategy will be amended to recommend pure synthetic phonics in the first 16 weeks of formal schooling, and the teacher training colleges will be asked to train teachers in the necessary techniques?
</p>





<p><a name="st_48"><a name="50714-03_spnew3"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for welcoming the review that we have set up under the leadership of Jim Rose, the former director of inspection at Ofsted. We have achieved these successes in literacy not least because we have been willing to consider evidence as the basis for the national literacy strategy. This is a continuation of our willingness to do that. We have asked Jim Rose to look at the evidence to determine what works, particularly in early years learning in relation to literacy, and to consider the emphasis on synthetic phonics. It is worth placing on record that, before the national literacy strategy, there was no approach to synthetic phonics in this country. The strategy introduced the requirement for the use of synthetic phonics every day for children between the ages of four and six, and that requirement continues. Of course we shall want to look very carefully at what Jim Rose, and those who support, advise and work with him, have to say about this issue, and we shall use their findings as part of our review of the literacy guidance that we offer to teachers as part of the primary strategy, in order to ensure that we continue the considerable progress that we have made in literacy since 1997.

<p><a name="qn_6">8. <a name="50714-03_wqn1"><b> Mr. Iain Wright  (Hartlepool)</b> 
 (Lab): What progress is being made on measures to help children with dyslexia.  [11924]
</p>


<p><a name="st_49"><a name="50714-03_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Maria Eagle): </b> 
 The Department works closely with the British Dyslexia Association and the Dyslexia Institute to help children with dyslexia. A   range of materials have been produced by the primary and secondary national strategies with the aim of raising standards in English schools. The most recent is a CD-ROM entitled &quot;Learning and teaching for dyslexic children&quot;. This helps schools to increase awareness of dyslexia and to develop approaches to enable learners with dyslexia to succeed.
</p>





<p><a name="st_50"><a name="50714-03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Wright: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for her reply. She will be pleased to hear that another Sure Start centre is about to open in my constituency. That is another great example of the Government giving children the best possible start in life. However, one of the gaps in Sure Start&#039;s work is the inadequacy of provision for identifying dyslexia in very young children. What additional work will the Minister undertake to ensure that very young children with dyslexia are identified at the earliest possible age, and that suitable training, teaching and resources are provided to ensure that they fulfil their potential?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 955</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_51"><a name="50714-03_spnew5"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises an important point. I am glad that another Sure Start is to open in his constituency, because the facilities that it offers can certainly help to identify such issues. It is quite difficult to identify dyslexia in very young children until they begin to develop their literacy skills. Signs of language delay, for example, can be an indicator, but only when specific difficulties in reading, spelling, written language and so on start to show can diagnosis easily be made. The resources to which I have referred will help school staff and those working with children to increase their awareness and understanding of the barriers to learning presented by dyslexia, the behaviour to which it gives rise and teaching strategies to overcome them. The focus on this issue in the special educational needs code of practice will therefore ensure earlier diagnosis and better strategies to cope with the consequences.
</p>





<p><a name="st_52"><a name="50714-03_spnew6"><b> Mr. James Gray  (North Wiltshire)</b> 
 (Con): Will the Minister agree that there is an important role to be played by private independent schools specialising in correcting dyslexia, of which there are currently eight across England, one of which is at Thickwood in my constituency? Their main clients, of course, are the local education authorities. Does she agree that it is important that we should encourage local education authorities to make use of the outstanding facilities available in those special schools?
</p>





<p><a name="st_53"><a name="50714-03_spnew7"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. Dyslexia is a spectrum disorder&#151;it does not present in the same way in every individual, and people are affected in different ways. Of the 82,000 or so children who fall into the category and are identified, more than 99 per cent. are in mainstream education. It is therefore tremendously important that our mainstream schools understand the needs of learners with dyslexia. That is not to say that special school provision does not have a role to play for some pupils&#151;there are some 700 children in special schools whose main disabling condition is dyslexia. Given the fact that it is a spectrum disorder, it is important that the provision can cope with both ends of that spectrum. I am sure that the school in his constituency, and the others to which he refers, have an important role to play.
</p>





<p><a name="st_54"><a name="50714-03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Jim Cunningham  (Coventry, South)</b> 
 (Lab): Is my hon. Friend satisfied with the proposals to close several special needs schools in Coventry? It seems to me that Coventry&#039;s education system has been subject to perpetual reorganisation for the past 25 years.
</p>





<p><a name="st_55"><a name="50714-03_spnew9"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 My hon. Friend will be aware of the fact that following the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, schools reorganisation is no longer a matter for Ministers but for local authorities through school organisation committees. I am sure, however, that he, parents and those in Coventry who are concerned about any such proposals will make the necessary points to those who make these decisions, and that the proposals can be changed to ones that are believed to be more suitable. That is a matter for local decision.
</p>





<p><a name="st_56"><a name="50714-03_spnew10"><b> Mr. David Cameron  (Witney)</b> 
 (Con): Is the Minister aware of the research that shows that some 20 per cent 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 956</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of pupils in independent schools are identified as having dyslexia, whereas the figure for state schools is just 2 per cent? How does she explain that discrepancy?
</p>





<p><a name="st_57"><a name="50714-03_spnew11"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 I am not able to explain that discrepancy. I would be happy to examine the research to which the hon. Gentleman refers, and to return to him on that. As I have said, there are some 82,000 children whose main disabling condition has been identified as specific learning difficulties that include dyslexia. As we have already established, dyslexia is not always easy to diagnose and is a spectrum disorder, so one cannot say unequivocally where a particular individual is on the spectrum.
</p>





<p><a name="st_58"><a name="50714-03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b> 
 While dyslexia is difficult to diagnose, will the Minister consider the simple tests being used in one secondary school in Banbury to identify it? Does she agree that alongside synthetic phonics, simple testing for dyslexia and remedial teaching are essential if we are to deal with literacy problems? If one cannot read, one cannot learn, and should not that be a higher priority for the Government?
</p>





<p><a name="st_59"><a name="50714-03_spnew13"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 It is a high priority for the Government. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that diagnosis is the key to remedial activity, and the earlier the diagnosis the better. I have made the point, however, that it is difficult to diagnose dyslexia in very young children, partly because of the way in which it presents itself and because it is a spectrum disorder. I would be happy to return to him, however, in respect of the points that he has raised.
</p>





<p><a name="st_60"><a name="50714-03_spnew14"><b> Ms Angela C. Smith  (Sheffield, Hillsborough)</b> 
 (Lab): In Sheffield we have developed interventions for children with special educational needs, particularly those with literacy difficulties, as part of the city&#039;s primary inclusion strategy.

</p>





<p><a name="st_61"><a name="50714-03_spnew15"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend&#039;s local authority. I am certain that local initiatives have a great deal to teach in this regard outside their own area, and that many authorities will be willing to learn from that one. Certainly the Department is.

 There are problems in Lancashire with the provision of further and adult education. Although there has been a big increase in further education

</p>





<p><a name="st_64"><a name="50714-04_spnew1"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 I know that my hon. Friend takes a genuine interest in further education in his constituency, but I think it important to address the facts. This year Runshaw college, one of the main colleges that concern him, has received an overall 6 per cent. increase. That mirrors the national pattern: seven out of 10 colleges have received above-inflation increases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-04_para0">
<a name="stpa_1">What is rightly taking place, however, is the implementation of the Government&#039;s skills strategy, which received widespread support on both sides of the House when it was launched. Within a budget that has increased overall, we are prioritising the needs of 16 to 18-year-olds achieving level 2 qualifications in adult basic skills. Inevitably, that puts pressure on adult leisure and recreation courses. I am not saying that such provision should end; I am saying that if employers and individuals value it, we should look at the fees-charging strategy. Even the current average, &#163;1.42 per hour, represents very good value for money.

</p>





<p><a name="st_66"><a name="50714-04_spnew3"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 I take my hon. Friend&#039;s point. The Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Phil Hope), and I have had several discussions with FE colleges about it. I have told them to ensure that they map such provision carefully in the context of the national framework. When they do so, more often than not they find that the courses are provided for. We must also ensure that the current strategy, which I believe is right, does not have unintended consequences, and we will keep that under review.

 Yes, I completely agree. The historical weakness in our education system is that we have never truly valued vocational education or provided real opportunities for young people to mix academic and vocational learning. We have to provide our young people with the opportunity to do hands-on practical subjects&#151;such as cookery, hairdressing and engineering&#151;that they can learn in a real setting, and which are taught by people who understand them and can teach them properly.

She is also right in pointing out that we want to introduce more challenge and stretch into the system, and to make the unit grades available to universities that need them, in order to differentiate between students. We are also introducing an advance extension award paper that students can choose to sit, in addition to their A-levels, to demonstrate their ability in a particular subject. That, too, will be available to universities. Moreover, we are piloting an extended project that will allow students to demonstrate over a prolonged period real scholarship and independent research, and to produce a separate piece of work that could also be made available to the university sector.

Sometimes children get out of hand, but the parents are doing their best and the courts acknowledge it. In those circumstances, it would be inappropriate to oblige them to undertake a course through a parenting order. However, it is clear that other parents allow their children to be out very late, in inappropriate circumstances.

 (Con): What steps he has taken to publicise the rights of victims of crime to appeal against lenient sentences.  [11938]
</p>


<p><a name="st_84"><a name="50714-05_spmin3"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service requires advocates who know of a complaint about a sentence to inform victims of their right to refer sentences to the Attorney-General. If the CPS decides not to refer a case, it is required by guidance to notify victims without delay, so that they have the opportunity to complain direct to the Law Officers.

 I thank the Solicitor-General for that answer. It bears a striking similarity to the one that I was given on 1 May 2002, which can be found at column 822 in the relevant edition of the <i>Official Report</i>. However, his predecessor told me:

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-05_para2">
<a name="stpa_5">That right was the right to complain, and I quoted the right hon. and learned Lady&#039;s reply again on 9 January 2003, at column 315 of the <i>Official Report</i> for that date. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 962</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will look at that extract. Most ordinary people do not read the Home Office&#039;s publications or look at its website. What steps is he taking to ensure that people know that they have the right to complain as soon as a sentence is passed?
</p>





<p><a name="st_86"><a name="50714-05_spmin4"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman raises an issue that needs to be brought to the attention of the CPS, and I shall ensure that its staff are aware of the importance that this House attaches to this matter. The CPS must carry out its obligations to inform victims, their families and, where appropriate, witnesses about the various rights that they have. It is not the Law Officers&#039; role to publicise those rights. That is best done by the CPS, which ought to be close to the court proceeding and able to inform witnesses, and victims in particular, of their rights to refer matters. Subsequently, the CPS is under an obligation to inform victims, in writing, that they have the right to refer a matter direct to the Attorney-General. These are important issues, and I welcome the interest that the hon. Gentleman takes in them.
</p>





<p><a name="st_87"><a name="50714-05_spnew3"><b> Vera Baird  (Redcar)</b> 
 (Lab): The CPS has the primary responsibility for referring unduly lenient sentences, but I am a little concerned that it does so only patchily. A constituent of mine, Mr. Taylor, was knocked over and kicked in the head. He was saved from worse injury being inflicted by two young men who had received very nominal sentences for previous convictions for violence. I have much respect for my local senior Crown prosecutor, but it did not appear that that case would be taken on until I had written about it. Are systematic procedures in place to ensure that each sentence is reviewed as soon as it is given out, and that the possibility of review is always at the forefront of the mind of those who work for the CPS?
</p>





<p><a name="st_88"><a name="50714-05_spmin5"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 I hesitate slightly before I answer, as the last time that I responded to Solicitor-General&#039;s questions&#151;the first time that had done so, in fact&#151;I had to apologise to the House for the CPS&#039; failure to refer what had happened in a homicide case to a victim&#039;s family. The CPS does not always carry out its duty as efficiently as we would prefer, but the procedures exist and are implemented in the vast majority of cases. The CPS&#039; obligations are much more at the forefront of its staff&#039;s minds than they ever have been in the past. There has been a remarkable transformation in the CPS, which now acknowledges its responsibility to do justice and to ensure, along with the police, that victims and their families, and witnesses, are informed of what is happening in court cases. Things are changing, and I hope that the local CPS of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) will be at the forefront of that change.

<p><a name="st_91"><a name="50714-05_spmin7"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service can examine the previous convictions and cautions of any witness, including defence witnesses. At court, the CPS can provide evidence of the bad character of a witness if certain conditions are satisfied.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 964</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>what controls are in place to prevent that option from being abused? In particular, when the charge levelled directly involves the police, possibly as victims, where both the defence and prosecution have a motive to look at a witness more cautiously, is there any proper and adequate control to ensure that such checks of criminal records are not abused?
</p>





<p><a name="st_93"><a name="50714-05_spmin8"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 I hope that there are sufficient protections. The Criminal Justice Act 2003, which applies after 15 December last year, imposes enhanced relevancy tests for submitting evidence that relates to the character of certain individuals. There are three grounds on which evidence of bad character can be admitted: first, if important explanatory material is involved and the court consents to its being admitted; secondly, if its use helps to prove important material issues and, again, the court consents; and, thirdly if the defence and prosecution agree that such material should be put before the court. Significant safeguards therefore exist, but if my hon. Friend is concerned about a certain case, I will happily discuss it with him.

He will have my personal support in ensuring that the legislation passes smoothly and quickly through the House, but I am sure that he will agree that we must not allow the recent terrible events to interrupt our normal democratic processes, otherwise the bombers will have achieved their objectives. So, may we have an early debate on the financial crisis facing many national health service trusts? In my constituency, the local primary care trust is asking doctors where it should make &#163;8 million-worth of cuts. In other parts of the country, such as Hampshire, doctors are being warned that they may have to stop referring patients to hospital later this year.

 The Government are committed to bring forward further legislation to deal with the terrorist threat to the United Kingdom. Consistent with what my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said, it is important that there is maximum opportunity for consultation and I am grateful to the shadow Leader of the House for his indication of continuing support from the Opposition; I recognise that that is so for all parties represented in the House. It is crucial that we move quickly to provide our security authorities with the appropriate powers that they need to deal with the threat to our society, but at the same time it is equally important that we get any new legislation right and that it is brought forward by consensus. I assure the hon. Gentleman, as I assure the House, that the Government will move quickly in that matter, but it is important that we get it right. That is our clear ambition.

In the unlikely event that the hon. Gentleman were to have experience of government, I am confident that he would say the same. As the Government are finding enormous extra funds for our national health service, we rightly expect that money to be spent properly and effectively, according to sensible principles.

That is deplorable. We would not stand for it in our constituencies; we would make our protest, and we should do so here. As for the so-called rest rooms, I visited them only the other day. They are slums on our own doorstep. When we consider our accommodation for Members or Officers, why should our fellow citizens have as rest rooms places that Dickens would have recognized in his time? This is totally unacceptable.

 Tomorrow I will be at the funeral of a constituent, David Cheshire, a good and honourable man who had done the right thing and paid into an occupational pension scheme for more than 20 years. Two weeks after the occupational pension scheme went into liquidation along with the Dexion Company that he worked for, David found out that he had prostate cancer, which was terminal. He has left a widow with no pension whatsoever. David had done the honourable thing, along with some 80,000 other workers in this country, and paid into an occupational pension, only to have it stolen.

 I am certainly concerned about the particular case that the hon. Gentleman raises. Not only have the Government brought forward a comprehensive compensation package to deal with the kind of situation that he describes, but we have taken steps to look at ways in which we can ensure that existing pension schemes are properly managed and properly funded, and impose tougher and tighter regulation on those schemes in order to prevent precisely the kind of difficulties that he so eloquently describes.

In my constituency, Wansdyke, the last pit closed more than a quarter of a century ago, which means that the average age of claimants is that much higher than in the country as a whole, and many of them are dying before receiving the compensation from which they should be entitled to benefit.

This is the largest compensation scheme attempted by any Government anywhere in western Europe and there have been around 400,000 payments already. The practical difficulty is that each case has to be assessed on its own merits. That is part of the reason why the cases have taken more time than we would have liked. I can assure my hon.

 In an answer a few moments ago, the Leader of the House referred to the Government&#039;s financial assistance schemes for people who have lost a large part of their pensions.

Will he please arrange for a statement from the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, who I am pleased to see has just taken his place on the Front Bench? We feel that the Secretary of State will have more sympathy with those pensioners who have lost three quarters of their pension, given that he is in the fortunate position of having had an &#163;18,000 pay-off when he resigned as Home Secretary only five months before rejoining the Cabinet.

The Government scheme exists, but this particular case involves a company that apparently has the funding available to provide proper compensation. That is one of the basic qualifications.

 Having studied the second volume of the diaries of my distinguished predecessor, Richard Crossman, which covers the period in which he sought to find ways to reform the House of Lords from the position that I currently hold, I recognise the difficulties of achieving the right result. The Government made progress by removing the overwhelming majority of hereditary peers, a change for which great intellects from Tom Paine onwards have argued. The Government are committed to continuing to establish a consensus on the way forward, because a single political party cannot drive through such reform. We must achieve a wide consensus on the way forward and establish constitutional arrangements for the United Kingdom that are consistent with the requirements of a 21st-century democracy.

 I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_29">As we have discussed many times, the Bill contains much that commands broad support. On Second Reading, I said that two specific issues were absent from it. The first is the problem of the calculation of interest. I note that an amendment on that has not been selected but it needs to be resolved. The second is data sharing. I know that the Under-Secretary shares my concern and that of many others, including the Conservative spokesman, that there is a long way to go in resolving the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_30">In a sense, it goes without saying that the best decisions about whether to lend are made when both parties&#151;the lender and the borrower&#151;have access to full information on which to base a judgment about whether it is appropriate to lend and about the amount to lend in the circumstances. However, at the moment, all too often, only the borrower has access to the full information. For many reasons, borrowers may be in denial about their capacity to service a loan or the amount borrowed on a credit card. We must therefore find a way of ensuring that both parties have access to the full information to make objective and wise decisions based on the principle of responsible lending.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_31">Often, people build up unsustainable debt from several different sources. We are told that that is one of the prime causes of the crises that occur when people suffer health problems and sometimes worse. Increasingly, consumers shop around, obtain different credit cards, spend on them and also take out loans. Perhaps there is no defaulting for some time on any of those products, but unbeknown to each lender, borrowers are building up unsustainable debt and the crisis ensues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_32">There are two broad problems. First, data sharing generally takes places only when there has been a default&#151;when someone has not paid on time or exceeded an overdraft limit and so on. When no default has occurred, but an unsustainable debt might be building up, information is not shared.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_33">The second problem is historic and I shall describe it in a little more detail shortly. Before I reach the core of the new clause, I make a plea to the Under-Secretary to use his authority to sort out the whole problem. The new clause deals with part of it. It is permissive, not mandatory and therefore enables fuller data sharing. However, there is another side to the difficulty: ensuring that the industry does its duty and takes the opportunity that the new clause provides to make sure that data are shared. The Department of Trade and Industry, the Department for Constitutional Affairs, the industry, the office of the Information Commissioner and the Inland Revenue should get together urgently and set a timetable for achieving full data sharing. Even if the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 982</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Under-Secretary opposed the new clause, I would welcome a commitment from him to ensure that that happens.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_34">The Treasury Committee&#039;s inquiry showed that there is a feeling that the talking has gone on for a long time but there has been a lack of action. Part of the responsibility for that lies with the Government in legislative reform, which we are providing today, and in facilitating and putting pressure on the industry to respond. I know from discussions with the industry that, for example, APACS, the British Bankers Association and FLA are up for it and keen to discuss the matter with the Government to get it resolved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_35">Let me deal with the historic problem, which the new clause tackles. The Data Protection Act 1998 requires lenders to notify individuals that their data will be shared and the purpose for which they will be used. That legislation led in due course to the industry including standard clauses in the application process to ensure the consent and knowledge on the part of the consumer for any new agreement after data protection legislation came into force. There is no problem for new agreements; consumers have given their consent. However, there is no provision for any account opened or agreement made before the introduction of the standard clauses in contracts. Nothing provides for consumers to agree to their data being shared. Many accounts&#151;credit cards and current accounts&#151;have a long life. I have had my current account all my adult life.
</p>





<p><a name="st_88"><a name="50714-11_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe): </b> 
 A long time.
</p>





<p><a name="st_89"><a name="50714-11_spnew1"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 Thank you. Many people&#039;s credit agreements will predate the introduction of the standard clauses and thus fall outside the scope of the new provisions for ensuring that data can be shared. The industry estimates that some 40 million accounts&#151;42 per cent. of the market&#151;fall into the category where there is no data sharing. How can the Government be serious about sorting out the problem of the lack of data sharing if there is no such sharing on 40 million accounts? Yet the industry says that it cannot share data unless there is a legislative change.
</p>





<p><a name="st_90"><a name="50714-11_spnew2"><b> Chris Bryant  (Rhondda) (Lab):</b> 
 I am sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument but I wonder whether that is where the problem lies. There have been genuine problems in my constituency of people accumulating debt that they could never afford. The main problem was people starting with a set of new credit arrangements fairly recently. Surely the problem lies with shopping around on the internet or responding to the many millions of pre-approved applications for loans and credit cards. I wonder whether the measure is necessary when we should mostly be saying: caveat emptor.

</p>





<p><a name="st_91"><a name="50714-11_spnew3"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. As I said earlier, there are two problems. There is the historic problem, which the new clause addresses. There is also the problem that there is generally no data sharing in relation to modern accounts in circumstances in which the borrower does 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 983</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>not default. A default triggers the sharing of information. The industry says that it is extending that provision, and that by the end of the year, it will have introduced much broader sharing of information, so that it will be sharing the good data as well as the bad data. If that actually happens, we will see a real advance. I am not suggesting that the new clause will resolve all the problems. We need a combination of legislative reform and pressure on the industry to deliver a much wider sharing of information from the kind of new credit agreements that the hon. Gentleman has described.
</p>





<p><a name="st_92"><a name="50714-11_spnew4"><b> Mike Penning  (Hemel Hempstead) (Con):</b> 
 The industry has a wide knowledge of people&#039;s credit. One area that is very dangerous is the transfer of credit card balances to new credit cards. There are some wonderful offers out there, but the problem is that the credit card companies know that a balance is being transferred to a new card, with a whole new credit limit, yet the existing credit card is not cancelled. So the borrower automatically gets double the amount of credit, and they can do that every six months. There is not one credit card company that cancels the card from which the balance is being transferred. Its credit limit remains in place. If someone with a &#163;5,000 credit limit transfers that balance to a new card, they will find themselves with a combined credit limit of &#163;10,000. They can do the same thing six months later. The danger is that the credit card companies have the information, but they are not using it to protect the consumer.
</p>

<p><a name="st_93"><a name="50714-12_spnew0"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. He makes a good point. There is a big problem with the transfer of credit. Sometimes it can work in the consumer&#039;s interest, if they can get a genuinely lower rate of interest and use the system. However, there are real dangers involved. I am not suggesting that the new clause will be a panacea to resolve all the problems of irresponsible lending in the credit industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_36">Further to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, the Treasury Committee noted that people often transfer their credit card balance having received a commitment of a nil rate of interest for perhaps a year. However, they are often not told that new purchases on the card will be charged at the full rate of interest, or that when they pay off some of the balance, it will be taken off the balance transfer, not the new purchases. They therefore find that they are paying interest when they did not expect to. So there are many problems, and they all come down to the practice of responsible lending. We still have a way to go to get the industry fully to understand the importance of that concept.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_37">I am seeking to address one specific historic problem, which is that, in the view of the industry and the Information Commissioner, there cannot be a full sharing of data. The commissioner has advised the industry that it would be a breach of the Data Protection Act 1998 to share data without consent. Incidentally, the problem has got much worse because, as the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) pointed out, there has been a revolution involving people shopping around. In the old days, all our needs were met by one 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 984</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>institution&#151;a bank or whatever. Now, people shop around for the best value product, so the need to address the problem of data sharing has grown considerably.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_38">The Information Commissioner has said that, under the old agreements in which there is no provision for data sharing, a lender would need the customer&#039;s consent to share such information. The only solution available at the moment, therefore, is for the lender to go to the customer and ask for their consent. Members will appreciate, having sent out political mailings to people, that the response rate to such requests would be tiny. The industry reckons that it would be less than 1 per cent. We cannot resolve the problem simply by seeking consent under the existing rules. New clause 1 seeks to address that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_94"><a name="50714-12_spnew1"><b> Mark Lazarowicz  (Edinburgh, North and Leith) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 I have sympathy with the objectives of the new clause and with the need to promote greater data sharing on an historical basis. Does the hon. Gentleman agree, however, that we need to be careful about forcing consent, as it were, on members of the public? The Data Protection Act is there for a reason, after all. The new clause would give fairly wide powers to credit reference agencies and other organisations to extract consent from individuals. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should think about the implications of what could be quite a serious breach of data protection principles.
</p>





<p><a name="st_95"><a name="50714-12_spnew2"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 I fully accept that. I have thought about the issue, and I realise that there is a balance to be struck. We could simply say that this provision breaches the principles of the Data Protection Act; therefore there is nothing we can do. However, the consequence of doing that would be too serious, and I cannot accept that that is the right approach. So while I fully understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, it is my judgment that we should reform the law in the way that I have proposed. The consequence of not doing so could be very serious. At worst, it could be a matter of life or death. We have all come across awful cases of people taking their own lives because of the mess that they have got themselves into. There is a responsibility on all of us to address the problem, and to ensure that judgments on offering credit are made with the fullest possible information available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_39">Some people have expressed concern that the new clause could lead to predatory lending. Other jurisdictions have suggested that, where there are provisions for data sharing, some unscrupulous lenders could use the information to target vulnerable consumers. However, the specific provisions of subsection (4) will address that concern, in that it sets out the conditions under which the information can be shared. It will prevent any risk of the information being exploited for the purpose of predatory lending.
</p>





<p><a name="st_96"><a name="50714-12_spnew3"><b> James Brokenshire  (Hornchurch) (Con):</b> 
 The information could be used to encourage more blanket mailings. More and more paper lands on our doorsteps each day, and we end up being offered credit for this, that and the other. This results in two problems. First, some of the offers are pre-approved, which can be a problem if that mail is intercepted. We all know from our constituency mailbags that people have had their information misused by others. Secondly, such offers can encourage people to take credit when perhaps they 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 985</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>should not. Will the hon. Gentleman comment on the protection offered in the new clause to ensure that those things would not happen?
</p>





<p><a name="st_97"><a name="50714-12_spnew4"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman raises a genuinely serious point. We all suffer from those mailshots, but some people are better able than others to identify the dodgy ones. There has been a revolution in the availability of credit, but there has not been a commensurate revolution in financial literacy and education. People are therefore often very vulnerable to such approaches. However, the conditions set out in subsection (4) ensure that the use of information to target mailshots at vulnerable groups would be prohibited. Lenders would not have permission to do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_40">Data sharing is of value to both the lender and the consumer, but when we talk about breaching the principles of the Data Protection Act, we must remember that we are seeking to act primarily in the interests of the consumer. From the lender&#039;s point of view, it would enable better, more informed decisions. It would mean a reduction in credit losses and in the amount of time spent handling accounts. From the consumer&#039;s point of view, which for me is the most important, it captures those cases to which I referred in which unsustainable debts build up unnoticed, and helps to prevent such a crisis from occurring. It helps existing lenders to monitor what is going on with their customers&#151;if they can see, through access to information, that their customer is building up an unsustainable debt elsewhere, it enables them to make an earlier intervention to warn their customer of the potential consequences. At the moment, the lender is completely ignorant of such looming problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_41">Consumers who have a good credit record would also be helped. The acknowledgement of that fact, because of the lack of &quot;dodgy data&quot; through data sharing, improves their ability to shop around to get a good deal. There is also a problem with people who have what is described as a &quot;thin file&quot;. Because such accounts might be historic ones going back a long time prior to the Data Protection Act, credit reference agencies might have very little information about many consumers. That in itself often makes it difficult to gain credit, and potentially makes it more expensive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_42">Therefore sharing of information seems to be in the interests not only of the consumer who is liable to get into real trouble but of the consumer who has a good record. Crucially, it also encourages responsible lending. There is interesting evidence that a reduction in arrears occurs when consumers are informed that their data will be shared. When consumers know that information about what they are doing in relation to one particular account will be shared, it does not half concentrate their minds&#151;it ensures that they try to keep their account under control, and therefore encourages responsible behaviour on the part of consumers. According to some suggestions, arrears could be reduced by as much as 50 per cent. simply through the consumer being aware that their data could be shared, because they realise the knock-on effects in terms of access to credit if they get into difficulty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_43">The new clause is not mandatory&#151;it does not require the sharing of data. It is permissive. Crucially, therefore, it is not just a panacea on its own&#151;it requires the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 986</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>industry to respond by taking advantage of what it would provide and sharing the information. For example, the industry would need to ensure that its codes of practice establish the principle that data sharing is the right approach, and ought to be done as standard practice.
</p>





<p><a name="st_98"><a name="50714-12_spnew5"><b> Mr. Adrian Bailey  (West Bromwich, West) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 I have been following the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument with interest. I feel that it is flawed in certain areas. He has put forward the argument that the publication of a person&#039;s indebtedness will provide a disincentive, but under his proposals such a person has the right to prevent the public disclosure of his personal indebtedness. Those two proposals seem contradictory, because anybody who is likely to run up cumulative debts has the right under his new clause to prevent that being public knowledge.
</p>





<p><a name="st_99"><a name="50714-12_spnew6"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 I do not think that that is contradictory in any way. A safeguard is provided that addresses some of the concerns of other Members. We have already established the de facto principle that all credit agreements these days provide a standard clause for the sharing of information&#151;there is no opt-out, it is a fact, and that is what happens. If consumers want credit, they sign up to that arrangement. The new clause addresses the problem of all those agreements that predated the Data Protection Act, and therefore pragmatically helps to address a serious problem that cannot be resolved in any other way, because the response rate to any request for consent would simply be too low.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_44">That is my new clause in a nutshell. It seems to me that there is a strong case for ensuring that there is full data sharing&#151;not the partial data sharing that we have currently. We must do something effective to ensure that that happens. The time for talking is over, and it now seems to me that the Government should act. The new clause is the way of achieving that.

<a name="stpa_47">As I stated in Committee, we all agree that the nature of the credit industry has changed beyond recognition over the past 30 years, and particularly during the past 10 to 15 years. That is the whole point of the Bill&#151;to bring provisions and consumer protection up to a level at which it can successfully respond to those changes. As Members on both sides of the House will know, in 1971 there was only one type of credit card. Today, there are more than 1,300. Thirty years ago, &#163;32 million was owed on credit cards, but today that figure is almost &#163;50 billion. In fact, there are now more credit cards than people in this country. With that, a range of new issues have arisen. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) said, when people transfer the balance from one card to another, the initial card does not get closed. Someone drew to my attention recently the fact that, although she thought that she had closed a card because she had transferred the balance, she then discovered that charges were being put against that initial credit card. She was told that that was because she had not reported the card lost or stolen&#151;she could not just close it. To me, that shows a significant loophole in the current way of operating.

Consumers can now apply for and open accounts over the telephone and the internet, which is relatively hassle-free. While the increases in competition and greater flexibility and access to the market for consumers are welcome, at the same time, the risks and dangers of accumulating debt have become all too apparent. Members will recall that, on previous occasions, I drew attention to specific cases of individuals who have run up multiple debts on numerous credit cards&#151;debts that have been far beyond what their income allows them to repay. As a result, they borrow more and more to try to alleviate their difficulties, but all that that serves to do is to wind them further and further into unmanageable debt. It is a spiral of debt that we all know and many of us fear, which, in a number of the cases cited by Members, has led to tragic consequences.

<a name="stpa_49">On the day of the Bill&#039;s Second Reading, the <i>Daily Mail</i> reported the tragic case of Stephen Lewis, a 37-year-old production worker from Worksop in Nottinghamshire, who ran up debts of &#163;70,000 on 19 credit cards despite earning only &#163;22,000 a year. In the end, he felt that he could escape from that huge debt only by taking his own life, leaving a wife and two children.

The new clause, however, proposes to punch quite a big hole in some of the principles of our data protection legislation. I wonder whether it is proportionate to the real problem. Does the problem really lie with the historic credit arrangements that many of us may have? The hon.

 I think that if Stephen Lewis&#039;s data had been shared more generally, and if the lenders had known that he was already borrowing on a range of credit cards and was well beyond being able to repay the debt on the basis of his income, the lenders would have been more cautious about issuing new cards.

Most of us would be quite happy for our data to be shared because we have nothing to hide, but when people do have something to hide and say, &quot;You may not share that information&quot;, the lender should beware. The hon. Member for Rhondda mentioned caveat emptor. I am not sure of the Latin for &quot;the lender should beware&quot;.

<a name="stpa_55">Most members of the credit industry already share, or are about to share, data on their credit agreements with the credit reference agencies, but some problems remain. Lenders first issued credit long before they would have seen a need to share data and, as a result, many credit accounts do not allow for sharing in their respective agreements. Accounts that were opened before lenders decided to share data are governed by the current legislation. They are not eligible for inclusion in credit files until the account holders consent to the sharing of their data.

<a name="stpa_57">It is beyond question that lenders have a vested interest in lending responsibly. Only a very few loan sharks make their money by preying on people and leading them knowingly into debt that they cannot afford. Responsible lending reduces credit losses, thus creating a financial incentive for the undertaking of credit agreements that do not place the borrower under financial strain. There is also the issue of reputation: lenders do not want to be seen to contribute to individuals&#039; misfortune.

 As ever, the hon. Gentleman is advancing a rational argument, but the new clause gives a very broad definition of the information that is available. Many people would be nervous about the amount of information that might be available as a consequence. A credit card contains a vast amount of personal information about how people live and many would find it worrying that it could be shared quite so readily. Subsection (4) moderates the position slightly, but nevertheless includes a very broad definition of the purposes for which information might be shared.
</p>





<p><a name="st_110"><a name="50714-14_spnew1"><b> Charles Hendry: </b> 
 A recurring theme in Committee was the lack of detail in the Bill. The Minister&#039;s response was usually that the issues concerned could be resolved in the courts. I should be happy to see an extra schedule or, alternatively, a provision allowing the Secretary of State to issue guidance in statutory instruments. The new clause, however, heads in the right direction. Of course we do not want information about where everyone spends their money to be available to a range of institutions, but if someone has 20 credit cards and has reached the borrowing limit on all of them, it is surely not unreasonable for a lender to have that information before issuing a further card. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we should be cautious, though. One of the Conservatives&#039; worries about the Identity Cards Bill is the amount of information that would be held and would be generally available.

<p><a name="st_112"><a name="50714-14_spnew3"><b> Charles Hendry: </b> 
 One could also argue that, if somebody is looking to take out a credit card or to borrow money, the question of whether they are paying thousands of pounds to a spouse is relevant and should be taken into account in assessing their ability to make repayments. Every time that we take out a mortgage or a loan, we are required to tell the lender about our other outgoings. If we are to encourage responsible lending, it is reasonable for lenders to be able to ask such questions.

 Data sharing is a particularly relevant issue to those on low incomes.

They include other types of lending regulated in other statutes, such as the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, and the important question of data protection, which is regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998. Members of the Association for Payment Clearing Services agreed data sharing principles in 2004 and, among other things, they committed to sharing all data that they are legally able to share.

<p><a name="st_138"><a name="50714-15_spnew16"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 I completely agree and, in a spirit of co-operation, I say that the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. If we miss the opportunity that the Bill provides us with now, it could be years before we have a similar opportunity to resolve the problem again. The Minister is not committed to any time scale for sorting the problem out. Talking to the Department for Constitutional Affairs could drag on interminably and will not resolve the problem. That is why it is important for all of us to put pressure on the Government. We do so by pressing the new clause to a vote to get the problem resolved. Without legislative action, it will not be resolved.

<p><a name="st_147"><a name="50714-16_spnew0"><b> Charles Hendry: </b> 
 I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-16_para0">
<a name="stpa_71">I am grateful to the Minister for the information that he provided me with in a letter yesterday in response to the many questions that I asked in Committee that he was unable to answer at the time. One of my specific questions was how any notice, such as statements of arrears or other statements, that lenders will be required to provide to borrowers under various clauses will be made available to visually impaired and blind people or those for whom English is not their first language. When I raised that issue in Committee, I sensed that it was something that the Minister and his officials had not thought much about. We should take the opportunity to provide greater clarity on what is expected of lenders in the way that they provide information to or communicate with their customers. That is an important issue that the Bill has left aside.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_72">If we are trying to improve consumer protection by providing borrowers with further and more frequent information about their accounts, it is only right that all consumers have suitable access to it, regardless of any disability or barrier, such as language, that they may have. Thus we should ensure that such notices are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 999</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>available in formats such as Braille and alternative languages where necessary. The Minister said in his letter yesterday that the Office of Fair Trading would need to be mindful that it is meeting disability and language requirements, but that does not go far enough. Instead, we should make such things a necessity, which is what the new clause will do. That is surely only right to protect consumers against discrimination.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_73">Such a step is also important given that the Bill enshrines the presumption of unfairness, rather than a presumption that an agreement is fair unless proven to be unfair. Lenders need greater clarity about what steps they should take if they are to prove, perhaps some years down the line, that they have acted fairly. The new clause would make it clear that lenders are expected to provide information in a way that is accessible to people who are blind or partially sighted and to provide it in alternative languages for people for whom English is not their first language. Crucially, though, in respect of the subsequent proof of fairness, the onus would be on the borrower to request the information in given format, not on the lender to know what special needs and requirements someone may have.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_74">The new clause is important because the sorts of document required under the Bill are central to its workability. If people do not understand what they are signing up to in a credit agreement, if they do not understand the importance of the arrears notice or if they cannot read the OFT guidance issued to them, they will not be able to enjoy the full protection that the Bill is designed to offer them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_75">Even if the Minister accepts the new clause, I am conscious of the fact that other matters will be left out. For example, people with learning difficulties may not understand what they are being told in a written document about their rights as borrowers. <i>The Independent</i> recently published a letter by the Reverend Paul Nicolson, the chairman of the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust, who said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;There are seven million adults in the UK with a literacy age of 11 years, who will not be able to read the leaflets&#151;let alone fill in the forms. The increasing incidence in mental illness has made the need to curb door-to-door lenders even more urgent. There is a lack of volunteer support and legal aid.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_76">I am afraid that I have been unable to draft an amendment that would address that issue. Perhaps we will have to rely on the expert and invaluable advice of the citizens advice bureaux to assist people, but that should not stop us taking action where we can and I urge the Minister to accept the new clause.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050714/debtext/50714-17.htm"/>




<p><a name="st_148"><a name="50714-17_spnew0"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 I rise briefly to say that I support the importance of the new clause. Unless consumers are able to understand such provisions, there is not financial inclusion but ignorance of the requirements imposed on them. It must be right that someone who perhaps cannot speak English or who is blind has the capacity to understand the information in another way. It also seems right that the consumer in those circumstances should serve notice on the lender to the effect that the information is required in another format. So I certainly support the new clause.
</p>





<p><a name="st_149"><a name="50714-17_spnew1"><b> Michael Fabricant  (Lichfield) (Con):</b> 
 Sadly, we have learned over the past few days what a large proportion 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 1000</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of people in the United Kingdom do not speak English or at least do not have English as their first language. All hon. Members on both sides of the House feel that we have a duty of care to all our citizens. For those who perhaps speak Gujarati, Hindi or other languages and bearing in mind the difficulty that some many people face when getting into debt, it is incumbent on the Government ensure that their duty of care is expressed in ensuring that information in languages other than just English and Welsh is made available to those who cannot easily understand English.
</p>





<p><a name="st_150"><a name="50714-17_spnew2"><b> Mr. Nigel Dodds  (Belfast, North) (DUP):</b> 
 I agree with the thrust of the new clause, but is it not more widely drawn than is suggested? Would it not be open to people who can speak English as their first language to request a notice in another format and a language other than English? It could be open to abuse by those who wish to request information in another language unnecessarily, when they do not need to do so for the purposes of understanding the notice.
</p>





<p><a name="st_151"><a name="50714-17_spnew3"><b> Michael Fabricant: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises an interesting point. Such abuse is always a possibility. As in all cases, reasonability must be the test. However, it is incumbent on the Government to protect the consumer, and this Government and previous Administrations have a good record in that respect. I hope that the Minister, whom I know to be a flexible man, will accept the new clause; but if he does not, I hope that he will certainly assure us from the Dispatch Box that guidance will be given to lenders. Such information must be made available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_77">Of course, there is another issue. Many of us who have English as first language find it difficult to understand precisely what some of these provisions are all about, even when they are in large type. It is also incumbent on people to ensure that the information is given in clear, plain, understandable English, not in legalese, which is not understandable to the general borrowing population.
</p>





<p><a name="st_152"><a name="50714-17_spnew4"><b> James Brokenshire: </b> 
 I want to echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant). The new clause highlights a wider issue: the clarity of the notices that will be issued under the Bill. As the Minister knows, we are talking about issues such as default notices and getting people to understand their level of debt and borrowing. It is important that we provide protection to ensure that people are given as much opportunity as possible to understand the notices that are given to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_78">The new clause touches on accessibility and availability. We know of the implications of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which ensures that we have facilities for all people to gain access to understandable information. That is what the new clause seeks to provide. I hope that the Minister will listen to the comments that have been made in the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_79">My hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield raised this issue in Committee and has spoken about Braille and ensuring that those who are partially sighted fully understand their credit and commercial situations. That is important because if someone is in default, charges and other penalties may arise as a consequence. We have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 1001</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>duty of care, as my hon. Friend said, to ensure that people are fully aware of their predicaments, so that if they are getting into increasing debt, they can seek advice, help and assistance to allow them to address their credit situation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_153"><a name="50714-17_spnew5"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 As Members have said, the Bill is a balance between the interests of consumers and the responsibility of lenders to comply with the new requirements and the need to inform consumers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_80">The new clause would impose obligations on businesses that are already catered for elsewhere, and would impose a significant burden on business. I am surprised that Conservative Members are trying to increase those burdens, as they constantly remind the Government of the many burdens that they think exist already. As the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) said, I have written to him on the issue, and I have copied the letter to the members of the Standing Committee and placed a copy in the Library for other Members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_81">As I pointed out in Committee, it is important to consider the Bill in its context: the other legislation dealing with the provision of business services to disabled persons. So, in relation to providing information to blind or partially sighted persons, the result that the new clause seeks to achieve is already dealt with in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which applies generally to business. The Act imposes obligations on businesses to take such steps as are reasonable to make their services available to disabled people.The Disability Rights Commission has published a code of practice on access to goods, facilities and services, which provides advice to businesses as to the manner in which they can comply with those obligations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_82">Similarly, there is no provision in relation to other languages in the Bill, the Consumer Credit Act 1974 or any similar legislation. Lenders should look to any legislation or codes of practice that may have some bearing on the question. It goes beyond the issue of the provision of notices that can be understood by consumers to more fundamental questions concerning the capability of particular debtors to contract with the creditor. If a person cannot understand documents written in English and the lender knows that, or knowingly disregards it, it may be relevant to the fairness of the relationship when considered in the context of all other relevant factors. Similarly, the regular targeting of consumers who have difficulty in understanding agreements and notices is a matter that could be taken into account by the Office of Fair Trading in assessing fitness under the licensing regime.

 I very much endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant) said about the need for plain English, which is an issue that runs through so many debates. We have only to study the Bills with which we are presented to see incredibly complicated phraseology. Those of us who do not have the legal expertise of my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) find that sometimes we have to read statutory instruments several times to understand them. The same applies to credit agreements. When people are taking out such an agreement they want to know exactly what they are committed to, what their responsibilities are and what happens if they default. I completely endorse my hon. Friends&#039; comments on the need for agreements to be written in plain English.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_85">I endorse too what my hon. Friend said about the nature of the documents. They are extraordinarily important to people and there was much discussion in Committee about how they should be delivered&#151;how we could prove that they had been received by the right person and how they should be addressed. The Minister said that he hoped it could be done in a user-friendly way, but our concern was that it if was too user-friendly people might not understand the severity of the message. The documents should probably be stamped with the words &quot;This is an important document that requires your immediate attention&quot;, otherwise companies would not be seen to have fulfilled their legal obligations. There is no doubt that such documents are extremely important, so clarity is essential.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_86">The Minister is fundamentally wrong to say that the provision would impose a big burden on business. The industry is looking for clarity and wants to know what is expected of it. He said that if a lender knows that there is a language problem and knowingly disregards it they will be deemed to have acted unfairly. How on earth can they prove in retrospect that they knew or did not know? Due to the way in which the legislation will change, the burden in court will be on the company to prove that it did not act unfairly. Businesses need to know their responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_87">The new clause makes it clear that the onus is on the customer to say that they need information in a particular format and that the company should provide it. If the company did not respond properly, it would certainly have acted unfairly, but that would not be the case if it had not automatically offered the information in 25 languages at the outset. The whole problem turns on the nature of what is unfair&#151;something to which we shall return later in our debate. Lenders need to know what is unfair and what is not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_88">Our small new clause would provide that if a person wants documents in Braille, large type or a language of their choice, they must be given them in that format; but it is up to them to tell the company. That is not a huge additional burden on business.

 I return again to the important issue of the powers of the Office of Fair Trading, an issue that has been raised with some concern by Members on both sides of the House on Second Reading and in Committee. The issue highlights once again the lack of detail in the Bill, and I remain as disappointed today about that lack of detail as my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) was when the Bill was initially introduced in the last Parliament and he dealt with it for the Opposition. Six months on, the detail is still missing, and I venture to suggest that it will still be missing in six years&#039; time, unless a court case has been brought to establish it. What a tragic waste of time and money that would be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_90">The Bill provides the OFT, and other enforcement authorities operating on its behalf, with wide and open powers to regulate the conduct of licensees. We know that its goal is to achieve better regulation&#151;something we all want&#151;but the exercise of those powers will go practically unfettered. The concepts of unacceptable conduct against which the OFT will be judging licensees&#039; business practices are entirely loose and ill-defined, so their interpretation is left entirely to the OFT. As the measure also includes the power to impose the penalties for committing unfair practice, there is no question but that the OFT will be both judge and jury.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_91">With such broad-ranging powers, I am concerned that the Bill contains no provisions specifying the objectives and purposes towards which the OFT must act. Indeed, there is at present no guarantee that the OFT will perform in the manner that Parliament has in mind. By introducing an &quot;objects&quot; clause, new clause 3 would redress that, and install a vital degree of maintenance of parliamentary control over an organisation to which we are entrusting so much authority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_92">Indeed, it is invariably the case that Parliament controls the exercise of the discretion enjoyed by a regulatory body. I have previously used the example of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, whose opening sections make clear the ground rules with which the Financial Services Authority has to comply. In Committee, I challenged the Minister to give a single suitable reason why the OFT should not be subject to a similar control under the Bill. Sadly, he failed to do so, but now that he has had a couple of weeks to reflect, I am happy to give him another opportunity.
</p>





<p><a name="st_179"><a name="50714-18_spnew4"><b> James Brokenshire: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point about the approach taken for the Financial Services Authority, and the duties and responsibilities that are set out in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The way in which the OFT is intended to operate, and its new regulatory powers proposed in the Bill, is similar to the way in which the Financial Services Authority acts. There is an important parallel to be drawn between the Financial Services and Markets Act and what is proposed in the Bill.

 Earlier on my hon. Friend and others of us on the Opposition Benches talked about the need to protect individuals in relation to language and the use of language so that people could understand what conditions they were letting themselves in for by borrowing. Does he think that the OFT might be more focused by virtue of new clause 3(2)(b), which talks about &quot;the protection of consumers&quot;? Would that direct the OFT in turn to direct lenders that language must be clear, plain and, where appropriate, in the language understood by the borrower?
</p>





<p><a name="st_186"><a name="50714-19_spnew1"><b> Charles Hendry: </b> 
 I am even more grateful than usual to my hon. Friend for that timely intervention. Our concern is that the OFT may go all over the place. It may decide to draw its remit as it chooses. We believe that Parliament has a clear idea of what it wants the OFT to do, so the establishment of duties would be helpful to the OFT in knowing what is expected of it. If the Minister disagrees with any of the duties set out in the new clause, perhaps he could let us know. If he agrees with them, again it would be helpful to know. If he does not yet know whether he agrees, perhaps we should know that. Through the new clause we are trying to give lenders and borrowers much more clarity about the role of the OFT. By ensuring that the industry is clear on what is expected of it by the OFT, it will be enabled to do more to meet the interests of consumers. That is what the Bill is all about, but at present that clarity is missing.

<a name="stpa_94">The Minister has stressed that improving transparency is one of the fundamental aspects of the Bill. We fully support that aim, but feel that in certain aspects transparency is lacking and improvements could be made. That is the object of new clause 5. It is a further attempt to address our concerns about the OFT&#039;s unfettered powers. It will be operating at considerable length from Government and Parliament, there is a lack of any check against its actions and behaviour in relation to licensees, and it will be both judge and jury.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_96">The annual report will give Parliament a real opportunity every year to see how the OFT is performing in its extended role and will put an early warning system in place if it is not achieving what is hoped and expected of it. It is but one small measure that does not impose any substantial costs or time on the part of either the OFT or the Secretary of State. It would ensure that the work of the OFT is regularly reviewed and monitored, and that the public, consumers and the credit industry have access to information regarding its operation. It is fair and right, given the extensive powers that the OFT is being granted, and I hope that the Minister will accept it.

<a name="stpa_97">There needs to be a legislative framework for the exercise of these onerous powers; unfettered discretion is dangerous.

I shall be interested to hear the Minister&#039;s response to that case. These issues will inevitably end up being considered by the courts, whether or not there is a framework. It is unattractive, however, to leave everything to the courts&#151;if the courts set the framework without Parliament having any influence over it.

 I am glad that normal service has been resumed and that the usual relationship between Front Bench spokesmen has been restored. May I nail down the tactic that the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) has used quite charmingly throughout Committee? He argued that the Bill is too general and that there is not enough detail, conveniently forgetting the process that has produced it. A White Paper was published, and there was a full consultation on the issues that it raised. We spoke to all the stakeholders, including the industry and consumer groups. The Bill was introduced, and we tried to get it into good shape through the parliamentary process. He accuses me of lack of detail, but the aim of those procedures is to look at the detail of the Bill. Secondary legislation will flow from the measure and, again, there will be detailed consultations and discussions with industry and consumer groups on any statutory instruments. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. He cannot accuse the Government of a lack of detail while asking for a full consultation with everyone involved. We must strike a balance.

<p>
<a name="50714-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_101">We had an interesting discussion in Committee about an amendment that closely resembled new clause 3. I explained how the Office of Fair Trading should act with regard to its consumer credit functions, as set out in sections 1 to 5 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. That includes keeping under review both the Act and relevant social and commercial developments; the enforcement and operation of the Act; the production of information and advice; and annual reporting obligations on the operation of the Act. The provisions of the 1974 Act should be read in conjunction with some of the general provisions in the Enterprise Act 2002, particularly the provisions relating to corporate governance and the OFT board; the requirement for an annual plan and report; and the OFT&#039;s more general functions, which are set out in sections 1 to 8 of the Enterprise Act. The ground rules for the way in which OFT operates were laid down when Parliament debated and passed the Enterprise Act in 2002, and they recognised the nature of the role given to the OFT. It was not to be a narrow regulator operating within the terms of a strictly defined remit that could limit its approach to problems. There had to be one set of coherent objectives for the OFT, and the Enterprise Act provided it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_102">We should remember that the OFT is subject to the usual range of accountability measures such as scrutiny by the National Audit Office and appearances before House Committees. It presents an annual report to Parliament and, in addition, it is a signatory to the

When looking at the work of the OFT it is best to look at its consumer credit work in the context of all that it does, not just its duties under the Consumer Credit Act. Secondly, the new clause would require a report on the OFT&#039;s duties under the Consumer Credit Act. One of those duties is to keep the working and enforcement of the Act under review and from time to time to advise the Secretary of State about that.

This is the first time that we have looked at the Consumer Credit Act for 30 years, and we cannot leave it that long to look at the issues again. My hon.

The Minister said that we were trying to have it both ways by asking for detail and a consultation. Consultation, however, will help us to decide what people want in the Bill. One of the things that has been made abundantly clear is the desire for greater detail. If the Minister responded fully to the consultation, he would provide greater clarity in these and other provisions in the Bill.

If Parliament does not like it, that person will be the judge and jury. We have an opportunity to include in the Bill the OFT&#039;s role and general objectives. It is a great shame that the Minister does not regard that as desirable or important. I accept that some of our proposals are covered by other pieces of legislation but, nevertheless we should return to this issue. Perhaps the other place can look at it.

 Well, we need to get the resuscitation team ready, because I have listened to what hon. Members have said and Government amendment No. 7 is the result. This amendment recognises the concerns of the hon. Members for Wealden (Charles Hendry) and for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) in relation to the issuing of notices of sums in arrears where the agreement has a repayment interval of one week or less.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_111">The amendment alters the circumstances in which the creditor must provide a notice. Previously, for a notice to be issued, the debtor must have been in arrears to an amount equivalent to four missed repayments. The amendment refines that requirement, so that the obligation to give an arrears notice only arises when the debtor is in arrears to the equivalent of four missed repayments within a period of not more than 20 weeks, ending on the date on which the last missed repayment was payable under the agreement. In those circumstances, the lender is required to provide a notice within 14 days of the date on which the last missed repayment was payable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_112">I do not believe that the amendment will reduce consumer protection. Many consumers in this sector are vulnerable. But this change recognises the flexibility with repayments that applies in respect of many of those agreements. However, where the debtor has problems, and misses four repayments within the specified period of no more than 20 weeks, or five months, they will receive a notice along with information from the OFT to assist them in dealing with any problems they may have.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_113">While I do not condone or accept that consumers should be in arrears, or that lenders should encourage or permit them to think that that is acceptable, the amendment recognises that the way that lenders administer many agreements with weekly repayments is flexible and caters for the odd missed repayment over time. So to that extent, I accept that the provision of notices under the existing clause could be more than is required in such circumstances. I hope that the hon. Gentlemen will be pleased with the amendment.

<p><a name="st_202"><a name="50714-20_spnew4"><b> Charles Hendry: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister, especially for meeting the hon. Member for North Norfolk and me last week to talk about the issue of arrears notices. I am pleased that we have been able to agree on Government amendment No. 7 to help to resolve the problems that would have arisen from the Bill&#039;s original wording, to which the hon. Gentleman and I drew attention in Committee. That shows how far we can go when the Minister genuinely understands where we are coming from.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_114">The amendment addresses a significant difficulty. In the Bill&#039;s original format, there is no distinction between cases in which four payments have been missed in a short period of time, where the borrower is likely to be in arrears, and possibly in some distinct trouble, and cases in which four payments have been missed sporadically, over a much longer period of time. In the latter case, missed payments are likely to have been repaid and amicable arrangements may have been made with the lender. If the Bill does not draw that distinction, lenders will be forced to issue arrears notices to borrowers who, in the latter case, may not be in arrears at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_115">The problem is an aggregate one that relates most closely to home credit loans repaid on a weekly basis, where missed payments are not uncommon for most customers during their loan agreement. Indeed, on average, most home credit borrowers miss four payments during the period of a loan. A customer on a one-year agreement might miss one payment at Christmas, because of the increased costs at that time of year; a second in the spring because of a child&#039;s birthday; a third in the summer simply because they are on holiday the week the collector visited; and a fourth in the autumn for an entirely different reason. On all occasions, they may have notified the credit company and agreed amicably to repay the missed payments at a subsequent point. However, as drafted, the Bill would require the lender to issue an arrears notice on the missing of that fourth payment, despite the fact that the customer was not in arrears.
<a name="time_10">
<a name="50714-20_time0"><h5>2.15 pm</h5>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-20_para13">
<a name="stpa_116">As the Minister said in Committee, the customer would not technically be in arrears. In such circumstances, an arrears notice would cause great stress and concern. It would lead to family tension, as the borrower would be forced to explain why they had been issued with an arrears notice, however user friendly the format of that notice might be, when they would contend they are not in arrears because no additional debts or charges had been incurred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-20_para14">
<a name="stpa_117">The requirement would also create a bureaucratic nightmare, as potentially every one of the 3 million home credit borrowers would need to be issued with an arrears notice. That also presents a major administrative burden. Assuming that the cost of writing, posting and administration is just &#163;1 a letter, that represents an extra &#163;3 million in administrative costs, which would inevitably be passed on to borrowers in the form of higher charges, and that is the opposite of what the Bill seeks to achieve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-20_para15">
<a name="stpa_118">By reducing the time-frame in which the four payments must be missed before an arrears notice is required to be issued, from the entire length of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 1012</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>agreement to 20 weeks, we can overcome many of those difficulties. I am particularly pleased that the Minister has responded to our request that the period should be 20 weeks rather than the 26 weeks that he initially proposed. I am grateful for his flexibility. A 20-week period will be far more indicative of a customer in trouble, and will help to reduce the unnecessary distress and bureaucracy caused by issuing incorrect notices. Perhaps raising the number of payments missed from four to six would have helped that further, but I nevertheless welcome the Minister&#039;s compromise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-20_para16">
<a name="stpa_119">I tabled amendment No. 4 to the Bill before I was aware of the exact wording of the Government&#039;s amendment, but it remains relevant. I hope that the Minister will not think me churlish after his generosity if I seek to push him one step further. The aim of amendment No. 4 is to ensure that arrears notices will need to be served to customers only if their interests are prejudiced, and that means that they have incurred a charge or penalty on their account. The hon. Member for North Norfolk made that point especially strongly in Committee and it is fundamental to what we seek to achieve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-20_para17">
<a name="stpa_120">It looks possible that section 9A of the Government&#039;s amendment, which states that

</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-20_para19">
<a name="stpa_122">I think that the Minister understands why this issue is so important. We totally agree that arrears notices should be issued where a person is genuinely in growing arrears, but we do not think it right that it should be issued if they may technically be in arrears, but that has no other implication for the borrower. To give an example, if I lend the Minister &#163;100&#151;I know that that is highly implausible&#151;to put on the horses this afternoon, he might offer to pay it back in 10 weekly instalments of &#163;10. Of course, as a generous person I would not charge him any interest. If he tells me that he wants to treat Mrs. Sutcliffe to a special night out&#151;we know that he can get a good deal up in Yorkshire&#151;and to miss a couple of payments and so pays it back over 12 weeks instead, he would technically be in arrears, but neither of us would believe that to be the case in reality. It would be a reassignment, with no further debt or charge involved. The same is true in most home credit agreements, so the further change&#151;

 I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be able to clarify an aspect of particular concern. As amendment No. 4 is drafted, the whole section would have no effect if there was no prejudice to the borrower, but the question is what we mean by prejudice. I agree with him on doorstep lending, when payments are missed, but no extra interest is charged and no default charges are imposed. But what about a situation in which the borrower simply stops paying and misses 10 or 12 payments in a row? The hon. Gentleman and I would probably agree that in that situation, there could be a concern that the borrower was getting into

<br>&nbsp;<br>difficulties. Does he believe that there would be prejudice, or does he believe that if no extra interest is charged, there should be no default notice? I am concerned that the entire section will not apply if the situation is not defined as one of prejudice.

<p><a name="st_204"><a name="50714-21_spnew1"><b> Charles Hendry: </b> 
 I understand where the hon. Gentleman is coming from. We will be glad to complete proceedings on the Bill, so that we can stop saying that.

<p>
<a name="50714-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_123">If the interests of the borrower are not prejudiced&#151;if he faces no further charges, penalties, levies and so on&#151;there should be no need to issue a formal arrears notice. Being in arrears means that some penalty is involved, but if there is none, is it necessary to go through the process of declaring the borrower to be in arrears? They will simply pay back the loan over a longer period, and pay back the amount they expected to pay, not a penny extra. Is it necessary to tell somebody formally that they are in arrears when they may feel that they are genuinely not, having had an amicable discussion with the home credit provider and reached agreement on a different way of repaying the loan?
</p>





<p><a name="st_205"><a name="50714-21_spnew2"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 In the situation that I described, where payments simply stop and none have been made for 10 or 12 weeks or more, would it not be right for some sort of notice to be issued to warn the person of the consequences of not resuming the payments?
</p>





<p><a name="st_206"><a name="50714-21_spnew3"><b> Charles Hendry: </b> 
 I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. If the borrower had simply stopped paying, they would technically be in default, rather than arrears. Arrears would mean that the lender had agreed to reschedule payment over a longer period. If the borrower stopped paying unilaterally, without consulting the lender, the lender would want to issue a notice quickly, to make sure their own interests were protected. Where the borrower has reached an agreement with the lender about how they will reschedule the loan and pay it back over a slightly longer period, and where the lender&#039;s interests are not prejudiced, a clear case can be made as to why the borrower does not need to be issued with an arrears notice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_124">The change is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the Bill and will benefit borrowers, who must be our top concern.

 There is no point in repeating what has already been said, so I shall be brief. I put on record my appreciation of the Minister&#039;s readiness to meet us, hear our arguments and respond by way of a compromise to reduce the period to 20 weeks. That is a sensible compromise which recognises how doorstep lending works.

<a name="50714-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_125">My big concern, to which the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) has alluded, is that in many agreements there is no prejudice as a result of occasional payments being missed.

<a name="50714-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_126">On amendment No. 4, I am with the hon. Member for Wealden on the principle of it. I have concerns about the workings of the clause as drafted. It removes the whole of the effect of the section where there is no prejudice. I still have a sense that where payments stop for a considerable period, it may well be appropriate for the lender to have an obligation to serve an arrears notice. My concern was to ensure that the arrears notice was not triggered so quickly in the case of doorstep lending. The principle is right, but I have concerns about how it would operate, given the wording of the amendment.

However, the meaning of &#039;unfair relationship&#039; is vague and the scope of the provision is generally too wide for both consumers and creditors . . . The Bill contains no guidance for consumers as to what constitutes &#039;fair&#039; or &#039;unfair&#039; to enable them to identify when they have a valid claim. Similarly, there is no guidance for creditors on how they should conduct themselves to ensure that their actions are not &#039;unfair&#039;.

This market has to date been a very important source of capital for many lenders. Industry is concerned that the Government have not taken account of the potential for the market to be disrupted by retrospective application of the unfairness test. Market risks may ultimately have to be revised, thereby having an adverse impact on the credit ratings of securitisation transactions. This could increase securitisation costs and ultimately have a negative impact on competition and cost in the consumer credit market.&quot;</p>

Those at the margins will be driven to the least scrupulous lenders, to the loan sharks or to the lenders charging the higher rates of interest.

<p>
<a name="50714-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_137">The approach to tackling unfairness in lending must be targeted and consistent. Lenders need certainty from the outset that their contracts are secure and customers with genuine cases need to be clear about where they stand. My amendment aims to reach that level of clarity. It would allow the Office of Fair Trading, under its extended remit as provided for under the Bill, to issue guidance on those circumstances and activities that would be deemed unfair, subject to approval by the Secretary of State. By issuing such guidance, the level playing field that we all want restored will be that much more achievable. The Minister may argue that such guidance is not necessary or that it will somehow act as a constraint, but that argument simply does not hold true, because there are already legislative precedents that show how feasible and effective such guidance can be. The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1997 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contract Regulations 1999 demonstrate that it is possible to give sufficient guidance to consumers and creditors by means of a non-exhaustive list of the factors that are relevant to an assessment of fairness.

<br>&nbsp;<br>agreements that could caught in its grasp. For example, an existing credit arrangement that is due to finish a few months beyond the transitional period will be subject to the provisions of the measure because of those few months. The cost, administration and time expended by lenders on adapting their processes to meet the changes will be significant. As we all know, those charges will be passed on to consumers in higher interest rates or additional charges. The amendment therefore excludes those agreements that will expire in two years after the transitional period. I am not wedded to the two-year period and would be willing to consider a shorter time if that would make it easier for the Under-Secretary to accept the principle of the amendment and if he undertook to table a Government amendment in another place. However, the principle is sound. The new rules and regulations would come into force, as currently planned, for agreements that last longer than two years after the one-year transitional period at the end of that transitional period. We should try to keep bureaucracy to a minimum for agreements with only a short time to run. It will ease the transition process for lenders and consequently help to alleviate the risks of consumers bearing extra costs.

 We support the change in the test. The current test in the 1974 Act has been shown not to be fit for today&#039;s consumer market and it must therefore change. An unfairness test generally appears to meet the requirements. It provides some flexibility and it seems appropriate for today&#039;s substantial market. However, the lack of clarity and guidance creates genuine concerns.

<a name="stpa_149">The hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) referred to the burden of proof, which effectively means that one is guilty until proven innocent. That imposes an onerous burden. There is no guidance about what would subsequently be deemed unfair by a court and that is an unattractive scenario for the lending industry. It is also unattractive for consumers who are left simply not knowing their rights. The lack of clarity is dangerous in law making for the interests of both the consumer and those whom the measure seeks to control.

First, it could take months or even years before we learn what the court decides the right guidelines should be for interpreting the unfairness test. Secondly, is it right that a court, rather than Parliament or a body accountable to Parliament, should determine those guidelines? That is an unattractive proposition.

That is a serious concern, both for lenders and consumers.

The whole purpose of the Bill is to provide for transparency and responsible lending. I shall resist going into detail about the unfairness test, because I know that I am not going to convince the hon. Gentleman or the hon. Member for Wealden of its appropriateness, but I ask him to consider the matter in the context of the Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="st_221"><a name="50714-22_spnew2"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 I absolutely understand the context and I am completely with the Minister in his aim of achieving transparency and responsible lending. I was talking about that earlier in relation to data sharing and it is absolutely the correct objective. That is why I generally support the test of unfairness. It will have a real effect in changing the culture in parts of the industry, and I hope that it will also address the concerns of the people who argue for a cap on interest rates. Under the test, we shall be able to consider all the circumstances, including the wording of the agreement and the behaviour of the parties involved. That is a good thing, but the Minister cannot deny the fact that there are no guidelines on how the provision is to be interpreted. A court will inevitably end up defining that, because Parliament has failed to do so.
</p>





<p><a name="st_222"><a name="50714-22_spnew3"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The concept of unfairness exists in relation to other financial matters. To suggest that this is completely general flies in the face of the fact that such provisions exist elsewhere. Why is the hon. Gentleman trying to tie down what the court may consider? It is 30 years since the existing provisions were introduced, and there could be new ways of doing things that we have not been able to consider, yet he seems to be suggesting that we tie down the ability of the court to consider all these issues. He makes a fair point on interest rate caps and the unfairness test will deal with that issue.

 I agree. It is important both for the lending industry and consumers to have a greater understanding of what is intended by Parliament. We are sitting as Parliament setting new rules yet none of us can say precisely how this provision will be interpreted.

 I am not a lawyer, but I think that there is a problem here.

Unless the Government are specific in this context&#151;for there is case law on unfairness in other contexts&#151;the definition eventually handed down by the courts may not be the one that the Government want.

It is not one of the OFT&#039;s functions as a regulator to interpret the law for the courts. The courts are not bound by the OFT&#039;s guidance and need not have regard to it if it is not relevant to the specific case. Obviously, if the guidance

That appears to be based on the requirement in the Bill relating to the OFT&#039;s powers to impose civil penalties. In that instance, the OFT is prevented from imposing a civil penalty until it has published a statement of policy that has been approved by the Secretary of State. Given the seriousness of that power, which goes beyond the usual regulatory functions, the Government felt it necessary for the statement of policy to be approved by the Secretary of State.

<a name="stpa_160">In the Enterprise Act, Parliament reconstituted the OFT as an independent regulator. Parliament decided that the way in which the OFT used its powers to enforce the legislation for which it is responsible should be free of ministerial control. The amendment would fetter that freedom. It would mean that the way in which the OFT used its enforcement powers in respect of unfair relationships would be subject to ministerial control.

The OFT&#039;s guidance is simply that&#151;guidance. It is guidance on the circumstances in which it will take action, under its powers in part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002, against creditors who enter into unfair relationships. The 2002 Act provides that the OFT may take action against a breach of specific statutory requirements, including through the unfair relationships provisions, where harm is done to the collective interests of United Kingdom consumers. The OFT&#039;s guidance will not seek to interpret or to define an unfair relationship, although it could refer to conduct that it considers may give rise to, or contribute to, unfair relationships.

<a name="stpa_168">The Minister said that the twin purposes of the Bill were transparency and responsible lending. However, unless the detail that we are asking for is there, neither of those purposes will be brought effectively into practice. The Minister is condemning us to leaving all the sorting out to the courts. That means that we will have to wait years. It will take many years for cases to be brought to court, go through all the appeals processes and the rest of it. It will also cost a phenomenal amount of money. As was said earlier, the only people to benefit are the lawyers. It could not have been the hon. Member for North Norfolk who said it, because he is a lawyer. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, perhaps he can see a new career opening up for him outside this place. The costs will be huge.

<a name="stpa_169">We heard earlier about the fear factor&#151;the sheer concerns that people will have when they face the option of taking on a massive multi-billion pound corporation in the courts. People will decide that they simply cannot go through with it. Even if they have full backing from the consumer associations, they will say that they just cannot face going through it all and will back down. The issue will drag on for longer and longer. Once a judgment is eventually reached, there will be debate about its implications. Either it will mean that the lenders could have been less cautious in the intervening years&#151;they will subsequently know with greater clarity what they can do&#151;or alternatively, millions of agreements will have to be rewritten and compensation paid because the system was not clear enough in the first place.

It does not have to be absolutely detailed; it could be as we cited in the European directive, setting out some measures that could be agreed on all sides to be clearly unfair in all circumstances. That would have been a step forward in itself and I think that it is profoundly sad that the Minister is not prepared to move further on that. As I said, everyone is calling for this change: the industry wants it, consumer groups want it, Members on both sides of the House want it. It is very sad indeed that the Minister will not concede any ground.

 I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 41, line 19, leave out &#039;includes a reference to&#039; and insert &#039;means&#039;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_173">We move the amendment on the suggestion of the Law Society of Scotland. Its purpose is to ensure that, in Scotland, only a sheriff and not a justice of the peace will be entitled to grant the search warrants provided for in clause 48. I discussed the issues before tabling the amendment and discovered that the Law Society of Scotland takes the view that the powers to grant the warrants under the clause should extend in Scotland only to sheriffs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_174">A justice of the peace in Scotland, unlike in England and Wales, may not be legally qualified and so may be unfamiliar with the criteria for granting the warrants under clause 48. Limiting the power to sheriffs would also bring the Bill into line with recent legislation passed in this House. For example, sections 289 and 290 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 relate to the approval of a judicial officer for searches under section 289. In Scotland, that power is limited to sheriffs whereas, under section 290(3)(a), in England and Wales the judicial officer is a justice of the peace.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_175">Another example is the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003, section 17 of which provides that warrants may be granted by a justice of the peace in respect of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In contrast, section 18 provides that, in Scotland, warrants may be granted only by a sheriff.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_176">Again, section 156 of the Extradition Act 2003 provides that search and seizure warrants may be granted by a justice of the peace in England and Wales, but section 156(1) makes it clear that a sheriff grants them in Scotland. Finally, section 38 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants Etc.) Act 2004 provides that, in Scotland, only a sheriff will be involved in granting warrants.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_177">The Law Society of Scotland suggests that clause 48 of the Bill is similar to the four recent Acts to which I have referred, and that the appropriate authority in Scotland for the granting of warrants is the sheriff. Amendment No. 2, therefore, would maintain 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 1026</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>consistency in the law on search and seizure warrants in Scotland, and ensure that the warrants under clause 48 are granted only by officials who are legally qualified.

 I thank the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) for the amendment, but I shall be consistent to the end and say that we intend to resist it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_178">The hon. Gentleman suggested that the amendment is intended to make the Act consistent with other legislation, such as the Extradition Act 2003, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants Etc.) Act 2004. The Bill is concerned with the regulation of the affairs of businesses and consumer protection, and the provision under discussion covers entry into premises to obtain information in relation to fitness to hold a consumer credit licence. It is, therefore, not in the same league as the other legislation to which I and the hon. Gentleman have referred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_179">The Bill is consistent with the 1974 Act, which at section 162(3) provides that in Scotland justices of the peace and sheriffs may issue warrants to enter premises. The clause is also consistent with section 176 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, section 297B of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, section 111 of the Medicines Act 1968, and section 1 of the Breeding of Dogs Act 1990.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_180">I can understand the concern expressed by the hon. Gentleman about warrants in cases where there is a considerable risk of criminal activity, imprisonment or danger to affected persons. However, the Bill does not fall into that category, and for that reason we have made it consistent with the 1974 Act and similar legislation such as the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_181">Furthermore, from a practical perspective, the amendment would place an additional burden on the sheriffs and mean that, in addition to their already considerable responsibilities, the OFT or trading standards officers would always need to obtain warrants from them. The Bill provides the regulator with the flexibility to obtain a warrant from a judicial officer without undue inconvenience.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_182">I hope that that explanation will be sufficient for the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

We may return to the matter in another place, but I shall consider the Minister&#039;s response before taking it any further.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 1027</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Bill, we are creating a modern framework for the regulation of consumer credit in the United Kingdom. We want a market that is fair and that rewards competitiveness, innovation, choice and enterprise, but we also want to stamp out the irresponsible and unfair lending practices that do so much to harm many consumers. I believe that the Bill fulfils those aims.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para12">
<a name="stpa_185">The Bill is the centrepiece of the most ambitious reform of consumer credit regulation since the early 1970s. The reform process involves not just legislative change, but a cross-Government strategy to tackle the problems of over-indebtedness in our society. Dealing with debt is more than just a consumer credit issue. Among other things, we are looking at why people get into debt problems and how to deal with the causes of those problems. We are funding more face-to-face debt advice for consumers, with &#163;45 million over the next two years from the financial inclusion fund, and we are considering the best ways to tackle the pernicious problem of illegal money lending.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_186">This long-awaited Bill has much support from consumer and industry groups and from hon. Members on both sides of the House. I thank hon. Members for contributing to our debates on the Bill. The involvement of all hon. Members who have explained their experiences has been invaluable in developing the Bill. I am grateful, in particular, to my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) and the hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Derek Conway), who chaired the Committee so effectively, and to the hon. Members for Wealden (Charles Hendry) and for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) and all the other hon. Members who served on the Standing Committee. Hon. Members&#039; support for the Bill is reflected in its swift progress in this Session.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_187">From our constituency postbags, we know of the many problems that people suffer because of debt. The debate on Second Reading gave us the chance to hear about many of those problems and the issues that affect business in developing an effective credit market. The Committee sittings offered us a chance to discuss with hon. Members concerns about specific aspects of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para15">
<a name="stpa_188">In what I hope will be the final debate on the Bill in the House, I should like to concentrate on a number of issues that have been of interest to hon. Members. In Committee, the hon. Member for Wealden asked many pertinent questions about issues of great detail. As he said, I have written to him to answer those questions, and hon. Members can find copies of those answers in the Library. Although I understand where the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concerns are coming from, it is important to remember that the Bill will provide a framework for regulation. It will allow Parliament to impose general requirements that can be fleshed out in secondary legislation. So we will consult on that detail and can adapt it to changing circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para16">
<a name="stpa_189">Hon. Members will recall that I recently took great care to explain the unfair relationship provisions to the Committee. Those provisions must be considered in the context of the laws that deal with specific unfair practices and terms, as well as the way in which the courts will apply the law, and I will not get involved in that issue again today. We have considered extensive 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 1028</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>arguments from across the sector, and I believe that those provisions constitute the most effective means for consumers to obtain the redress through the courts, if they choose to take that route when resolving their dispute. The approach taken in the Bill is a solution that provides comprehensive and flexible protection for consumers, while allowing the industry to make credit available to all, not most, consumers and to continue to innovate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para17">
<a name="stpa_190">Some hon. Members are concerned about the powers of the Office of Fair Trading. We must ask ourselves whether the body that enforces the Consumer Credit Act 1974 should have the power to investigate potential wrong-doing and whether consumers should be able to operate confidently in the market, safe in the knowledge that they are dealing with responsible lenders. The answer to both questions is yes. The Bill will provide a regime that ensures that there is fairness for consumers, that businesses are competitive and that the regulator has the powers that it needs to ensure that is so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para18">
<a name="stpa_191">The OFT does not have an unfettered power to act. As a public body, it is has a responsibility to act reasonably and proportionately. In relation to its powers under the 1974 Act, it is subject to certain constraints and to an independent appeals tribunal. The powers that the Bill will give to the OFT are an essential foundation for a modern and effective consumer credit market. They are not a luxury. So if we enable the regulators to penalise misconduct, we must also enable consumers to resolve disputes for themselves. That involve introducing a system that is cheap, fair and easy to use. The alternative dispute resolution scheme in the Bill is all those things. It is informal. There is no need for hearings; a dispute can be dealt with in writing and issues can be cleared up over the phone. It can adapt to changes in the market quickly. Not only will it empower consumers to act with confidence in the market, it will also ensure stable competition across the credit sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para19">
<a name="stpa_192">In Committee, I noted some suggestions that clause 24 would impose a requirement to be licensed on retailers who do no more than hold on to a card at the point of sale when requested to do so by the card issuer. It is certainly not the Government&#039;s intention to include that in the definition of debt administration. At that time, I said that if, on reflection, the clause was wrong in that respect we would table an amendment to clarify the position. Having considered the issue carefully, I have concluded that the definition of &quot;debt administration&quot; does not include holding on to a card at the point of sale when requested to do so, thus no amendment is necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para20">
<a name="stpa_193">Members will be aware of the speed with which the Bill went through Committee, which is an indication of the broad degree of consensus that surrounds it. As it stands, the Bill fulfils everything we set out to do. However, the Government have always listened, and will continue to do so. We have listened to the concerns of Members about the timing of notices of sums in arrears for short-term credit, which we discussed earlier, and have now made an adjustment. In the context of the Bill, I have committed to look further at other issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para21">
<a name="stpa_194">I have restated the Government&#039;s commitment to look further at the issue of credit card cheques under secondary legislation, and the Department is working on that. Similarly, I have arranged, with my Front-Bench counterparts, to meet the credit card industry on 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 1029</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>18 July, before the recess, to discuss how industry is addressing, through self-regulation, concerns about unsolicited increases in credit card limits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-24_para22">
<a name="stpa_195">The Bill enjoys wide support both in the House and among consumer and industry groups. Some aspects of the Bill give rise to concerns, and I have no doubt that they will be explored again in this debate and as the Bill goes through the other place. However, after more than four years&#039; work, I believe that the Bill represents the foundation of a fair and competitive 21st-century consumer credit market. It enhances consumer rights and redress, while giving business confidence that it is competing in fair markets that are fit for the modern world. It encourages effective competition, driven by demanding and discerning consumers.

<p><a name="st_245"><a name="50714-25_spnew0"><b> Charles Hendry: </b> 
 I have been delighted to have the chance to lead for the Opposition on such an important Bill, which will help to bring consumer protection in the UK up to speed with the considerable changes that have taken place in the credit industry in the 30 years since the introduction of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_197">The extent to which things have changed in terms of the size of the industry, the range of products on offer and the level of indebtedness among consumers shows how outdated that legislation has become and how imperative it is that new measures are introduced to respond to the situation. From the outset, we have made it clear that the Conservatives give the Bill broad support in achieving that goal and we are fully committed to action to root out loan sharks and bad practice, especially as it is the most vulnerable who are usually the hardest hit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_198">We have raised concerns and probed the Minister on a number of issues and problems along the way. That was part of the process of ensuring that we get things right this time and that the Bill can cope with the demands that will be placed on it by future changes in the credit industry. Had the Minister been prepared to say &quot;yes&quot; a few more times, the Bill would have been even better, but we shall leave that to our friends in another place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_199">I pay tribute to Members on both sides of the House for their expertise and for their determination to look after the interests of people preyed on by those who seek to exploit their financial circumstances and their lack of understanding of sharp lending practices. An understanding of the issues and the passion to drive them forward is a good combination and we have been lucky that Members have demonstrated that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_200">Many Members referred to tragic cases where individuals were caught up in a vicious cycle of worsening debt, often caused by unscrupulous lenders and unfair practices. That was an important part of our considerations and it is those lenders and practices that the Bill seeks to stamp out. At the same time, it is important that the Bill does not stifle the ability to operate of credit businesses that behave responsibly and whose services are often of great benefit to individuals and families, especially those on low incomes. We recognise that the overwhelming majority of credit providers act responsibly and the legislation, although it will inevitably affect them, is not targeted at them.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 1030</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_201">As the Minister said at the outset, debt of itself is not bad; it is irresponsible lending that causes the problem. By far one of the most important aspects of the Bill has been the new unfair relationship test, which replaces the old, impractical, extortionate credit test. We support the new test as a means of clamping down on loan sharks and unfair practices but, as the Minister is well aware, we are concerned about the lack of detail. As he knows, we have argued powerfully for that greater detail and we are disappointed that he has not given ground on it. Many of us believe that the Bill will be of less benefit to consumers as a result. It should be Parliament that gives the detail, not the courts, with all the time and huge costs that that will involve. It means that lawyers will benefit rather than borrowers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_202">Many still do not think that the Bill goes far enough. Even the <i>Daily Mirror</i> quoted just this week the chief executive of the Nationwide building society, who said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;It is a great shame the opportunity was missed at the Committee stage to improve the Bill. While we support the broad thrust of the Bill, we still don&#039;t believe it goes far enough. We strongly urge MPs to grasp this last opportunity to make a real difference to consumers. Some practices, like credit card providers applying payments to the cheapest debt first, remain unfair and can only be to the detriment of the consumer. Any debt counsellor worth their salt would tell you to pay off your most expensive debt first.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_203">There have been areas where we have tried to make those changes and I am disappointed that we did not succeed in persuading the Government to agree to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_204">We also welcome the new systems of redress provided through the Financial Ombudsman Service. The Bill also provides expanded powers for the OFT as a means of improving regulation. Again, we agree that better regulation of licensees is a crucial step forward, but we remain concerned that the OFT&#039;s powers will go unchecked and that it will be judge and jury. We would like to see more control retained by Government and Parliament over its actions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_205">Another crucial dimension of the Bill is the increased level of information provided to consumers concerning their credit agreements. That, too, is an important step forward towards tipping the balance of power back towards consumers. They need to be granted an equal standing and to have access to appropriate information to make informed choices over their credit decisions. It is also a vital means of helping consumers avoid getting into trouble with their agreements. I am pleased that the Minister has been working with us to ensure success in this respect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_206">I join with the Minister in paying tribute to our two Chairmen, the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) and my hon.

Members on both sides of the House who have spoken with such passion and commitment on what is an important area for many of our constituents. In particular I pay tribute to my hon. Friends the Members for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning), for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey) and for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire), who as new Members have shown tremendous commitment, understanding and expertise.

<a name="stpa_207">We have had a wide-ranging debate. We have focused in particular on issues, such as loan sharks, but we have also discussed a helicopter clause, so that when the Prime Minister&#039;s friends need to buy a new helicopter or yacht at short notice, they can be given greater assistance in doing so. We have made progress on those issues. Naturally, I pay tribute to the Minister who has been courteous and charming throughout. He is the natural heir to General de Gaulle and Mrs. Thatcher in being able to say no so forcefully and so often, but I wonder whether perhaps he should move in his next life to the Department for Transport because his sense of direction is remarkable. He always knows where we are coming from and understands where we are heading in every contribution. As I said earlier, it is just a shame he would not help us get there.

<a name="stpa_208">I thank the officials at the DTI and in the House. Departmental officials must have dreaded yet another list of Hendry questions. No doubt forests were torn down, gallons of ink were expended and writers&#039; cramp inflicted simply to give the Minister the answer as quickly as possible. They have been extraordinarily helpful, too, in providing written replies subsequently. I was particularly struck by the one about my challenge to the Minister to find some fees which had gone down under this Government. They produced an extensive list of Companies House charges. However, I win on points. The Directors Register by e-mail has indeed gone down from &#163;3 to &#163;2.50 but things like the full snapshot of the Directors Register has increased from &#163;60,000 to &#163;120,000. The list shows that the general drive is upward, even if there are some examples of fees that have come down. In any case, the officials have provided a great service, both in Committee and subsequently.

He should be praised for that, and for consistently dealing with our amendments with great courtesy and good humour. I am pleased with the level of consensus that we have struck throughout the Bill&#039;s progress and, although we have not always been able to agree on the detail, we all want to see the same end product&#151;more protection for consumers, better systems of redress, more access to information and better regulation.

We need be aware that the problem could be getting worse.

 I join the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) in thanking the Minister for the approach that he has taken throughout. He has been willing to discuss and debate, and to be constructive. We are slightly frustrated that he has not been able to go along with some of our constructive amendments to improve the Bill, but the whole debate on the Bill has been conducted in a civilised way. To that extent, I pay tribute to everybody who has contributed to that debate. It is a blessed relief sometimes to be able to discuss issues constructively, without seeking to score points at every possible opportunity. The Minister played a big part in that and I thank him for it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_213">I also wish to pay tribute to the officials who assisted the Committee and the Minister throughout the process. It was painful having to go through it all again just a few months after the last time, but I thank them for their hard work. I also join the hon. Member for Wealden in thanking the Chairmen of the Committee, the hon. Members for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) and for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Derek Conway).
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_214">The Bill follows an explosion in the availability of credit since the original legislation was passed through Parliament&#151;it took some time to come into force&#151;back in 1974. It is worth saying again that the availability of credit is a good thing. We all need credit, and it is often those on the lowest incomes who have the greatest need for it. It would be wholly wrong to adopt a sort of paternalistic approach and deny people access to credit when they need it. The whole issue comes down to the case for responsible lending, which should be combined with responsibility on the part of the individual borrower. However, so many people are vulnerable, for one reason or another&#151;be it mental health, age or just the pressures of life&#151;so the industry bears a great obligation to act responsibly. The Bill, however, sets a modern framework within which the industry can operate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_215">The Bill is welcome, but it is long overdue. I pay tribute to the Treasury Committee, on which I served, for pushing the Department of Trade and Industry to introduce a Bill in Parliament. Such as measure was debated for a long time. The Minister said that there had been four years of hard work, but at one stage it seemed as if that would become five or six years. The Treasury Committee played an important part in pushing the Department in the right direction.

 I am pleased that the Minister agrees.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_216">I very much hope that the Treasury Committee will continue to monitor the industry, because although there has been genuine progress and the Bill modernises the legislative framework, there is still a long way to go before the industry always behaves responsibly and consumers avoid getting into serious difficulty. There 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 1033</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>are some areas where progress still needs to be made. First, there are still unacceptable practices. I hope that the unfairness test will address some of our concerns, but pernicious charges are often imposed, as I have experienced myself. Payment may be due to go into an account but, for some reason, it does not. Consequently, the cheques that one writes are not covered. One might have to pay a charge of &#163;30 a cheque, so if one has written five cheques one faces costs of &#163;150. The equivalent interest rate would be a substantial one, and many people get into serious difficulty as a result of those exorbitant charges. That is the subject of an investigation, and I hope that the outcome will be a more competitive market. Remarkably, all the companies manage to charge roughly the same amount for going over the credit limit or for failing to pay on time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_217">Credit card cheques were mentioned by the Minister, and are a serious concern, as they tempt people to use their credit card inappropriately. I remember when Matt Barrett, the chairman of Barclays, had his wonderful Ratner moment in the Treasury Committee, but he was quite right to say that he would not advise his son to use his credit card as a means of borrowing over time. He would advise him to use it as a means of payment. However, sending people credit card cheques so that they use their credit cards to borrow on a long-term basis is wholly inappropriate. Most people do not realise that interest applies immediately&#151;it is therefore different from the interest on credit card purchases&#151;so they are not aware of the problems that they will experience as a result of those charges. The Minister has undertaken to take a further look at that. I hope that he does so and produces an effective solution to tackle the problem. We may be able to discuss that at our joint meeting with the banks which, again, I welcome. The banking code is a voluntary means to address many of those concerns and avoids the problem of over-prescriptive regulation. I therefore urge the industry to respond positively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_218">The hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) raised the transfer of credit balances, which is another serious concern. People who have transferred a debt of &#163;5,000 with nil interest for a year go out and make some purchases with their card. They think that they are paying off the purchases but, in fact, they are paying off the transfer debt at nil interest, and are paying interest on their purchases. Again, that is the sort of problem that is most appropriately dealt with through the banking code or by voluntary agreement, but the industry must respond. If it fails to respond, I hope that the Treasury Committee and the Department will be on its back demanding a positive response.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_219">The second issue of principle that still has not been addressed and which the Bill fails to address is that for a genuinely competitive market, one needs informed consumers. On the cost of borrowing, we do not have informed consumers. Although we have sorted out the APR problem, we have not sorted out the problem of the calculation of interest rates. It is a pity that the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Wealden was not selected for debate today. I understand how these things must be done, but that is a crucial issue. When there are 10 different means of calculating interest, no consumer will be able to compare one card with another. There will not be transparency until that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 1034</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>problem is resolved. I hope that the Minister finds a way of addressing the problem and that we can discuss it directly with the industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_220">The third issue is data sharing, the subject of a new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) and me today. Because it was not selected, the issue again remains unresolved. As has been said by others, the Bill is the golden opportunity to address these problems. While the Bill continues to progress through the other place, it is a time to put pressure on the industry to get its act together. However, as the industry says, it needs a legislative change in order for it to be able to share data under the historic agreements introduced before the implementation of the Data Protection Act 1998. It is a crucial issue, which the Government need to address.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_221">The fourth issue is financial education. The changes will have little impact unless we increase the level of financial education generally in society. There has been an explosion in the availability of credit and credit products. We have not had a commensurate revolution in financial education. Schools and the Department for Education and Skills need to engage in that. The Minister can use his authority to engage with others to bring about real change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_222">The fifth issue is the availability of advice and assistance. In parts of the country there is access to a remarkably good service, often provided by citizens advice bureaux and other advice agencies, but there are gaps in the network that need to be filled. Our party has argued that the industry ought to contribute to a common fund. At present there are all sorts of different arrangements whereby, perhaps for competitive advantage, companies enter agreements with advice agencies to offer support and advice when needed. Unless that is done comprehensively, gaps will remain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_223">I had a case in my constituency, involving the Holt citizens advice bureau and two other bureaux in other hon. Members&#039; constituencies. They have had their three-year lottery grant. Like so many similar organisations, they have provided an enormous amount of advice during that period. Some 40 per cent. of the advice that is given relates to debt. That is in a market town which many people would regard as reasonably prosperous, but there is hidden deprivation and lack of financial security in every part of the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_224">What happens when that three years comes to an end, as it did earlier this year? An application for renewal was refused, so the funding came to an end. There is a cliff face. I am constantly frustrated by the availability of grants from central Government and from other agencies which have a defined life period, often helping to provide an essential service, and when it comes to an end the whole scheme collapses. That is not good public policy. Advice is no longer available in that part of north Norfolk and, although I have written to the Association for Payment Clearing Services and the British Bankers Association and asked them to help, the industry as a whole should ensure that a full network of advice is in place across the country, which would be a major advance. Again, I urge the Minister to engage with the industry on that front.

<a name="stpa_225">We have not addressed the issue of an interest rate cap today, but it was passionately debated on Second Reading and in Committee&#151;Rev. Paul Nicolson is a particularly effective advocate for the cause. I have not been persuaded of the case, and my position is based on research commissioned by the DTI, which has been heavily criticised for the lack of evidence. The Minister should ensure that more authoritative and deeper research is carried out to compare jurisdictions with interest rate caps with other jurisdictions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_226">None of us feels comfortable about the interest rates charged by some doorstep lenders and others, but the providers of mainstream credit often get people into difficulty because of the combination of charges and the lack of data sharing. The interest rates issue specifically relates to the most impoverished in our society, because the poorest members of society are paying the highest rates of interest. The Department should monitor the matter closely and commission further research so that we achieve a greater understanding and try to reach a consensus about the evidence before drawing further conclusions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_227">The Minister is mistaken about the unfairness test. There is serious concern about a lack of guidance for both the lender and the borrower on what &quot;unfairness&quot; means in that particular context. The matter comes down to the whether Parliament or an agency that is accountable to Parliament should decide, or whether a court should decide. The Minister has chosen the option of the court deciding, so we will be left with an uncertain wait, which may last for years, for an unaccountable court to provide the guidelines on how to interpret unfairness. That arrangement is unsatisfactory, and, in a sense, Parliament has abdicated its responsibility to provide clear legislation that lets everyone know where they stand.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_228">I have raised a number of concerns and issues that are not dealt with satisfactorily in the Bill, for understandable reasons.

 I welcome the Bill, which introduces a reform that is long overdue and reflects changes in practice. The credit market has changed enormously since the Consumer Credit Act 1974 was introduced. It is pleasing that the Government have dealt with the matter so soon in this Parliament. It is important to provide greater protections to those who are seeking credit, and that is a key element of what the Bill tries to do in seeking to protect the most vulnerable members of our communities.

<a name="50714-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_230">It will probably come as no surprise to the Minister that I am left a little disappointed by the end result of our deliberations. As he knows, I am a lawyer by training, which means that I am picky and like Bills to be drafted in a particular way. Like other lawyers, I look for certainty in terms of the way in which legislation is interpreted. I fear that certain parts of the Bill still have elements of vagueness, particularly in relation to the unfairness test. We have discussed that on Second Reading, in Committee and today on Report, so I do not intend to go over old ground&#151;the Minister is clearly familiar with the arguments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_231">The Minister proffered the olive branch of the Office of Fair Trading guidance, but that has certain limitations, as the OFT itself recognises in the guidance note that it has already produced. That says that it is ultimately for the courts to decide what happens in a case of unfairness and whether something is to be regarded as unfair practice, although it may give some pointers. I hope that that will help in providing the level of certainty that Members on both sides of the House are seeking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_232">On one level I can understand why one can advance the argument of keeping a general approach on the unfairness test: it is in order to say to lenders, &quot;We&#039;ve done it this way deliberately to keep you on your toes and on the right side of the line, and you&#039;ve got to think about it very carefully.&quot; My only fear is that that could operate in the opposite way. As regards access to justice, the lack of certainty makes it difficult to bring a legal case or to force a lender who has not been abiding by the rules to reach an early settlement. There is an overlap with the OFT and the financial penalties for inappropriate practice, as well as the powers under part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002. Again, that has certain limitations, as there has to be a sustained practice that can be regarded as unfair across the whole industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_233">It is possible to look at the right to impose sanctions in a slightly different way. The OFT says in its notes on imposing financial penalties:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;Where . . . a licence holder voluntarily provides compensation to consumers, this can be taken into account by the OFT when considering the appropriate amount of penalty to be imposed. This would exclude situations where the consumer involved had already approached the courts or the Financial Ombudsman Service, because in this context that would not be a voluntary action by the licensee.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_234">I acknowledge that that signifies an intent to try to force lenders to examine their actions carefully. If somebody approached the courts and the ombudsman&#039;s service, and the lender recognised that he had not acted appropriately, I would hope that the OFT has some flexibility to take that into consideration. I hope that matters are not so rigid that, simply because somebody started the process of going to the ombudsman or going through the courts, the OFT could not take such recognition into account, as the language in the guidance note suggests. We all agree that we want to avoid going to the courts if possible. Any mechanism for encouraging that must be a good thing.

<a name="stpa_235">Many have spoken about denying credit and the fact that those on low incomes find it the most difficult to obtain credit. There has been a great expansion in the UK credit market and more people than ever have the capacity and opportunity to borrow. However, access to credit remains severely constrained and limited for those on insecure or low incomes.
</p>

<p>

We&#039;ll pull out of that market.&quot; I am sure that the Under-Secretary shares those views. The credit industry must be regulated properly to ensure that it provides fair credit, but that must not result in financial facilities being denied to those on low incomes.

<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 1038</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_242">I refer in particular to the interest rate cap that the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) mentioned. The Bill provides for a significant enhancement of indirect consumer protection as a result of an easier recourse to the law, either through the courts or through an alternative disputes procedure. A more explicit definition in the Bill of the unfairness test would have provided more direct and immediate protection, but we do not have that at the moment. I would go further and argue that we need completely to stamp out exploitative lending in the sub-prime market through the operation of an interest rate ceiling. Such ceilings exist in most countries, including the majority of European countries, and in many states in the USA, Australia and Canada. The South African sister Department to the DTI has included in draft legislation an enabling clause similar to the one that I proposed in the previous Bill before the election, and in the past few weeks, the Polish lower House has supported legislation to introduce an interest rate cap. Surely all those countries cannot be wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_243">Credit is to be supported, but there is a difference between credit and what used to be called usury. Credit is an arrangement that benefits both the lender and the borrower. The lender receives the interest payments, but the borrower also benefits because the arrangement enables them to smooth out fluctuations in their income. Usury offers no long-term benefit to the borrower, however, and the lender knows that at the time of the transaction. Surely such arrangements should be eliminated, and an interest rate ceiling would appear, from the research that the Minister and I have seen, to be a successful way of achieving that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_244">The Minister said on Second Reading that he was prepared to look again at the independent research on interest rate capping. I know that he has received a briefing on the issue from Debt on our Doorstep. It is an extensive literature review that goes back over 40 years of experience in interest rate ceilings. It goes into much more detail than the Policis research, which, as the hon. Member for North Norfolk said, is highly flawed. Policis does not appear to have interviewed many of the leading academic commentators worldwide. It claims to have done a full literature review, but there was no extensive bibliography in the report. I know that Debt on our Doorstep has asked to see it. That research seems flawed to me.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_245">I echo the comments made by the hon. Member for North Norfolk. Could we have a timetable for the review that the Minister has promised? Will the Government commission further independent research, because of the doubts that are widely shared about the robustness of the Policis research? After all, there is a template that the Department could use. It is the Treasury&#039;s recent consultation document on the credit union interest rate cap. The Government have imposed an interest rate cap on the credit unions. By law, they cannot charge more than 1 per cent. a month. If it makes sense to place an interest rate cap on credit unions, which by their very nature are beneficent in their attitude towards their borrowers, why is it not worth looking again at putting a interest rate cap on lenders that are slightly less beneficent in their approach? Will the Minister therefore consider that?

Are there any proposals, for instance, to examine the kind of statutory requirements that the Governments of France and Germany place on mainstream lending institutions in relation to providing banking, including overdraft facilities, under which a certain proportion of their customer base must be low-income households? In commissioning further research, will the Government examine not just interest rate caps but spreading financial inclusion through mainstream providers?

 Like everyone else in the Chamber, I want to say how much I welcome the new Bill and wish it well on its way to the other place. As a new Member, I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience of participating on Second Reading, Report and Third Reading but most of all in Committee. It was a tribute to the proceedings of Parliament that we were able to go through the Bill in such detail, clause by clause, with such courtesy across the Committee Room. I thank the Minister for the way in which he and his officials have handled the Bill, and I also thank the Liberal Democrats. Most of all, however, I thank my hon.

<a name="stpa_247">I want to return to only three issues, some of which I raised on Second Reading. As the Minister is now well aware, I am obsessed, rather like a dog with a bone, with the unfair relationship test. It strikes me as extraordinary that the Department has not in any way sought to include guidance on what an unfair relationship means. Were such guidance provided, perhaps in the Bill or by regulation, that would be an enormous benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_248">To begin with, guidance would help the industry before the Bill even came into effect. The industry would know how to redesign if necessary any products that were on the market, and how to adapt easily and quickly to the forthcoming regime. Above all, however, guidance would help the consumer, who stands alone when he or she makes the bargain, and who has no resources to turn to expert advice if the bargain goes wrong. It would help the consumer if he or she were able to turn easily to guidance on what might or might not be unfair, rather than, as I had to do, ferret around in &quot;Chitty on Contracts&quot;, using my dusty and ancient legal experience, to work out that there might or might not be a connection with the terms in consumer credit regulations. Guidance would also help the industry&#151;it would put off ambulance chasers and unscrupulous individuals seeking to try it on because they were unhappy with the bargain that they had made&#151;and the ombudsman.

<a name="stpa_250">I have also listened with interest to the wider debate, which we did not necessarily have in Committee, particularly the debate on an interest rate cap. I have to say that I am increasingly attracted to that idea. Arguably a Conservative Member&#039;s instinct should be to oppose any regulation, especially regulation that &quot;interferes with the free market&quot;, but I think that too often members of our party shy away from active regulation and intervention that can help the individual, the consumer and the vulnerable person, because we make obeisance at the altar of the free market.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_251">When we look at the financial services industry, we see an industry that is selling a product. Any other industry that sells products to consumers is regulated, and indeed the financial services industry is closely regulated. But no one would argue that we should get rid of motorway speed limits because they cut off access to high-speed, thrilling drives for Ferrari drivers, and I find it odd that we should wish not to cap interest rates because that would cut off access to vulnerable consumers for unscrupulous lenders. As for the argument that we are somehow doing vulnerable consumers a disservice by cutting them off from excessive rates of interest, I find that bizarre. It is precisely because those consumers are vulnerable in a host of ways, not just because of their particular circumstances at the time but perhaps because of their educational background, that they are targeted.

<p>
<a name="50714-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_252">As the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price) pointed out, the Government are not shy of imposing consumer-style regulation on financial products, not just credit agreements but the stakeholder pension when it was introduced. As I said on Second Reading, that also applies to CAT&#151;charges access terms&#151;standards.

 I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman agrees with me, but I think that the picture is unclear.

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman, and with the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr, that the Government should review the position.

<a name="stpa_254">I find it extremely odd that, in the 21st century, it is possible to go to school and receive only the merest smattering of education. Pupils may learn algebra, which they will never use again, or a foreign language, which they will rarely use again. I would go so far as to say that 99 per cent. of what I learned at school I never use. It would be a great idea to include personal financial education, not merely as a fringe activity but as a core part of our education system. School children should be able to take GCSEs and A-levels in the subject, to educate themselves in the wily ways of financial services.

Many interesting issues have been raised, and I stand here feeling some satisfaction, in that the Bill has reached Third Reading and will now proceed to the other place. As a result, in the near future there will be protection for a wide range of consumers who seek credit. We have focused on people on low incomes, but we have also agreed that credit is a useful tool when handled properly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_256">I realise that the question of an interest rate cap is central to this debate. Our research on this issue has been criticised, but I should point out that the research undertaken by Policis focused on those on low and very low incomes primarily because they are the most vulnerable groups. Much of the existing data have not been separated to show the position of those on low incomes. However, as I have said all along, I am genuinely prepared to examine the information that comes in. In answer to the point raised by the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire), we will review the legislation within two to three years and examine the various issues arising.

</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_257">We will not be complacent, however, and we must remember that this Bill must be seen not in isolation, but in the context of the various cross-departmental initiatives on financial inclusion. The hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price) discussed developing credit unions, and the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey) raised the issue of financial education, which will be provided.

<a name="stpa_259">We are going to have to deal with the problem of loan sharks very soon, and with that in mind we are running two pilot projects, in Birmingham and in Glasgow. The Birmingham project is working very well. The issues being dealt with are very depressing. These loan sharks lend huge sums, and there are other, associated evils. For example, loan sharks target single mothers living in high-rise flats because lenders do not allow their staff to visit such flats; as a result, such single mothers cannot obtain any other kind of credit. If they happen to miss a few payments, the loan sharks encourage them into prostitution or drugs. We are determined to tackle this problem, and we must ensure that those at the low end of the income scale are not preyed upon by loan sharks.

</p>





<p><a name="st_273"><a name="50714-30_spnew0"><b> Mr. John Baron  (Billericay) (Con):</b> 
 Thank you, Mr.   Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to raise this important issue in the House and I also want to thank the Minister for responding. He will be aware that the Crays Hill Travellers&#039; site is the largest in the country. Should council plans go ahead, there will be a very large-scale eviction over the coming months of about 50 families who have developed green belt land without authorisation and therefore live, in a sense, on the illegal part of the site.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_262">It is a very unfortunate and sad state of affairs. The eviction will cause much heartache for both the settled and Traveller communities. No doubt, when the time comes, the newspapers will be full of pictures of crying children and distressed adults as the bailiffs move in to do their job. There is little doubt that the law as it presently stands is to blame for this situation and I would like to make the Minister aware of why I believe that to be the case. I also want to ask him some specific questions in the hope that we can move the issue forwards and clarify certain matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_263">The law as it stands is presently inadequate. It can deal with the issue of trespass, but it cannot deal with those who buy green belt or greenfield land and then speedily and illegally develop it. There is no shortage of examples in my constituency of where that has taken place. A relatively recent example occurred two or three years ago near Saddler&#039;s Farm roundabout where, over the course of a bank holiday weekend, Travellers built a 6-ft earth mound around the perimeter of a field that they owned. They laid hardcore the next day and the day after that moved the caravans in. The council reacted with stop and enforcement notices, but by the time that they had been served, the development was complete. Consequently, a lengthy planning and appeals process was entered into, which is still ongoing, and meanwhile the illegal development remains. The problem is a result of the law&#039;s ineffectiveness, because it allows small illegal sites to become much bigger ones, so the issue becomes much harder and costlier to deal with. That is precisely what happened at the Crays Hill site.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_264">The Minister will be aware that, after a long and protracted planning process that involved several enforcement notices, appeals, and public inquiries, Basildon council finally got to the point where they sought authorisation to evict those Travellers who had illegally developed the green belt. However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister effectively overruled the council in 2003 and gave the Travellers a two-year extension to move on. Instead, the number of caravans on the illegal site increased significantly during that period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_265">Needless to say, the problem has become much harder to deal with, because the number of families involved has increased and the Travellers have had longer to settle down and establish a way of life. Basildon council now has no choice but to evict those Travellers who have broken the rules, as not doing so would send out the very clear signal that the green belt was up for grabs.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_266">I want to make it absolutely clear that no one wants to discriminate against a minority. I have tried to make the same point whenever this matter has been discussed over the past few years, but it is only fair to insist that all those who live in a community abide by its laws and regulations. Otherwise, the law-abiding majority are the ones who suffer discrimination. That is important, because there is a minority in the Traveller community&#151;and I stress that it is a minority&#151;who in the past have resorted to unwise words on this matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_267">We in Basildon district have no problems with law-abiding Travellers. The latest figures show that we have more than 100 authorised sites and pitches for the Traveller and Gypsy communities, whereas some neighbouring districts have none at all. We have a long and proud history&#151;of literally hundreds of years&#151;of living in harmony with those communities. Indeed, Basildon district has the largest number of authorised caravans in Essex: in 1990, we had 37, and now we have about 180. That is an increase of nearly 500 per cent., and compares with an increase in the same period of roughly 100 per cent. in Essex, and 55 per cent. in England as whole.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_268">No one can accuse us of discriminating against Travellers or of being intolerant or racist. All that we ask is that everyone obeys the same set of rules, especially if they wish to live in the community. Clearly, that has not happened at the illegal Crays Hill sites.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_269">I want to make it clear, too, that local politics has played no part in the discussion. That important point is worth stressing, and I am not using this debate to play politics with the issue. I first became MP for Billericay four years ago, when Labour controlled Basildon council. I refused to blame the council then, as I believed that the law needed reform. I know that my approach is appreciated by Labour councillors to this day.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_270">I am pleased to note that the Opposition Whips are no longer in the Chamber, as I have also made it clear that I believe that the Conservative Government of 1994 were wrong to remove the statutory duty on local authorities to provide authorised sites. That was a bad mistake, and I shall return to it in a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_271">What needs to be done? I have no doubt that the law is to blame, as it is outdated and ineffective. We urgently need to adopt a twin-track approach, as outlined in my private Member&#039;s Bill, the Greenbelt Protection Bill of 2003. My aim was to change the law, on the one hand by obliging councils to provide authorised sites where there was sufficient demand and for which an honest rent and council taxes could be charged, and on the other by giving them much stronger powers speedily to evict those Travellers who insisted on breaking the law. Also, my Bill would have allowed councils to put right any damage caused and to recover the cost from those who had caused it. Moreover, my Bill provided that those powers would have been available to councils only when the required sites had been provided. I felt that that was the fair way to go about dealing with the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_272">I could give further details of the proposals in my Bill, but I refer the Minister to the explanatory notes, of which his Department has a copy. The change in the law that I proposed would have been fair to those Travellers who respect the law and it would have allowed those who do not to be dealt with speedily. That would have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 1046</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>prevented the development of the large-scale illegal sites, such as Crays Hill, that are often so much more difficult to deal with.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_273">The Government&#039;s response to my proposals was disappointing, to say the least. A long consultation was held, which involved many site visits, public hearings and meetings with residents, Travellers, councillors, police and Basildon council&#039;s planning department. In addition, I sought&#151;and had no trouble securing&#151;very good cross-party support in the Chamber, but the Government blocked my Bill without explanation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_274">After continually raising the issue in Parliament and meeting Ministers from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and, indeed, the Prime Minister, there are tentative signs that the Government are now at least considering adopting a twin-track approach, but progress is far too slow. I should therefore like to ask the Minister a number of questions, to which I hope he will respond directly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para13">
<a name="stpa_275">First, the Minister is fully aware that I raised the issue of eviction costs with the Prime Minister, by way of letter, and with the Deputy Prime Minister during Prime Minister&#039;s questions last week. The two-year extension given in 2003 to the Travellers at Crays Hill before they must move on has resulted instead in the number of caravans increasing significantly. The precise figures are difficult to come by, but there is no doubt that there has been a significant increase. The cost of eviction has increased accordingly and, according to Basildon council, now stands at about &#163;2 million, which represents approximately 15 per cent. of a year&#039;s council tax revenue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_276">Will the Minister now commit the Government to assist Basildon council financially with those increased eviction costs, which are a direct result of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s decision to give a two-year extension, or will he at least promise to look into the issue? If the answer is no, Ministers are, in effect, unfairly penalising local council tax payers for a mistake made by the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para15">
<a name="stpa_277">The response from the Deputy Prime Minister last week was totally inadequate. He suggested that the money could be better spent on providing land for the Travellers, but such a view displays an ignorance of the situation locally, while nationally, it would spell disaster for our green belt because it would allow Travellers to drive a coach and horses through our planning laws, for there would be no disincentive to buy and illegally develop large chunks of the green belt, as councils would be encouraged by the Government not to meet evictions costs, but to spend the money instead on providing sites.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para16">
<a name="stpa_278">Secondly, will the Minister update me on what progress is being made on the much-needed reform of our planning laws? Many people think that the progress so far has taken far too long, particularly bearing it in mind that the Government have been aware of the issue for a number of years now. The Minister will be aware that two consultation exercises have been instigated&#151;one to look at the provision of authorised sites, the other to consider whether to give stronger powers to councils&#151;and I have contributed to both.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para17">
<a name="stpa_279">With regard to authorised sites, in December 2004, the ODPM issued a consultation paper, &quot;Planning for Gypsy and Traveller Sites&quot;. The consultation period 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 1047</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>ended on 18 March. When can local authorities expect to receive the revised guidance that will replace circular 1/94? Does the Minister accept that the provision of sites for Traveller families is a national issue and that it should not be left to a small number of local authorities to provide the majority of the sites? Will the new guidance therefore include measures to require all local authorities, where demand is sufficient, to make adequate provision for Traveller sites?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para18">
<a name="stpa_280">I am concerned to learn that there is talk that the Government have dropped the idea of direction and are instead considering leaving the solution to regional spatial strategies. That simply will not work, for there is nothing to force councils to comply with those strategies, except for the Travellers themselves resorting to the appeals process. The Minister will be aware that paragraph 20 of the draft circular on planning for Traveller sites advised that the regional spatial strategy should include provision for Gypsy sites. Yet the draft east of England plan, published very recently, says nothing about Gypsy sites. The draft spatial strategy is meant to guide development in the east of England for at least the next 20 years, yet no mention is made of Gypsy sites whatsoever. I hope that the Minister will appreciate that such confusion needs to be sorted out by the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para19">
<a name="stpa_281">The Government have consulted on whether to give stronger power to councils. They proposed a 28-day temporary stop notice in response to the pressure to give much stronger powers to councils. Indeed, such notices became law on 7 March this year. The main difference from the existing law is that local authorities will have power to serve a temporary stop notice without first serving an enforcement notice. That sounds good, but when we consider the detail and the exemptions the power is actually quite ineffective. Basildon council has several concerns. Within the 28-day period, for example, the local authority has to serve an enforcement notice and a normal stop notice, which gives right of appeal against those notices. However, such an appeal also has the effect of putting into abeyance not only the enforcement and normal stop notices but also the 28-day temporary notice itself. That is a real concern for my local planning department.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para20">
<a name="stpa_282">Meanwhile, in the interim 28-day period, the local authority can indeed prosecute the contravener in the magistrates court for continuing to occupy land in breach of the temporary stop notice. However, the magistrates court is in many respects an inappropriate means for securing an effective deterrent to the breach, because it can usually impose only a fine. In many cases, it is difficult to get someone to court in 28 days if they do not want to be there. All sorts of delaying tactics can be used, such as an application for legal aid or simply not turning up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para21">
<a name="stpa_283">More important, the new law does not allow local authorities to serve a temporary stop notice against someone who is occupying a caravan where that caravan is their main home, unless it is parked where it is causing a highway danger or there are other exceptional circumstances. It is highly likely that most Travellers will claim that the caravan in question is their main residence and, in fairness, there is a good chance that it will be, so the exemption renders the temporary stop 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 1048</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>notice next to useless. The fact that the caravan was on green belt land would not entitle a local authority to serve temporary stop notices if that caravan was a main residence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para22">
<a name="stpa_284">The conclusion is that the law will not help local authorities to take effective, swift action against Traveller families who move on to green belt sites without planning permission. It will certainly not help Basildon council with the situation at Crays Hill. Meanwhile, it must not be forgotten that, even if a stop notice is invoked, it postpones the problem only for four weeks&#151;thereafter the present ineffective laws kick in.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para23">
<a name="stpa_285">May I ask the Minister to address some other issues? Will he clarify some of the terminology on needs-based assessment under the Housing Act 2004? He will be aware that the Act stipulates that the needs of Gypsy communities should form part of a local authority&#039;s homelessness needs assessment&#151;rightly so. However, little or no methodology has been given as guidance and councils are wondering how to undertake that task. It has been suggested that the number of unauthorised caravans is one way of measuring the needs of local travellers; in other words, if there is a large number, there must be a need. However, in Basildon district, there are about 220 unauthorised caravans&#151;representing a 700 per cent. increase since 1990&#151;while some neighbouring districts have very few or none at all, so if that methodology was used, it would suggest that only in Basildon district was there a further requirement for Traveller sites, which is clearly nonsense. Will the Minister clarify the methodology councils are to use to meet their obligations under the Act?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para24">
<a name="stpa_286">Will the Minister update me on the Government&#039;s progress, if any, on my proposals for a twin-track approach? During this short debate I have tried to highlight the extent of the problem at the Crays Hill Traveller site, and to show where I believe that Government policy is causing confusion, is ineffective and at least partially to blame. I have suggested the improvements that should be made, as highlighted in my attempt to change the law in 2003. As I have said previously, the Government initially blocked my Bill, but after pressing them in Parliament and after meetings with Ministers and the Prime Minister, who seemed to suggest that my proposals should be examined further, it seems that the Government are at least heading down the road towards the twin-track approach that is required. However, for the reasons previously stated, the Government&#039;s proposals to date will not provide the solutions required. Will the Government take a fresh look at my proposals which, as the Minister knows, have good cross-party support and, when he has time, will he get back to me?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para25">
<a name="stpa_287">In conclusion, I hope that the Minister will appreciate that I am not interested in playing politics on the issue. What is required is good law, and the current law is inadequate. Proof of this is that we still have a sad situation in Crays Hill, where a large number of Traveller families will be forcibly evicted, which will cause much pain and anguish. The situation can be avoided in future if the Government grip the problem, but so far from what we know of their proposals, both with regard to the provision of authorised sites and giving councils stronger powers, they are clearly inadequate. Left as they are, they will not solve the problem.

<p>
<a name="50714-30_para26">
<a name="stpa_288">A twin-track approach is required. With regard to the provision of authorised sites, clear direction must be given to local authorities, while councils must be given much stronger powers speedily to evict Travellers who insist on breaking the law and to put right any damage. Otherwise, the unnecessary and sad conflict that we have seen in the past between settled and Traveller communities, and that we will see again at Crays Hill in the coming months, will continue and intensify in future in other parts. Given that the Government have been aware of the issue for a good number of years, they have a moral obligation to act, and to act quickly, before too much more pain is caused. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#039;s response.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron) on securing the debate. I am pleased to see my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela E. Smith) in her place and I acknowledge her interest in the matter. I should like to place on record my appreciation for the way in which the hon. Gentleman has introduced the debate and for his contribution in trying to find a solution to this problem recently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_289">We recognise the difficult problems that can arise when trying to find suitable accommodation for Gypsies and Travellers generally and, more specifically, the problems of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency. I hope to cover all the hon. Gentleman&#039;s questions in the course of my speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_290">We take these issues seriously. We have been working hard and will continue to work hard to find solutions and alleviate the distress that local people are experiencing. The hon. Gentleman is aware that my noble Friend, Baroness Andrews, met representatives of Basildon district council and Essex county council on Tuesday to discuss the situation at the Crays Hill site. I understand that Basildon council is meeting later tonight to consider whether or not the Travellers should be evicted from this unauthorised development. We sympathise with the difficulties that this may present for both the settled community and the Travellers. The council will need to weigh in the balance the consequences of such action for the council, the settled community and Travellers. I do not underestimate the seriousness of the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_291">The matter has to be for the council. Ministers have no locus in any decisions in relation to the enforcement notices and actions in compliance with them. That properly is a matter for the district council to determine. In the same vein, the Government cannot assist with any of the specific costs relating to ensuring compliance with the enforcement notices.

<br>&nbsp;<br>authority needs to play a part in that. We want to assist Basildon and other Essex authorities to find a way forward to resolve the issue of accommodation for Gypsies and Travellers by working with other local authorities in the area. As a start, we have agreed with Basildon and Essex that it will be helpful for officials from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to be invited to next week&#039;s meeting of the Essex local government association, at which Gypsy and Traveller issues in the county are to be discussed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_293">Many local authorities have not responded sufficiently to local need in their areas in recent years. To be fair, some local authorities have done a great deal, but some have not. That is unfair on neighbouring local authorities and on local communities, which must put up with unauthorised development, often on inappropriate sites.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_294">Under the Housing Act 2004 local authorities must carry out housing needs assessments for Gypsies and Travellers, as they do for the settled community. They are also required to draw up a Gypsy and Traveller accommodation strategy to ensure that need is met. We will be issuing final guidance on how to carry out housing needs assessments in due course, but meantime we will seek to facilitate sharing of good practice between local authorities and other players, and we will do all that we can to help local authorities find a way to share provision. In response to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s specific question about when that will happen, my best guess is the end of the summer. We have had 300 responses to the consultation exercise and, obviously, we want to give due consideration to them. I assure him that it will be sooner rather than later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_295">Local authorities should identify land that could be used for the provision of new public and private sites. That is why it is important to place an obligation on local authorities to identify land as part of their planning process. Under the new planning circular, as drafted, there is a requirement on local planning authorities to allocate sufficient land for sites. That is effectively a duty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_296">Local authorities will have to identify sites suitable for Gypsies and Travellers as part of their local development framework&#151;the new planning process. There is an important opportunity provided through the regional planning process to look across the region. Because of the nomadic lifestyle followed by many Gypsies and Travellers, there has to be a strong strategic element to planning for their needs. Regional planning bodies are key to that. They will have to make an assessment of the regional need for Gypsy and Traveller sites, based on local housing assessments made by local authorities. That assessment of need will then be turned into pitch numbers allocated to each area of the region in the regional spatial strategy. Local authorities will have to reflect those targets in their local development frameworks. That will help to counter the concerns of some authorities that they are being left to shoulder the burden on their own. We recognise that many local authorities may find it difficult to tackle that issue. We would encourage neighbouring authorities to work together wherever possible, and I know that that is starting to happen in Essex.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_297">There have been calls for the reintroduction of a duty on local authorities to provide sites. The current problem is clear&#151;there is a significant lack of

<br>&nbsp;<br>authorised sites. However, the solution is not to reintroduce a statutory duty on all local authorities. A duty has been tried before, but often did not produce appropriate provision, and meant that the public purse funded provision. Even with the introduction of 100 per cent. Exchequer funding in 1979, Gypsy site provision failed to keep pace with the growth in the number of caravans.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_298">The arrangements that I have outlined for local authorities to carry out needs assessments and make provision for sites in their local plan, amount effectively to a duty.

<p><a name="st_277"><a name="50714-31_spnew2"><b> Mr. Baron: </b> 
 I accept what the Minister has said, but is he concerned that the draft east of England regional spatial strategy does not contain any mention of the provision of Gypsy sites? Does not that suggest a failing that needs, somehow, to be put right?
</p>





<p><a name="st_278"><a name="50714-31_spnew3"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman kindly gave me the opportunity to consider the point that he wished to emphasise. We will respond to the draft RSS in due course and if it does not contain details on how accommodation needs will be met, the Secretary of State could refuse to finalise and approve it. I assure the hon. Gentleman that such provision will be considered as part of the process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_299">In assessing need, local authorities should not be able to rely simply on the situation within their boundaries. Situations such as that in Basildon illustrate a need to look across regions and sub-regions to ensure an equitable distribution of provision. We shall explore the best way to achieve that as part of the guidance on needs assessments currently in preparation. I would also point out to the hon. Gentleman that despite the repeal of the Caravan Sites Act 1968, local authorities continue to have the power to create sites as they see fit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_300">Basildon council has called on the Government to help with the cost of enforcement. The enforcement of planning control is a statutory function of local authorities for which they need to budget and the costs of which are not generally recoverable. The Government have provided significant investment in local authorities since taking office, with a 33 per cent. real terms increase in Government grant in that time. Although I recognise that the costs in this case are significant, I regret that the principle must remain. However, we are prepared to help with the cost of new site provision, and are offering practical assistance by providing funding. In 2005&#150;06, the Gypsy sites refurbishment grant is available for new sites as well as for the refurbishment of existing ones. The aim of the grant is to increase the number of authorised pitches available to Gypsies and Travellers, and thus reduce the need for unauthorised sites. In addition, mainstream funding via the regional housing pot of some &#163;56 million will be made available for local authority and registered social landlord sites from 2006&#150;07.
</p>





<p><a name="st_279"><a name="50714-31_spnew4"><b> Mr. Baron: </b> 
 We can bandy figures about in the Chamber, but a council that is about to seek eviction can be told suddenly by the Government to stop and give the Travellers a two-year extension. During those two years, the number of caravans can increase significantly. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jul 2005 : Column 1052</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Does the Minister not accept that outside the House many people believe that the Government should pay an appropriate proportion of the increased costs, because their decision to provide a two-year extension led to a significant increase in the number of caravans?
</p>





<p><a name="st_280"><a name="50714-31_spnew5"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 I am sorry, but we do not accept that. We introduced the two-year extension in an attempt to ameliorate the situation and solve problems. We wanted to provide time to make sure that we did not provoke a crisis for settled communities, Travellers, local authorities and enforcement agencies such as the police service. Problems with evictions could be resolved over the course of time. Obviously, that did not happen in Basildon where, over the two years, the site became bigger and there was no attempt to use local authority powers to restrict the number of people coming on to the site. There is therefore some local responsibility for the fact that the position is more difficult now than it was two years ago. As I have outlined, that is a local statutory responsibility: we do not have that responsibility, and we will not take it upon ourselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_301">As I was saying, the Government grant available to local authorities this year is &#163;8 million. It is being used to allow local authorities to build new residential sites for rent as well as to refurbish existing sites. Local authorities could do more to deal effectively with unauthorised development, and we plan to provide further help by producing an enforcement toolkit to provide guidance. The purpose of the guidance is to support local authorities and the police in taking whatever action is required to address the local problem that they face. Under powers in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991, local planning authorities have wide-ranging enforcement powers to deal with unauthorised development, including enforcement notices and stop notices, which carry penalties of up to &#163;20,000 for non-compliance, and injunctions in the High Court or county court that can be used to restrain any actual or expected breach of planning control.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_302">Since 7 March this year, local planning authorities have been able to use a new enforcement power&#151;the temporary stop notice&#151;where they consider that a breach of planning control has taken place and it is expedient that the activity that amounts to the breach is stopped. Temporary stop notices were introduced by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, and they are a new general enforcement power. Temporary stop notices have already been used, and I am aware of at least one case in which they were used both to stop the development of a Gypsy and Traveller site and to prevent caravans from going on to the site. Under the regulations, temporary stop notices can be used to halt all development. They need to be reviewed and, over the longer term, there should be scope to link stronger enforcement with greater site provision. Those measures should go hand in hand both nationally and locally, like measures to tackle unauthorised encampments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50714-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_303">I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concerns that the planning control regime should not appear to encourage unauthorised development. It is clearly unsatisfactory for anyone to carry out development without first obtaining the required planning permission. However, to remove the prospect of retrospective planning permission would excessively penalise those who inadvertently undertook work without permission.

<p>
<a name="50714-31_para15">
<a name="stpa_304">The Government&#039;s current approach is that development without planning consent or in breach of a consent which has been granted is not an offence, and that criminalisation would be an inappropriate and disproportionate response. The margins between lawful and unlawful development are not sufficiently clear-cut to form an acceptable basis for a new criminal offence.

Gypsies are part of the community and they have the same rights as anyone else, but with rights come responsibilities, and we support tough action by councils and local police to tackle illegal behaviour, including, where appropriate, the use of antisocial behaviour orders.
