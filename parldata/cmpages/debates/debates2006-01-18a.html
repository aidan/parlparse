<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60118-01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales  (Nick Ainger): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I have regular meetings with representatives of the business community to discuss issues that concern them. In fact, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will be attending a CBI Wales reception tomorrow in north Wales.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60118-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bellingham </b> 
 Is the Minister aware that over the past eight years, Britain has fallen from fourth in the   world competitiveness rankings to 12th&#151;the Principality has fallen by a similar amount. Is he aware that the Welsh CBI, Welsh chambers of commerce and the Welsh Federation of Small Businesses are saying that the cause of the fall is excessive regulation and that they are worried about possible job losses? Does he agree that if it were not for the extra jobs in the public sector, unemployment in Wales would probably be going up?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60118-01_spnew1"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s last statement was not true. There has recently been significant growth in the private sector. For example, in the third quarter of 2005, some 4,800 new small businesses were created in Wales. The hon. Gentleman claimed that the CBI and other business organisations were concerned, but let me give him some other quotes. Today&#039;s edition of <i>The Western Mail</i> says that a report by the Royal Bank of Scotland states that Wales begins 2006 with new momentum and confidence. It is reported that the Welsh economy picked up pace at the end of 2005, with growth in output and the acceleration of new orders suggesting that firms are confident about business prospects in the year ahead. That is the reality in Wales.

 (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree that it is a gross misrepresentation to suggest that   new jobs in Wales are being created only in the public sector? My constituency has had renewable manufacturing jobs in the energy sector, and we have an unemployment rate of 2.5 per cent. Will he commend the Assembly for the introduction of business laboratories, which are bringing into small business people in towns such as Wrexham who have never experienced entrepreneurship before? Those people commend the stability of the manufacturing sector and business generally, and I think that the Government are doing an excellent job.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60118-01_spnew3"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 Not surprisingly, I totally agree with my hon. Friend. The facts speak for themselves. More than 1,300 grants totalling &#163;40 million have been given to small businesses in Wales under the investment grant programme. I think that my hon. Friend was referring to the Technium programme. We have invested &#163;150 million in 13 Technium sites, and new businesses are being developed, research is going ahead and jobs are being created. That, again, is good news for Wales.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60118-01_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan  (Chesham and Amersham)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister boasts about the number of start-ups, but fails to tell us the number of businesses that have closed down. With unemployment rising in Wales, it is more important than ever to address the regulatory burden that inhibits small businesses. Following the publication of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, what targets has he set for cutting the burden of regulation on Welsh business, and will he publish those targets?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60118-01_spnew5"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 It is not for me to set those targets, but a measurement exercise is under way to establish the baseline. May I welcome the hon. Lady to her first Welsh questions? The fact is that the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill is the most radical such measure anywhere in the world. The CBI, the Institute of Directors, the Federation of Small Businesses and the British Chambers of Commerce are totally supportive of   it and see it as a major way forward on reducing regulation. It will build on what we achieved during our presidency of the European Union. The Commission is now withdrawing 68 pending laws and simplifying more than 220 pieces of legislation. That situation contrasts with the 8,100 statutory instruments that were passed in the last three years of the Conservative Government.

<p><a name="qn_o1">2. <a name="60118-01_wqn1"><b> Mr. Wayne David  (Caerphilly)</b> 
 (Lab): What decisions have been reached on the future of European structural funding in the objective 1 area of Wales. [41795]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60118-01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales  (Nick Ainger): </b> 
 On 16 December 2005, the European Council reached agreement on the European Union budget for 2007&#150;13. As a consequence, west Wales and the valleys will qualify for the highest level of European funding and will continue to benefit from substantial European structural fund receipts for the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 825</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>next seven years. Work is already well under way by the Assembly to prepare the new round of programmes that are due to commence in January 2007.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60118-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. David: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for that reply. May I   point out that Caerphilly county borough alone has attracted &#163;36 million of objective 1 funding in the current funding period, which has created no fewer than 11,300 new jobs? Is that level of investment likely to continue under the new funding arrangement that has been agreed?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60118-01_spnew7"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 Absolutely. The deal means that the level of structural funds coming into Wales for the next six to seven years will be the same as we have received in the last six to seven years. It will total around &#163;1.3 billion, which will be on top of the Assembly&#039;s block grant. The success of the programme so far means that probably, by the end of 2006, more than 40,000 new jobs will have been created; the unemployment rate in west Wales and the valleys will fall at twice the rate of the rest of the UK; and we will see full-time earnings in west Wales and the valleys growing twice as fast as in the rest of the UK. We can build on that huge success now that we have secured the great victory of getting objective 1 funding up to 2013.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60118-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Roger Williams  (Brecon and Radnorshire)</b> 
 (LD): West Wales and the valleys is not the only area in Wales that benefits from structural funds; certainly, the rural areas of Powys and the urban areas of Newport and Cardiff also benefit. Will those areas continue to get support under the new budget arrangements?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60118-01_spnew9"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 Yes, they will. Under the competitiveness and employment programmes the rest of Wales will qualify. The level has not yet been decided, but those areas will continue to benefit, perhaps even more so in certain places because the support could be more targeted. That is dependent on negotiations in Brussels.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60118-01_spnew10"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies  (Ogmore)</b> 
 (Lab): May I urge my hon. Friend to note the &#163;19.8 million that has been spent in my constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) under objective 1? Will he note also that this party was initially criticised because nobody thought that we could deliver objective 1, and nobody thought that we would do it this time either, but once again we have proved the Opposition parties completely wrong?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60118-01_spnew11"><b> Nick Ainger: </b> 
 That is absolutely right. At the beginning, we were told that we were not going to get objective 1; we did. Then we were told that we would not get the Treasury backing, and we did. Then we were told that it would not work, and it did&#151;we not only created all those jobs but raised average earnings and addressed our infrastructure. Finally, we were told that because we were being so successful, we would not get objective 1 again, and we must do the deal urgently or we would lose it. The Opposition, particularly Plaid Cymru, were wrong every time. This is a major victory for Wales. We should accept that all the way along, over the past seven years, this Government have delivered objective 1 for Wales.

<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60118-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Intemperate language from an intemperate party that does not represent Wales. The truth is that north and mid-Wales have been doing much better under this Government, with almost 50,000 extra jobs created since 1997, work about to start on a &#163;14.8 million new community hospital in Porthmadog, and a &#163;9.9 million community hospital in Holywell. Whether on health or employment, Labour is delivering for north Wales, and the Tories, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru have consistently failed north Wales.

Will the Secretary of State revisit my constituency to see new companies such as BioCycle Ltd, which has just been set up providing 24 new jobs, and which has won a Green Apple environmental award in 2005?

 I am disappointed by the complacency shown by the Secretary of State and his parliamentary Under-Secretary this morning. Are they not aware that unemployment across Wales has been increasing for 10 consecutive months, in some constituencies by up to 35 per cent.? With Welsh manufacturing output slumping in the past year by 6 per cent. and the Chancellor&#039;s public sector jobs splurge coming to an end, is there not a real danger that much of the excellent progress that we have made on the Welsh job front since 1992 is now starting to unwind?

<br>&nbsp;<br>business start-up rate in any part of the United Kingdom, in which small businesses are booming because of the economic climate that the Government have created, in which unemployment has halved, and in which new opportunities are being created all the time, including the Bluestone holiday project. In Milford Haven, up to 700 construction jobs have been created through the construction of the new liquefied natural gas plant project. Pembrokeshire is booming under Labour; it was failing under the Tories.

 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend recall that, when he and I were first elected to the House in the dark days of Thatcherism, unemployment was our main concern? Now it is not an issue until it is dredged up by the right hon. and hon.   piffle artists on the Benches opposite. It is a matter of celebration that EADS Defence Systems&#151;a great leviathan of an international company&#151;has opened its new factory at Glyndwr House in Newport. It will act as a high-tech magnet to bring many jobs to Newport, Gwent and the rest of Wales.
</p>

 Indeed. The latest jobs announcement is vital. The Newport area is now a magnet for high-tech investment in the defence industry and in other parts of the economy. That goes to prove what my hon. Friend says about Wales succeeding under the Labour Government as it has never succeeded before. There are 118,000 more people in jobs in Wales than when the Tories were last in office.

That is in-work poverty, up sharply from 30 per cent. in the mid-1990s, with 150,00 Welsh people in in-work poverty. Is not poverty in Wales poverty in work or out of it?

 The Ministry of Defence has made it clear that it fully expects to recover its investment in the Red   Dragon project by April 2007.

 I am sure that the Secretary of State for Defence and his team will ensure that the decision is made on merit.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o58"><a name="60118-03_spmin4"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Because if we introduce an ID card scheme and reduce identity fraud, that makes a major difference to the costs of Government and the costs of doing business. In today&#039;s world, if we want to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>tackle illegal migration, crime and identity fraud, using the new biometric technology to have ID cards is an important part of doing so.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o59"><a name="60118-03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b> 
 But we face those problems and threats today; these cards will not come in until 2013. The Prime Minister could use the money to buy 20,000 extra police officers or to have 24-hour security at our ports. Will he accept that almost every Government IT programme has massively overrun? What guarantee can he give that his estimates are right, whereas the London School of Economics, which talks about costs of &#163;14.5 billion&#151;almost half the entire budget of the Department for Education and Skills&#151;is wrong?

<p><a name="st_o60"><a name="60118-03_spmin5"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 First, if the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern is that ID cards will not be introduced quickly enough, he should work with us to ensure that they are introduced more quickly, but that is an absurd reason for not introducing them. As for the calculations made by the LSE, I think that I am right that, although the report was put out under the LSE&#039;s name, it was actually written by the leading campaigner against ID cards on the ground of civil liberties. So I do not think that it is an entirely objective assessment.

<a name="60118-03_para1">
<a name="stpa_o2">The right hon. Gentleman should think again about ID cards, which are an important, indeed, essential way of tackling illegal migration and crime in the early 21st   century. Perhaps I may put it like this: they may be the future, not the past.

 When it comes to who is working with   the Prime Minister, perhaps he could answer the   following question. It has been widely reported that   the Chancellor does not back ID cards and would scrap them, so will the Prime Minister give a guarantee that, when the Chancellor takes over his job, the scheme will be continued?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o62"><a name="60118-03_spmin6"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I certainly can give a guarantee that the Government as a whole are absolutely behind ID cards&#151;the Chancellor himself has provided the start-up costs. Why are ID cards so important now? Because we know, from all the available evidence, that identity fraud is on the increase&#151;that is bound to happen in the modern world. Many people, including the former leader of the Conservative party, reached the conclusion that we need identity cards, and it is right to do that now because the biometric technology is coming in. Other countries are moving towards biometric passports and we will have to do that. The largest part of the cost of an identity card will be the biometric passport, which we must have. I assume that the right hon. Gentleman is in favour of the biometric passport; perhaps he could elucidate that&#151;we know that his policy tends to shift a little quickly nowadays.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-03_para2">
<a name="stpa_o3">We need the identity card to fight crime, illegal migration and identity fraud in the early 21st century and the costs will be largely met by the biometric passport.

<p><a name="st_o64"><a name="60118-03_spmin7"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I totally disagree with him. I apologise for asking policy questions but the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s policies change so quickly&#151;almost on a day-to-day basis&#151;that sometimes it is a good idea to inform myself simply to keep up with where he is at any one time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-03_para3">
<a name="stpa_o4">With the greatest respect, he should think again about the matter. We will have to introduce biometric passports&#151;I know that he agrees with that&#151;and we will therefore have to make enormous changes in the years to come for the vast bulk of people who have passports. Identity fraud is also a major and growing problem. People throughout the world are moving towards identity card systems because they are necessary to tackle the problems of today&#039;s world. Of course there is a cost to identity cards but there is a cost to identity fraud in so many different ways. As the argument progresses, I suspect that he will find himself in the same   position as he has been on rather a lot of policies recently, from the patient&#039;s passport to selection in schools and from the environment to social justice&#151;I   could go on; it is a long list. At the next general election, I suspect that he will be standing on his head on ID cards, as he has done on so many other issues.

Of course, it is important that we introduce Sir   Michael Bichard&#039;s recommendations, and tomorrow my right hon.

Of course, it is important that we make sure that everyone is aware of that. All local authorities are using the antisocial behaviour legislation, but the new powers will allow authorities to evict people from their homes if they are making life an absolute misery for people in their local communities. Despite the fact that some people have described those powers as a gimmick, I think that they will be used and will make an important difference, as is the case with the ability to close down   crack houses and houses used for drug dealing.

On climate change, Government Departments have a target for getting 10 per cent. of their energy from renewable sources?

<p><a name="st_o79"><a name="60118-03_spmin14"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 To be fair, we are being immensely ambitious on renewables. We have placed an obligation on energy suppliers to supply increasing proportions of energy from renewables, which will be worth something like &#163;1 billion to the renewable industry by 2010. In addition, we are providing &#163;500 million over the next few years to help to develop renewable and low-carbon technologies, and we have a target of 10 per cent. renewable generation by 2010 and 20 per cent. by 2020.

The National Audit Office said that the Government policy was not stretching and the Environmental Audit Committee said that it was bizarre and highly unsatisfactory. In advance of next week&#039;s energy review, what is the Prime Minister planning to do about the fact that carbon emissions from Government Departments have gone up and continue to rise?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o81"><a name="60118-03_spmin15"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Of course we want to make sure that Government Departments have stretching targets, which are, indeed, in place, and it is always important to examine how they can be increased. If we are talking about carbon emissions overall, however, that involves not simply Government Departments but the whole country. If we are to reduce carbon emissions, one important way of doing so is the climate change levy, which will save 3.7 million tonnes of carbon by 2010. It   is unfortunate that the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s spokesman said yesterday that his party is still against the climate change levy. I know that the right hon. Gentleman also has a proposal, to which he has committed the Conservative party, for a statutory reduction in carbon emissions every year, monitored by an independent body. I must say to him that he should think through carefully the consequences of that policy, because in some years, for all sorts of reasons, such as the weather, carbon emissions might go up, and he would then have to increase fuel taxes significantly. He   should therefore think through his opposition to us on the climate change levy, which is working, and his support for a policy that I would say is a trifle dodgy, although I understand the motives behind it. If we consider his environmental policy, where it is sensible it is in agreement with the Government&#039;s, and where it is not in agreement with the Government&#039;s, it is not sensible.

I have to say to the Conservatives, who seem to be against this antisocial behaviour legislation, that again, they are completely out of touch with the British people. The fact is that people in local   communities believe that there should be certain rules, that a certain amount of order should apply in   those communities, and that those who consistently fail to show respect and responsibility towards others should be dealt with. Where summary powers such as on-the-spot fines, antisocial behaviour orders, dispersal orders and the ability to evict people who are causing a nuisance in local neighbourhoods are used, they work. They should be used more often, and they should have the support of all Members of this House.

Gentleman will know from his constituency&#151;and, after all, he has a special interest in the matter&#151;that there has been major investment in health care over recent years.

<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60118-04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Alex Salmond  (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. At Question Time, the Prime Minister appeared to give credence to reports, which previously I had thought were stuff and nonsense, on the interception of communications or contacts with MPs. He said he would reflect on the matter. Does not this matter touch on parliamentary privilege? If such interceptions were performed within the precincts of the Commons, would it not be a matter for you to reflect on, as well as the Prime Minister? Will you come back to the House with an opinion on that before the Prime Minister decides to intercept our communications, whether for reasons of terrorism or because of rebellious Labour Back Benchers?
</p>





<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60118-04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman raises an important matter. I will reflect on what he said, and on what the Prime Minister said. The question places a responsibility on my shoulders, as I cannot discuss security matters on the Floor of the House. However, the hon. Gentleman will understand that I take the matter very seriously indeed.

 It is a separate point, Mr. Speaker, of   which I have given your office notice. I seek your advice and guidance in respect of questions tabled by one hon. Member about another hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 844</b>

I have spoken to the hon. Gentleman, who told me that he submitted the question on the instructions of his Whip, but what is your guidance on this matter? Will you also advise me about hon.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60118-04_spnew5"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 In another life, I was a Back Bencher, and I did not listen to the Whips all that often. Perhaps it is best to lead by example in that respect, but I remain a constituency MP and I understand that sensitivity is required in these matters. When an hon. Member asks a question about another constituency, he should contact the relevant Member of Parliament. He might be asking the question for national policy reasons, and I understand that in this case the question was to do with nuclear power. We need to be sensitive about these matters, but that should not deny any Member of Parliament the opportunity to ask a question about something in another hon. Member&#039;s constituency. Every hon.

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60118-04_spnew8"><b> John Robertson  (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab):</b> 
 I beg to move,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide a statutory right to rehabilitation leave for newly disabled people, and for people whose existing impairments have changed; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-04_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">In line with the Government&#039;s welfare to work agenda, the Bill aims to ensure that people who develop a disability during their working lives, or whose existing disability deteriorates, are supported to remain in employment where reasonably practicable. In particular, it provides a statutory right for newly disabled employees to have their employment capacity and support needs properly assessed and addressed, and, in addition, where necessary, to have a period of leave to adapt and undergo rehabilitation and retraining before returning to work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-04_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Let me give an example of the kind of person I want to help. This is an actual case. Michael works for a firm in the electronics testing industry. About six years ago, he started to lose his sight. He wanted to keep working, and his employers valued his skills. RNIB Scotland provided advice on how to reorganise his work and apply the latest technology. The Government&#039;s access to work scheme met most of the costs. Now aged 30, he is still working for the company, in a slightly different job, but still using his IT expertise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-04_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The type of job-retention policy that the Bill deals with is known as rehabilitation leave, or sometimes disability leave. The use of &quot;leave&quot; helps make it clear that the person in question wants to get back to work. It is explicitly identified as an example of reasonable adjustment in the code of practice relating to part 2 of the Disability Discrimination Act. It is also a feature of the Warwick agreement, with which the Government and the trade union movement agree. Rehabilitation leave is, moreover, a tried and tested policy, having been piloted by a number of high-profile private employers in the public sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-04_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">Why, then, is there a need for the Bill, and what difference would its passage make? Quite simply, it is needed for two reasons. First, unemployment among disabled people in this country remains stubbornly and appallingly high. Secondly, it is illogical to support disabled people to get off benefit and into employment&#151;a policy I agree with&#151;while at the same time allowing those in work who develop a disability to join, needlessly, the ranks of the pensioned-off or those on incapacity benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-04_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">Disabled people are almost five times more likely than non-disabled people to be out of work and claiming benefits. The UK&#039;s employment rate among blind and partially sighted people, for example, is a staggering 75 per cent. An estimated 3,000 people additionally join the dole queue each year because they develop a sight problem while still in employment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-04_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Yet so much expert support and equipment is available to assist employees and employers alike, much of it available under existing Government programmes, such as the access to work scheme. The Bill would ensure that employees and employers are supported at the critical time when they need it&#151;namely, at the onset of a disability and while the newly disabled person is still 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 846</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>employed. The alternative, which unnecessarily befalls tens of thousands of newly disabled people each year, is for them to lose their job. That often happens because the employer does not know what support is available or because they have not had much experience of dealing with disabilities among employees and so are understandably fearful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-04_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">When someone is coping with a disability, they need help and support. We must not fail them. To become unemployed in those circumstances is a human and an economic tragedy. It undermines the individual&#039;s confidence, risks skills becoming out of date, and often leads to long periods of unemployment. Many disabled people never return to work. That results in a drain on the state, it burdens pension funds and represents a significant loss of expertise to industry, not to mention the additional recruitment costs for employers to replace staff.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-04_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">Sometimes legislation is needed to ensure that good sense and best practice prevail. The law on wearing seat belts is perhaps a good example. This Bill is both sensible and necessary. None the less, I freely accept that the Government will have to develop some existing schemes, such as access to work, to ensure that at least some of the costs of the employment assessment, and any reasonable adjustment measures required, can be offset by the employer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-04_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">The Government will also need to ensure that state benefits are temporarily payable to those employees who may not receive wages or sick pay from their employer during a period of rehabilitation leave. I   believe that, at relatively little cost, the Government will be able to ensure that any regulatory burden on employers resulting from this Bill is kept to a minimum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-04_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">There will of course be times when the nature of a disability, or of a particular workplace, will mean that it is unreasonable or even impossible to expect that a newly disabled person can remain in their current job, or even be redeployed. Rehabilitation leave is not a job guarantee scheme. The law of reasonableness will still apply. But surely it is sensible to give a newly disabled employee the right to have their circumstances properly assessed and a chance to adjust so that they can continue in employment if possible. Are we not morally honour-bound to help and support the people of this country into employment? My Government have put that at the centre of their policies over the last eight, nearly nine, years. I ask them to continue those policies and take another step forward and support this Bill.

Interestingly, the Government&#039;s paper confirms that the employer representatives on that panel, in essence, support the new clause. They recognised that concern was greatest among small employers and that large employers did not want to introduce direct payment, as it would cause them unnecessary complexity and they would prefer to administer the system themselves. They recognised that there would be benefits for some small employers. The paper and common sense suggest that the benefits would be felt most by employers who still use manual payroll systems, where the process for making payments is more time-consuming than in an automated system.

 The paper refers to a total net benefit of &#163;1.1 million. The figure for small employers, defined by the national insurance contribution threshold of &#163;45,000 a year, would be about &#163;400,000 a year, but the benefit would be focused on employers whose costs are much greater than average&#151;those who decide that it is in their interests to transfer the administration to the Government, presumably because they have manual systems that they judge will take too much time to administer themselves. So the paper nowhere identifies how much that would benefit those employers whom the new clause would help.

 What estimate can the hon. Gentleman give of the number of   employers who would wish to transfer their responsibilities in the way that is suggested in the new clause?
</p>





<p><a name="st_24"><a name="60118-05_spnew3"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 I cannot give an estimate of the number, and it is not necessary to do so to make the case. The HMRC document confirms the fact that the employers&#039; representatives on the Government&#039;s consultation panel advocated a system that would allow the right to transfer responsibility to the Government to   be focused particularly on small employers. In essence, the new clause builds on the case put by the employers&#039; representatives on the Government&#039;s panel and recognises the fact that large employers see no benefit in the proposed system. They are left out of the equation. The focus is simply on those employers who would benefit by transferring the system to the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-05_para6">
<a name="stpa_17">According to the HMRC paper, small employers said that they would benefit. The paper also correctly recognises that every employer is different&#151;employers have different payroll methods&#151;so rather than simply seeking to transfer the responsibility for all payments to the Government, the new clause would give employees the power to decide whether they want to take advantage of the right. Under the new clause, we seek to recognise the facts that are set out in the HMRC document by excluding large employers, who would not benefit, from the right to transfer.

<a name="60118-05_para7">
<a name="stpa_18">The paper also confirms that approximately 40,000 women employed by small employers&#151;those employers who make national insurance contributions of up to &#163;45,000 per annum&#151;are in receipt of statutory maternity pay. I cannot begin to estimate the cost of the Government employing an administration to operate on the opt-in principle dealt with in the new clause, but if we are talking about a total of 40,000 women and only a proportion of their employers choose to transfer, I can imagine that the size of the unit that would be required to administer the system for the Government could be

<a name="stpa_19">I have already dealt with the net savings, but I want to say a word about whether we can rely on the figures set out in the Government&#039;s paper. We all accept that any regulatory impact assessment is inevitably only an estimate, because it considers what would happen in the future. There must inevitably be doubt about how accurate those estimates are likely to be in practice. The concern of many in the small business community is that the paper underestimates the time taken to administer those arrangements, particularly by small employers who operate manual systems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-05_para9">
<a name="stpa_20">The paper obviously considers average times for employers, but the new clause focuses on those small employers with manual systems who are trying to cope with everything, who do not have a director dedicated to   dealing with payroll and staff issues and where a one-man or one-woman operation is trying to keep the whole show on the road, as well as dealing with all this. In those cases, learning and understanding what is involved in the payment of maternity or paternity pay, when the employer may not have had someone in that situation for some years, is a time-consuming operation. It is very easy to underestimate the burden that that imposes on employers. If that burden can be lifted and transferred to the Government&#151;as they clearly envisage would be appropriate, provided that the costs are not too high&#151;it seems right to do so.

 Does my hon.

</p>





<p><a name="st_32"><a name="60118-06_spnew7"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 Yes. A very limited benefit will apply to only the very smallest employers. As my hon. Friend rightly says, many employers in the category caught by the new clause, who would benefit from the right to transfer responsibility back to the Government, will get no assistance in covering NI contributions and only 92 per cent. of statutory maternity pay back from the Government. If the Government are not prepared to go down the route that we suggest, they should consider whether they are prepared to increase the percentage repaid to employers.

<a name="stpa_21">I am not sure whether HMRC&#039;s assessment adequately takes into account the cash-flow benefits for small employers in not having to make the payment in the first place.

If the responsibility were transferred to the Government, those payments would not come from small employers&#039; systems at all. I am not sure of the repayment time at the moment&#151;it would be helpful if the Minister could confirm it&#151;but a cash-flow burden is imposed on businesses for the period that the money is   out of their systems. Those businesses would be assisted if the Government took over responsibility for making the payments. I do not think that the assessment made by HMRC adequately takes that into account.

<a name="stpa_22">HMRC&#039;s calculation takes account of the fact that many employers have complex remuneration packages because of pension contributions and so on.

However, the Government do not understand that the voluminous guidance that comes out of the Department of Trade and Industry in itself puts an administrative and regulatory burden on employers.

<br>&nbsp;<br>would thus be easier for small businesses to concentrate on the matter on which they should concentrate: in a nutshell, making money. Time is money for a small business person. If employers have to spend more time than is necessary on administrative matters, they are, by definition, spending less time on running the business and making a profit. If a business makes a profit, it allows more jobs to be created and, perhaps, the payment of bonuses to employees. It is in everyone&#039;s interest that businesses run efficiently and well. The days of employers taking everything out of a business and employees putting in all the effort are gone&#151;well, we hope that it does not happen any more, at least in 99 per cent. of cases.

What happens to small businesses thus has a knock-on effect on most employees. If employers spend too much time on administration, their businesses suffer and become less profitable, which might mean that they have to make employees redundant, or not take on more employees. A successful business will create employment and provide better conditions for employees, and a business is more likely to be successful if the administrative burden is removed from it.

Yet the cost to Government, the Minister told us, of doing exactly the same would be &#163;75 million in start-up costs and &#163;15 million annually.

This is my son&#039;s first week at real school, and I am trying to take him there in the morning and pick him up in the afternoon, although I will not be there this afternoon. We are fortunate. We have great flexibility in our hours here&#151;they are long hours but they are quite flexible. If we have that privilege, so should as many other employees in the country as possible.

The hon. Member for North Norfolk made the cash-flow point very well. Instead of a very simple arrangement between employer and employee for the   payment of wages, tax and national insurance, the situation becomes much more complicated, and it all takes time. As I said before, to an employer or small business man, time is money.

 It is not just a question of who pays; it is a question of who administers the regulations. The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood my point.

<a name="stpa_35">The Minister must realise that we are not just talking about tax regulation and maternity and paternity pay. Every business is subject to regulations from many other agencies as well. The cumulative effect of all these regulations, and the amount of time that anyone running a business has to spend dealing with them, will have an impact on that business. In my own case, there 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>were masses of regulations that had built up from the Law Society of Scotland and the Financial Services Authority. Eventually, we decided that it was not worth the candle to go through all that, and that it would be better to junk our financial services business altogether because of the amount of regulation involved. There were good reasons for those regulations, because of what had happened in the financial services industry, but they became a huge burden for small businesses, which were doing their best to provide a service in small-town areas. The time spent dealing with those regulations impacts on a business, because it eats into the time that can be spent doing other things, such as spending time with the family.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_36">A particular difficulty with these regulations could be the complexity of the interaction between the times when a mother and a father take their maternity and paternity leave. There could be difficulties with dealing with the statutory pay involved. That is another reason for considering ways of making it easier for small businesses to deal with these regulations, because they could get into difficulties if both parents were not working for the same employer. There would have to be interaction between the employers involved, as well as the Inland Revenue, and that could present problems. Transferring the obligation to the Revenue might provide a way round that, but there could still be an inherent difficulty if one party were with the Revenue and the other were not.
</p>





<p><a name="st_47"><a name="60118-08_spnew1"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is describing the reason why we want to consult on how to deal with the   additional paternity leave. We shall do that, and we shall have discussions with small businesses about the issue. I am concerned that the hon. Gentleman seems to be talking about regulation in general, rather than the direct payments proposed in the Bill. Does he consider a benefit of &#163;400,000, following an investment of &#163;38 million, to represent value for money for the taxpayer?
</p>





<p><a name="st_48"><a name="60118-08_spnew2"><b> Mr. Weir: </b> 
 If the figures are correct, it would not appear to do so. I must echo what the hon. Member for Epping Forest said earlier: the figures seem incredible for what I would have thought to be a relatively simple operation. The Minister says that I am not talking about the specific measures in the Bill, but we cannot divorce those measures from the impact that other regulations have on small businesses. They have a cumulative effect. This might only be a small regulation that we are passing&#151;although it is an important one&#151;but it will be yet another regulation on top of all the other regulations that businesses have to deal with.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_37">I accept that there is a need for many of these regulations in the modern world. I do not subscribe to the theory that we should just throw all regulations out of the window. We have to have regulations, but they must be minimised, and we must do everything that we can in that regard when imposing new laws for the social good. The Bill will be for the social good of families, but we must also minimise its impact on business and on those families who run businesses. There could be other ways of achieving that. In my experience, many small businesses now outsource their PAYE and other tax 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 858</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>work to local accountants because of the increasing complexity of the work involved. However, there is a cost involved in doing that. The more the accountant has to do, the greater the cost will be. Many small businesses are already struggling to make a living&#151;there is a pretty hard business environment in some areas&#151;and they would not be able to bear such costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_38">I am inclined to support new clause 1. I appreciate that the Minister is going to consult on the provision, but this might not be the best way of dealing with the issue. We must find a way of minimising the impact on small business of these very good policies.

<p><a name="st_49"><a name="60118-08_spnew3"><b> Mr. Stewart Jackson: </b> 
 When speaking in this place, it is always a good rule of thumb to speak about something that one is vaguely acquainted with. That is a personal credo which is not always followed by other Members, but I hope to follow it today, as in a previous life I was a business adviser with Business Link. I well remember the days when I would trudge round Europe&#039;s   largest industrial estate at Park Royal. As I   would knock on the door and go into those very small micro-businesses, some with fewer than five staff and many with fewer than a dozen staff, the most dread words that I could say were, &quot;I&#039;m from the Government and I&#039;m here to help your business.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_39">That was rather unfair, and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the sterling work done by Business Link. It does an excellent job. It is important to recognise the struggle that small businesses face every day to make ends meet. The points about cash flow made by the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) and my   hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mrs.   Laing) are well made. Whether by the British Chambers of Commerce, the Institute of Directors or the CBI, much comment has been made about the speed and quantity of regulations coming from Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_40">I should like to explain in a wider context why I   support the Bill from a political as well as a personal point of view. To be slightly partisan, I resent the implication that the Labour party&#151;the Government&#151;has a monopoly on concern for working people and on care about work-life balance, that amorphous group of policies dealing with quality of life issues. That is not true. My party should not be pigeon-holed as a party that is not progressive, that is not modern, and that is unwilling to look at Britain as it is today, rather than as it was. I strongly support the views of my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) in that respect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-08_para7">
<a name="stpa_41">Similarly, I am not speaking today as a mouthpiece of big business. To me, big business has good parts and bad parts. The bad parts are supermarkets and banks, which are my own bugbear. But that is not free enterprise and competition. Free enterprise and competition is the invisible hand of Adam Smith, which my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest no doubt invoked when speaking about her father, a good Fife man.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-08_para8">
<a name="stpa_42">We care about working families and we welcome the Bill because we think that in general it will be successful, it will make an impact and it will help with aspects such as bonding between parents, quality time, and nurturing and protecting family life. I say that not because I am some wishy-washy Liberal, although they are in the

<br>&nbsp;<br>news this week, but because that is good, practical, economic common sense. I reiterate the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest that small business people have families too and they want quality time. If they have mortgaged their house or remortgaged their business and gone cap in hand to the bank, their right to have a family life is important too. We should do everything we can to mitigate the pressures on them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-08_para9">
<a name="stpa_43">I turn to the issue of paternity pay. In Committee the hon. Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher) was offended by the fact that men are paid more than women and consequently that paternity pay was an issue. That is a   fact of life. There are cultural issues involved in the non-take-up of paternity rights. Men are often at a higher level in the hierarchy and are better paid than women, and they perceive that their careers will be damaged if they take paternity pay and avail themselves of paternity rights.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-08_para10">
<a name="stpa_44">I referred earlier to the dichotomy in the Government&#039;s position, and I sense a slight weakening in resolve on the Minister&#039;s part with regard to new clause 1. The Government are effectively saying, &quot;We are going ahead with paternity rights. We want more men to have that work-life balance, but there are not many of them, so don&#039;t worry about it.&quot; If that is the case, the Government should consider new clause 1 with an open mind.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-08_para11">
<a name="stpa_45">We should be careful about the amount and proximity of regulations coming through to small businesses. There is both anecdotal and empirical evidence suggesting that we should not inadvertently bring about discrimination. If a business is struggling at the margin, business people will look at the legislation coming through and make a judgment about the impact that it will have on them. If the future of the business is a matter of life or death, they may well decide that they do not want to employ a young woman of childbearing age or a younger man. That is discrimination. I make no excuse for it, but if the Government are not sensitive to that degree of regulation and the burden that it places on businesses, they will find that the people they most wish to help&#151;young families, mums and dads who have to work to pay the mortgage and meet the costs&#151;will be discriminated against.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-08_para12">
<a name="stpa_46">I am concerned particularly about paternity rights because I am unsure about the figures. Are they based on social studies, demography or statistics compiled centrally by the Department of Trade and Industry? I   am not clear how straightforward and transparent the figures are and what impact they will have on small and medium-sized enterprises. For instance, the indicative estimates of the cost of paternity pay are anywhere between 12 and 21 per cent. That is potentially an 80 per cent. overrun. For the right to request flexible hours, the indicative cost is anywhere between just under &#163;30 million and &#163;120 million, which is a pretty substantial difference. That is a concern to me. One might say flippantly that the figures could have been prepared by the architects of the Scottish Parliament, but I would not go that far.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-08_para13">
<a name="stpa_47">The issue is balance, as my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest said. We must get the balance right. We all care about making sure that the economy is improved, that businesses grow, and that families are not put under stress to the extent that they disintegrate 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 860</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>as a result of getting the work-life balance wrong. None of us wants that. Given that 97 per cent. of the UK&#039;s gross domestic product is generated by small businesses, many of which are micro-businesses and innovative businesses, we must not throw the baby out with the bathwater or crack the golden egg. No more similes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-08_para14">
<a name="stpa_48">I broadly support the Bill. My experience as a business adviser is that where they can, people who run businesses will do their best to comply with regulations if they think they are fair and if they think others are complying with them. If they think the regulations are   unfair and that the Government are not listening to them or their representative organisations, they will avoid them, the scheme will not work, and ultimately the Government will not achieve their aims. With that, I   give the Bill a broad welcome. I hope that when the Minister speaks later, he will address the concerns that I raised today.

<p><a name="st_50"><a name="60118-09_spnew0"><b> Mr. Alan Reid: </b> 
 The Bill is important and I welcome the rights that it extends to working families, particularly the rights that relate to the clause, concerning maternity, paternity and adoption pay. However, there is a downside to the Bill, as other hon. Members have pointed out&#151;the extra burden of administration that it will place on employers, especially the owners of small businesses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_49">I shall quote from a document that I am sure the Minister is familiar with, the 2005 Labour party manifesto. It states on page 77:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;We will therefore increase paid maternity leave to nine months from 2007&#151;worth an extra &#163;1,400&#151;with the goal of achieving a year&#039;s paid leave by the end of the Parliament while simplifying the system for employers.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="st_52"><a name="60118-09_spnew2"><b> Mr. Reid: </b> 
 My hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) is correct. The Government made a commitment to simplify the system for employers, but it seems to consist of a CD-ROM and a do-it-yourself guide. That is not simplifying the system for employers and that is not what employers read into the Labour party manifesto.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_50">I hope that the Government accept new clause 1, because we are trying to assist them in implementing their manifesto. New clause 1 would transfer responsibility for the administration of payments for maternity, adoption and paternity pay from a person&#039;s employer to Revenue and Customs. The procedures involved are complicated, and they will become even more complicated with the introduction of additional paternity pay, because in most cases parents work for different employers, which introduces an extra level of complexity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_51">The Government have referred to a cost-benefit analysis produced by HM Revenue and Customs, which claims to show a minimal benefit. However, that cost-benefit analysis considers only statutory maternity pay and does not attempt to examine issues such as adoption pay or paternity pay. Many small business owners challenge the assumptions in the cost-benefit analysis&#151;in particular, they take issue with the time that the report assumes that it will take them to perform the necessary tasks. Employers who have examined the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 861</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>report say that it will take them far longer to carry out those tasks than the analysts from Revenue and Customs suggest. It is questionable whether the savings to employers set out by Revenue and Customs will accrue from the transfer of direct payments, and it is also questionable whether the benefits to employers will be as low as the report suggests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-09_para3">
<a name="stpa_52">We need to take account of the great burden on small employers who come across new working procedures for the first time. A big employer with large human resources and IT departments will handle the new processes easily, but a small employer who is faced with working out additional paternity pay for the first time will find that it takes a great deal of time, even with the help of the Government&#039;s CD-ROM and do-it-yourself guide. As hon. Members have said, that time is often late at night, and if the employer tries to deal with the matter during the day, it distracts them from trying to grow their business and create jobs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-09_para4">
<a name="stpa_53">New clause 1 states that companies with fewer than 50 employees should be given the choice between running that part of the payroll themselves or transferring it to HM Revenue and Customs, which should be able to run such procedures more easily given the benefits of scale. That would compensate small employers&#151;the Government are giving small employers more work by introducing new rights for workers, and they should help them by taking on that part of the administration. It is vital that we free up small employers to enable them to grow their businesses, and we can do so by giving them a choice on the burden of administration.

<p>
<a name="60118-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_55">The Minister should ask himself two important questions before he asks the House to reject the new clause. The first question has partially emerged in the debate: what has become of the Prime Minister&#039;s policy, which is very good, that a regulation should be struck off for every new one that is imposed? No equal and opposite regulation is being struck off to balance today&#039;s sizeable one.

Indeed, a Minister suggested the beginnings of one such idea in an overnight briefing to the papers, and perhaps the House will have the courtesy of being told whether it is true&#151;it would be nice to feel that as a Member of Parliament, one is sometimes the first to hear such things rather than the last.

<p>
<a name="60118-09_para8">
<a name="stpa_57">We have identified plenty of regulations that could be struck off to add to the good workings of the British economy and reduce the burden on people and businesses, but they fall outside the scope of the debate on new clause 1. One sometimes wonders whether Ministers belong to the same Government as the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has made some extremely good speeches, such as his speech on deregulation, but the opposite of what he has said is happening day by day. As has been said, this provision is a good example of something happening in exactly the opposite direction from that set out by the Prime Minister and without the action to balance the situation enjoined by him. My hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest has made it clear that she supports the proposal, but on the condition that offsetting deregulation, which has not been introduced, takes place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-09_para9">
<a name="stpa_58">The second question about which the Minister should think more carefully concerns cost. It is unsatisfactory that we should debate such an important measure with no credible figures from the Government, and I find it unbelievable that we are discussing a cost of only &#163;400,000. If we examine the Government&#039;s assessment of the impact of the legislation, the gross figure for the regulatory impact of the legislation is cited as &#163;575 million a year, if one adds up the highest estimates. The Government say that there could be offsets of &#163;209 million a year against that figure&#151;&#163;196 million of   those offsets are extremely optimistic, but let us give them to the Government. In short, according to the Government&#039;s own regulatory impact assessment, we are discussing about &#163;400 million of extra cost.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-09_para10">
<a name="stpa_59">We are being asked to believe that the important part of the cost imposed on small businesses will amount to some &#163;400,000, so it is not worth exempting small business&#151;although it will cost the Government a mind-blowing &#163;39 million to deal with the problem, it will save small businesses only &#163;400,000. I know that anything that this Government run is considerably less well run than it would be in the private sector&#151;productivity is a far bigger problem in the public sector than the private sector&#151;but it is difficult to believe that they are so monumentally incompetent that they would spend &#163;39 million to save &#163;400,000 a year. I put it to the Minister that the truth of the position is that a bigger element of the &#163;575 million that the Government have identified will be attributable to small business, and that it would therefore be a useful saving for small businesses in implementing the measure to transfer the work burden from them to the Treasury in cases in which small businesses would like that to happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-09_para11">
<a name="stpa_60">I understand that my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest and other hon. Friends have in mind an opt-in system, which means that if by any chance the Government are right and there are no real costs to the   measure for small businesses, those small businesses would be happy to administer the measure themselves and the Treasury would not be troubled. However, I   suspect that the measure will involve substantial cost. It would be a very good idea for small businesses for the Treasury to do the work, if we discover that the cost estimates are far from adequate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-09_para12">
<a name="stpa_61">It is fundamental that a Government who claim to believe in deregulation should set out accurate and detailed costings that have weight and carry credibility 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 863</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>both with this House and with those outside who are interested in such matters. This is yet another example in which the regulatory impact assessment is on the whole vague and incredible. Where the regulatory impact assessment is specific, it comes up with some very large numbers, which the Government have passed by and cannot explain. We should not ignore the &#163;390 million cost which the regulatory impact assessment states that the Government must pay, which means that the total cost of the measure taking the Government cost and the net private sector cost in the RIA will be around &#163;800 million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-09_para13">
<a name="stpa_62">The Government must remember that they have no money of their own. They have only the money that they collect from us as individuals and from the business community, so the &#163;390 million of so-called Government cost is also a cost on business and individuals who work for those businesses, just as much as the &#163;400 million cost is a direct charge on the private sector.

<p><a name="st_54"><a name="60118-10_spnew0"><b> Mr. Prisk: </b> 
 It is a pleasure to follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), who, like every other speaker in the debate, supported new clause 1. I trust that the Minister will make it a full house and I look forward to his contribution on that basis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_64">New clause 1 is an eminently sensible provision. I do not often associate the Prime Minister with being eminently sensible, but it follows his original idea last year of a one-in, one-out approach to regulation, to which hon. Members have referred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_65">The background to the new clause is crucial. The administrative costs of the regulatory burden are especially important to the smaller employer. All hon.   Members recognise that, for a smaller business, the costs are disproportionate to any perceived benefits. Conservative Members support the principle of the Bill, which aims to get the right balance between work and families. That is not questioned. The debate is about how to strike the balance and why the Government&#039;s original promise that they would seek to cover the administrative costs aspect of the deal has changed. That is at the heart of the new clause.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_66">The administrative burden is already becoming difficult for small businesses to bear. The Federation of Small Businesses has highlighted the fact that each small business has to put aside an average of 28 hours a month to comply with Government information requirements and regulations. Given that, according to Government figures&#151;we shall trust them for the purpose of this exercise&#151;there are some 4 million small businesses, that is bad not only for the individual enterprise but for the productivity of the United Kingdom&#039;s economy. It cannot be right that so much time is spent on dealing with Government requirements and not on generating wealth.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_67">Let us imagine what those businesses could achieve without losing that time. They could spend it generating prosperity and especially in employing new people or to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 864</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>generate new products and services. As the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir) highlighted, that time is also lost to the families of those who run small businesses. If we are to be fair and balanced in ensuring that we help families, we cannot ignore the rights of the self-employed mother and father.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_68">The payroll burden is of especial concern to smaller businesses. Other hon. Members dealt with the administrative burden, so I shall not allude to it in detail. However, there is also the difficulty in a small family business of employers, who may know their staff well, having to ask the difficult questions about relationships that are essential if they are to run a payroll system properly. That is often ignored and overlooked. My    hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Mr.   Jackson) eloquently highlighted that we must not forget that those who run small businesses have families. That is a key point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_69">Let us consider new clause 1 and why I support it. I   hope that the Minister can provide some thorough replies to my questions. First, I believe that the burden should be lifted on a quid pro quo basis. Is it no longer the principle that one regulation should be removed for another? The new clause would achieve that and I am therefore interested in the Minister&#039;s reply to that question.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_70">Secondly, the point has been made, especially by the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), about cash flow. As politicians, we often assume that the most important monetary aspect of a business is profit, and we are wrong. The most important aspect for small businesses is often cash flow. If cash flow is negative, sooner or later, there will be no small business. That point is often forgotten, so I want to stress it. A direct payment scheme will free up significant cash flow in small businesses and may be the one thing that prevents them from going out of business. I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_71">Thirdly, let us consider the controversy about costs. To refresh my memory, I read what the Minister told us in Committee. For the benefit of hon. Members who did not serve on the Committee, I shall quote him. He said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;I said that the costs of the direct payment scheme were estimated to be up to &#163;75 million in set-up costs and &#163;50 million in annual running costs . . . the benefits for employers were estimated to be around &#163;1 million per year, of which only &#163;400,000 would accrue to small employers.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 13 December 2005; c. 52.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>

 That reaffirms my concern because of the difference between an apparent benefit of &#163;1 million to employers, who can clearly run the scheme for that sum, and &#163;50 million, which the Government have to spend on running it instead. Even if we put aside the &#163;75 million of set-up costs, we are still considering an extraordinary difference in efficiency. As my right hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>enormous amount about either the extraordinary efficiency of the private sector and why we should support it or the extraordinary inefficiency of the Government. Or perhaps it tells us something else: that the Government do not wish to engage in the process, are embarrassed by the promise that they appear to have made and therefore accentuate a difference that is not quite what the Minister claims.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_73">I am interested in the Minister&#039;s explanation of the illogic of a position whereby one organisation can spend &#163;50 million on administering something that many other organisations, which, one would assume, would be a little less efficient because there are many of them, can do for only &#163;1 million. That is illogical and I hope that the Minister can enlighten us about that in his usual fashion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-10_para10">
<a name="stpa_74">My final point, which is of especial concern to business representatives, is to ask why the Government have reneged on what businesses regard as a promise. In all my talks with various business organisations&#151;the Forum of Private Business, the Federation of Small Businesses or the CBI&#151;they were crystal clear months ago about the fact that they had an agreement with the Government. Their phraseology was that the Bill was &quot;part of a package&quot; and they were willing to support it on that basis. They have changed their position because it appears that the package is no longer available. They perceive that the Government have reneged on it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-10_para11">
<a name="stpa_75">We have seen what was written in the Labour party manifesto. Business has been given some assurances and now we find a different settlement. When the Minister responds, will he tell us exactly what he or the Secretary of State agreed with business representatives, especially the CBI, so that we can better understand why they feel so aggrieved?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-10_para12">
<a name="stpa_76">Fairness is at the heart of the new clause, which tries to ensure that we can allow families who work for small businesses to have a sensible balance in their lives, with the quid pro quo of ensuring that the smallest businesses that are run by people who have families can have some of the burden lifted. People in business believed that the Government were making that promise. The purpose of the new clause is to fulfil it.

 I thank the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) for tabling new clause 1.

Those views were emphasised by the CBI, which wrote to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State just before Christmas withdrawing its support for the Bill because the direct payment issue had not been resolved to its satisfaction. Understandably, a number of Opposition Members spoke in support of the new clause today, but in raising the issue of regulation in general, as the right hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_80">The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) said that it was a question of balance. I agree. We must consider what provides value for the money for the taxpayer when administering the system. We made it clear at the outset that we are committed to delivering the work and families legislation in a way that strikes the right balance between the needs of children, families and employers. We looked at a range of issues that affect employees and employers. At the time of the 2004 pre-Budget report, we made a commitment to consider the possibility of direct payments as a way of easing the administration of leave and pay. After careful consideration, we concluded that the scheme would be out of proportion to the benefits accruing, representing neither good value for money for the taxpayer nor a significant saving for employers. Hon. Members asked about costs and it was estimated that set-up costs would be up to &#163;75 million with annual running costs of &#163;50 million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_81">Those costs should be contrasted with an estimated net benefit for employers of about only &#163;1 million a year. A figure of &#163;38 million was mentioned, but if we accepted new clause 1, which applies to employers with 50 employees or fewer, HMRC&#039;s analysis would be relevant. I accept that hon. Members wish to question the figures as they try to make their case, but those figures were widely available. In the CBI response, no one questioned the figures or the detail, nor did they offer alternative figures to explain why the direct payment scheme would work. There would not be any net benefit for the taxpayer or, indeed, small businesses. As for the cost to business of the whole Bill, the majority of costs fall on the Government, as the Treasury reimburses business for statutory maternity, adoption and paternity pay at 92 per cent. for large businesses and at 104.5 per cent. for smaller businesses. As the right hon. Member for Wokingham said, that is worth about &#163;390 million a year. Small businesses will bear only a small proportion of the costs of the Bill. For example, of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 867</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the &#163;29 million to &#163;43 million net cost to business of extending maternity and adoption pay, small businesses will pay only &#163;1 million to &#163;8 million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_82">We have taken the problems for small businesses into account. I do not think that there are differences between us on whether the self-employed or small businesses are affected, but we must achieve the right balance. We are not starting from scratch, as we already have statutory maternity and paternity pay. The principle of the Bill has been accepted by all parties. I   raised an article in today&#039;s <i>Financial Times</i> with the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing). I accept that she has not had time to read it, but it suggests that the Opposition have changed their view on paternity leave and fathers taking time off when their child is born. In earlier debates, however, she backed what we are trying to achieve.
</p>





<p><a name="st_60"><a name="60118-11_spnew1"><b> Mrs. Laing: </b> 
 May I reiterate that, whatever impression has been given, we support the basic principle of the Bill? Fathers should be allowed to take time off when their children are born.

 I accept that the hon. Lady is sincere and I accept the view of the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) that the Labour party does not have a monopoly when it comes to political parties caring about employees and working conditions. The proof of the pudding, however, is the action that is taken. The Opposition talk about attacking business where necessary, but the article gives the impression that, in this instance, paternity leave may not be appropriate.
</p>





<p><a name="st_62"><a name="60118-11_spnew3"><b> Mr. Prisk: </b> 
 The Minister says that the proof is in actions, not words, but the business community clearly understood that there was a one-for-one package. Why, therefore, did the Minister not back his words with actions?
</p>





<p><a name="st_63"><a name="60118-11_spnew4"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b>

 The hon. Gentleman may attack the CD-ROM proposal, but we have regular meetings with small businesses to look at what can be done. We have set up Employee Direct, particularly for small businesses, to see what can be done about the burden of regulation and to try to make sure that we ease it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_83">In the context of direct payments, much has been made of the cost of such payments. In its response, the CBI attacked us, saying that we were trying to hide the   figures. That is the not the case&#151;the figures are on   the website and have been placed in the Library. HMRC took a great deal of advice from a specially convened advisory group of payroll experts who were representatives of both large and small employers, payroll bureaux and software developers. HMRC&#039;s own analysts also carried out extensive analysis that was published on its website when the 2005 pre-Budget report was published.

<p><a name="st_66"><a name="60118-11_spnew7"><b> Mr. Nigel Dodds  (Belfast, North) (DUP):</b> 
 Given the doubts expressed today about the costs and the burden on small businesses in particular, can the Minister give the House an assurance that if the new clause is not accepted&#151;I sincerely hope that it will be&#151;he will keep the matter under review? If the costs are much greater to small businesses, will he look at the provisions in new clause 1 again and revisit the matter?
</p>





<p><a name="st_67"><a name="60118-11_spnew8"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 I am happy to give the House an assurance. The Government do not think that the direct payment scheme, given the cost both of setting it up and   of its administration, is appropriate. However, regulations will flow from the Bill and we will have to consult with small businesses on regulations on additional paternity leave and so on. The hon. Member for North Norfolk rightly pointed out that the figure of 104 per cent. related to the national insurance contribution. We will consider whether we need to change the position as to who can access the 104 per cent. We will also consider how we can further relieve the burden on small businesses, but I do not want the House to run away with the view, which understandably comes from the Opposition, that because we are not providing direct payments, we are not prepared to consider the burdens on businesses, particularly small businesses. In the context of the Bill, I have tried to outline where the burden on small business lies.
</p>





<p><a name="st_68"><a name="60118-11_spnew9"><b> Mr. Prisk: </b> 
 Is not the Minister embarrassed that what would cost &#163;1 million if run by business will, it appears, cost &#163;50 million if his Department runs it? Is not that an embarrassing statement in terms of the protection that he and his colleagues are meant to provide to the public purse?
</p>





<p><a name="st_69"><a name="60118-11_spnew10"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 No, I am not embarrassed, but I understand why the hon. Gentleman is trying to distort&#151;that might be too strong a word&#151;the position. The effect on certain small businesses that have written payrolls rather than more technologically developed ones is complex, and that has been included in our calculations.
</p>





<p><a name="st_70"><a name="60118-11_spnew11"><b> Mrs. Laing: </b> 
 If we accept the Minister&#039;s calculation of what the provision would cost the Government or the taxpayer to administer, will he accept that &#163;400,000 is not a realistic figure to put on the cost to small businesses? It is not just a question of how many stamps are required and how many letters they post but of the time and the additional burden involved. Surely the overall cost for small businesses must be far greater than &#163;400,000.
</p>





<p><a name="st_71"><a name="60118-11_spnew12"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 I am prepared to accept the word of the payroll experts and the experts at Revenue and Customs who have come up with those figures. The time involved in administration is incorporated in those figures.
</p>

I therefore hope that Members will allow me a little time to explain why the Government believe that the actuality of a direct payment scheme, as well as the burden of costs, would not benefit employers.
</p>





<p><a name="st_72"><a name="60118-11_spnew13"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 Does the Minister accept that, even though there are some new burdens in passing information over, even the Government&#039;s regulatory impact assessment accepts that those are less than the saving that would be made?

<p><a name="st_73"><a name="60118-11_spnew14"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 I fear that, however eloquently I try to explain the position in relation to direct payments, Opposition Members have already made their minds up.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_86">A direct payment scheme would add new responsibilities for employers. Because statutory maternity pay and other payments listed in the new clause are wage replacements, which are subject to the full range of payroll deductions and paid net, direct payment would mean Revenue and Customs becoming a temporary payroller for SMP and other statutory payments to employees of potentially any employer in the country, taking off the full range of payroll deductions. Employers would not, however, lose all their current tasks and responsibilities in relation to those payments. For example, they would remain responsible for making earnings-based contributions such as employers&#039; national insurance contributions and employers&#039; contributions to occupational pension schemes. They would also continue to be responsible for completing periodical returns such as the employer&#039;s annual return. Many employers also provide occupational maternity and paternity pay on top of the   statutory minimum, which is something that the Government welcome. Handing responsibility for statutory payments to the Government would still leave such employers with the responsibility of making those occupational payments, in addition to having to pass on new information to Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs.

<a name="stpa_87">For a direct payment scheme to work properly for both employers and Revenue and Customs, a potentially complex two-way information exchange would be necessary, which, as I have pointed out, would impose new burdens on employers. HMRC would require detailed information to be provided by employers to high standards of accuracy and to tight time limits in order to take on that function, and employers would still need information from HMRC to fulfil their obligations and to take back the payroll at the end of the direct payment period.

That is based on the regulatory impact assessment. I   support the RIA process in principle, but we need to be clear about the severe limitations imposed by the way in which such assessments are conducted. They tend to   be self-serving, in that they are prepared by the Departments that seek to benefit from them. Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs obviously does not want an additional responsibility, so self-interest is involved in the delivery of an assessment that is discouraging from the point of view of employers.

That simply does not make sense.

<a name="stpa_99">My point is that we Members are compensated for the cost of having a member of staff on maternity leave. The cost of replacement staff is paid by the Fees Office.

<a name="stpa_100">If the Minister is intent on rejecting the new clause, we will press it to a vote, but in any event I urge him to look again at the percentage repayment. As he has conceded, the 104.5 per cent. for small businesses does not compensate them for the administrative burden. When

 Has not the Minister demonstrated that the Government simply do not understand how small businesses work? It seems that they are about to reject a new clause that has the support of everyone else in the House.

 One does get that impression. The only Member to speak against the new clause was the Minister. He was on his own: not a single member of his party supported what he was trying to do.

<p><a name="st_94"><a name="60118-14_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Laing: </b> 
 I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_104">New clause 3 might appear somewhat opaque, but it would require clauses 3 to 10 to be reviewed after one year. We touched on some of the issues in our debate on new clause 1, but this proposal deals specifically with additional paternity leave and additional statutory paternity pay.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_105">The Bill goes much further than the Government&#039;s original proposals, which suggested that mothers&#039; rights to maternity leave and maternity pay would be transferred to fathers. In effect, it creates new rights for fathers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_106">We are not against paternity pay in principle. We accept that it is good for families if new fathers can be with their babies in the months after they are born. It is especially important for working mothers to have the support of fathers when a child is very small. That is a crucial time, and the Government&#039;s proposals are absolutely right in principle but, as ever, the question is one of balance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_107">As I said in the debate on new clause 1, it is very important to balance the needs and rights of employers, and especially small employers, with those of employees. Only by striking the right balance will we be able to achieve the optimum result for the economy and for society. It is true, of course, that a work force that is treated well will be more efficient, and that employers who treat employees reasonably will get better employees and run better businesses.

Were the monetary costs involved estimated at a ball-park figure of between &#163;500,000 and &#163;2 million, it would be reasonable to accept them, and we should do so happily enough.

</p>





<p><a name="st_98"><a name="60118-14_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Laing: </b> 
 I see what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but I would say that we need not so much a level playing field as to try to make all employers do what good ones already do. We had an excellent debate in Committee on paternity leave, and I am sorry to see so few members of the Committee here, although there are some&#151;notably the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan) and my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mr.   Walker). Examples were given of times when men had found an excuse to be absent from work on the day that their child was born, or the day after, or the day   after that. They would give any excuse other than what might be construed as the soppy excuse that their wife was having a baby and they would leave work that afternoon. When I say &quot;soppy&quot;, incidentally, I do not mean that I think it a soppy excuse; indeed, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am not sure whether soppy is parliamentary language, and I apologise unreservedly if it is not. The point is that we all know the way in which men sometimes talk to other men, and it is often the case that there is not always universal sympathy for a man who thinks that his place on the day on which his child is born is beside his wife and child. There are people who think that he should be anywhere else in the world. It is generally agreed, however, that a man should, of course, have the right to paternity leave.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_112">It is far better that employers and employees are given the opportunity to be honest about this matter. Examples were given in Committee of where expectant fathers would give all sorts of excuses for not being at work when they were in fact attending the birth of their child. The really good thing about the Bill is that it   encourages, and indeed enables, employers, and employees, to be honest. If a man wishes to be present at the birth of his child and be with his wife and child the following day and for a little while thereafter, he should be able to be honest about it, and a good employer, as the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami) said, will recognise that he will get more out of his employee if he is flexible about giving leave. That is what is good about the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_113">What is not good is that we do not know what the effect will be on small businesses, and therefore on the economy as a whole. That is why we tabled new clause 3, requiring the Secretary of State to review and report on the effect of clauses 3 to 10 during every year in which the regulations are in force, beginning 12 months after they are made. That, of course, could be just over a year 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="stpa_115">The Bill would be the better for having new clause 3 added to it. I said earlier that it is essential that Bills such as this one command the respect of all who have to implement them. The Bill would command far more respect if it required that we review its operation after a year. We would thus be able to see what was really happening on the ground. So often, the House and the other place deliberate at length on what ought to be done, what laws passed, what regulation made and how different people ought to behave. We then discover afterwards that there were unintended consequences of the laws that we have passed.

This back-door sunset clause&#151;for that is what the new clause is&#151;attacks the paternity leave that we introduced for birth and adoption. It attacks, indirectly, additional statutory paternity pay for birth and adoption, and it attacks additional statutory maternity pay and the rates of pay and period of leave that we are introducing. The platitudes of the hon. Member for Epping Forest on the   wonders of paternity pay and her statements that   the Government have, of course, got their policy right in principle, are also absurd.

I appreciate that the Conservatives are trying to reinvent themselves, but to give the Government work for the sake of it by reviewing the regulations every year into the future seems a little over the top. However, the administration of the regulations, especially in the transfer of rights from the mother who gives up some of her maternity leave to allow the father to take paternity leave, will be complex, and the Government might not get it absolutely right. It would, therefore, be worth while looking at how the regulations are working after a year to ensure that they are working as well as possible or whether they need tweaking to ensure that their operation is not overly complicated for employers, or for mothers and fathers seeking to take advantage of those rights.

As the Minister is aware from our discussions, the labour market has changed for the better over the past two decades, under both Conservative and Labour Governments. These days, 50 per cent. of the work force are male and 50 per cent. female. Indeed, it is predicted that by 2010 women will make up 53 per cent. of the work force.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_123">The change in work patterns has also seen a change in   child-rearing responsibilities. In my case, my wife would not want me to be involved in any way with child-rearing, because she thinks that I am completely useless at it, and I am happy not to be involved. However, many women have excellent husbands whom they feel they can trust to share child care duties. In such cases, we have to accept that some men will want to take paternity leave to spend time with their children and release their wife to continue her career, perhaps in a higher paying job.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_124">The recruitment industry welcomes the extension of paternity leave, because we think that we shall make a bit of money from it. Fathers will want to take time off and there will be a consequential cost to small businesses in filling those positions. Recruitment companies often pay a higher hourly rate to temporary workers because they do not have access to the same level of in-work benefits as their permanent colleagues. Recruitment businesses also charge a margin on top of the hourly rate that can be as high as 20 per cent., so the cost to small business can be very real.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_125">The other issue that small businesses face is losing a key member of staff. I know that the issue is the same when they lose a valuable female member of staff, but the provision will mean that they will lose valuable male members of staff. If a small business employing fewer than 10 people loses one of its star performers for 10 or 12 weeks, it can leave a big hole to fill. Yes, the business can get a temporary worker to cover the role, but the skill set required may be such that the temporary worker cannot hope to fill the vacancy properly.

<a name="stpa_126">I agree that we do not want a sunset clause, but I urge the Government to report to the House in 12 months and let us know how the regulations have been working. That could be done through a statement or a report. Paternity leave will be a new concept and it will take time   for businesses to get their heads around it. It will   also take time for fathers to get their heads around how to access and manage their new right. If we can   ensure that regulation is thought through thoughtfully, implemented thoughtfully and followed up thoughtfully, it will be a great reassurance to Members on this side of the House. It might also be a reassurance to Labour Members and I am sure that it would be a reassurance to business.

When my youngest daughter was born my wife had to stay in hospital before and after the birth, which made things difficult. I had a young daughter to look after and had to change my work patterns.

Many aspects of the impact of the regulations on employees need to be assessed. Perhaps a review could reconsider the year&#039;s leave and split the time up in different ways to allow a crossover period. It could also consider the effects on small businesses that we discussed in our earlier debate. The review is fine but a year is far too short a period.

 On Second Reading, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry undertook to attempt to get the draft regulations ready before the Committee completed its deliberations. That did not happen, and they are still not ready. Would it not have been better to allow the House to see the regulations at least to assist in the debates on such matters?

 My right hon.

I have certainly done that when involved with previous Bills, and we welcome any support from Opposition Members in the way that we try to administer doing so. The regulations will go through the affirmative procedure&#151;Parliament will have an opportunity to discuss them&#151;and that is the proper way to proceed.

Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson). However, the evidence shows that the right hon. Member for Witney is attacking paternity leave and running behind what the   CBI has said about it.

 The Minister has been most convincing. He used the magic phrase that always makes me sit up and pay attention&#151;&quot;taxpayers&#039; money&quot;. We discussed that matter in Committee on many occasions. I consider the Conservative party to be the guardian of taxpayers&#039; money, but the Government often want to spend so much of it, and it is up to the Opposition to defend the taxpayer. So I am quite persuaded by the Minister&#039;s argument, but it is even more pleasing that he says that he accepts the principle of what I have said about the effect of new clause 3.

<a name="stpa_141">Of course, the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan) has his job to do as well. It is quite astonishing that, because I am saying something in 2006 that is broadly in agreement with what the Minister and the Government are saying, he must hark back to what the Conservative party said five years ago. Not so long ago, the Labour party was in favour of the common ownership of the means of production, but I do not hark back to that all the time to try to find something on which we disagree. What we said five years ago is not relevant; what we say now is relevant, and I am saying now that we are in favour of statutory paternity leave.

So I will take that no further, but I notice that the hon. Gentleman loyally echoes the words of the Prime Minister earlier today. If political parties could not review their polices in light of a changing world and a changing society, what is the point of political parties and what is the point of Parliament as a place to propose ideas and to have debates and arguments? That is what Parliament is all about. I am pleased to say that that is what we are doing effectively this afternoon, and the Minister has done it so effectively that he has persuaded me: I am happy with his assurances that he will return to the House and that we will have such an opportunity in future.

<br>&nbsp;<br>


<p><a name="st_130">The amendment reflects the fact that holiday entitlements and rates of pay for agricultural workers in Scotland are devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The minor technical amendment ensures that the current limited devolution is preserved.</p>





<p><a name="st_131"><a name="60118-17_spnew1"><b> Mr. Alan Reid: </b> 
 The Minister is quite right that the matter is devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Agricultural Wages Board sets the minimum wage as well as holiday entitlement. It is obliged to set a minimum wage that is above the national minimum wage and a holiday entitlement that is greater than that laid down in the Working Time Regulations 1998. Will the Minister assure the House that the future holiday entitlement of agricultural workers in Scotland will not lag behind that laid down in UK or European regulations?
</p>





<p><a name="st_132"><a name="60118-17_spnew2"><b> Mr. Russell Brown  (Dumfries and Galloway) (Lab):</b> 
 While I appreciate that my hon. Friend the Minister indicated that the amendment is technical, I share the concerns of the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr.   Reid). I regret to say that although we have a national minimum wage in this country, there are all too often some who would like to attack the protection that is offered through the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board. Like the hon. Gentleman, I merely say to my good friend the Minister that I hope that the amendment will offer protection to agricultural workers in Scotland and that they will not be worse off in any shape or form compared with workers in other parts of the country.
</p>





<p><a name="st_133"><a name="60118-17_spnew3"><b> Mr. Weir: </b> 
 I had not intended to speak to the technical amendment, but I have been interested by what hon. Members have said. As the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board is a devolved body, it is up to it to decide what to set. I would hope that members of the board, being good Scots, would set rates that were higher than those in other parts of the country, although I accept that there is no guarantee that that will happen. However, as an independent body, it would have the right to set such rates.

<a name="stpa_144">The number of people working in agriculture in Scotland has declined steadily over the years. Many people who work in agriculture, especially those who are seasonal workers, come from eastern Europe to work for short periods. Will the Minister confirm that they are covered by regulations on the national minimum wage, rather than the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board, and that the amendment thus covers people who are permanently engaged in agriculture, rather than seasonal workers?
</p>





<p><a name="st_134"><a name="60118-17_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Laing: </b> 
 I also realise that the amendment is technical, so I do not intend to speak for long. Devolution is complicated, so we can forgive the Government for not getting the drafting perfectly right from the beginning and thus having to table the amendment. It is much better for technical amendments to be considered on Report than for us to have to spend hours and hours upstairs considering statutory instruments to make devolution work. We all want devolution to work, so we welcome the amendment.

<a name="amdt_10">
<br>
&quot;1A      In section 106 of ERA 1996 (replacements) in subsection (2)(a) after &quot;adoption leave&quot; insert &quot;or leave under section 80AA or 80BB (additional paternity leave)&quot;.&#039;.
<br>



<p><a name="st_140">This amendment will support employers in managing the new entitlement to additional paternity leave. The Government recognise that employers are concerned about their position when they take on a new employee to cover a woman&#039;s absence on maternity leave. Those concerns were raised on Second Reading. They were also discussed in Committee during debate on an amendment tabled by the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb). We recognise that the same issues will be of concern to employers taking on new staff to cover an absence due to additional paternity leave.</p>





<p><a name="st_141">An employee with 52 weeks&#039; service is, of course, protected from being unfairly dismissed. It is right that employees are protected in that way; the Government reduced the qualifying service from two years to one in 1999. However, we recognise that it is also right that we make the management of maternity, adoption and additional paternity leave as straightforward as we can for employers, and that includes making the management of employees they take on to cover maternity, adoption or additional paternity leave as straightforward as we can.</p>





<p><a name="st_142">Section 106 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 provides that where an employee is taken on to cover an absence caused by pregnancy, childbirth or adoption leave and is dismissed because the original employee returns from the absence, they will be treated as having been dismissed for a substantial reason which would mean that the dismissal was not unfair, provided that the employer had acted reasonably.</p>





<p><a name="st_143">Section 106 is intended to protect employers who take on employees to cover maternity or adoption leave. It enables them to dismiss the replacement employee when the original employee returns from leave. The replacement employee is also protected since section 106 applies only where the replacement was informed in   writing when they were appointed that their employment would be terminated when the original employee returned to work, and the dismissal will be fair only if the employer acted reasonably and fairly and followed proper procedures in carrying out the dismissal.</p>





<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 889</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


<p><a name="st_144">As well as maternity and adoption leave, section 106 includes replacements taken on to cover maternity or medical suspensions and other absence caused by pregnancy.</p>





<p><a name="st_145"><a name="60118-17_spnew6"><b> Mr. Walker: </b> 
 Will there be a requirement for notice or any form of redundancy payment to be given to an individual being dismissed when a women returns from maternity leave? What period of notice and conditions will be attached to that dismissal?
</p>





<p><a name="st_146"><a name="60118-17_spnew7"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Bill extends the notice that women returning from maternity leave give to their employer, enabling the employer to give more notice to the replacement employee. My understanding is that there will not be issues of redundancy as this is not a redundancy situation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_147"><a name="60118-17_spnew8"><b> Mr. Walker: </b> 
 A woman returning to work could say, &quot;I&#039;ll be coming back in two or three months&quot;. Will there be a requirement for the employer to notify the temporary employee that they will be moving on? It would be fair for the temporary employee to have as much notice as possible that they will not required in future.
</p>





<p><a name="st_148"><a name="60118-17_spnew9"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 My understanding is that nothing in the Bill changes the current arrangements, and clearly the   employer has to follow the correct procedures. Having the extended notice helps the replacement employee. They need to be told at the outset that they are a replacement and that they will finish at that point. The proper procedures should be followed. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_145">The amendment will allow section 106 to be extended to include the dismissal of employees taken on to cover absence due to additional paternity leave. In the majority of cases, such an absence will be short and the   replacement employee will not have enough continuous service with their employer to enable them to claim unfair dismissal. However, there may be circumstances, including where additional paternity leave is taken on the death of the mother, where the father&#039;s absence is long enough to allow the replacement to clock up one year&#039;s service and be able to claim unfair dismissal. The extension of section 106 will provide certainty to employers managing the new entitlement to   additional paternity leave. Employers will know that   they can take on a replacement to cover the absence without concern about their ability to end the   replacement employee&#039;s contract. I commend the amendment to the House.

 If my amendment on a related point has triggered the Government to spot this anomaly, I   am obviously delighted. This measure appears eminently sensible, and we must ensure that in all the different circumstances&#151;maternity or paternity leave, or adoption&#151;the employer and the employee are in the same position. The amendment will regularise that situation, so as to ensure that in the few cases in which

<a name="stpa_146">This Bill, which has enjoyed a positive reception from both sides of the House during its passage, is pro-family and pro-business. These aims are not mutually exclusive, but mutually supportive. Flexible working increases the number of people who are able to work, which widens the talent pool for business. More importantly, it gives parents a genuine choice when making the difficult decisions about how they balance their work and family lives. That is why these measures are an essential component of an enabling state.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_147">The Bill extends paid maternity and adoption leave. It extends to carers of adults the right to request flexible working. It also gives fathers the opportunity to play more of a role in their child&#039;s upbringing, and it makes it easier for employers to administer these rights. These are progressive policies that respond to profound changes in our workplaces and our homes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_148">It is therefore curious to read that the Leader of Her   Majesty&#039;s official Opposition, the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), is apparently against the measures.

<br>&nbsp;<br>measure that this Government have introduced, from extending maternity leave, maternity pay and paternity leave to the right to request flexible working. They also voted against giving adoptive parents help for the very first time in dealing with the difficult task of taking children into their homes. We genuinely hoped that there had been a change of heart, and that there would be a progressive consensus behind the Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="st_155"><a name="60118-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bellingham: </b> 
 The Minister will remember that, for a couple of years during the last Parliament, I shadowed him when he was a Minister of State. We consistently supported a number of family-friendly measures. We certainly gave our wholehearted support on adoption rights. Perhaps, going back a bit further, the Opposition might have taken a more anti-family stance, but for the past four years or so we have supported the Government on many occasions. Yes, we have had our differences with them over employment legislation, but we have also supported them time and again.
</p>





<p><a name="st_156"><a name="60118-18_spnew4"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I remember when we dealt with the Employment Bill in 2001. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s memory is faulty. Conservative Members opposed the Employment Bill on Second Reading on 27 November 2001. That Bill contained every element that I just mentioned. It was supported with fine words in Committee. I well remember the principle being acceptable, but when it came to the crunch and the vote, Opposition Members, including the right hon. Member for Witney, voted against every single measure. Although we hoped that there had been a change of heart and that there would be a progressive consensus behind the present Bill, that seems not to be the case, but I still hope that Members in all parts of the House will support the Bill this evening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_150">Progressive politicians should certainly back the Bill, because progressive businesses back it&#151;not just the biggest businesses, which find it easier to invest in human resources policies, but small businesses too. In many cases, small businesses are far ahead of larger businesses in their enlightened approach to employment relations. They do it almost instinctively, as we found when we researched the original employment relations policies introduced in the early part of the century.
</p>

<a name="60118-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_151">The economics are clear. It costs &#163;80 to handle a straightforward flexible working request, for instance, but it costs &#163;4,800 to recruit a new employee. That is why 90 per cent. of flexible working requests are being accommodated, according to a CBI survey. That is why Miles Templeman, director general of the Institute of Directors, which was against the original proposals back in 2000&#150;01, now says:

Business also supports the extension of maternity pay towards 12 months by the end of this Parliament, and many of the other measures in the Bill&#151;the increased notice periods, the &quot;keeping in touch&quot; days and the alignment of start dates, all of which are essential simplifications of the legislation.

<p><a name="st_163"><a name="60118-19_spnew3"><b> Mrs. Laing: </b> 
 That is the point. Does it mean 28 days including public holidays or 28 days excluding public holidays? I personally think it correct to exclude public   holidays from the 28 days. Public holidays should not be included as part of annual leave&#151;they are additional holidays. The transition should be introduced gradually, because it will have a large and immediate impact on some businesses, which may be detrimental.

 I understand that the current provision is 20 days, of which eight days are bank holidays and 12 days are holidays provided by employers.

 I thank my hon. Friend for assisting me,   because I have got it wrong. When I said 28 days excluding bank holidays, I meant to say 20 days excluding bank holidays. I inadvertently misled the House in my answer to the hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr.   Heppell), who said from a sedentary position that it depends on what 28 days means. I am in favour of 20 days plus bank holidays, not 20 days including bank holidays. I hope that I have now made myself clear.

<a name="stpa_160">The Secretary of State is right that, if the Bill works as it is intended to work, business will become more efficient as well as more family-friendly. There is no need for what we describe as family-friendly measures to be in any way opposed to business-friendly measures. As he said, if things work properly, there should not be a choice between a business working efficiently and profitably and a work force being happy. On the contrary, for a business to work to the best of its ability, it is necessary to have a work force who are working to the best of their ability. That means that it is necessary to have a proper work-life balance. We come back, as we always do, to that word, &quot;balance&quot;. That is what it is all about.

Nevertheless, it was once the case that women were required to give up work, notably in the civil service. It happened to my mother when she got married. I do not think that she minded. It was the fashion at the time that if a woman who was a qualified civil servant got married, she was required to give up work there and then because it was assumed that she would have a baby more or less immediately. Of course, my mother was very fortunate because she gave up the civil service and had me, although I would not necessarily expect the whole House to agree with that. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon.

<a name="stpa_162">I do not wish to digress or to take up the House&#039;s time unnecessarily, but to convince the Secretary of State that I agree with most of what he said. We are thoroughly behind the Bill and its intentions, but I   remain concerned about the burdens on small businesses and about the cost to the taxpayer and the business community, large and small, of implementing some of the regulations. I also remain concerned that, if employers do not have confidence in the Bill and feel that they are being forced into a situation that they do not want, the measure might backfire. However, I hope that it does not because in our debates in many forums in the past few months, we have all been trying to achieve equality in society and in the work force. That is not only desirable but necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_163">Women have to do two jobs and it is not only desirable but economically necessary that they should do that because we need them in the work force. We need women who are currently in the work force to remain there and it is wrong that a woman who has a child and wants to return to work should sometimes be required to go back at a lower level than that that she had reached before she gave birth. That is wrong socially and because it is unfair, but it is also wrong because of its effect on the economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_164">I shall repeat the statistic that the Minister for Women and Equality first mentioned. If all the women in our work force worked at the height of their capability instead of doing jobs for which they are over-qualified in order to do part-time work to look after their families, annual GDP would increase by 3 per 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 895</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>cent., which is equal to our annual trade with Germany. I have often used that statistic and people have argued against me on many occasions. I cite the Minister as the person who first mentioned it and I therefore hope for my sake as well as hers that it is accurate. However, I   should like us to prove its accuracy by enabling the women to whom we refer to work to the limit of their abilities instead of being undervalued because they happen to be mothers as well as important people in the work force.

<a name="stpa_166">If a family is to work the way that it should, flexibility is required to enable people to look after their elderly parents, their sick relatives and their small children when necessary. Flexibility does not mean not working properly. If the employer and the employee exercise it responsibly, it works in everybody&#039;s best interests. That is why the Bill is so important. I am pleased to be able to support the Bill. It is a big step forward towards a family friendly workplace. If it works properly&#151;I sincerely hope that it will&#151;it will be a huge boost not only to our society but to our economy.

<a name="stpa_167">As the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) said, it is a pity that we have not seen the regulations. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State and the Minister for Employment Relations, Consumers and Fair Markets promised us that we would see them. There was an understanding that we would have them in Committee. The Minister expressed a further hope in Committee that we would have them before Third Reading. We are nearing the conclusion of proceedings on the Bill and we have still not seen the regulations, so I   fear that it may be the duty of our colleagues in another place to pursue the argument about their introduction. In Committee, the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and   Industry, the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr.   Sutcliffe) said that the Secretary of State was a &quot;hard taskmaster&quot; in promising that the regulations would be published soon. That was several weeks ago, and we still have not seen the regulations, which is disappointing. Our consideration of the Bill would have been better informed if the regulations had been published. I cannot make that point strongly enough.

 My hon. Friend is correct. It is difficult to consider the Bill properly without knowing what the regulations are. It is hard to understand why we have reached this stage without the regulations that the Secretary of State promised. The Under-Secretary said that he was doing all that he could to produce them. There is no urgency to introduce the Bill. We could have waited for Third Reading until next week, the week after, or the week after that. It is a good Bill, and we want it to come into force, but there is no reason why it should do so in six or seven weeks&#039; time rather than in 10 or 11 weeks&#039; time. We could have had a far better and more informed debate if we had had the regulations

 On Second Reading, I expressed the desire and hope that the regulations would be ready while the Bill was proceeding through the House. I am very sorry that that has not proved possible, but that is far from suggesting that it is an essential part of the legislative process. Countless Bills go through the House without regulations being published until they have completed their passage. That is the normal practice. In this case, particularly given concerns about the way in   which paternity leave would operate, I thought that it would assist the scrutiny of the Bill in Committee if the regulations were ready while the Bill was proceeding through the House.

They are, of course, subject to the affirmative procedure. Our latest information is that they will be included in a consultation document in February. I am sorry that that is after the Bill will have completed its passage through the House but, because of the affirmative resolution procedure, it leaves ample opportunity for Members on both sides of the House to comment and amend them.

The Government have good intentions, and we have good intentions in supporting the Bill, but I do not want anything to happen that would undermine the position of small businesses, because that would make the whole body of   legislation on maternity and paternity pay and family-friendly working arrangements backfire. We therefore want to examine the regulations in great detail to make sure that the Bill will work as intended.

I   particularly support the extension of the right to request flexible working to adults. As a carer myself, I   spoke on Second Reading about the specific needs of   carers, and I am anxious that the consultation on the   regulations should give detailed consideration to the definition of a carer. It should be as wide and as flexible as possible. We have all received very good briefings from Carers UK telling us that caring is not the same as child care. Different needs are involved, and different factors must be taken into account. When the

I hope that we have taken a step towards enabling all families with children of all ages to request flexible working. We all know that children&#039;s needs may be even greater when they are older than when they are babies or toddlers. Parents may be more likely to know where there children are when they are little. Different needs arise at different stages of the family cycle. I hope that the Bill will lead to circumstances in which everyone can combine work and family life to the benefit of all, and I hope that we shall be able to discuss that possibility in the future.

<a name="stpa_178">The Bill contains important measures relating to increases in maternity leave and pay, paternity leave and adoption leave.

There has been a transformation&#151;a revolution&#151;in the workplace over the past two decades, since the days when it was dominated by males&#151;indeed, fathers.

 Absolutely. I led the campaign for compensation for women who were discharged from the   armed forces when they got pregnant. Some 5,000 women were discharged simply because they became pregnant, and we should note the craziness of the resulting lost investment in their training. One of the biggest critics of the campaign to get compensation was a Conservative MP, so if the Conservative party has now moved on that is a good thing from everybody&#039;s point of view.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_181">I have a number of specific points to make about the Bill, but I shall be as brief as I can because I want to make sure that the historic opportunity for parish councils to have their moment in the spotlight in the forthcoming Adjournment debate is not lost. Never has so much time been able to be devoted to the interests of parish councils. First, we must all accept that the Bill does impose new burdens on employers. By and large, employers&#039; organisations recognise that the rights being introduced or extended are good things in themselves and they are prepared to go along with them, but they continue to express concern about the impact on small businesses in particular.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_182">On report&#151;the Secretary of State was not present for that debate&#151;the Government rejected a new clause to introduce a right for small employers to transfer responsibility for the payment of statutory maternity and paternity pay to the Government. We put it to the Minister present for that debate that the Government ought to consider adjusting the percentage payback to employers when recompensing them for the maternity or paternity pay paid out. Currently, 92 per cent. is paid back to all employers who make national insurance contributions in excess of &#163;45,000 a year; for those below that level, the figure is 104.5 per cent. However, even for smaller employers, such repayments do not reflect the administrative burden. In an intervention on my speech on the new clause, the Minister seemed to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 900</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>accept the case for compensating for the cost of the administrative burden. Given that the Government rejected the new clause, they ought to consider making an adjustment to assist employers. If they are unable to help them through the direct payment method, that is another way in which they could help, and they ought to take it seriously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_183">My second point concerns the regulations facilitating the increase in paid leave. The Bill provides potentially sweeping powers for the Secretary of State to increase paid leave. The understanding is that it will be increased by another eight days, to reflect the fact that there are still many employees who do not get paid for bank holidays and other public holidays. We very much support such an extension. The CBI made the case for phasing in that additional right.

<p><a name="st_185"><a name="60118-21_spnew5"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 I see that the Minister is nodding at   that. My purpose is merely to ensure that the Government consult fully with business interests on this matter. I am sure that they will, as the effect will be felt most particularly in low-paid employment such as the hospitality and cleaning industries. The additional costs will be considerable, and there is at least a case for phasing the changes in. The Government need to consult carefully about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_184">Secondly, I turn to the regulations covering the circumstances in which maternity leave can be replaced by paternity leave&#151;when the father can take time off after the mother returns to work. I support that provision, but framing the regulations to ensure that it works effectively could be a complex matter. In most cases, for instance, the father and mother will work for different employers, with the result that their employers will have to exchange information with each other. It will be difficult to make sure that that works effectively&#151;both for fathers and mothers and for employers, especially small ones&#151;and again I urge the Government to consult very carefully on that. They should also look at the mechanism again after a year or some other interval to ensure that it is working effectively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_185">My third point has to do with the extension of the right to request flexible working. I support that, but on Second Reading I mentioned the contention of the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society that a right to make such a request only once a year did not take into account the fact that the seriousness of some conditions, including Parkinson&#039;s disease, can vary considerably over the course of 12 months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_186">The Government did not accept the idea that requests might be made more often, and I understand why. However, I urge Ministers to reflect on concerns raised by organisations such as the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society and to see whether the system could be made more flexible. Alternatively, I hope that the guidance that they supply will at least encourage employers to go beyond the statutory minimum in respect of helping the carers of adults with a horrible illness such as Parkinson&#039;s disease.

If the definition is narrow, few people will benefit, whereas a broad definition will be of real value to a large number of carers. Like the hon.

<a name="stpa_188">My final point has to do with the extension of the right to request flexible working to include people with teenage children. The Equal Opportunities Commission has said that the right should, in due course, be extended to cover everyone. People at work who do not have children or who do not care for loved ones at home could feel that there are two separate groups in society. Single people who crave a better work-life balance could believe that they have no right to request anything.

This is a light-touch regime: people will have the right only to request flexibility, not to get it, but they will be able to discuss the matter with their employer. Indeed, anyone who falls outside the Bill still has the right to ask their employer, but there is no statutory framework to facilitate that.

 It is a real pleasure to speak on Third Reading to a united Chamber. There was, in fact, a broadly united Standing Committee, too. Some on the Opposition Benches would, given the new leadership of the Conservative party, like to forget the recent past, and particularly their voting record. The Bill needs to be considered in the context of a journey that began in 1997. Although the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) was right to say that most good employment practices are not rocket science, the reality is that for those employers who do not get there by themselves, we need prescription in the law. Secondly, the law and regulations help to change attitudes so that employers, parents and carers change over time.

<a name="stpa_191">It gives me great pleasure to welcome the main thrust of the Work and Families Bill, which will extend paid maternity and adoption leave. It will also extend the right to request flexible working to carers of adults. It will help fathers to play a role in their child&#039;s upbringing if the mother returns to work. It will also make things easier for employers&#151;a point often forgotten in Report stage debates. It will make it easier for employers to manage the administration of rights. The Bill will also include powers to deliver and ensure that all workers are entitled to four weeks of statutory leave in addition to the eight days for bank holidays.

<a name="60118-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_192">It is a great pleasure to welcome the Bill, but it is worth emphasising that it is part of a jigsaw. Other parts of that are the work we have done on tax credits and child tax credits&#151;helping hard-working families and those who are least well off. Other parts of the jigsaw are the work we have done to extend maternity leave to 26 weeks, not just benefiting mothers and families, but benefiting employers by facilitating more continuity and   less staff turnover, with mothers given longer maternity leave.

<p>
<a name="60118-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_193">We introduced two weeks&#039; paternity leave. Other pieces of the family-friendly jigsaw are the introduction of three months&#039; adoption leave. We must not forget the right to request flexible working, which has benefited 1 million parents across the country and many hundreds in Tooting. We also, of course, in another piece of the jigsaw, increased maternity pay, which was as low as   &#163;55 in 1997. Part-time workers now have the same rights as full-time workers, particularly benefiting women and ethnic minority employees, who were disproportionately part-time workers. Other pieces of the jigsaw are the introduction of four weeks of paid leave, which will include the eight pubic holidays. Finally, another piece of the jigsaw is the introduction of the national minimum wage&#151;

</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_195">I must emphasise what the Bill does to improve the quality of life for families in Tooting and around the   country. Increased notice periods benefit both employers and employees, clarifying in law the fact that reasonable contact during maternity leave is permitted, allowing optional &quot;keep in touch&quot; days and enabling women to go to work for a few days during the paternity pay period. That will help employers to run maternity leave more effectively and will improve communication and contact during leave periods. The Bill will also enable statutory maternity pay to be paid daily and start on any day, which will ease the administration of SMP and allow employers to align the payment of SMP with their normal payroll arrangements.

<br>&nbsp;<br>to   reassure business that the costs of that will not be disproportionate. The majority of the cost of the measures in the Bill will fall to Government, because the   Treasury will reimburse business for any maternity and paternity pay, at the rate of 92 per cent. for large businesses and 104 per cent. for smaller businesses. It is often forgotten that the net cost to business is estimated to be much smaller&#151;&#163;40 million to &#163;90 million in any one year&#151;and much of it is offset by the benefits that accrue, such as lower recruitment costs because more mothers return to work. As has been mentioned, more flexible working practices also lead to more productivity and profit, estimated at 3 per cent. of GDP.

<a name="stpa_197">The fact that groups as disparate as the Federation of   Small Businesses, the TUC, the British Chambers of Commerce, the Maternity Alliance, Carers UK and even, dare I say, the Conservative party welcome the Bill is to be commended. The fact that the Bill will pass unopposed shows how far society has moved in recent years. As a Labour Member, I am especially proud that the movement towards a more family-friendly society and a healthier balance between work and family life began in earnest in May 1997.

 It is a privilege and honour to follow the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan) because I had the   great pleasure of being a councillor with him in Wandsworth. I congratulate him on his excellent speech. Parental leave is a good thing, and that is accepted on both sides of the Chamber. Most important, it is good for children. Children need their mum and dad. They do not need to be farmed out to day care centres at two or three months old. That is not good for them and it is not good for families. I am delighted that the Bill will allow children in their formative years to spend more time with their parents. After all, once they hit eight, nine or 10, the last thing that they want to do is spend any time with us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_198">The Bill is also very good for parents. It allows mothers and fathers to share child-rearing responsibilities between them. It is also excellent that women who go on maternity leave can return to the job that they left. Let us imagine the outrage if the Secretary of State for Health, for example, left to have a baby and was offered a junior transport job when she returned. She would be appalled, we would be appalled and the nation would be appalled. The important element is choice. It might be that the Secretary of State decided that she wanted to spend more time with her family and have a better work-life balance, so she wanted to become a junior Transport Minister. It would be in a strange, parallel universe, but it might happen. In any event, it must be her choice whether to return to her health portfolio or take a slightly less senior role. Choice is very important.

<a name="stpa_199">The Bill is also good for business, because it will be able to hold on to talent. Business is in a skills battle at   present. There is a skills shortage and good people are leaving the labour market and not returning. Most good employers will welcome the Bill. Indeed, many good employers have already adopted many of the provisions, but other employers&#151;with a little encouragement&#151;may find that it is a good thing for them and allows them to become more profitable in the longer term.

<a name="stpa_200">I want to inject a couple of caveats about the benefits for business. I am broadly in favour of increasing paid holiday entitlement from 20 to 28 days. It was always a little disingenuous of us to include eight days of bank holidays in the 20-day period. That was an unsustainable position, but the Minister assured us that he would look at the impact of the increased entitlement on small businesses, for whom the extra eight days would mean a 3 per cent. increase in their payroll costs. Given that there are other added costs, it is important that we consider the impact on overall employment rates, profitability and performance.

We did that automatically&#151;we did not need regulation to do so&#151;but I understand that some companies might not do so and might need regulation.

It does the House a service to think back because the marriage bar lasted until the late 1960s. Indeed, trade unions that stemmed from the civil service such as my own, the Communication Workers Union, kept the marriage bar for their employees into the early 1970s. Kim McKinlay, a great woman trade unionist, had to keep her maiden name and pretend that she was not married to prevent her from being sacked from her position as an assistant secretary with the union. I say this to many young girls, including my daughters, so that they understand what women have had to do to reverse a situation that, as the hon.

 I am extremely pleased to have the opportunity to raise, at perhaps greater length than I might have had, the issues of parish councils. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) said in the previous debate, it is very rare that we have the opportunity in this place to talk about what are, certainly in England, the basic building blocks of our democratic system, so it is appropriate to take that opportunity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_226">The parish council is an extremely venerable institution. It arguably dates back to Anglo-Saxon times, although in its more recent appearance it dates from Gladstone&#039;s Local Government Act 1894. A criticism sometimes made of the structures in this country compared with other countries is that we are under-parished. We have relatively fewer community councils at that lowest local level than similar countries in Europe or elsewhere. I have to say that from the perspective of my constituency, it does not seem that way. As Members may know, I have a large rural constituency, and every year I do a tour of my villages. There are more than 120 of them, and I normally visit at least 100 of them each summer during my tour. There are more than 100 parish councils; I think that the figure is 101, but it is a little difficult to be precise because we have at least one detached part of a parish council that lies in another constituency, so the calculation becomes more complex.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-23_para15">
<a name="stpa_227">I applied for the debate specifically in response to criticisms expressed to me by a couple of villages: Cranmore and Leigh-on-Mendip. I have noted, since securing the debate and in earlier discussions, that very similar points come up in discussion with a variety of parish councils. They vary widely in their size, of course, and in their function, ranging from the smallest, with relatively little in the way of a local role or budget, to quite sizeable town councils. Frome is the biggest town council in my constituency, but others are actively engaged in running local facilities and take an interest in the development of their town or village. Those that have been engaged in the market towns initiative are able to unlock significant funding to accomplish some of their objectives.

 When the hon. Gentleman went on his travels around his constituency&#151;I do not know whether he went on horseback or in a caravan&#151;did he discover that the smaller parish councils in particular were having ever more onerous regulations, such as the code of conduct, imposed on them? Are not they also, however, having their powers reduced and are they not being listened to less and less?
</p>





<p><a name="st_211"><a name="60118-24_spnew1"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I shall come to some aspects of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question later. I have not attempted the journey on horseback yet, although it would be an appealing prospect to do so in the steps of William Cobbett, who undertook some of his rural rides in my constituency. He went to Frome, which he described as the &quot;Manchester of the south&quot;. Perhaps its industrial past was rather different from its more bucolic present.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_228">A characteristic of all parish councils is the depth of   local knowledge that they contain. The parish councillors are a repository of local knowledge, and because they live within a relatively small community and often make it their business to talk to their neighbours to ensure that they are well advised, they also have a strongly consultative role in their community. I should like to pay tribute to the men and women who volunteer to be our parish councillors. It is often a thankless task&#151;it is certainly unremunerated&#151;but without them, our democratic system would be very much worse. I pay tribute not only to the elected councillors but to the parish clerks, who are becoming increasingly professional in their abilities and the roles that they perform. They do us a great service right across the country.
</p>





<p><a name="st_212"><a name="60118-24_spnew2"><b> Norman Lamb  (North Norfolk) (LD):</b> 
 I echo my hon. Friend&#039;s tribute to the work of the parish councillors. I   am concerned, however, at the extent to which we do not always see full slates of candidates when parish council elections are called. It is sometimes difficult even to convene a parish council because of the shortage of candidates. People often complain that they are not listened to, and so wonder what is the point. Planning is a particular case in point. The parish councillors of Barton Turf in my constituency have expressed their concern that they feel that they are not listened to in the planning process. Will my hon. Friend be seeking to find answers to such problems in this debate?
</p>





<p><a name="st_213"><a name="60118-24_spnew3"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 My hon. Friend will not be surprised to   learn that he has just provided a synopsis of what I   intend to say today. Those issues are very much the concern of many parish councillors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_229">When I visit the parish councillors in my constituency, not only on my summer tour but all year round, I know that they will be able to point to the issues in their community that I need to take up on their behalf. They will know about the road problems, for example, some of which they might have been wrestling with for a long time. They will know about the lack of affordable housing, and about how the problem could be rectified. They will have talked to the children and young people in their community, and will know about the lack of recreational facilities. They will also know about the lack of public transport. That is a particular problem in my Somerset constituency, where the bus timetables sometimes show one bus per week rather than an hourly or more frequent service. The parish councillors will know what a restricting effect that can have on people without their own transport, especially younger people who do not have the capacity to drive and who might not have the opportunity to be driven everywhere by their parents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_230">What are the concerns that I hear about the role of parish councils? Picking up on the point made by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr.   Bellingham), one of the concerns is a general feeling that there has been a significant increase in the regulation through the code of conduct and through the Standards Board, and that some of that is not relevant to the role and responsibilities of a parish council. I do not entirely accept that argument. I recognise that there are standards that we should expect parish councillors, like any other elected 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 911</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>members, to uphold, but there is a point beyond which it is unhelpful and counterproductive to require constant reiteration of those standards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_231">My hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk pointed out the lack of competition for places. The fact that so few parish councils have competitive elections is a significant worry. I do not know what the answer is. I   do know that not only does it sometimes cause considerable concern to councils that do not have the requisite number of councillors the day after polling day because not enough people put themselves forward, but it calls into question their identity as councillors&#151;the respect with which they should be treated if they are not genuinely the product of a democratic process, other than nomination. We should be concerned about that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_214"><a name="60118-24_spnew4"><b> Andrew George  (St. Ives) (LD):</b> 
 My hon. Friend asks whether there is an answer to the problem of the democratic deficit. Often, insufficient candidates put themselves forward to fulfil the job of parish councils. That happens in a very few cases in my constituency in west Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. The answer lies in   the title of my hon. Friend&#039;s debate&#151;the implication that parish councils and parish councillors have little or no power. If they are given more power&#151;the communes in France have power&#151;we will find that people turn out for elections and that there is competition for the seats available. That is the case at the commune level in France, and no doubt the same would happen with parish councils throughout this country. Surely the answer is that we need to devolve some appropriate powers to parish councils.
</p>





<p><a name="st_215"><a name="60118-24_spnew5"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who makes a valuable point. People put themselves forward for election and turn out to vote if it means something. We see that in the House. In constituencies which are hard fought&#151;marginal constituencies&#151;turnout is extremely high. My constituency is one of them. It has been a traditional marginal, which I always win, but by nothing as vulgar as a four-figure majority. It means that we have one of the highest turnouts in the country. If the role of parish councils were strengthened and better understood, people would be more likely to put themselves forward and we would have more hotly contested elections.
</p>





<p><a name="st_216"><a name="60118-24_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bellingham: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has been generous in giving way. He is in the middle of an extremely impressive speech, which resonates with anyone who understands the countryside. Time and again parish councillors tell me that more people who are involved in the community and who have a great deal to offer would stand if they felt that the decisions of the parish council were listened to by, for example, planning authorities. They tell me that time and again what they say is ignored.
</p>





<p><a name="st_217"><a name="60118-24_spnew7"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman brings me back to the main tenor of my speech. That is the principal concern for many parish councils, particularly the smaller ones. They feel ignored. They feel that there is a lack of recognition of their role in the process and that they are wasting their time giving great care to consideration of development control planning if nobody at a higher level takes a blind bit of notice. That 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 912</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>applies not just to planning. I mentioned affordable housing earlier. Parish councils have tremendous potential for playing a role in seeing through the acquisition of appropriate and affordable housing in their parish, from the point of site identification to the point of allocation. That is not done well at present, and parish councils are often overlooked as a resource in that process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_232">The Government&#039;s rhetoric suggests that they intend to recognise the role of parish councils in planning. Since the rural delivery review in 2003&#151;the so-called Haskins review&#151;they have consistently stressed that the role of parish councils is important, and they have supported that role by, for instance, working with the National Association of Local Councils in developing quality assessment and training. Question marks still remain for the future and in the present, and I hope that the Minister will say something about the future in the light of press comment in the past few days.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_233">We know that the Government are seriously considering the future of local government in this country. On unitary authorities, they are considering whether it is better to have the present two-tier system in shire counties and rural areas by which parish councils exist below both a district council and a county council or whether it would be better to reduce that to a parish council and a unitary authority. I am a former county councillor, a former leader of a county council and a   former leader of a group on the Association of County and City Councils, so I have some knowledge. I   remember the previous local government review, which was a difficult process that turned colleagues at different tiers against one another as they advanced the case for their own authorities and their own way of doing things. The arguments were often equally valid&#151;the role of district councils is closer to the public whom they serve, while county councils, as strategic authorities, have the scope to get better value for money through economies of scale.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_234">There is an argument for unitary authorities, but the Government will make a big mistake if they repeat the 1972 local government changes, which not only instituted new patterns for local government, but told people that they no longer lived where they believed and continued to believe that they lived, which is a point that applies to the creation of the so-called county of Avon. People do not care who collects their dustbins, but they know whether they grew up a Somerset man or a Gloucestershire man, and they do not want to be told that their culture, history and geography has been turned upside down. If the Government want the process of moving unitary authorities to succeed, then I   advise them, however the local authority boundaries are determined, that they should allow the cultural and historic boundaries to remain so that people can still say, &quot;I live in Somerset, but my dustbins are collected by South Somerset council&quot;, which would allow people to maintain their identities. That is an aside, but it is an important consideration.

 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this worthwhile Adjournment debate. Does he agree that planning is one of the most emotive issues in a local community and that district councils and county councils often feel just as powerless as the parish council? The problem often concerns central Government planning targets, planning guidance and planning inspectors, who overrule the local authority&#039;s decision in one third of cases. More power should certainly be given to parish councils and to local authorities generally, but the power should be taken away from central Government and given to local authorities and parish councils.

<p><a name="st_219"><a name="60118-25_spnew1"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman to a great extent. Since I was first engaged in local government, I   have seen a steady erosion of the discretion available to local government, at any level, to have an effect on the future of its communities. It is constantly looking over its shoulder and thinking, &quot;What will a planning inspector make of this?&quot;, before reaching a decision. I   am afraid that I take a slightly iconoclastic view, but   I think that, in planning, precedent is the worst enemy of sensible decision making. It prevents local authorities from making the right decision in support of their local community instead of that which is simply what others have done before or may do in future. I will touch on the exact point that the hon. Gentleman raised in a moment.

The local council in Leigh-on-Mendip&#151;a similar situation has arisen in the neighbouring council of Batcombe&#151;feels that it is being held over a barrel by Mendip district council, which is saying, &quot;You must agree to this low-cost housing scheme, and you have a very limited time scale in which to do so, or the funding will be gone.&quot; This is a crucial matter for our community. These are small villages, and the pattern of housing will affect the environment for many years to come. The local council feels that it should have been involved in the process right from the   start&#151;that it should have been able to identify appropriate sites, allowed to consult its community in an effective way, and given a role in carrying it forward.

<p><a name="st_224"><a name="60118-25_spnew6"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is making an important point about housing. In a previous life, before I came to this House, I encouraged parish councils to take the lead in the development process by setting up a working party, deciding on the housing association and the site, and working with local authorities&#039; housing and   planning departments to drive through the development process as regards meeting their affordable housing needs. It can be done, but it must be with the assistance of the local authority and the recognition by Government that parish councils have a pivotal role.

<p><a name="st_225"><a name="60118-25_spnew7"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 With more eloquence than I could muster, my hon. Friend makes exactly the point that I was trying to make, for which I am grateful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_238">I want to consider planning in general because, as hon. Members from all parties have pointed out, it causes the most frustration for parish councillors, who feel that they simply do not get their point of view across. That happens even in the context of district councils, which are eager to hear local voices and effect their wishes. Somerset district council, which is one of two in my constituency, has led good practice. A long time ago, it established local area committees to devolve decision making lower than district council level to give local people an opportunity to be genuinely involved in planning decisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_239">Even in South Somerset, which I consider an example of good practice in planning, there are problems. That is largely due to the Government&#039;s targets and the requirement for increasing the speed of resolving planning decisions beyond what is appropriate for the sort of area that I represent. I shall explain that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_240">Clearly, it is not a bad thing for the Government to encourage district councils to make planning decisions as quickly as possible. It is reasonable to request that, but what is the consequence in respect of what district councils have to do to fulfil the Government&#039;s requirements? First, there is the 21-day consultation process. I shall revert to that shortly, but 21 days is not a long time for a parish council to convene a meeting to take the appropriate soundings from people in the community and to respond in due course. Parish councils often have less than 21 days, because they are not statutory consultees but are statutorily notified. Some may view that as patronising.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_241">Secondly, there is a lack of access to planners. They have enormous work loads and cannot provide the same care and consultation as formerly for parish councils, applicants or anybody else. A common complaint is that people no longer have the same access to professional planning advice that they once had.
</p>





<p><a name="st_226"><a name="60118-25_spnew8"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 It would be helpful if the Minister for Local Government would clarify the point in his reply, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 915</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>but I understand that a parish council is not a statutory consultee. Its role is even more subordinate than that. There is no requirement on the local authority to consult the parish council; it is consulted merely out of courtesy.
</p>





<p><a name="st_227"><a name="60118-25_spnew9"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right and I believe that I said that. Parish councils are not consultees in development control applications. I believe that they are statutory consultees on what is now called the local development framework, which I knew as the local plan. They must be notified, but no more, about development applications. They are not consultees in the same way as some others are.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_242">The scheme of delegation is another difficult matter. We all accept that, if we are to have an efficient planning system, not every application has to go before a full council committee. That does not make sense. However, in councils throughout the country, officers take more than 90 per cent. of the decisions. Applications do not get near elected members in committee, but are simply tackled by an officer, who may or may not be properly familiar with the concerns and needs of the local village.

<p>
<a name="60118-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_243">My hon. Friend&#039;s comments underline the fact that consultation nowadays is almost perceived as a threat rather than an opportunity for councils and, sometimes, the Government. The Government often say that they are looking for ways in which to engage and involve people in political processes, including the planning process. Yet one method has been under their noses for some time. The parish councils, along with an expanded statutory right to consultation, could provide an excellent way to engage more people. Before I became a Member of Parliament, I served as a parish councillor at one point in my career. I was close to my electorate and was engaged in local decision making on their behalf. We could even consider extending that principle to urban areas that are unparished. If we abandoned the word &quot;parish&quot; in such instances, more community or neighbourhood councils could have a similar statutory right to consultation.

<p><a name="st_229"><a name="60118-25_spnew11"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. When the Minister replies, he may well say that that is part of the Government&#039;s thinking, but I am not convinced that it is working and believe that there are serious difficulties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_244">We have touched on the code of conduct, which is an obstacle to common sense. Parish and district councillors may be unable to vote on planning issues. For example, people who wear different hats in the council may be barred from considering such issues. Of course, we need probity in local government, but common sense is required to enable the people who know the local community best to express an opinion on its behalf when they are elected to represent it, but sometimes there are difficulties in allowing them to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_245">There is a serious shortage of planners. It has become difficult to recruit planners in many district council planning offices, which has had knock-on effects on decision making and the quality of decisions. I recently 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 916</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>received a deputation of architects, who were concerned about being given different advice on different occasions. Their clients regard that as a reflection on their professional competence when, in fact, the planners gave them different advice on the same issue. Very often, grounds for refusal are tightly drawn. Parish councils are sometimes criticised for failing to understand what are, and what are not, valid grounds for refusal. If that is the case, better training should be provided for parish councils so that they do understand the difference, but we also need to be flexible about appropriate grounds. If a village has taken a great deal of trouble to determine what it wants for its future, and that has been agreed by all the residents, something that does not fit with its vision should be considered an important ground for refusal. Such considerations can are often ignored if they do not fall within narrow criteria.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_246">What can we do to improve the situation? We can improve the time scale for consultation and undertake genuine consultation with parish councils to reflect the fact that small rural parish councils are not local authorities that meet every week and employ staff to prepare their response to applications. We could do an awful lot more by developing IT links between parish councils and their local district councils so that they have a clear idea about the progress of a particular planning application and are given more opportunities to make observations on it during the process. I mentioned better training and it is appropriate to ensure that parish councillors have all the tools at their disposal to help them to make the right decisions. We need to address staffing issues in planning and, most of all, we must address the attitude of principal authorities, particularly district councils, so that they accept that parish councils have an important role to play as colleagues. Parish councils are partners in the planning process, not an irritation that gets in the way of quick decision making. It would be helpful if parish councils were treated as statutory consultees rather than as parties to be notified.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_247">There have been more extensive experiments. In Taunton Deane, for instance, there was a scheme of delegation to parish councils on minor planning decisions. Does the Minister have in mind something similar where there is an appropriate scheme of delegation? The responsibility remains with the principal authority, which is the certifying authority but, nevertheless, in the case of minor issues, which are often delegated to a junior officer, it would be better for a parish council, with its knowledge of what is right for the area, to play a role.

Does he accept that, because of their proximity to the environment concerned, parish councils are in an excellent position to monitor what is going on from the enforcement point of view?

<p><a name="st_231"><a name="60118-26_spnew1"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a valid point. I   applaud particularly what he said about enforcement, as it is often the parish council, rather than district council planners, that knows that something is not being done according to planning permission, and it should at least be able to instigate an appropriate remedy. On determining more decisions, the one drawback&#151;I agree strongly with him about the need to devolve as far as possible&#151;is that it would not be appropriate if the parish council could take the decision without any recourse to the district council while the district council maintained the risk in terms of cost on appeal or whatever. In the Taunton Deane experiment, there was   only one appeal, and that was successfully resisted. That was evidence that parish councils take such responsibilities extremely seriously. A balance must be struck.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_248">My last major point, on which I started with observations from Cranmore parish council, relates to village plans, which are an extraordinarily effective tool in many ways. For a start, they are wonderful at developing the coherence and good neighbourliness of the village. The village comes together as the parish council undertakes a genuinely consultative procedure to get people&#039;s views about the future of their village, what they wish to see and what they regard as the difficulties or deficiencies, in order to create a structure for the village&#039;s future. Time and again in villages in my constituency, I have seen the holistic value of that process, which allows people to have a real say in their future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_249">The Government promoted that process in the White Paper &quot;Our Countryside&quot;, which stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;local communities have a real opportunity to influence the nature and quality of future development . . . and providing their Plan is consistent with the Local development plan, and the relevant national planning guidance, the design and land use aspects can be endorsed by the planning authority as Supplementary Planning Guidance.&quot;</p>
</ul>

<a name="60118-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_250">That was backed up by planning policy statement 1, &quot;Delivering Sustainable Development&quot;, which supports the role of parish plans in encouraging town and parish councils to develop full and active community involvement in their areas, and PPS 12, &quot;Creating Local Development Frameworks&quot;, which urges local authorities to

<a name="stpa_252">I am therefore concerned that the document, &quot;Community Involvement in Planning: The Government&#039;s Objectives&quot;, published in 2004, contains no recognition of the role of parish plans whatever.

Extensive research published by the Countryside Agency saw the merits of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Jan 2006 : Column 918</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>village plans as a tool for seeking project funding, influencing changes, strengthening the democratic mandate and providing impetus for local community action, but did not find that they had an effective role in influencing planning decisions by the district council. Most planning departments that were consulted considered it unrealistic to expect parish plans to fit into the development planning system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_253">That is a serious issue. Parishes in my area are frustrated. Many villages that went to much trouble to produce glossy documents such as the Somerton town plan, which I have here&#151;there are also plans for Norton St. Philip and Henstridge&#151;are ignored far too often when it comes to development control planning.

No wonder parish councillors, parish councils and the communities that they serve feel frustrated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_256">If the Government contend that parish plans are a significant part of the planning process, as I think they should be, and if such plans represent the will of the local community, which they clearly do, surely they should have a much clearer status in the decisions made by planning officers and district planning committees, so that they are given effect. Does the Minister agree with that? If so, what will he do to change what appears to be the current position?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_257">Until the village plan is recognised by the planning inspector as a material consideration, district councils will not take notice of it. As long as we maintain an adversarial system of planning in which the views of the parish council are seen as being simply the views of one contestant in a competition, they will have no effect. If they are seen as the genuine voice of the community, deriving from a partnership between the planning authority and the local community, they will have a real effect.

We struggle with three-tier local government, which helps nobody.

<a name="stpa_260">I should at this point declare an interest. In 1987, I   was elected as a parish councillor in my Stonehouse community, which became a town about three years   later. I am still a town councillor, and for that entire 18-year period I have been on the planning and transportation committee, so I have some expertise in these areas. I shall not bore the House with the details of the meetings that I have attended, but I thoroughly enjoy them and I have yet to be kicked off, or fail to be elected to, that very important body.

Gentleman did not touch on, but which are also important in their own right, such as rural community councils and the National Association of Local Councils. Through the work of people such as John Findlay and Michael Green, the NALC represents local councils at national level. I should also like to mention the University of Gloucestershire, which has done a great deal to help to support parish and town councils.

<p>
<a name="60118-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_262">I welcome the fact that local councils&#151;parish or town councils&#151;can still make planning representations. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, they take two forms: reaction to planning applications, and a more strategic interpretation of the way in which local councils can influence the planning process, which, as he says, is becoming part of the local development framework. When this Government were first elected, the official Opposition said that it was part of the Government&#039;s plan to remove parish councils, but it is the Government who have fostered a relationship with parish councils, funded the planning process to make it more effective, and made local democracy, to which they have a longstanding commitment, genuinely work, for reasons that I hope to explain.

<a name="60118-26_para15">
<a name="stpa_263">As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, the planning application process gives rise to frustration; it would be nice to be listened to by councils further up the line. The problem lies not just with immediate planning applications; there is also the question of minerals policy and waste policy, for example, which currently reside with county councils. It is important that such policies be taken into account, because they have a dramatic impact. In my constituency, waste is a huge issue, and in that regard it is particularly important to find ways of vesting more responsibility at local level.

That was not followed through, as some matters can be very sensitive&#151;after all, turning down applications can cause reverberations when one meets the people who made them in the street or pub. That can be difficult, but I   support greater delegation and believe that the DETR was on to something. Those were also the days of the rural White Paper, through which the Government extended local democracy, and made funding available for it.

A compromise was mooted that would have allowed them to turn up but say nothing&#151;an interesting interpretation of local democracy&#151;but in the end the district council changed its mind. As a result, I am pleased to say that parish and town councils retain a role in site inspections.

I   have always argued the case for unitary authorities with a clear relationship with parish and town councils. One of the banes of the life of a parish councillor is the fact that they have to deal with two larger authorities, one somewhat more divorced by distance than the other. The games played between those layers of local government mean the parish councillor often finds himself pushed between pillar and post. That is as true of the planning process as it is of many other parts of local democracy. I should welcome any drive towards sorting that out.

Does he accept, however, that one of the weaknesses associated with that can be that there are unparished urban areas within district and borough council areas?

I have spoken on those courses on many occasions because I happen to be local. That is the way forward&#151;to build expertise and get people to stand for election without feeling vulnerable or as though their time is being wasted. That will lead to a better planning process. In the end, we all want a planning process that is fair, transparent and works as quickly as possible so that people get a decision. In some cases that will be a refusal, because the planning process should not be a   pushover. There should not be a presumption in favour of approval. As the hon.

An example is that of Barton Seagrave in Kettering borough which, until a few years ago, was not a parished area and had no parish council. A campaign was started to parish Barton Seagrave and, after a long process involving the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, permission was eventually granted and Barton Seagrave had its parish council. I am delighted to say that the Conservatives have a majority on it.

<a name="stpa_281">Recently, a major planning application was made by the supermarket firm Morrisons to build one of its largest warehouses in the country on the border between Barton Seagrave parish council and Burton Latimer parish council. The Morrisons development was a good thing for Burton Latimer parish council, as it brought jobs and enterprise to the area. However, it threatened to cause all sorts of problems for the residents of Barton Seagrave, not least the possibility of heavy traffic flows along residential streets, particularly Polwell lane. The parish council, especially Mr. and Mrs. Arthur and Margaret Mitchelson, put in a tremendous amount of work representing the concerns of local residents about the planning application. About 1,500 letters of objection flooded into Kettering borough council, such was the outrage locally, but it was effectively channelled by the parish council and other local protest groups into extremely constructive local meetings, one of which I   attended at Latimer arts college in Barton Seagrave, where about 800 local residents heard a briefing on the planning application from borough council planning officers and others.

 Borough councillors in Kettering and elsewhere who are listening to the debate might suggest that the meetings led by parish councillors that the hon.

The ward also includes the villages of Grafton Underwood, Warkton, Weekley and Rushton. Cranford and its residents face a serious threat from planning due to the ODPM&#039;s Milton Keynes and south midlands sub-regional spatial strategy, which proposes for Kettering borough the construction of 13,100 houses by 2021. That will increase the number of houses in the borough by about a third in the next 15 years. That is a very serious issue for everyone who lives in the locality, but it is particularly serious for the good residents of Cranford and for Cranford parish council, because it is likely that a very large proportion of those 13,100 houses will be built in Cranford parish, effectively between the built-up area of Kettering and Cranford. Cranford parish council is, sadly, like a minnow in a sea of sharks, given such a major development issue.

Of course, with that comes the twin-pronged problem of parishing an area and then having to admit to the councils in that area that they have no powers and the fact that the councillors who end up serving on those councils and on higher-tier authorities are compromised as a result of becoming engaged in any of the more important issues that the parish councils consider, as was exposed in an intervention by the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor).

<a name="60118-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_288">The issue that we are debating has not suddenly sprung up in recent years: an honourable tradition goes back before William Godwin, Kropotkin, Cobbett and, more latterly, Schumacher, all of whom emphasised the importance of giving communities a genuine say in the   conduct of their affairs. In fact, that honourable tradition is exemplified by the way in which parish councils operate when they are at their best and by the way in which we as politicians want communities to have a genuine influence on the conduct of their affairs in taking that issue further forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_289">The hon. Member for Stroud has now returned to the Chamber. He referred to Stephen Wright, the director of Gloucestershire rural community council and a good friend of mine. I think that Stephen Wright stole the words to which the hon. Gentleman referred from me. Many years ago, I went to Action with Communities in Rural England, and I often said that parish councils were the highest tier of government because they were closest to the people, and thus in a better position to reflect people&#039;s interests. I am sure that I nicked the idea from someone else&#151;probably Stephen Wright&#151;but we can argue about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_290">At their worst, parish councils are open forums for settling local scores and pursuing narrow parochial interests and do not help the greater good of the local community. However, when they operate at their best, as they do on most occasions throughout my constituency&#151;this can be said of local authorities of different levels&#151;they represent the best interests of their communities extremely well. Such councils are in the best position to take decisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_291">The Government have to make important decisions both on the unfinished business of devolution and on the related matter of the role of parish councils. If the Government genuinely think that devolution is a process of letting go instead of holding on for dear life and realise that it is appropriate to devolve a number of powers further down the authority spectrum, they must recognise that they can negotiate a business case for parish councils taking on a range of decision-making responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_292">Such responsibilities might include planning. My hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome cited the example of Taunton Deane, as well as the situation in other districts and boroughs. That demonstrates that parish councils are in a good position to monitor situations&#151;district councils are incapable of doing that. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>They would be in an especially good position to monitor the enforcement of conservation measures and whether all properties in a parish had appropriate planning permission before work was carried out on extensions, for example. Planning law is flouted to a great extent, so parish councils could take on the responsibility for addressing the problem from higher-tier authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_293">I take on board my hon. Friend&#039;s point about risk. Parish councils could be at legal and financial risk if they took decisions on matters that another authority might delegate to them. It would be possible to make a business case for establishing a system through which parish councils would fully understand their legal and financial responsibilities when taking decisions. If the district council engaged in the process, it could supply parish councils with any appropriate professional assistance and expertise that was required. It is not beyond the wit of man or woman to create a system of delegation that would work. Parish councils are in a much stronger position than other authorities to discharge duties on a whole load of matters, including planning, environmental matters and waste management.

 The hon. Gentleman would have heard my hon.

It is not unknown in parts of Leicestershire for parish councillors to resent and resist the greater formality on which clerks rightly insist, so tensions can grow, sometimes to the point of fracture.

<a name="stpa_294">I know that local planning issues, in particular, can be tremendously highly charged.

<a name="stpa_295">Turning to circumstances in which it is appropriate to take decisions locally, I have a good example in my constituency, on the Isles of Scilly. The population is 2,000, considerably smaller than that of many parishes, but the council has more powers than a county, district and parish council rolled into one&#151;it is also the water authority and the airport authority. There are many lessons to be learned from the Isles of Scilly, and if the Government are thinking seriously, as I hope they are, about devolving powers to parish level, they should look at that exemplar. On the Isles of Scilly, all planning decisions, as far as the Government and the new,

Nevertheless, along with policies in the local planning authority&#039;s local development documents, and any relevant national guidance, the input from parish councils on individual planning applications continues to help planning decision makers to shape our communities and the built environment in a sustainable way.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) mentioned the code of conduct. The House should know that the revisions to the code of conduct and the standards and ethical regime are out for consultation at the moment. My own view is that the worries that were expressed when the code was first introduced in relation to parishes have not been realised, and that things have become steadier. There is an acceptance that we need an ethical code of conduct for parish councillors, but I accept that, if petty matters are getting in the way and causing undue concern, we should be made aware of that.

<a name="stpa_301">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome made a number of big points and asked several specific questions. I shall try to answer them, but if I do not do so, I am sure that he will tell me. His argument about marginal seats was interesting, and it is one with which I am familiar. I can confirm that turnout can be increased in such seats. However, it does not necessary follow that parish council seats will be marginal. I work closely with two parishes in my constituency, and I hope that they benefit from that relationship as much as I do. Furthermore, I am not sure that planning authorities on the whole ignore parish councils. From my experience, I suspect that the two bodies concur on the vast majority of decisions, although attention is inevitably paid to those cases in which there is a disagreement. I do not have any research on that point, however, so I cannot back that assertion up.

<a name="stpa_302">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, and other hon. Members, also mentioned the quality and   training of parish councillors and parish clerks. The Government are addressing that issue with funding, as well as with policies. Several hon. Members mentioned the future debate on unitary authorities. We have made our views on that process very clear. I want to reassure all hon. Members who have spoken tonight that two factors will be at the core of the debate about whether an area should be unitary. One is that we ask the opinion of the area concerned. The second is that we ensure that the empowerment of the third tier&#151;the neighbourhoods, including parishes or other parts of urban areas&#151;is key to the policy. I take the advice not to tinker with traditional boundaries. I represent Saddleworth, so I am aware, although perhaps less so than the hon. Gentleman, of that important point.

Gentleman will recognise that there is a time lag, but he makes a valid point.

 Planning officers in rural areas need to be both proactive and sensitive, which we hope are not mutually exclusive.

People have the right to expect that their views will be taken into consideration and listened to.

We want to see more of that and an acknowledgment that money has gone into the development of the village plans. I am grateful to my hon.

He also raised an interesting point, which I shall take away, that a parish should be a planning authority. He also suggested that the parish has a role in enforcing planning decisions and planning law, which is a powerful point. He wants other powers for parishes and cited the example of the Isles of Scilly, which are in my mind at the moment because they are recipients of the formula grant in the local government settlement&#151;they will receive &#163;67,375.

Prompt decision making with no loss of quality is only one element of the planning services we want local authorities to provide. Communities deserve openness and transparency of process and of decision making. The latter must go further than simple compliance with the consultation arrangements laid down in the law. Improving the planning system is also predicated on increased public participation in the process, whether by individuals, by groups or by bodies such as the parish council.

There is also independent examination of the statement of community involvement. A local planning authority must comply with its statement.

<p>
<a name="60118-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_315">The performance targets that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister sets for the handling of planning applications have no bearing on the legal requirement that local planning authorities consult parishes and await their representations. Local planning authorities reach their decisions on planning applications in accordance with their local development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. They should give due weight to any other relevant factors. In a particular case, the view expressed by the parish council could be one such factor. The law says that a local planning authority is not allowed to determine an application within 21 days of notifying a parish council. In other words, once it has notified the parish council, it has to allow at least 21 days before it can determine an application so as to allow it time to comment on those applications that it has asked to be told about.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_316">Let me deal with the question of the law and parish councils. A parish council indicates to a local planning authority which type or category of applications it wishes to be notified about. It is then a statutory duty on the planning authority to notify the parish and wait 21 days for any representations by it. The Government are convinced of the value of involving parish councils in this way by inviting their comments on any relevant planning application. A parish council&#039;s representations are not binding on the local planning authority. That would, in effect, pass the responsibility for determining planning applications to parish councils in all cases in which they were consulted. In the first instance, the decision maker remains the district or borough council or unitary authority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-29_para13">
<a name="stpa_317">Those authorities have to act in what they deem to be the broader public interest, as well as having regard to planning law, when determining an application. The broader public interest may involve education and other important services. The hon.

The Government question whether that is appropriate, but in doing so we encourage, through policy and the levers that are available, greater consultation with parishes.

<a name="stpa_320">From time to time, a parish council&#039;s comments on a specific scheme may conflict with other considerations and it is for the local planning authority to decide which of the conflicting views should prevail. In the broad framework of the law, local planning authorities devise their own detailed arrangements for handling responses to consultation. It would be unnecessarily prescriptive to set out in legislation the subject matter and form of consultations between local planning authorities and parish councils. Instead, consultation procedures are established on the basis of voluntary agreements, which are better able to reflect the circumstances of the relevant local councils. When disputes arise, they can and should be resolved locally.

<a name="stpa_321">I suppose I point to the obvious paradox that, in attempting to get local authorities to devolve to local people, if the Government insist on how that should be   done, the policy can hardly be described as decentralised. Nevertheless, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister regards the delegation of suitable decisions to officers as an effective way sometimes of improving timeliness of decision making, which is why the Department encourages all local authorities to adopt a comprehensive system of delegation.

<a name="60118-29_para18">
<a name="stpa_322">Decisions can be delegated to officers only by the elected members, so it is the latter who determine, for example, the terms on which a delegated agreement operates, the level of member involvement and the circumstances in which an officer&#039;s delegated power to make a decision may not be exercised.

That included reviewing the delegation scheme and the existing arrangements for consultation with parish councils.

<p>
<a name="60118-29_para23">
<a name="stpa_327">Last year, the council introduced a &quot;by exception&quot; scheme of delegation. Many local planning authorities have operated voluntarily a procedure whereby a significant disagreement between planning staff and the incoming opinions of a parish council would cause the matter to be sent to committee for determination, even if the case is of a type or scale that would normally be delegated to a planning officer for decision. By contrast, the &quot;by exception&quot; principle means that all applications are delegated unless specific criteria are met.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-29_para24">
<a name="stpa_328">The effect of the model is that it removes the hitherto automatic referral of planning applications for consideration by the planning committee where a parish council&#039;s comments differ from the view put forward by the council&#039;s planning department.

<a name="stpa_329">Although the &quot;by exception&quot; model may have aroused the fear of a loss of influence at parish level, I   should emphasise that the model is very much in line with the approach that is endorsed by the LGA/ODPM guidance, which I have already mentioned. In 2004, 85 per cent. of applications in South Somerset district council were dealt with under delegated powers. The council considered that that needed to be increased to 90 per cent. but, as I have said, there is no such performance target from us.

 It is important to say for the record that I have received more complaints from parish councils about the planning system in Mendip district council than in South Somerset district council.

 I thought that the hon. Gentleman was going to say that. I am trying to be helpful, and explain the process. I will try to be brief, as I appreciate that I   have more time than usual.

<p>
<a name="60118-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_330">Applications can now be published immediately on an authority&#039;s website, which means that we can consult parish councils and other bodies more quickly, as the hon. Gentleman hinted. The time scales can therefore be improved by the use of the new technology. As everyone agrees, parish councils play a key role in the planning process. There is disagreement in some instances between the case officer and a parish council but, as I   have said, many councils still consider such cases in committee. It is entirely possible to reform the culture of the service at both member and officer level to reflect the need for speedy, good-quality and transparent decisions while retaining public confidence in the integrity of the decision-making process.

<br>&nbsp;<br>community&#039;s needs, and sets out the way in which they might be tackled. The local planning authority should always take account of the existence of such parish plans and other village plans when designing the local development schemes that set out their programme of plan making in their areas. Parish plans and village plans provide useful evidence of rural issues and may suggest suitable options for rural areas when development plans are drawn up. Parishes can then request the local planning authority to publicise, consult on, and adopt those elements of parish plans that elaborate on development plan policy as supplementary planning documents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_332">Considerable voluntary effort goes into making parish plans, as we all know. Naturally, local communities do not want to feel that their efforts have had no result. If adopted as a supplementary planning document, a parish&#039;s vision of its future can take its place within the local development framework as a consideration to be given due weight whenever relevant development proposals are under discussion. It is important to emphasise that parish councils must involve themselves fully from the start in the preparation of their local authority&#039;s development plan documents. As the hon. Gentleman will know, there are about 120 parishes in his district of South Somerset. I   am afraid I cannot remember how many there are in Mendip, but there is a substantial number of parish councils. South Somerset district council is confident that those parish councils will continue to receive a good service from its development control team, including attendance by individual officers at parish council meetings where appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_333">Allowing parishes to become planning decision makers would, as I have suggested, be prohibitively expensive. The Government do not intend to take that route for that reason and the others that I have outlined. In our view, the present mechanisms&#151;I acknowledge that they do not always work perfectly and to people&#039;s satisfaction&#151;form the right model, and give ample opportunity for a parish to reach a view and for that view to be taken into account. No one in local government should wish to antagonise their communities with unnecessary and insensitive development. It is unlikely that teething problems that may arise in particular delegation schemes cannot be sorted out by the relevant local authority under its own protocols within the existing framework of law and guidance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_334">I know that some might feel that delegation to officers means that they lose the opportunity to see applications debated in public. They might take a similar line, however, when a proposal is passed to an area committee for determination instead of to the full planning committee. Nevertheless, it seems to me that the type of delegation schemes that I have described are transparent, with a clear audit trail, and there is still a discretion to send a proposal to the committee if appropriate&#151;for instance, where a scheme is controversial. The only real change is loss of automatic referral to the committee where parish views conflict with those of the designated officer. In that regard, I   think that the balance is right.

<a name="stpa_335">I am genuinely grateful to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome for giving us the opportunity to have this debate. I indicated that I would try to answer all his questions.

 The Minister has given an extremely full response, for which I am grateful. I do not want to prolong the debate further, but will he address specifically the point about village plans and how they are treated in planning terms, because many of my villages that have produced village plans feel strongly that they ought to have a more significant status in terms of arriving at development control decisions?

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, and I will put the matter on the record for the benefit of his constituents and others who might be interested.

<p>
<a name="60118-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_336">Under the new system, supplementary planning documents have statutory status, although they are not part of the statutory development plan. We are still in a transitional phase. To ensure that authorities can continue to have supplementary material in place, PPS 12 states that, as part of the transitional arrangements, supplementary planning guidance can continue to supplement &quot;saved&quot; development plan policies and will remain while &quot;saved&quot; policies are in place. However, supplementary planning guidance will need to be replaced by supplementary planning documents when new development plan documents are adopted replacing &quot;saved&quot; policies. I ask the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome to bear with me, as it does make sense.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_337">Supplementary planning documents form part of the new local development framework. They have greater weight than the old supplementary guidance because they have complied with the requirements for community involvement and sustainability appraisal and conform with the development plan policy. Therefore, more power is given to supplementary planning documents than under the old system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60118-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_338">Parish plans can add value by expressing a greater level of detail than is possible in development plan documents. While parish plans may be adopted as a supplementary planning document, that is not to be seen as the norm. Technically, a supplementary planning document has to supplement a development plan document policy. Turning parish plans into supplementary planning documents is likely to be time-consuming. In South Somerset, for example, the small planning department is trying to prioritise housing delivery and regeneration, so there are tensions. Parish plans are in the nature of community planning, and only when requirements such as public involvement and sustainability appraisal have been met may the spatial planning components, possibly modified, be adoptable. That is the policy outline for the parish plan. I see that

<p>
<a name="60118-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_339">Parish planning is a tried and tested tool for strengthening local democracy and engaging citizens in how their local area and services are managed. During the past four years, nearly 3,000 parishes have been producing 1,250 parish plans, and when one bears in mind that many of those are in clusters, the extent of their geographical coverage is clear. From 2001 to 2005, parish plans were delivered and supported by the Countryside Agency, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has made available more than &#163;1 million for parish plans this year, and will continue offering support for parish plans and parish councils from 2006 through the rural social and   community programme. Rural community councils allocate grants for villages to produce a parish plan of up to &#163;5,000. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome will be pleased to know that some parish plans have been adopted as supplementary planning documents, and can provide a valuable evidence base for decision makers.

I hope that I have been able to convince the House of the Government&#039;s genuine intention of involving parishes and parish councils in decision-making.

<a name="stpa_344">&quot;We need to find a solution to the agency&#039;s problems, because in many cases parents are just not facing up to their responsibilities to their children. Worse still, a significant number of parents actively avoid paying maintenance. Some go to extraordinary lengths to do so, leaving their jobs, constantly changing address or leaving the country as soon as the agency gets close. Whatever we do in the future, the fact remains that it is the overriding responsibility of non-resident parents to support their children financially. We need to revisit the fundamental questions of what we are trying to achieve and whether we have the right tools with which to do it. Where we do not have the right tools, or they are not in the right place, we need to put together a robust plan to fix the problem&#151;and that is exactly what we are doing.&quot;
