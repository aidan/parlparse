Alan Williams (Swansea, West) (Lab):</b> To state the obvious,
I am delighted that the Bill has reached this stage, because if it
completes Third Reading, it will have time to clear all its stages in
the House of Lords and will, I hope, be enacted. The fact that it has
reached Third Reading is due to support not only from its sponsors, but
from hon. Members on both sides of the House. Indeed, the hon. Member
for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross) drew my attention to the
Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005, on which I based my original
Bill. My Bill has all-party sponsors; moreover, at every stage we have
had all-party support, including from Opposition spokesmen, and I am
grateful for
that.</p><p><a name="06071459000071">I
should like to cite two individuals in particular. I suffer from the
great disadvantage in the House of Commons of not being a lawyer, so it
was invaluable to receive the assistance of my hon. Friend the Member
for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), who is not always associated with a
benevolent approach towards private Members&#146; Bills, and my hon.
Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry),
both of whom gave legal advice and support when I was in negotiations.
As those who followed the progress of the Bill from the start will
know, the provisions in the Scottish Bill were much wider, and there
were negotiations with the Home Office and others to try to ensure that
a similarly wide-ranging Bill was introduced in the
House.</p><p><a name="06071459000072"><b><a name="06071459000683">Mr.
David Kidney (Stafford) (Lab):</b> My right hon. Friend
mentions our hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore); hon.
Members might think it unusual that he is not in his place on a Friday,
especially as he is a sponsor of the Bill, as my right hon. Friend
says. I think that my hon. Friend would want it to be known that he is
attending a funeral, which keeps him from his business in the
House.</p><p><a name="06071459000073"><b><a name="06071459000684">Mr.
Williams:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon explained
that to me personally,
too.</p><p><a name="06071459000074">After
negotiations with the Home Office, the Bill became not only shorter but
clearer. My only regret, if I may make a personal comment, is that the
great scourge of private Members&#146; Bills, as I described him in
Committee, Eric Forth, is not here today. I do not think that my Bill
was a unique case, but Eric actually suggested that he supported its
intentions. I pointed out to him in a slightly mischievous way that his
only objection was exactly the one espoused by the Home Office. I felt
that that combined opposition was too much for me to take on, and so we
are considering a truncated Bill. The Bill has been welcomed by the
emergency services. Strangely enough, it has been welcomed in Northern
Ireland, too, which has asked for the Bill to apply there, because it
has no such provisions on ambulance workers.</p><br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1595</b><br><p><a name="06071459000075">The Bill
addresses the offence of impeding emergency workers. It is based on two
straightforward, simple principles. First, people who risk their lives
to save others should not be obstructed, and should be free to
undertake their rescue work without obstruction and attack by yobs and
idiots. Secondly, people who need to be rescued in an emergency because
they are in danger should not face additional danger because of the
mindless activity of a minority of idiots. Rescue work is essentially a
team operation, and it is important that the team operate together. If
part of the team is dislocated, the team does not work as effectively,
so victims could be at greater danger. Sadly, that has become more
important now, because of the threat of terrorist
attacks.</p><p><a name="06071459000076">On
Second Reading, I mentioned the unbelievable conduct of some people,
and I will reiterate a few examples. Greater Manchester fire and rescue
service helped to lead a campaign on the subject, with the prompting
and help of the <i> Manchester Evening News</i>. The fire and rescue
service reports as many as 200 incidents a year of impeding and
assault. Barry Dixon, who gave me considerable briefings on the Bill,
told me of incidents from across the country of pipes being cut to stop
the water supply. That is the least of the imaginative devices that
some thugs use. Stoning is not unknown, and scaffold poles have even
been driven through the windscreens of fire tenders. Fires have been
lit deliberately as an ambush to lure the fire services to places where
the thugs are waiting for them. Once inside, firemen find such refined
tactics as razorblades fixed underneath banisters, so that as they try
to haul their equipment upstairs their hands are severely
injured.</p><p><a name="06071459000077">There was an
instance of live electric wiring being fixed to the inside of a door,
so that the firemen trying to reach the source of the fire were in
danger of electrocution. In the most grotesque case, in a multi-floor
building, a hole in the floor was covered with a mat, like a bear trap,
so that firemen coming in were in danger of plummeting to the floor
below. That is the sort of dangerous nonsense that our rescue services
have to
endure.</p><p><a name="06071459000078">The
Bill&#146;s provisions are wide-ranging. Clause 1 covers
firefighters, rescue services, ambulance workers, including air
ambulance workers, and voluntary organisations. I stress the latter,
because some people were afraid that voluntary organisations were
omitted. As Opposition Front Benchers proposed in Committee, clause 2
covers individuals who come to the help of the emergency services. The
Bill covers the coastguard, lifeboat crews, and people transporting
blood, organs and medical and rescue equipment to the site of an
emergency. That is a list of provisions in the Bill, but the trouble
with lists is that they are not always accurate and do not always fully
reflect need. For that reason, we have built in a safeguard clause,
which means that the list is not conclusive. That safeguard
clause&#151;clause 5&#151;allows the Minister by order to add or
remove categories of workers that they think need to be added. That
builds in flexibility, so that we can act if the idiots find new
targets.</p><p><a name="06071459000079"><b><a name="06071459000685">Dan
Norris (Wansdyke) (Lab):</b> Can my right hon. Friend
elaborate on other groups of workers who, although not usually
considered emergency service providers, none the less fall into that
category in some 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1596</b><br>situations? Examples include approved social workers when they are
sectioning people, and child protection officers when they have to
remove children from danger. Can my right hon. Friend clarify the scope
of the
provision?</p><p><a name="06071459000080"><b><a name="06071459000686">Mr.
Williams:</b> As I said, the Bill was truncated in
negotiations. We have built in the option under the order-making powers
so that any organisation or group of workers who feel they should be
covered by the Bill may make representations to the Home Office, and it
would be a relatively simple matter for the Home Office to add any
group to the list. We have kept options open. I do not pretend that the
list is
comprehensive.</p><p><a name="06071459000081"><b><a name="06071459000687">Mrs.
Betty Williams (Conwy) (Lab):</b> On similar lines, one
important service that has not been covered, unless I have missed
something, is the air rescue service, which is extremely important in
Snowdonia, as my right hon. Friend knows, where climbers and others get
lost on the
mountains.</p><p><a name="06071459000082"><b><a name="06071459000688">Mr.
Williams:</b> I should have thought that that service was
covered, especially as it operates within the country, rather than at
sea. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that with the help of his memory
box, which Ministers have and the rest of us are
denied.</p><p><a name="06071459000083"><b><a name="06071459000689">Barbara
Keeley (Worsley) (Lab):</b> Most of us know that excellent
services are provided by volunteers. Mountain rescue crews are often
volunteers. I was recently at an open day event in my constituency
where St. John Ambulance volunteers were in attendance. They often help
at such events, as well as at football matches and on many other
occasions. Will non-professionals carrying out such health-providing
services be covered? We know that St. John Ambulance in particular
provides a vast amount of those
services.</p><p><a name="06071459000084"><b><a name="06071459000690">Mr.
Williams:</b> At this stage, it is not possible to amend the
Bill, but I am sure the Minister is listening to representations and
would be glad to receive back-up representations from the organisations
and groups
involved.</p><p><a name="06071459000085">The penalty
was in dispute on Second Reading. In my original Bill, which was based
on the Scottish Act, the maximum penalty was a fine of &#163;5,000.
At that stage the Home Office was minded to reduce that to
&#163;1,000, which I was not exactly happy about. Fortunately, as a
result of discussions and negotiations within and outside Government,
the &#163;5,000 penalty has been restored, which was welcomed by the
fire service.</p><p><a name="06071459000086">The
other aspect addressed in Committee was defences. The Scottish Act, on
which I originally based my Bill, listed defences. It was pointed out,
correctly, as I said in connection with my safeguard clause, that lists
are not comprehensive. The Home Office offered the suggestion, which I
accepted, that instead we should resort to the concept of
reasonableness. That is a fairly standard process in law. A person
would be guilty of impeding if he impeded without reasonable excuse.
For example, a reasonable excuse would be that he did not realise that
someone was an emergency worker. This change from the specific list to
what I call the catch-all phrase was unanimously endorsed in
Committee.</p><br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1597</b><br><p><a name="06071459000087">The Bill is relatively simple
and straightforward. I hope there are now few areas where there is
grave disagreement. The Bill that has evolved is better and clearer
than the one that I originally proposed to the House, and I commend it
to the
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000625">10.4
am</h5><p><a name="06071459000088"><b><a name="06071459000691">Richard
Younger-Ross (Teignbridge) (LD):</b> I congratulate the right
hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) on the progress that he
has made in steering his Bill to Third Reading. I agree with most of
the sentiments that he expressed. The Bill will unquestionably make
life easier and allow prosecutions for hindrance of
services.</p><p><a name="06071459000089">In
reply to two of the points that were raised, the air ambulance service
is specifically covered under the Bill where it is operating at the
request of the national health service. Where it is not operating in
such circumstances, the position is unclear. Perhaps the Minister needs
to address that. According to my reading of the Bill, mountain rescue
services are not mentioned and therefore would not be covered by the
Bill. Again, that is an omission that the Minister may wish to reflect
on, in view of the powers that he is
granted.</p><p><a name="06071459000090">In
his usual self-effacing way, the right hon. Member for Swansea, West
said the Bill is far better than it was when he started. In some ways,
it is. All Bills improve through the Committee stage. Sadly, as we
discussed in Committee, some important elements and opportunities have
been missed by the Government and the Home Office, particularly the
opportunity to put an assault on an emergency worker on the same level
of seriousness as an assault on the police. That would have been in the
original Bill and is in the legislation in Scotland. A Liberal Democrat
amendment to the Scottish Bill which specifically included social
workers engaged in child work or sectioning was accepted by the Labour
party in Scotland. That was all removed from this Bill by the
Government because they thought it was not compatible with English
legislation. It was an argument that I understood but did not
necessarily agree
with.</p><p><a name="06071459000091">We wish the Bill
further progress and look forward to its being enacted and becoming
law. I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman once again on pushing it
forward.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000626">10.7
am</h5><p><a name="06071459000092"><b><a name="06071459000692">Clive
Efford (Eltham) (Lab):</b> I add my congratulations to my
right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams). He was
kind enough to ask me to be a sponsor of the Bill, but with his
experience of the procedures of the House it was not the most onerous
task to support his Bill as he is so capable of steering it through all
its stages. It is no surprise that it has reached Third Reading this
morning.</p><p><a name="06071459000093">When
my right hon. Friend moved Third Reading, he mentioned Eric Forth, my
former constituency neighbour in Bromley, and the fact that he was
fortunate enough to have Eric Forth&#146;s support for the intent of
his Bill. I pay tribute to Eric Forth as a formidable opponent and a
regular at our sittings on a Friday morning. My two Bills on
environmental measures, which I fought for several years to get through
the House, always fell on 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1598</b><br>what became known as Eric Forth&#146;s killing fields for private
Members&#146; Bills. I had to sit silently as he eloquently talked
them into oblivion. I am pleased to say that elements of one of my
Bills have been resurrected in the legislation on home information
packs, but sadly not with my name on them. None the less, Eric Forth
was a formidable person who will be missed at our Friday morning
debates.</p><p><a name="06071459000094">It is
surprising that we need to address the issue that is covered by the
Bill. We have had emergency workers for many years and the problem is
not new, but the Bill will be welcomed by those
workers.</p><p><a name="06071459000095">I understand
that accident and emergency workers have been excluded from the Bill.
It is arguable that in their daily work they frequently need
immediately to respond to the needs of people who have been brought in
for care and attention, and obstructing accident and emergency workers
can have catastrophic consequences for people who need their attention.
I accept that accident and emergency workers work in buildings and that
they are often supported by security guards, but they face a great deal
of aggression for no apparent reason. I have witnessed such behaviour
when I have accompanied people to accident and emergency. The
obstruction of such workers should be dealt with more severely, and the
situation would be simplified if the Bill applied to them,
too.</p><p><a name="06071459000096">The
Government&#146;s respect agenda, although not directly addressed by
the Bill, is part of what the Bill seeks to achieve because it is
better to prevent emergency workers from being obstructed or attacked
while carrying out their duties in the first place. I commend the work
of the Metropolitan police, the fire service and others to explain to
young people the dangers posed by things that they do sometimes for a
lark and the consequences for other people if they impede emergency
workers. That approach includes explaining to young people the
importance of the work done by emergency workers and the dangers to
which emergency workers expose themselves in addition to the problem of
their possibly being attacked. That helps young people to address
antisocial behaviour in the wider community and gets them to understand
the consequences of their actions for not only emergency workers, but
people who need emergency services.</p><p><a name="06071459000097"><b><a name="06071459000693">Dan
Norris:</b> Does my hon. Friend accept that although the Bill
is welcome and positive in many respects, other aspects of Government
legislation are making a huge difference to, for example, the number of
assaults experienced by NHS staff? The number of assaults against
nurses has drastically reduced in recent years because of other aspects
of Government business.</p><p><a name="06071459000098"><b><a name="06071459000694">Clive
Efford:</b> I am grateful for that intervention, but I will
not pursue it, because I can see that Mr. Deputy Speaker thinks that
that would stray too far from the Bill. Nevertheless, we need to
address the antisocial behaviour that has made this Bill necessary. The
Government are addressing that point through the respect agenda, which
has my full support. I commend the work that has been done, but I
believe that we need to invest more money to minimise the number of
times that the Bill is used to protect emergency
workers.</p><br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1599</b><br><p><a name="06071459000099"><b><a name="06071459000695">Mr.
Kidney:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend that education is
important in preventing the obstruction of emergency workers. Does he
agree that it is still important for Parliament to pass this law, which
sends a message to young people that the matter is so serious that
there is a specific offence of obstructing emergency
workers?</p><p><a name="06071459000100"><b><a name="06071459000696">Clive
Efford:</b> Yes; the Bill is necessary. As I have said, it is
surprising that the gap in the law still exists and that we still need
to simplify the law regarding firefighters. Although existing measures
can be used against those who obstruct firefighters, the Bill
simplifies the procedure and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for
Swansea, West has said, covers other emergency workers, such as
ambulance workers&#151;I am surprised that they have not included
before&#151;and
coastguards.</p><p><a name="06071459000101">The
Bill is necessary, and the emergency workers and public sector workers
whom it covers will welcome it. As has been said in this House on
numerous occasions, emergency workers risk their well-being when they
attend emergencies and protect the public. They do an enormous amount
of good work in our local communities, and they deserve the cover of
the Bill if they are impeded in doing so. Once again, I congratulate my
right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West on successfully piloting
the Bill through the
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000627">10.16
pm</h5><p><a name="06071459000102"><b><a name="06071459000697">Barbara
Keeley (Worsley) (Lab):</b> I spoke in the debate in March,
and I am delighted by the Bill&#146;s progress. I congratulate my
right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) on his
work on this important Bill.</p><p><a name="06071459000103">I support the Bill, because
unfortunately Greater Manchester has one of the worst records for
assaults and attacks on firefighters. My right hon. Friend the Member
for Swansea, West has already referred to the fact that about 200
assaults a year are recorded on our fire services, which is a record
that we want to lose. Although hon. Members would be concerned by an
assault on any emergency worker, we know that the greatest number of
assaults are directed at the police, firefighters and prison
officers.</p><p><a name="06071459000104">I want to
praise the role played by the <i> Manchester Evening News </i>and its
reporter, Neal Keeling, in highlighting the scale of the problem faced
by firefighters in Greater Manchester. That newspaper has run an
effective campaign to highlight the issue as the Bill has progressed
through Parliament, although it is sad to say that there is still a
need for such reporting in my
area.</p><p><a name="06071459000105">Today, we have
had good news about the success of the recent knife amnesty run by the
Home Office, because it is necessary in the fight against crime to
reduce the number of knives on the streets. In a recent disturbing
case, a teenager from my constituency was convicted of using a knife
against a firefighter, who was trying to tackle a blaze, which shows
the context in which our emergency workers are trying to do their jobs.
The incident began with a scenario mentioned by my right hon. Friend
the Member for Swansea, West, in which a group of youths were shouting
abuse at a fire crew and taking items from the fire engine. As an
officer went to help his colleagues deal with the yobs, he was
confronted by a youth on a bike. The court was 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1600</b><br>told that the youth said, &#147;Shall I hold him down while you cut
him up?&#148; The youth then said to the firefighter,
&#147;You&#146;ve got an axe, but I&#146;ve got one of
these&#148;, at which point he brandished a bladed weapon. We can all
imagine how shocked the firefighter was to be confronted by a youth who
was brandishing a bladed weapon. He told the police who assisted with
the incident that he joined the service to protect the public, not to
be threatened by
them.</p><p><a name="06071459000106">That incident
occurred very recently and the prosecution was only a couple of weeks
ago.</p><p><a name="06071459000107"><b><a name="06071459000698">Dr.
Brian Iddon (Bolton, South-East) (Lab):</b> I wonder whether
my hon. Friend is aware, as a parliamentary neighbour of mine, of the
excellent work that the emergency services&#151;all of
them&#151;undertake in Bolton through a programme called
&#147;Crucial Crew&#148;? Emergency set-ups are staged in a large
building. All the emergency services are in attendance. Primary school
children go through each of the scenarios. The aim is to try to impress
upon them how important it is to observe decency when emergency workers
are attending various incidents. Perhaps in that way we can inhibit
some young people from becoming hooligans in future and thereby cure
the problem that the Bill is intended to
target.</p><p><a name="06071459000108"><b><a name="06071459000699">Barbara
Keeley:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I
think that he is absolutely right. I was a councillor for a number of
years and was aware of such initiatives, which do a great deal of
good.</p><p><a name="06071459000109">I am here to
support the Bill because the incident to which I have referred was much
more serious than verbally abusing fire crews or throwing things at
them. I find it shameful that one of my constituents did what I have
described to a firefighter. I feel badly about that for the fire crew.
There is a case for saying that we must start with people when they are
at a very young age. The young man I mentioned was convicted and,
rightly, received a 12-month sentence for an appalling incident. He was
17 and a half years old. It is serious when someone gets to that age
and, unbelievably, thinks that it is acceptable or a jape to brandish a
weapon at a fire fighter who was doing his job and trying to protect
the local community.</p><p><a name="06071459000110">The chief fire officer for
Greater Manchester and Councillor Fred Walker, who is the chair of the
Greater Manchester fire authority, are concerned. They have told me
that they want Members to hear about the incident to which I have
referred so that we can understand the threat that fire crews face
daily. It must be shocking and difficult for someone to return to work
the next day, or even the same week, when they have been the victim of
such a severe incident. We need the Bill because of that
threat.</p><p><a name="06071459000111"><b><a name="06071459000700">Michael

Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) wants to cover assault and to ensure that
it is an aggravated offence?</p><br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1601</b><br><p><a name="06071459000112"><b><a name="06071459000701">Barbara
Keeley:</b> Indeed. We are trying in this debate to highlight
various issues. A plethora of things can be done and are being done to
deal with these issues. As I said, the young person who committed the
offence that I have described is already in prison. He received a
sentence of 12 months, and rightly
so.</p><p><a name="06071459000113">Further
to what my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon)
said, incidents can involve youths as young as eight or nine years of
age. Perhaps that is where our attention should be focused. We must
start to explain to young people the seriousness of the job that
emergency workers undertake. We must get them to understand how vital
that work is and that it should not be impeded in any way. Barry Dixon,
the chief fire officer, feels that it is important that magistrates use
the powers that they already have to deal with such wrongdoing so that
young people do not carry on with abuse and assaults on fire
crews.</p><p><a name="06071459000114">As I said on
Second Reading, community penalties might be appropriate for the
incidents that we are discussing. My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham
(Clive Efford) talked about the respect agenda and the great work that
is being done by the police and fire officers to engage with young
people. That is an important example of what can be done.</p><p><a name="06071459000115">The
Prince&#146;s Trust and the fire service run joint schemes in my
area. The young firefighters scheme is probably similar to the
&#147;Crucial Crew&#148; programme that my hon. Friend the Member
for Bolton, South-East mentioned. I know that firefighters attend a
great variety of community events to talk about fire hazards and to
show off their equipment, which helps to develop relationships with
young people in the community. More than anything, given all the work
that my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West has been doing,
we need to have the Bill on the statute book so as to add to the
respect agenda, the good community work that is being done and the
penalties that are available. We need to keep on highlighting the
message to magistrates that they should be as firm as they can be, and
use all the powers at their disposal, to stop young people developing
the tendency to abuse and then later, possibly, to assault
firefighters.</p><p><a name="06071459000116">The
situation is still as serious as it ever was. The Bill is as necessary
as it ever was. I further congratulate the people whom I have
mentioned, who alongside my right hon. Friend have been highlighting
the matters that we are discussing. I have already referred to the
<i> Manchester Evening News </i>and the report by Neal Keeling. Barry
Dixon has undertaken a great deal of work and should be commended for
so doing, as has Councillor Fred Walker. I know that that team of
people will be delighted to see the Bill enacted. Again, I congratulate
my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West on introducing
it.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000628">10.26

Waltho (Stourbridge) (Lab):</b> I congratulate my right hon.
Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) on his Bill, which
is both timely and much needed. Its purpose is to deal with a genuine
and urgent problem.</p><p><a name="06071459000118">During
previous deliberations, we heard statistics relating to offences
against emergency workers, including actual assaults. The situation is
improving in some 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1602</b><br>sectors, such as the NHS, since the introduction of programmes such as
conflict resolution training and the determination of the NHS to
protect its staff by prosecuting offenders. There were about 37,000
assaults in 2003 and the numbers went down to about 11,000 in 2004-05.
Those figures relate to acute hospitals. New orders, such as acceptable
behaviour orders, are assisting generally, but there is still a job to
be done to prevent incidents occurring. That is where the Bill will do
its job. We must get in earlier, as it were. The news that the
Government are supporting the new offence of obstructing an emergency
worker in responding to an emergency will help to plug the gap and
further diminish the number of incidents involving emergency workers.
It will give them the same respect and protection in law as that which
is accorded to our police force.</p><p><a name="06071459000119">I was speaking to my local
ambulance personnel recently. They were keen that I and my hon. Friends
should support the Bill. That is why I am here instead of opening
fêtes and fairs, the number of which seems to be growing
exponentially in my constituency It is important that I make sure that
the Bill goes forward so as to assist ambulance personnel and others in
their work. I am proud to be in the Chamber to support the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06071459000120">The obstruction
of emergency workers responding to emergencies is a heinous crime that
at best is irritating and troublesome and at worst potentially life
threatening. The consequent danger and damage to the person awaiting
emergency assistance can be devastating. I am pleased that the Bill
defines emergency workers as firefighters and those transporting blood,
organs and medical equipment, as well as coastguards and lifeboat
crews. It is especially welcome that it covers all ambulance workers,
including those working in air ambulances, volunteers and those working
under contract to the health
service.</p><p><a name="06071459000121">I am
especially concerned about the safety of those in our ambulance service
and paramedics, whom I consider the unsung infantry of the NHS. I am
therefore particularly pleased that the protection contained in the
Bill is extended to them in clause 1(2)(c). They work in extremely
stressful and sometimes dangerous circumstances. They are on the scene
of an accident from the start and they use their skills to save lives.
We should also have pride in them and they deserve not only our
gratitude and respect, but our protection. They should be protected
from harm and from obstruction in going about their duties, and they
should have support in
law.</p>

Keeley:</b> My hon. Friend is being characteristically modest
in that she is not revealing what a number of us know: she has spent a
great deal of time working with emergency crews out on their shifts.
Having spent hours overnight with them in her own time at weekends and
during summer breaks, she knows about these matters at first hand. I
commend her for doing that, and I hope to take it
up.</p><p><a name="06071459000123"><b><a name="06071459000704">Lynda
Waltho:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for those comments. I had
hoped to get on to that point, although I was not going to be quite as
obvious. Part of what I intended to do as an MP was to get out and
about, particularly with public service workers. I am a former teacher,
but teaching was probably not as 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1603</b><br>dangerous&#151;at least it did not feel as dangerous&#151;as some of
the situations I have been in since I started going out on duty with
police crews and the ambulance service. I believe that doing that
should be part of my role as an
MP.</p><p><a name="06071459000124">I recently worked
a night shift with an ambulance crew from Stourbridge station, which is
an experience that I recommend to all parliamentary colleagues.
Experiencing situations is very different from reading about them, or
even from hearing first-hand stories. That experience has served to
deepen my respect for the ambulance service and its personnel. I hope
that it might also have deepened their respect for Members of
Parliament, but we shall have to wait and see about that.
<i> [Interruption.]</i> I hope that it might at least have deepened that
crew&#146;s respect for their own
MP.</p><p><a name="06071459000125">That night shift
began at 9 pm and finished at 6 am. I do not think that anybody
expected me to work the whole shift, so I think I got brownie points
for doing so. Apart from one rest break at about 3 am, the crew work
solidly for the duration, going from call to call and either
tending to patients on site or, in some cases, taking them to hospital.
At all times duringthat shift, they were constantly on guard,
constantly concentrating and working together with
almost unseen communication between them. The whole process was very
uplifting.</p><p><a name="06071459000126">We attended
a variety of cases, including a cut head at the local swimming baths, a
road traffic accident, alcohol-related incidents, a suspected heart
attack, a young woman with severe abdominal pains, a distressed and
disturbed patient in need of assistance, and the rescue&#151;I do
call it a rescue&#151;and treatment of two young men who were the
victims of a group attack. That attack underlined to me how helpful a
Bill such as this could be.</p><p><a name="06071459000127">We were returning to hospital
with a patient from one of the other incidents that I have mentioned,
when the paramedic who was driving noticed a man by the roadside whom
he believed to be receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation&#151;CPR.
He called in the incident immediately, which is the right procedure,
but he also took an immediate decision to divert our ambulance to it to
assist. Upon parking it became clear that the incident was quite
different from how it had first appeared. The young man on the floor
was in fact being attacked, and his friend, whom my colleague&#151;if
I can use that description&#151;from the crew had initially thought
was giving CPR, was actually protecting him from further
blows.</p><p><a name="06071459000128">Both
paramedics attempted to calm the situation and to assist both young men
under attack. They managed to negotiate successfully, through a highly
charged situation, and the young men were then attended to, and the
badly injured patient on the floor was carried into the ambulance.
However, while that was happening, two bystanders who had not
previously been involved in the incident, attempted to prevent it by
barring the way to the injured party and then hitting out at one of the
paramedics as the injured man was lifted into the ambulance. Local
police arrived within two minutes of the call to them having been made,
and the situation calmed. But in those two minutes, when lives could
have been lost and immediate assessments 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1604</b><br>and quick judgment were needed, the professionalism and dedication of my
two colleagues shone through. Of course, that was a one-off experience
for me, but men and women such as my two Stourbridge paramedics face
such situations day in, day out, night in, night out. That incident
brought home to me that inadequate protection is sometimes afforded to
such excellent
professionals.</p><p><a name="06071459000129">I also
welcome the provision in clause 3 that allows a person to be convicted
for impeding an emergency worker &#147;by action directed&#148; at
a vehicle used by an emergency worker, because of another unfortunate
aspect of the incident I have described, which occurred as we began to
drive back to the hospital with our injured patient and prior to the
police establishing order in the fracas. At one point, two young men
mounted the steps at the side of the driver&#146;s door and attempted
to prevent our ambulance from moving away. The situation was
unbelievably tense, but once again the calm and professional manner of
my colleagues, and the way in which they handled the situation, enabled
all of us to leave safely and to get the patient to hospital
quickly.</p><p><a name="06071459000130">The enacting
of this legislation will underline our great respect for services such
as the ambulance service, and it will also send a message to those who
have less respect for them than us and to those who would try to
frustrate their staff in their work. The decision to support the
increase in the penalty for such behaviour to up to &#163;5,000 will
also serve to indicate to the wider public how seriously we regard such
offences.</p><p><a name="06071459000131">Members have
mentioned other methods of getting this message out. I wish briefly to
mention the work of the west midlands ambulance service, which runs an
education programme throughout the midlands. It goes into schools and
community groups to raise awareness of its work and to help to draw
young people in particular closer to the service to encourage respect
for its workers and appreciation of the role they play. When he speaks,
will the Minister underline possible future plans to publicise and
widen that educational role, which is very
important?</p><p><a name="06071459000132">Finally, I
congratulate again my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West on
his success so far with this Bill, and I hope that colleagues from all
parties will continue to support it in its latter
stages.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000629">10.38

Brown (West Ham) (Lab):</b> I join my hon. Friends in
congratulating the Father of the House on this Bill. If it is enacted,
it will be a worthy addition to the statute book, as is recognised by
the cross-party support that it has. The Bill has undoubtedly been
improved as a result of the lively and constructive debates on it in
this House, and it will play an important role in addressing the
serious problem of the obstruction of our emergency services. The Bill
addresses an increasingly important issue. I hope that Members will
forgive me if I repeat some arguments that have already been made, but
the need for the Bill is worth reinforcing again.</p><p><a name="06071459000134">The British crime survey shows
that fire and rescue service firefighters and officers, along with
police officers and prison service officers and others defined in the
Bill as being in the protective services, are the 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1605</b><br>people who are most at risk of experiencing violence and obstruction at
work. Some 14 per cent. of workers in the occupational category report
that they have experienced an incident of actual or threatened violence
while working. The figure for the work force as a whole is 1.7 per
cent., so there is a huge and outrageous difference. The former Office
of the Deputy Prime Minister collected figures for England and Wales
from 2004 at the request of the Chief Fire Officers Association. The
stats show that there were almost 400 serious incidents in a
nine-month period
alone.</p><p><a name="06071459000135">It is not only
the number of incidents that is increasing, but their ferocity and
seriousness. I am sure that most hon. Members in the Chamber know of at
least a single incident that has occurred in their constituency or
nearby that illustrates how serious the problem is
becoming.</p><p><a name="06071459000136">The Fire
Brigades Union has published research showing that the instances of
obstruction on UK fire crews runs at approximately 40 a week, and we
understand that the problem may well be getting worse. I understand
that the research is the first of its kind in the UK. The problem is
also seriously underreported, so it is suggested that there could be as
many as 120 incidents in one week. We believe that there is
serious underreporting because only 18 of the 50 English and Welsh fire
and rescue services responded to requests for information when the
figures were being compiled. Only a third of the brigades thus added
their numbers to the statistics that we have
available.</p><p><a name="06071459000137"><b><a name="06071459000706">Barbara
Keeley:</b> My hon. Friend raises a valuable point that was
discussed substantially on Second Reading. I mentioned that the Greater
Manchester fire authority has an apparently appalling record in respect
of attacks on its firefighters and I am sure that I speak for Salford
Members when I say that we want to lose that record. I have read the
material about the situation and my hon. Friend is right that
underreporting is a problem. Does she agree that we should send out the
message that the job of recording attacks that is carried out by the
Greater Manchester fire authority and police should be done by other
fire
authorities?</p><p><a name="06071459000138"><b><a name="06071459000707">Lyn
Brown:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for her timely intervention
and agree with her. I understand that the arrangements for reporting
have been tightened and improved so that the data that we have will
reflect better the situation as a whole. However, the Bill will enable
firefighters and fire officers to appreciate the importance of
collecting such data because they will realise that it might be
possible to do something about the
problem.</p><p><a name="06071459000139">My
hon. Friend told us earlier about an attack that occurred in her
constituency. It seems clear to me that the young man who was involved
in the incident was not committing a first offence because it would not
have been the first time that he had seen emergency workers as a
legitimate target to allow him to have some fun. My guess is that his
behaviour had been escalating up to the age of 17. If the Bill had been
in place, perhaps his behaviour could have been addressed when he was
10 or 14 years old. The Bill would have imposed penalties, and perhaps
the dreadful incident in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency could
have been avoided. We need to nip 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1606</b><br>things in the bud as early as possible and say that certain behaviour by
members of our community is totally unacceptable. If we can do that
early enough, we can hopefully prevent such
incidents.</p><p><a name="06071459000140">The FBU
states that fire crews in some parts of the country are served a diet
of bricks, bottles and missiles as they fight fires. In some cases,
firefighters have been lured to an incident, ambushed and attacked,
as my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr.
Williams) pointed out. Scaffolds have been thrown through the windows
of emergency vehicles and crews have been attacked with concrete
blocks. Bricks and bottles have been thrown, and crews and vehicles
have been spat
at.</p><p><a name="06071459000141"><b><a name="06071459000708">Mr.

have been out for an eight-hour shift with my local police force. I am
in the midst of arranging a similar night out&#151;if one can call it
that&#151;with my firefighters and ambulance crew. I look forward to
seeing their experiences at first hand, although I am not sure that I
will go as far as hugging them, unless, of course, they wish that to
happen.</p><p><a name="06071459000143"><b><a name="06071459000710">Dr.

Brown) and for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho) sound like prime candidates
for the police parliamentary scheme, which I have undertaken myself. I
spent 30 days with the Greater Manchester police, so, like other hon.

hon.
Friends.</p><p><a name="06071459000144"><b><a name="06071459000711">Lyn
Brown:</b> I am looking forward to taking part in the scheme.
In fact, I have the papers on my desk as I speak. My only concern is
that I might be expected to become fitter than I am. Once I have
received clarification on that point, I will sign and submit the
papers.</p><p><a name="06071459000145">As
I said, we unfortunately all know of incidents in our constituencies or
neighbouring areas. I remember an incident that took place in a
neighbouring constituency on a Guy Fawkes night when youths fired
rockets at two firefighters as they responded to a call. Their injuries
were so bad that they were both
hospitalised.</p><p><a name="06071459000146">At this
juncture, it is useful to recall the words of the FBU&#146;s general
secretary, Matt Wrack. He said in March this year that the union
welcomed the Bill and the cross-party support for it because
the</p><a name="06071459000602"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;number and ferocity
of the attacks has been getting worse and there have been several
attacks this week.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000147">The
Bill is thus central to firefighters&#146; concerns about their
working conditions.</p><p><a name="06071459000148">I
wanted to speak about the Bill because I received representations from
my constituents to ensure that I supported it. I thus read the FBU
website and paramedics&#146; websites to find out what they said
about 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1607</b><br>the Bill and people&#146;s experiences. It is clear that assault and
abuse causes great concern because they take up many pages of those
worthy websites.</p><p><a name="06071459000149">As
Matt Wrack
said:</p><a name="06071459000603"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If we
can&#146;t do our job because of violent assaults then it is our
communities which are being put at risk. We are the targets, but it is
our communities which are deprived of an emergency response which are
the victims.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000150">He believes
that the Bill must be part of a package of measures and that central to
that package should be a wide range of educational measures to try to
stop such attacks. The union is keen for statistics to be collected on
such incidents. In some brigades, fire crews are being encouraged to
record every single incident. However, as the union points out, the
crews will be encouraged even more if they understand how the figures
can be used.</p><p><a name="06071459000151">The union
also wants co-ordination and evaluation. I understand that various
initiatives are being introduced throughout the country, including
community-based projects with offenders and possible offenders. I know
that we would all agree that there is a need for such initiatives to be
properly monitored and evaluated nationally so that brigades can learn
more quickly what works and what does not. Frankly, what works in one
area will not necessarily work in another.
</p><p><a name="06071459000152">We
need to understand the nature of the problems in our own communities
and find remedies suited to our particular needs.</p><p><a name="06071459000153">The Fire Brigades Union has
also accurately pointed out that the end result of the continuation of
these incidents could well be the effective withdrawal or diminution of
services from certain areas. Unless the problem is dealt with, we run
the risk of depriving parts of the UK of access to the first-class
emergency services that we have all come to expect and appreciate.
After all, if we have to wait for the police to accompany an ambulance
worker or a firefighter into a certain part of the country, it means
waiting for two emergency services rather than one, which will slow
down our ability to respond to incidents. That would be a real shame,
and would mean that there would be a postcode impact on 999
services.</p><p><a name="06071459000154"><b><a name="06071459000712">Anne
Milton (Guildford) (Con):</b> Does the hon. Lady agree that we
have reached a truly appalling state of affairs when these attacks
threaten services that are so badly needed? Does she have any ideas
about how to stop them, or what provokes them? Is it something

them?</p><p><a name="06071459000155"><b><a name="06071459000713">Lyn

high adrenaline and excitement associated with a blue flashing light,

thrill.</p><p><a name="06071459000156"><b><a name="06071459000714">Mike

authority. A minority of people have made it impossible for the post to
be delivered in certain localities. A minority of young boys see it as
an opportunity to challenge symbols of authority. Clearly, although the
Bill is important we also need other measures to deal with the problem
of the socialisation of young men. We need to get them to accept that
there are boundaries of acceptable behaviour, and that they should
respect some symbols of authority.</p><p><a name="06071459000157"><b><a name="06071459000715">Lyn

one Bill as a panacea for all ills. We need to look at the provision of
youth services and what happens in our schools, to build a picture of
the sorts of remedies that can begin to impact on this growing social
ill. In my own West Ham constituency, the council has used the Olympic
games and other sporting events as an effective way of galvanising
interest in sport. It has spent about &#163;1 million each year for
the last three years on sporting services for young people, and as a
result, 40 per cent. fewer young people appeared in the magistrates

help a patient with severe breathing difficulties. The patient was at
home, so there was no option but to park in the road. The crew were
assisting the patient into the back of the ambulance when the car
pulled up. The driver could not get past, so he got out of his car,
climbed into the ambulance and let the handbrake off so that it rolled
back. A woman technician came out of the back of the ambulance and
found a man in the ambulance attempting to move it. Being confronted,
the man walked off. She asked him what he thought he 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1609</b><br>was doing, which I think is a fairly reasonable and
measured response to such an incident. They exchanged words, and he
slapped her round the head. Because of the delay, the patient&#146;s
condition deteriorated to such an extent that they had to call the
paramedics through. I understand that the police are investigating the
incident but have yet to make any arrest.</p><p><a name="06071459000164"><b><a name="06071459000719">Richard

is a great pity that we need to do that, but when cases are brought to
court and people are accused and tried for obstructing emergency crews,
it may help to bring about a certain attitude on the part of the

crew were attacked just after 10 o&#146;clock at night in
Westburn road, Aberdeen. The ambulance was responding to an emergency
call with sirens and blue lights activated when an object was thrown at
its windscreen. It shattered the glass and badly shook up the paramedic
who was driving. That was such an irresponsible act. It could have
significantly injured the people in the ambulance and prevented the
paramedics from getting to the scene to which they had been called. The
paramedic was clearly dedicated, and continued to the emergency that
had necessitated the 999 call and dealt with it. I am informed that
paramedics have also been attacked in Grampian, but that was believed
to be the first occasion on which an ambulance was attacked. In
response to what the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross)
said, I am trying to emphasise that there is an
escalation.</p><p><a name="06071459000176"><b><a name="06071459000730">Michael
Gove:</b> The hon. Lady may not know it, but I had the great
privilege of being brought up in Aberdeen, not far from Westburn road.
In Scotland, legislation provides that assaults against emergency
workers constitute an aggravated offence. She has drawn attention to an
incident in Aberdeen that clearly requires exemplary action to be taken
against the assailants. However, the same provisions do not apply south
of the border. The hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross)
made that point, but the hon. Lady persists in defending legislation
that is, according to her own words, inadequate for the
task.</p><p><a name="06071459000177"><b><a name="06071459000731">Lyn
Brown:</b> Again, I am not a learned Member, but I understand
that there is a difference between Scots law and English law. The

later.</p><p><a name="06071459000178"><b><a name="06071459000732">Richard

architecture&#151;but is not the problem the fact that people who hit
a policeman know that that is a serious offence, but that the general
public do not view hitting an ambulance worker or member of a fire crew
in the same way? Surely we should try to get young people to appreciate
that hurting an emergency worker is the same as hurting a police
officer, and would have the same
repercussions.</p><br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1611</b><br><p><a name="06071459000179"><b><a name="06071459000733">Lyn
Brown:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention,
but I can only give the same answer: I understand that incorporating
provisions from Scots law into English law would create confusion
rather than assist. I agree with his sentiments&#151;people must know
that when they attack our paramedics, firefighters and others who
attempt to assist the public, the full force of the law will bear down
on them and the crime will be perceived as
serious.</p><p><a name="06071459000180">Amendments
in Committee were thoughtful and measured. Broadening the scope of the
offence to include assaulting and impeding was sensible. I am pleased
that the Government have announced that several measures will be
introduced to complement the new law. Such attacks can be viewed as
part of a bigger picture, and it is important to include them in the
Government&#146;s general antisocial behaviour agenda. It must be
made clear to people involved in such incidents that their behaviour is
unacceptable. We must underline the fact that they are threatening
lives, attacking brave, hard-working and committed public servants and
depriving their communities of vital public
services.</p><p><a name="06071459000181">From the
magnitude and frequency of the incidents, it would appear that some
sort of national education campaign, co-ordinated with the emergency
services, is required to change people&#146;s attitudes to such
behaviour.

giving way. Like other hon. Members, she has highlighted the
seriousness of the situation and the need for this important Bill.
However, does she agree that the examples that we have heard tend to
under-represent the seriousness of the position? My hon. Friend the
Member for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho) spoke about how busy ambulance
workers are, going from one emergency call to another, and there must
be assaults that are not reported. We therefore underestimate the true
scale of the situation and we need the Bill, which my right hon. Friend
the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) is steering so carefully
through Parliament.</p><p><a name="06071459000183"><b><a name="06071459000735">Lyn

under-reporting of incidents. I stress to Opposition Members who have
intervened that the abuse and minor incidents go unreported, perhaps
because there is no redress in law to deal with young people or other
individuals who commit such acts. If there were such
redress&#151;which there soon will be, thanks to the diligence of my
right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West&#151;there would be a
point in reporting the abuse, aggravation and obstruction. The reported
figures will thus increase, but that will not mean that the number of
incidents has increased. It will simply mean that people now have
redress and a means of dealing with obstruction and petty
violence&#151;the small incidents that do not go to court and cannot
currently be

that parents, perhaps especially fathers, play a crucial role? We must
nip in the bud the sort of attitudes that we have been considering, and
that must be done in people&#146;s homes, because children first
learn behaviour from their parents.</p><br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1612</b><br><p><a name="06071459000185"><b><a name="06071459000737">Lyn

Gentleman&#146;s eloquent
intervention.</p><p><a name="06071459000186">I
sincerely hope that the incidents are happening through ignorance of
their consequences rather than being malicious attacks on community
services. The Bill will also help to underline the overwhelming public
support for our emergency workers, and to reflect just how unacceptable
attacks on hard-working law-abiding people are.</p><p><a name="06071459000187">The Bill has avoided creating a
range of different offences of assault applying to different groups of
public servants. While I agree that any assault on public sector staff
is abhorrent and to be condemned, tougher sentences for such assaults
can be achieved through the Sentencing Guidelines Council. That would
be preferable to risking muddying the waters with regard to the
protection already offered by the law on assault, which is both
universal and equal. The fact that the victim of an assault was serving
the public is already taken into account by the courts when sentencing,
and is regarded as a serious aggravating
factor.</p><p><a name="06071459000188">I am pleased
that the Bill has seen fit to cover the full range of emergency workers
who can conceivably be expected to respond to emergency situations, as
my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley) said. To
restrict the legislation to emergency services that display a flashing
blue light would be too prohibitive, and would, as has been stated at
earlier stages, remove the protection provided by the Bill from a
number of vital parts of our emergency services. I also accept the need
for the provision allowing the Secretary of State to modify the
legislation to allow further categories of emergency worker to be
included under its protection.</p>

of the House, my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr.

a model that I hope to pursue in my parliamentary career&#151;which

Friend talked about the Government&#146;s respect agenda. Throughout
the debate, there has been an undercurrent of comments about the lack
of respect that these attacks demonstrate. They illustrate a lack of
respect from young people and adults towards the vital services that
emergency workers provide to us all. The Government&#146;s respect
agenda and the provisions of the Bill meet up in a very helpful way in
that regard.</p><p><a name="06071459000196">My hon.
Friends the Members for Worsley (Barbara Keeley) and for Stourbridge
(Lynda Waltho) highlighted horrific examples of the problems that some
emergency workers face. I want to place on record the fact that I have
now been inspired to go out with emergency workers in Hackney. As my
hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge said, there is nothing like
doing it if we want to learn at first hand the difficulties that
emergency workers face. My hon. Friend&#146;s indignation highlighted
the points that she raised, and I congratulate her on one the most
eloquent speeches that I have heard her make in the House.</p><p><a name="06071459000197">My hon. Friend the Member for
Hendon (Mr. Dismore) is not in the Chamber today, but my hon.
Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) paid homage to his skills as
an orator in the House on these sitting Fridays. I commend her
particularly for her eloquence and statistical knowledge, and for the
research that she has done on this important issue. I will not go into
the issue of the Olympics in Newham, but she will realise that I
mention it in passing because they will be taking place in Hackney as
well.</p><p><a name="06071459000198">We are here to
discuss the Emergency Workers (Obstruction) Bill. It is an important
Bill, because our emergency workers are the backbone of a decent and
caring society. The citizens of a well-run country with a responsive
and effective Government expect proper and appropriate action to be
taken in an emergency or crisis. They should receive such action, and
we should do all that we can to prevent anything from hindering it.
That is what the Bill is all about. It underlines and reinforces the
totally legitimate expectation of British citizens that emergency
workers will be able to carry out their duties and serve the public
without fear of obstruction.</p><p><a name="06071459000199">We have
focused on the police, fire and ambulance services today. I am glad,
however, that the Bill also covers voluntary organisations and other
agencies that work on behalf of the state. These include organisations
such as St. John Ambulance, and the mountain rescue teams that provide
such great service in remote parts of our islands to rescue people in
difficulty. No one has yet mentioned the lifeboat crews, who
voluntarily do a great deal in their free time to rescue people in
difficulty at sea. Speaking as a former merchant seawoman, I feel
strongly about safety at sea, and it is vital that the work of the
Royal National Lifeboat Institution should be recognised in our debate
today.</p><p><a name="06071459000200">The offence of
assaulting a police officer already exists, as hon. Members have
mentioned. It carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison, as
does common assault. The criminal law includes a range of powers and
penalties to protect individuals from violent behaviour. Perhaps the
lawyers in the House will criticise me for saying this, but I am not
too concerned about the difference. My concern is the 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1614</b><br>outcome. If someone is prevented from doing their
job&#151;be they a police officer, a firefighter, an ambulance worker
or any of the other emergency workers that we have mentioned&#151;the
sentence must be proportionate to the crime. Sentencing guidelines
allow the courts to take into account that the person involved is a
public sector worker. The Bill will reinforce and underline that, by
creating a separate offence.</p><p><a name="06071459000201"><b><a name="06071459000741">Richard
Younger-Ross:</b> The hon. Lady mentioned St. John
Ambulance. A St. John Ambulance crew attended a carnival in Chudleigh
in my constituency recently, to provide first aid services. Is she
aware that, if someone tried to prevent those crew members from doing
that a job, it would not be offence under the provisions of the Bill?
The legislation would kick in only for an ambulance capable of carrying
out blue-light duties responding to a blue-light
incident.</p><p><a name="06071459000202"><b><a name="06071459000742">Meg
Hillier:</b> I am indeed aware of that distinction.
I am sure that the Minister will go into this in more detail in his
response. It is important to implement law that it is possible to
deliver, and by drawing the provisions narrowly, as my right hon.
Friend the Member for Swansea, West has done, it is possible to be
clear about exactly when the law will kick in. Difficulties could
result if the Bill had a very wide remit. However, it could represent
the first step towards further changes. We often see law being
introduced incrementally. As one part proves successful, other elements
are added to it. The Bill contains a degree of discretion, in that the
Secretary of State may add further categories of worker. It does not
allow for other situations to be added, but who is to say that that
could not be changed in the
future?</p><p><a name="06071459000203"><b><a name="06071459000743">Richard
Younger-Ross:</b> The hon. Lady refers to making clear what
the provisions cover. I am not an hon. and learned Member, and perhaps
I am being a bit slow, but I would have thought that it was very clear
to say that if someone obstructs a St. John Ambulance crew who are in
uniform at an event, they are committing an offence. To say that it is
an offence to obstruct emergency workers at certain times when they are
responding to certain incidents is actually
unclear.</p><p><a name="06071459000204"><b><a name="06071459000744">Meg
Hillier:</b> We are becoming involved in definitions now. It
is a question of whether St John Ambulance, for instance, is attending
on behalf of the public service, which will often not be the case. I
may not be best qualified to comment on such questions, but the
Minister may be able to clarify the position. The hon. Member for
Teignbridge may not be hon. and learned, but he is certainly au fait
with parts of the law with which I, as a new Member, am less
familiar.</p><p><a name="06071459000205">As I have
said, the sentencing guidelines allow sentences for attacks on public
servants to be weighted. I hope that the Sentencing Advisory
Panel&#146;s recent consultation on sentencing for violent crimes
against the person will produce some sensible proposals. Perhaps the
Minister could give us a tantalising glimpse of anything that may have
emerged from that consultation, which was wide-ranging and to which a
number of interesting contributions were made. That might reassure
Members, including me, that some of the points we have raised could be
dealt with in that way rather than by the Bill.</p><br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1615</b><br><p><a name="06071459000206">My hon. Friend the Member for
Eltham spoke of &#147;young people larking around&#148;, and
impeding emergency workers. As he and others have pointed out,
education is an important way of tackling that kind of obstruction. I
also agree with what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford,
South (Mike Gapes).</p><p><a name="06071459000207">I want to say
something about the work of the London fire service. I am particularly
impressed by what Graham Howgate, the Hackney borough commander, has
done in collaboration with the Shoreditch service. They have been
working with fire cadets. Young people are chosen for the scheme
because they are likely to become criminals if they are not channelled
in the right direction at a particular time. They may commit a crime if
they are not given support, and this excellent scheme provides them
with that support. It gives them a sense of purpose, and educates them
about the work of the fire service. The results have been good so far,
and I wonder why the scheme has not been adopted more widely. Although
such matters are not in the Minister&#146;s remit, I hope he will
take up that question with Ministers in other Departments.</p><p><a name="06071459000208">Since the creation of a borough
command unit in Hackney some interesting collaborative work has been
done, thanks largely to Valerie Shawcross, chair of the London fire
authority. Although largely unsung, her achievement has been
significant.</p><p><a name="06071459000209">One of
the first things that Commander Howgate and his team observed was that
a number of fires are started in abandoned cars. They would often have
to deal with such fires, and clear up the mess. Such fires were
frequently started by young people in particular spots in Hackney, but
happily the problem has now been solved. Cars are removed much more
quickly, because the fire service mapped the incidence of the attacks.
It was realised that if the cars were removed, there would be less
arson, less antisocial behaviour and fewer opportunities for young
people to impede emergency workers in connection with their
crimes.</p><p><a name="06071459000210">Although the
Bill is welcome, the low-level obstruction that Members have mentioned
is also important. The Hackney firefighters repeatedly find that
equipment is stolen from their fire engines when they are out on a job.
They themselves may not be impeded, but bolt cutters&#151;which are
particularly popular&#151;and other emergency equipment are often
stolen as trophies. Lack of respect for public services is a crucial
part of what the Bill attempts to tackle. It deals with the worst
elements, but we and, in particular, the Government have a
responsibility to consider a number of possible
solutions.</p><p><a name="06071459000211">I was
disturbed by the example given by my hon. Friend the Member for West
Ham, which involved an adult. We should bear in mind that young people
do not always cause these problems, although we tend to focus on them.
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) is smiling, because of
course he wants to hug the hoodies, but not all young people are bad,
whether they wear hoodies or not.</p><p><a name="06071459000212">The Bill
sends out an important signal about the seriousness of impeding
emergency workers. Members may have heard of a project called
&#147;Prison? Me? No way!&#148;. It is run by an educational trust
set up by prison officers, which visits secondary school across the
country 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1616</b><br>to demonstrate the reality of prison to young people. There is a mock-up
of a cell on the back of a lorry, and young people are locked into it.
Prison officers drill the young people in teams, and explain to them
clearly what the prison regime means. In combination with such
educational initiatives, the Bill should help young people to realise
gradually that if they commit the offences that we have heard about
today, they could end up in prison. Organisations like the one that I
have described are there to remind them that that is a very undesirable
consequence of such
action.</p><p><a name="06071459000213">The Bill
obviously focuses on the criminal act of impeding emergency workers,
but the services themselves have acted both to protect their staff and,
crucially, to encourage them to report incidents. As we heard from my
hon. Friend the Member for Worsley, Greater Manchester is ahead of the
game because of the particular problems that it has experienced.
Various initiatives have been launched, including the placing of video
cameras in the cabs of appliances so that offenders can be identified.
I know that one of the Opposition parties has persistently resisted the
installation of CCTV. I do not know whether the hon. Member for
Teignbridge wants to tell us now whether he supports the move to put
video cameras in cabs. It appears that he does not wish to take me up
on that, but it may be a subject for another
debate.</p><p><a name="06071459000214">As we heard
earlier, in Northern Ireland support is already given to firefighters
along the lines suggested in the Bill, but the Bill will apply to
ambulance workers and coast guards there. It is important to recognise
that it will not apply only to
England.</p><p><a name="06071459000215">Although
the Bill mainly concerns ambulance workers, we should bear in mind the
implications for other public service workers, notably in the national
health service. Early indications suggest that 71 per cent. of staff
trained in the NHS to deal with potentially aggressive and violent
incidents believe that they have the necessary skills to do so,
compared with only 29 per cent. before the training. We must not sit
back and assume that the Bill alone will solve the problem. I am sure
none of my hon. Friends are doing that. We may try to initiate further
debates in the House to discuss other ways of protecting emergency
workers. The law is an important tool, but it is not the only
one.</p><p><a name="06071459000216">The NHS,
supported by the British Medical Association, Unison and the Royal
College of Nursing, has produced posters reminding would-be offenders
of the tough penalties that they could incur. I hope that public
information campaigns will stress the reality that the Bill is law, and
that people may, in the most serious cases, be sent to
prison.</p><p><a name="06071459000217">Several of us
have mentioned young people and antisocial behaviour. What is needed is
proper youth work, and I am glad that the Government have provided more
money for the purpose. In my borough of Hackney, nearly &#163;1
million extra will be spent on youth work this year. We pay attention
to the respect agenda, and aim to tackle antisocial behaviour at all
levels, nipping it in the bud. As my hon. Friend the Member for West
Ham said, it must come to be seen as absolutely
unacceptable.</p><p><a name="06071459000218">The
decent folk whom I meet on doorsteps nearly every week want to lead
peaceful lives. They do not want their emergency workers to be impeded.
Low-level activity escalates quickly if it is not challenged, 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1617</b><br>and we must challenge it. Sport, including competitive sport, is an
important way of channelling young people&#146;s energies in the
right direction, as is education. I will cite one example from a visit
to Mossbourne city academy on the edge of my constituency. I talked to
children and staff at the school, and asked one child what he liked
about the school. He said that he liked the discipline. I was surprised
that a 12-year-old said that, as one does not tend to think of that as
a top desire of a child of that age.</p><p><a name="06071459000219"><b><a name="06071459000745">Michael

Gentleman brings up his children.</p><p><a name="06071459000221">I was puzzled by what the child
said, so I asked him what he meant. He said that the discipline meant
that he could get on and do his work, concentrate and not be messed
around. He was not a top achiever but a child who wanted to learn and
have a disciplined framework in school. Children stay late and come at
weekends to work at that school, because they find it a quiet and calm
environment. In that regard, the Government&#146;s agenda of extended
education also helps to generate respect. Children want a framework of
stability, and the Bill will help to achieve that.</p><p><a name="06071459000222">I want to end
on one incident from my experience as a teenager. I was sailing with my
older brother, who had offered to take me out off the Isle of Wight. I
was not an experienced sailor, but I thought that it would be exciting,
which it was until we capsized in the middle of the Solent. I was cold,
shivering and scared. I give credit to my older brother, who did
everything that he needed to do and whom I trusted, but I was young and
scared. Who came to our rescue? It was the coastguard. Had they not
been there, I do not know whether I would be here today. There were
there, however, and they were not impeded. Nobody tried to stop them
getting to me, and they rescued me. For that, I am ever
grateful.</p><p><a name="06071459000223">I
congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West on
introducing this important Bill and adding a further protection to our
emergency workers in the course of their duties in protecting the
public of this
country.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000631">11.31

David Kidney (Stafford) (Lab):</b> It is a pleasure to follow
my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg
Hillier). I add my voice to all those who have praised my right hon.
Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) and congratulate him
on successfully steering his Bill through all its stages. The signs are
encouraging that it will also pass today&#146;s stage.</p><p><a name="06071459000225">I supported
the Bill on Second Reading, and I am pleased to do so again today. On
that earlier occasion, my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea,
West explained his reason for adjusting the focus of his Bill. He made
a good decision. In its new form, the Bill is positioned between those
cases that involve no offence having been committed and those more
serious cases involving assaults on emergency workers, which can
attract serious sentences of imprisonment, as we heard earlier. An
offence of obstructing an emergency worker in the execution of his or
her duty is a valuable addition, 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1618</b><br>as, for a long time, there has been such an offence to protect police
officers from being obstructed in the execution of their
duties.</p><p><a name="06071459000226">Some people
might therefore think that the Bill is quite narrow, but I hope to show
that its application is broad. People might be pleasantly surprised at
what a valuable tool the Bill will be to emergency services in adopting
policies of zero tolerance to such behaviour, and to the prosecuting
authorities&#151;the police and the Crown Prosecution
Service&#151;in enforcing the law. The Bill extends the same
protection from obstruction enjoyed by the police to the other blue
light services, but applies more widely than to the blue light services
alone. I am pleased that my right hon. Friend has secured a provision
in the Bill for the protection to be extended later to other emergency
workers. I congratulate him on ensuring that the Bill protects
emergency workers from obstruction at every stage of their response to
an emergency, which is important.</p><p><a name="06071459000227">Some Members have asked about
the Bill&#146;s application to mountain rescue workers, and I think
that I agree with the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) that
they do not attract protection under the Bill as drafted. Like him, I
examined the provision about air ambulance services, which are provided
at the request of a national health service body. That would not extend
to mountain rescue services, such as those launched from RAF Stafford
in my constituency, which rescue people lost on mountains in Wales.
Clause 1(2)(f)(ii) extends protection to</p><a name="06071459000604"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;any other person or organisation
operating a vessel for the purpose of providing a rescue
service&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000228">I am pretty sure that
that the definition of &#147;vessel&#148; would restrict the
protection to ships on the sea, and would not include vessels that
carry people through the air. If I am wrong, of course, the provision
would be wide enough to protect those engaged in mountain rescue
services. If not, although, as my right hon. Friend said in his speech,
it is too late now to amend the Bill further, I urge the Minister to
consider making use of the power in clause 5 to extend the protection
to other groups, to make sure that the crew of aircraft who are engaged
in saving and rescuing people are also protected.</p><p><a name="06071459000229">I am pleased
that protection is extended to fire and rescue service workers. In
Staffordshire, horrendous news reports appear from time to time about
obstruction and assaults on fire and rescue workers. Happily, such
occurrences are few and far between. I hasten to add that the Bill is
not intended to deal with hoax calls, which are a much more prevalent
nuisance to fire and rescue service workers. In relation to fire and
rescue service work, a specific offence already exists for hoax calls,
which prevent people from doing their job and saving lives when
necessary.</p><p><a name="06071459000230">Fire and
rescue service workers are usually enormously popular, which is why
those who obstruct and assault them are such a small minority. At the
time of the last national pay strike, however, there was a little ill
feeling in some areas of Staffordshire towards fire and rescue service
workers. Unchecked, that could have become the kind of behaviour about
which we have heard today. Even before that strike began, however,
Staffordshire fire and rescue service had embarked on a community fire
safety strategy, which, once the strike was out of the 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1619</b><br>way, applied fully. That involved a widespread campaign to issue
householders with smoke alarms and, as other Members have described, of
fire and rescue service officers meeting young people and families in
schools and more informal settings such as school and garden fetes, to
explain their work. That has ensured that fire crews get much earlier
notice of a fire, so that they can respond to it more quickly, and that
there is less chance of people wanting to obstruct them, as they
understand the importance of the job.</p><p><a name="06071459000231">The happy ending to the story
in Staffordshire is that, as a result of that community fire safety
strategy, the number of deaths in fires has dropped dramatically. That
fall has been long-lasting, which is a tribute to the workers who have
committed themselves to go into communities, meet people and persuade
them to protect their property and lives with smoke alarms and to
understand the importance of fire workers and not getting in their
way.</p><p><a name="06071459000232">Having mentioned
the national pay strike, I hope that it will be a long time before we
see green goddesses back on our streets. The Bill, however, has the
foresight to extend to members of the armed forces who carry out the
duties of firefighters the same protection from obstruction as fire and
rescue service workers. That is important, albeit that none of us
wishes to see the provision apply, as we would prefer the Army, Navy
and Royal Air Force to continue their normal duties and not have to
protect us from fire as well.</p><p><a name="06071459000233">I am pleased that the Bill
protects crew members of the third of the emergency services&#151;the
ambulance service. Hon. Members might know that Staffordshire has the
best-performing ambulance service in the country. That is no mere puff
or boast; anyone who studies the statistics will see that, year after
year, Staffordshire ambulance service massively outperforms any other
in the country in its response times and the number of lives saved as a
result. There is a secret to our success. Our ambulance service has
tried desperately for many years to explain it to other services and to
persuade them to adopt the same standards, but sadly too few have
followed so far, although I know that it has been on the
Government&#146;s agenda since their policy statement last year to
persuade other services to go the same
way.</p><p><a name="06071459000234">As
a footnote I should add, if you will permit me, Mr. Deputy
Speaker, that during the recent large ambulance service mergers we
successfully argued that Staffordshire ambulance service should stay
out of a west midlands service precisely because our standards are so
much higher than others. There was concern that the standards of a very
good ambulance service might in the course of a merger fall, by however
small a degree, and that that would harm the public of
Staffordshire.</p><p><a name="06071459000235">I
mention that because, although we have the best-performing service in
the country and all residents of Staffordshire know that, we still face
the problem of a minority of people obstructing, assaulting and
threatening ambulance service crews as they go about their duties.
There was a horrendous report last year of an ambulance crew member
being badly assaulted and seriously injured.</p><br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1620</b><br><p><a name="06071459000236">It might be a coincidence, but
Staffordshire ambulance service recently issued&#151;on 6
July&#151;its own press release saying that it has</p><a name="06071459000605"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a robust policy of zero tolerance
toward any alleged verbal or violent
behaviour&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000237">aimed at its
crews. The release
says:</p><a name="06071459000606"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This
Ambulance Trust appeal to the Community to help change the apparent
attitudes developing in society that seems to say it&#146;s ok to
behave in such a way.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000238">I
would add that, if such societal attitudes develop and embed in
behaviour, just as the violence and abuse referred to in the release
would worsen, so would obstruction of ambulance crews, which would be
highly undesirable.</p><p><a name="06071459000239">As I mentioned in an
intervention, the Bill is important in the education process for which
many hon. Members have called as part of the response to the problem.
It is important that we send the message that we think that this is
such an important issue that we are creating a specific offence of
obstructing emergency workers. We do not wish to send mixed
messages&#151;that the matter is important but we are not doing
anything to face up to
it.</p><p><a name="06071459000240">My
right hon. Friend gave an assurance that the Bill extends more widely
than to employees of ambulance services. There has been some debate
about whether that means voluntary workers such as St. John Ambulance,
but I want to mention another group of people who are extremely
significant in Staffordshire and other rural ambulance services:
community first-responders. There is a strong association of community
first-responders around the country. They are remarkable people who
voluntarily undergo training by paid ambulance service workers and
stand ready in their isolated localities and communities to receive
calls to attend the scenes of serious incidents. Very often, because
they are in isolated locations, they are first on the scene, before the
ambulance crew arrives in response to the 999 call. I stress that they
are volunteers who attend in their own time and who have the skills to
deal with however horrific a situation they find when they reach their
destination, where they help of their free will keeping people safe and
alive until the professional crew
arrives.</p><p><a name="06071459000241">I also
welcome the fact that the Bill extends to the air ambulance service. I
tried to think in what ways people in helicopters might be obstructed
in carrying out their duties and saving lives. The most obvious
situation is somebody obstructing the landing of a helicopter that is
picking up someone who is seriously injured in order to take them to
hospital. Therefore, there is a point to that
provision.</p><p><a name="06071459000242">I shall not
take up time dealing with the other groups of people who attract the
Bill&#146;s protection, but I should like to mention the case of
staff who are transporting organs from one hospital to another in order
to save a live in a transplant operation or delivering much needed
blood that is required for a serious operation. They are clearly
carrying out highly time-sensitive work, and obstructing them in the
course of their duties could have serious consequences. It is right
that they attract the protection of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06071459000243">My hon. Friend
the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch mentioned protection for
those who are willing to put out to sea to save lives. There is no
coast in my constituency; we are a long way from the coast in 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1621</b><br>every direction, but as my hon. Friend pointed out, people travel to the
seaside and might get into danger. Conceivably, that could be any
resident of my constituency. It is therefore pleasing to know that the
protection of the law extends to people doing such important
work.</p><p><a name="06071459000244">I said that
clause 1(3) is sensibly wide, covering all the emergency operation: the
journey to the scene of the incident, the preparatory work at the scene
and the time spent giving help at the scene. The entire process is
covered by the Bill and protects those doing such work.
</p><p><a name="06071459000245">Subsection (4)
contains a comprehensive definition of emergency circumstances. I am
particularly pleased that it extends to cases involving mental illness,
which are so easily overlooked. It is interesting to note the
protection offered concerning serious harm to the environment. I think
instantly of the great expanse of beauty in my constituency in Cannock
Chase, where there are numerous sites of special scientific interest
and an area of outstanding natural beauty, which during the summer
months are at serious risk of an outbreak of fire. Somebody obstructing
the fire services on their way to tackling a fire in an open space such
as Cannock Chase could be endangering hundreds of square miles of
sensitive landscape, and I see the point in the
provision.</p><p><a name="06071459000246">The same
point applies to buildings and premises. If the response is delayed,
the extent of damage can be great. Perhaps most obviously, life and
death situations are also covered, in subsection
(4)(b).</p><p><a name="06071459000247">I said that
the Bill is surprisingly broad, and clause 2 is certainly a good
example of that. Whereas the primary protection is for an emergency
worker who is usually an employee of a fire or ambulance service,
clause 2 extends to a person assisting such a worker. As I think I
heard my right hon. Friend say, such a person could be a good Samaritan
among the public who steps forward to help emergency workers at the
scene. If that person, anxious and willing to assist, is obstructed on
their way to give that assistance, it would be an offence. That is the
impressive extent of the coverage that the Bill
offers.</p><p><a name="06071459000248">Action that
amounts to obstruction is also widely defined in clause 3(1). It can
consist of action other than physical obstruction, and when trying to
think of examples of that, I recalled the incident last summer when
someone killed a number of people at a garden barbecue and the police,
fire service and ambulance service all stayed away for several hours
because they believed that there was a person at the scene who was
armed and would be a danger to the emergency workers who attended. I
realised that a way in which workers could be obstructed by other than
physical means was by someone maliciously and falsely claiming that
there was something at the scene that would make it dangerous for them
to attend&#151;an armed person or explosive device, for
example&#151;thus keeping them away from the scene.</p>

<p><a name="06071459000249">The Bill is impressive. It is
widely drawn to cover the objectives. Critics of the Bill who complain
that it does not deal with aggravated assault have the wrong target,
because it is filling a space, albeit not that one, and by so doing it
will provide valuable assistance to our emergency workers who, after
all, face enough danger in their jobs. They act out of public
spiritedness, first and foremost, because they want to serve the
public, to 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1622</b><br>save lives and to prevent suffering and damage. Their jobs are hard
enough without a very small minority of irresponsible people getting in
their way and preventing them from doing their job, thus putting other
people in more serious danger and putting property at greater risk of
damage than would otherwise have been the case. The Bill is welcome and
I sincerely congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea,
West on his success in bringing it to this
point.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000632">11.51

Members, I thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr.

shifts and day shifts with police, ambulance and fire services and with
accident and emergency services at the hospital in my constituency. I
greatly admire people who spend their time in public service and now
that I have worked those shifts with the emergency services my
admiration for what they do knows no bounds. They go out and work in a
difficult environment trying to resolve some substantial problems, and
they do so in a way that is kind and friendly and helps people who are
in severe distress. Like other hon. Members, I think that it is
outrageous that, when doing that, they face the threat of attack and
aggression.</p><p><a name="06071459000251">I
have received a communication from Cheshire fire service&#151;an
admirable fire service&#151;telling me that there were 25 reported
incidents in 2005. On 21 occasions, stones, bricks, bottles, iron bars
or golf balls were thrown at crew attending incidents. On several of
those occasions, the vehicle but not the crew was hit, and on four
occasions the appliance was forced to withdraw to ensure the safety of
crew and prevent the situation from worsening. Some of the incidents
were severe: for example, a firefighter attending a rubbish fire was
attacked by two youths who smashed his visor on his helmet, cutting his
eye. Other incidents have involved water bombs being thrown that forced
the appliance to swerve when it was trying to get to a fire to tackle
it. A fire service mechanic was travelling in his marked vehicle when
two youths pulled out what appeared to be a firearm and aimed it at the
vehicle. A crew member on an appliance that was attending a rubbish
fire was hit by a 2-ft iron bar. So far in 2006, stones, bricks,
bottles and other debris have been thrown at crews attending incidents
on eight occasions, causing crew to consider whether they can get
through to deal with the fire. Firefighters attending a fire in June
were threatened with knives by a gang of youths and the crew was forced
to withdraw from the
scene.</p><p><a name="06071459000252">All
those incidents are taken extremely seriously by Cheshire fire and
rescue service, which is working to increase the safety of its
personnel. The service has installed closed-circuit television cameras
on appliances in a number of the areas it covers, and it intends to
introduce them across its whole area as soon as it can. In addition,
appliances have high-visibility stickers stating that they are equipped
with CCTV recording equipment. The service is determined not only to
deter such incidents, but to make it clear to people that offenders who
can be identified will be
prosecuted.</p><p><a name="06071459000253">Not only
does our fire service deal with emergency fires, but it tries to
prevent them. We have an extremely effective initiative whereby a home
safety assessment is 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1623</b><br>completed every 15 minutes, every day, seven days a week. I particularly
admire our fire service personnel for the way in which they constantly
seek ways to introduce safety into our local community. As well as
going out, risking their own lives and safety in dangerous incidents,
they are looking for ways to make our community a better place to live
by helping people to make their homes safe and dealing with slip and
trip hazards for older people.</p><p><a name="06071459000254">The fire service is also
involving local young people in such work. At a surgery in a community
building that had had problems with fires being lit, I saw fire crews
talking to quite young children and explaining to them what a fire
does, how dangerous it can be, and their role in helping to make their
local community safer. The children were getting very
involved&#151;actually, they had a great time. Adults were treating
them with respect and the children were learning directly from
important role models what respect means in a local community. I was
pleased because the community in question has a number of disadvantages
and having adults of that type&#151;admirable role
models&#151;coming in is not just about dealing with current
problems, but about giving young people an opportunity to see what they
can do in future.</p><p><a name="06071459000255"><b><a name="06071459000749">Mr.
David Anderson:</b> The experience that my hon. Friend
describes is seen in my constituency, too. The community in the old
mining village of Chopwell was being destroyed by drugs and lack of
investment. The retained service there has a young firefighters club
where young people go to work with the fire brigade. They learn how to
respect their homes and each other. The service also holds open days
and public days, so it is a real community
initiative.</p><p><a name="06071459000256"><b><a name="06071459000750">Helen
Southworth:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for highlighting that
work. In my community, too, groups of young people are brought along to
fire service stations where they can use the equipment, learn about
what is happening, and get a sound idea of the future prospects, not
only for their community, but for themselves through going into public
service. The fire service is an integral and key part of our community,
which is why the Bill is so important. The Bill shows that we, too,
believe that our emergency services are key, integral, valued and
respected parts of our community that we not only respect, but are
prepared to defend.</p><p><a name="06071459000257">We are talking about one of the
things that particularly disconcerts me about the position for fire
service personnel, ambulance personnel and people in accident and
emergency services at hospitals. I hope that we will be able to look at
that to see whether the ability to modify might need to take into
account the needs of accident and emergency workers, particularly
people who work shifts on a Friday or Saturday night and have to deal
with the alcohol-fuelled antisocial behaviour that can kick off in
hospitals sometimes.</p><p><a name="06071459000258">It is particularly important
that we protect people who work in stressful jobs and who should be
able to know that they can call on other people when they need help. I
am concerned that paramedics who have suffered assaults and attacks on
their vehicles when they are working in an extremely stressful
environment 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1624</b><br>feel that they cannot continue to work in the front line. It is shocking
that they believe that they are not sufficiently protected to be able
to continue to do their valuable job, because we all want them
to.</p><p><a name="06071459000259">I want to
draw attention to Merseyside and Cheshire ambulance services, because
the work that is being carried out locally to tackle assaults on crews
is drawing together in the most effective way management and trade
unions to get across the message not just that we will not tolerate
attacks on ambulance crews, but that if someone prevents an emergency
service from getting out and doing its job, it could be that person or
a member of their family who faces the effect. It is admirable that the
management and Unison are working together to get that message across
in a poster and public relations campaign. The figures indicate that
ambulance crews reported 86 separate incidents involving an assault on
them during 2005 in Merseyside and Cheshire. That is completely
unacceptable. The Bill sends a clear message that we will not tolerate
that sort of thing and I would like to add not just my support and that
of the ambulance and fire services in my local area, but that of all my
constituents, who want to see our emergency services given the
protection and support that they need and
deserve.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000633">12.1

offer my apologies to the House on behalf of my hon. Friend. He cannot

valuable functions and in that respect we are more than happy to give

that, at the moment, legislative protection is afforded to the police
as they go about their duties. Everyone knows that if they assault a
police officer, it is an aggravated offence for which they will face a
tougher sentence. As a result of the Bill being passed, a signal will
be sent that to obstruct an emergency worker, whether it is an NHS
worker, a fireman or someone who is working for the Royal National
Lifeboat Institution or the coastguard, will also mean facing a
particularly severe punishment. In that respect, we wholeheartedly
support the legislation.</p><p><a name="06071459000262">As well as plugging a gap, the
Bill sends a message. We do not always support legislation that sends a
message, because sometimes we believe that legislation should not be
used so lightly, simply to communicate censoriousness on the part of
the House. However, by sending a message, the Bill can have a welcome
deterrent effect. We have heard from a number of hon. Members this
morning about the increase in the number of incidents of attacks on, in
particular, ambulance workers. There is a clear need for legislative 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1625</b><br>action to ensure that those tempted to go down that path understand that
the House and the Government wish to prevent them from behaving in that
way.</p><p><a name="06071459000263">The third
reason why we want the Bill passed is because we believe that those who
obstruct the work of emergency workers are guilty of a double crime:
not only are they interfering criminally with the work of public
servants, they are endangering the lives of others. As well as
interfering in the effective provision of a public service, they are
maximising the risk to others, whom those public servants are
attempting to assist. In that respect, because those who commit such
crimes are guilty of a double assault, we welcome the Bill.</p><p><a name="06071459000264">As my hon. Friend said earlier,
we wish to enter one note of regret. The original legislation that the
right hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) introduced was based
on the Bill that was introduced in the Scottish Parliament. For the
sake of ease of legislative drafting, he attempted to introduce a Bill
that was, in many respects, almost identical to the Scottish
legislation. As someone who was born in Edinburgh and raised in
Aberdeen, I am well aware that Scottish and English law are distinct
from one another, and it may not be the case that Bills introduced in
Scotland can have identical application in England. However, in order
to introduce his Bill, the right hon. Gentleman had to negotiate with
the Home Office, as he did in a spirit of good faith, and it insisted
on dropping the aspect of the Bill that dealt specifically with
assault. That is a matter of regret because, as has been spelled out by
almost all hon. Members who have spoken, the incidence of direct
physical assaults on emergency workers has increased in recent years,
and legislation to deal with that would be welcome.</p><p><a name="06071459000265">Indeed, the Government
recognised that in their manifesto, which
says:</p><a name="06071459000607"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we will introduce
tougher sentences for carrying replica guns, for those involved in
serious knife crimes and for those convicted of assaulting workers
serving the
public.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000266">They
have accepted legislative changes to deal with those carrying replica
guns and with serious knife crimes, but when it comes to protecting
workers who serve the public, they do not want legislation and say
instead that the Sentencing Guidelines Council will do our work for us.
We all remember that in recent weeks some of the decisions taken in
court by judges acting in accordance with the Sentencing Guidelines
Council have earned the criticism of Home Office Ministers. How can it
be that judges who are operating according to the Sentencing Guidelines
Council were excoriated by the Home Secretary two weeks ago but are
now, according to what Home Office Ministers have said, to be the
agents of the protection that we all feel that is
required?</p><p><a name="06071459000267">The onus is
on the Minister to explain precisely how the Sentencing Guidelines
Council will give effect to the feeling of the House to ensure that
emergency workers get the protection they deserve. He must also explain
why legislative action is not specifically required in this case. What
is it about emergency workers that means that they do not deserve the
same legislative protection that he has extended to other categories of
potential victims in the range of legislation that he is
introducing?</p><p><a name="06071459000268">I look
forward to hearing from the Minister as he provides enlightenment on
this and many other topics. It remains only for me to say that we
congratulate the 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1626</b><br>Father of the House on introducing this much needed legislation. Our
only regret is that his original intent was blunted by the Home
Office.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000634">12.7
pm</h5><p><a name="06071459000269"><b><a name="06071459000752">The
Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety (Mr. Tony
McNulty):</b> I congratulate the Father of the House on
securing the Bill and on facilitating its smooth passage.</p><p><a name="06071459000270">As a member
of the 1997 intake and a London MP, let me start in the same place as
my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford) did. At that time,
we sat for perhaps half the Fridays available instead of 13. That was
an interesting way to get more and more practice in this place. None of
us can ever get enough of that. We had all-day Adjournment debates as
well as debates on private Members&#146; Bills. I remember with great
fondness duelling constantly, but mostly failing in the attempt, with
my right hon. Friend&#151;I hope that he would not have minded me
calling him that&#151;the former Member for Bromley and Chislehurst.
As this is the first time that I have participated on a Friday since
his sad demise, I want to put on record how much I learned from him. He
was much maligned, misunderstood and excoriated&#151;not least by
Labour Members who did not know any better&#151;but he will be sadly
missed, not least by the 1997 intake of Friday boys, some of whom have
been mentioned in dispatches today and some not.</p><p><a name="06071459000271">I congratulate my right hon.
Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) on securing
cross-party support for the Bill. I also congratulate him on selecting,
from among the plethora of choice of legal advice in this House, my
hon. Friends the Members for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) and for Islington,
South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) rather than certain other learned
colleagues. I can furnish him with a list of those on both sides of the
House from whom he should never seek legal advice.</p><p><a name="06071459000272">It is important&#151;this has
underscored many of today&#146;s speeches&#151;to say what
precisely the Bill is supposed to do. It is not an attempt to reinvent
assault legislation. It is not an attempt to establish a legislative
framework for other things such as education awareness, antisocial
behaviour, respect and all the other relevant considerations that hon.
Members have mentioned. The Bill does not seek to achieve all that. Nor
does it seek to afford aggravated status to the offence of obstructing
emergency workers&#151;a point to which I shall
return.</p><p><a name="06071459000273">However, as
the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) suggests, the Bill
seeks to fill a serious gap. Many of the concerns that he and my hon.
Friends expressed would be more relevant if we wanted the Bill to be an
overall comprehensive measure like the Scottish Act, but the Bill does
not profess to be such a measure. There is no need for that, not least
because, as the hon. Member for Surrey Heath well knows, the Scottish
Act sought to fill considerably more gaps in the Scottish legislative
framework, and those gaps simply are not there in English
legislation.</p><p><a name="06071459000274">I had to
check my notes on this point, but I thank my right hon. Friend the
Member for Swansea, West, for saying that a Bill that the Home Office
had anything to do with was short and clear. That has not entirely been
my experience, either as a Back Bencher 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1627</b><br>or as a Minister, particularly in the Home Office, so I am grateful for
those comments. The Bill is short and clear&#151;rightly so, because
these are extraordinarily serious matters, and filling the gap is
hugely important.
</p><p><a name="06071459000275">I
must confess that although hon. Friends and colleagues have tried to
explain such behaviour, I do not entirely understand why people think
it a clever, smart or positive use of spare time to throw rocks at
ambulances, or why they regard people in uniform who seek to help the
public, and who invariably save lives, as invading their turf, or think
that they are just &#147;uniforms&#148;, like the police. Some
colleagues were even more generous, saying that the blue lights sparked
off adrenaline, everyone became terribly excited, and testosterone
levels went through the roof, but none of those are excuses for
impeding, obstructing or doing something worse to prevent our emergency
workers from going about their business. That simply is not right in
any way, shape or form. Whether it is just a kick-out at authority, or
whatever the excuse is, or not, it must desist, and we must introduce
legislation that addresses the issues&#151;and the Bill is a
necessary part of
that.</p><p><a name="06071459000276">I
know&#151;all the more because, happily, there is a cross-party
approach to the Bill&#151;that the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr.
Cameron) would tell us that the perpetrators simply need a bit more
love and affection. He would say that they are much misunderstood, and
if only we understood them more, everything would be so different, and
that we should hug them or whatever&#151;but I do not agree with that
approach, either. However, to take one step back, I agree with the
opening sentence of the contribution by my hon. Friend the Member for
West Ham (Lyn Brown)&#151;her point was repeated by the hon. Member
for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)&#151;that we have to go a
long way back along the chain and consider issues such as parenting,
family breakdown and other factors that are the antecedents of
antisocial behaviour, to try to address such matters. That is part of
the Government&#146;s comprehensive approach.</p><p><a name="06071459000277">Many of my hon. Friends
mentioned the respect agenda and what we are trying to do to tackle
antisocial behaviour. That very much fits in with trying to take
preventive measures, but we have heard some horrendous stories this
morning about the ways in which people seek to impede and obstruct
emergency workers. Some of the points that colleagues have made are
entirely fair and were dealt with in Committee. Some have been
answered, but some perhaps will need to be revisited. It was right and
proper to try to define an emergency worker as narrowly as possible,
but also to include the escape clause so that we can consider adding to
the categories, if experience dictates that the list is not adequate. I
understand what was said by many colleagues about social workers and
people who, in the course of their routine day-to-day work, may not
necessarily be construed as emergency workers, but who are often put in
positions in which they solve or help to solve an emergency. Those
people deserve to be covered by the Bill so that they are not
obstructed while carrying out their work. Those matters can and should
be
considered.</p><p><a name="06071459000278">As
I said, the Bill was not intended to reinvent assault legislation in
the context of public workers. We are doing that in many other ways. It
has been pointed out 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1628</b><br>that unlike Scotland, we have the Sentencing Guidelines Council. It
already almost imposes a tariff for impeding people in the execution of
public service, and we are considering in detail, with the council,
other ways in which sentences can reflect the spirit and sentiment of
the Bill. It is appropriate that many colleagues have put the wider
issues of assault of public sector workers generally, and emergency
workers specifically, in the context of the Bill, but the Bill does not
try to do everything. Its narrow focus is
appropriate.</p><p><a name="06071459000279">It
probably was inappropriate that the original Bill almost exactly
reflected the Scottish provision, given that we do not start from the
same legislative base. I shall say very carefully&#151;and I shall
not, as I was invited to, tease the House about what the Sentencing
Guidelines Council may or may not say&#151;that that is a matter that
the Government should keep under review. Having set up the Sentencing
Guidelines Council, we should let it do its work. If that achieves what
we want with respect to the legislative base, that is more
appropriately done in that way, although I reserve our right to return
to the
matter.</p><p><a name="06071459000280"><b><a name="06071459000753">Richard
Younger-Ross:</b> The Minister used the words
&#147;may&#148; and &#147;if&#148; with reference to the
Sentencing Guidelines Council. Will he give a commitment that if there
is not an increase in sentences over time, the Home Office will review
the matter and consider whether assaults on emergency workers should be
deemed to be
aggravated?</p><p><a name="06071459000281"><b><a name="06071459000754">Mr.
McNulty:</b> That sounded terribly like one of those elephant
traps that Liberal Democrats are always trying to get Ministers to fall
into by giving cast-iron assurances. None the less, unusually, that is
a fair paraphrase of what I said, and I will take it back to the Home
Office. I think that means yes, in a convoluted
way.</p><p><a name="06071459000282"><b><a name="06071459000755">Michael
Gove:</b> The Minister used the conditional
&#147;may&#148; or &#147;might&#148;, yet the manifesto on

it&#151;says:</p><a name="06071459000608"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we will
introduce tougher sentences . . . for those convicted of assaulting
workers serving the
public.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000283">We have already
had retreats by the Home Office this week on ID cards and on police
mergers. Is this the third retreat this
week?</p><p><a name="06071459000284"><b><a name="06071459000756">Mr.
McNulty:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman, whom I respect very
much, for conceding the last election. That is terribly generous. He is
being tedious. We already have people looking at how we can carry out
that manifesto commitment. It is not a matter of whether we will do
that&#151;we will; it is a matter of how. We have established the
Sentencing Guidelines Council, so it is appropriate in the first
instance that it does the job with which it is charged. Then, as I
tried to say to the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard
Younger-Ross)&#151;in a convoluted way, I fully accept&#151;we will
examine the matter further if the Sentencing Guidelines Council route
is not the appropriate
one.</p><p><a name="06071459000285">With
the Sentencing Guidelines Council, there is already an implied tariff
in place for those who obstruct public service workers. We need to
build on that. We are considering, as the hon. Member for Teignbridge
rightly 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1629</b><br>suggests, other aspects such as sentencing for firearms and knife
offences, and the wider context of assaults on public sector workers,
rather than the narrow confines of obstruction of emergency workers.
That commitment remains absolute.</p><p><a name="06071459000286">When the hon.
Member for Surrey Heath speaks of retreats of this sort or that sort,
both of which are fiction, he is introducing an unnecessary and
poisonous veneer of partisanship into our deliberations, which he
should be ashamed of. I agree with his starting point. We need to fill
the gap and add a deterrent or exhortatory value to the law. I agree
with his point about the double impact of interference in the discharge
of emergency workers&#146; duty and the potential damage done by that
obstruction&#151;for example, when the pipes used by firemen are
cut.</p><p><a name="06071459000287">I
absolutely commend what the Father of the House has done with regard to
the Bill. To hon. Members who have criticised the extent of the Bill, I
say that it elegantly fills a gap that needs filling. Hon. Members on
both sides of the House have discussed the wider issues, and we will
examine those points and report back to the House. The House is about
to give the Bill a fair wind, and I hope that it receives a fair wind
in the other place too, in which case the Father of the House will be
able to add it to his many other significant contributions in his long
and enduring time in this
place.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000635">12.20

Alan Williams:</b> With the leave of the House, I shall reply
to the debate. It has gone on longer than I anticipated, and there is
another important debate to come. I therefore hope that hon. Members
will excuse me if I do not go through all the excellent speeches that
have been made. All the speeches have been positive, and there has been
unanimity on both sides of the House in our support not for the Bill,
but for the work done by emergency workers, which should be satisfying
for those
workers.</p><p><a name="06071459000289">I
want to make two points about the debate. First, it has emerged that
hon. Members are deeply afraid that with increasing attacks on
emergency workers, as well as interference in their work, we may end up
with no-go areas in parts of some towns. Secondly, hon. Members are
deeply conscious that sanctions alone are not enough, and that
education, training and understanding must form part of the
programme.</p><p><a name="06071459000290">It would be
invidious to pick out one speech, but I shall pick out one comment,
which I commend to the House as the quote of the day: my hon. Friend

Hendry (Wealden) (Con):</b> I beg to move, That the Bill be
now read a Second
time.</p><p><a name="06071459000296">It is a great
privilege to open this Second Reading debate on behalf of my right hon.
Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude), in whose name the Bill
stands. Sadly, my right hon. Friend cannot be in the House today,
because of commitments to fight for the interests of his constituents
in Sussex, but that should not take away from the importance of the
issue or lead anybody to conclude that the Bill is not widely supported
by hon. Members, and, in particular, by those in the south-east and
other parts of country that face excessive housing
development.</p><p><a name="06071459000297">The
purpose of the Bill could not be clearer. The south-east faces
unprecedented and unwanted pressure for new houses. The infrastructure
is already creaking, and there is grave concern about the implications
if many new houses are built before the infrastructure is improved to
accommodate them. That is one of a number of issues that concern hon.
Members. In particular, I draw attention to the Bill that my hon.
Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) will introduce to
change the designation of gardens from brownfield sites, which is
currently causing extreme problems in many parts of the country and
particularly in the
south-east.</p><p><a name="06071459000298">The
Bill requires a full audit of existing or planned infrastructure in
areas in which significant housing development is planned. It has been
introduced because there is growing concern that the Government plan
for massive housing building in the south-east will lead to a
substantial deficit in the region&#146;s infrastructure. Local
authorities in the south-east earmarked by Government for significant
amounts of new house building estimate their individual infrastructure
deficits to be about &#163;1 billion each. I know that my
hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) will be familiar
with that figure, as it was calculated by his district council. The
cost of providing adequate infrastructure for the Government&#146;s
house building targets for the south-east has been more formally
estimated at &#163;45 billion at least.</p><p><a name="06071459000299">In March 2006, the South East
England regional assembly submitted the south- east plan to Government,
recommending an additional 28,900 new dwellings a year as sustainable
housing growth for the south-east. For many of us, that figure was
already much higher than we believed the region could sustain. However,
as the consultation period on the south-east plan closed, the
Government published a report examining the impact of building up to 60
per cent. more houses than was suggested in the already controversial
SEERA plans. Typically of the Government, the report was published on
the Government office for the south-east website without adequate
attention being drawn to its presence there.</p><p><a name="06071459000300">There is therefore a real
concern that the Government are determined to impose even higher levels
of house building in the south-east than SEERA had itself suggested,
which, as I have said, many of us 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1631</b><br>felt was already too high, especially given that recent legislative
changes mean that the Secretary of State now has a veto over all stages
of the planning process, from regional strategy to local plans, even
after examination in public. That brings even greater focus to our
concerns in these matters.</p><p><a name="06071459000301">Government spending on our
infrastructure is already woefully inadequate. The community
infrastructure fund is a mere &#163;295 million for London and the
wider south-east. Compare that figure with the figure I gave earlier of
a &#163;45 billion infrastructure deficit across the south-east in
general. If that is not bad enough, there is also the worry that the
current system of section 106 agreements will soon be replaced by the
Government&#146;s new system of planning gain supplement. This new
system will siphon off the majority of development gains into a central
fund for strategic infrastructure. That is new Labour-speak for the
Treasury, and yet another example of funds being taken away from the
south-east to be distributed to other parts of the country.</p><p><a name="06071459000302">Last year,
the south-east county councils commissioned ICM to carry out the
largest-ever survey of public opinion on the south-east plan. The
headline result is stark indeed. The survey revealed that 60 per cent.
of people in the south-east are not confident that the supply of
infrastructure in the region will keep pace with new house building.
The percentages of people saying which types of infrastructure should
be given priority come as no surprise: 48 per cent. said that NHS
hospitals should be given priority; 48 per cent. also said that
priority should be given to public transport; 31 per cent. said that it
should be given to major road projects.</p><p><a name="06071459000303">The Bill would force a serious
rethink about where the infrastructure is weakest and it would require
a full audit of existing or planned infrastructure in areas where
significant housing development is being
proposed.</p><p><a name="06071459000304"><b><a name="06071459000759">Lyn

generally across the south-east that infrastructure is already lacking

hundreds of thousands of houses being proposed, the situation will
become catastrophically worse.</p><p><a name="06071459000306"><b><a name="06071459000761">Lyn
Brown:</b> The hon. Gentleman is being extremely generous in
giving way.</p><p><a name="06071459000307">I am
trying to understand the nub of the Bill; I am struggling somewhat with
that. As I see it, there are not many new proposals in the Bill that
are not already 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1632</b><br>part of what has come through via the ODPM Select Committee, which sets
out things that the Government are doing. Is the nub of the issue the
number of homes that are being built? Does the hon. Gentleman wish to
say to people who are on my public sector housing list, and who have
been for about 18 to 20 years, that they can sit and wait because we
are not prepared to build any more houses?</p><p><a name="06071459000308"><b><a name="06071459000762">Charles
Hendry:</b> If the hon. Lady is having trouble understanding
the Bill, I have two proposals. First, she could read it&#151;to do
so might be helpful to her. Secondly, she might listen to the debate
before she starts intervening, because I shall now come on to exactly
the matter that she raised.</p><p><a name="06071459000309">We realise that the Bill would
not prevent what we consider to be the Deputy Prime Minister&#146;s
disastrous legacy of housing development in the south-east, but it
would make it much more difficult for the Government to impose those
new houses without proper provision being made for the infrastructure
necessary to support them. It would lay bare for public scrutiny the
deficiencies in Government thinking and
planning.</p><p><a name="06071459000310"><b><a name="06071459000763">Mr.
Brooks Newmark (Braintree) (Con):</b> It might be helpful if I
gave an example from Braintree, which until recently was one of the
fastest growing towns in Britain. Two of our community hospitals have
been closed down, and the land has been sold off but a new community
hospital has still yet to be built. That has caused enormous
frustration in a town that is growing very fast. In addition, we have
had electricity blow-outs in many of our new housing areas because the
proper infrastructure was not put in place for there to be sufficient
electricity supplies to the new houses.</p><p><a name="06071459000311"><b><a name="06071459000764">Charles
Hendry:</b> My hon. Friend, with his usual intuition, has
predicted my next point. Any south-east Member could tell a similar
story because all of us face the same sort of problem: enormous
pressure for house building without the necessary infrastructure in

worse.</p><p><a name="06071459000312"><b><a name="06071459000765">Barbara
Keeley (Worsley) (Lab):</b> I wish to make a point in response
to what the hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) said about
community hospitals. I hope that the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles
Hendry) agrees that we are moving away from having smaller-unit
hospitals because the advice of health professionals these days is that
we want hospitals that can cover all the needs that people have and
that have all the diagnostic equipment that people need. A plethora of
new community hospitals is not the answer to the situation we
face.</p><p><a name="06071459000313"><b><a name="06071459000766">Charles

two incredibly popular and well supported community hospitals, and the
hon. Lady would be very brave if she were to come and say that they
should be closed down. If that is truly a statement of the
Government&#146;s intentions, it is very worrying indeed, and it
would cause profound
concern.</p><p><a name="06071459000314"><b><a name="06071459000767">Barbara

health service, but if the hon. Lady wishes to intervene later, I will
of course give way again.</p><p><a name="06071459000316">The Bill
would require an audit in specific areas. In terms of health care, to
accommodate additional housing growth it has been calculated that
almost 1,300 additional acute beds and more than 600 general beds will
be required over the next 20 years in the south-east alone. To pick up
on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr.
Newmark), in Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Essex there will be a
requirement for an additional 500 acute beds and almost 300 general
beds over the next 15 years. In total, that equates to six medium-sized
new hospitals being required in the greater south-east over the next 15
to 20 years. But far from increasing investment in health care, the
current structure is under intolerable stress. The massive debt
accumulated due to the chronic underfunding in Surrey and Sussex
strategic health authority is leading to service reconfigurations
across Surrey and Sussex, and those moves go against the public feeling
that more, not fewer, services are
required.</p><p><a name="06071459000317">My
hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex has been a fantastic champion for
saving the health facilities at the Princess Royal hospital, Haywards
Heath and the Queen Victoria hospital, East Grinstead. Without his
perseverance, determination and commitment, the situation would
undoubtedly be even worse than it is. Further south, my hon. Friend the
Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) is leading the campaign to
preserve the maternity, paediatric and specialist baby services at
Eastbourne district general hospital. There are even worse proposals
for downgrading the accident and emergency facilities, with at least
part of them being moved to Hastings, which is causing profound concern
among local communities, Members of Parliament and the ambulance
service.</p><p><a name="06071459000318"><b><a name="06071459000769">Mike
Gapes (Ilford, South) (Lab/Co-op):</b> The hon. Gentleman
talks about chronic underfunding. Although I do not wish in any way to
question the difficulties that the health service in his local area
seems to face, will he at least admit that there has been a massive
increase in NHS funding over the past seven or eight years, including
in his area, compared with the level of funding under the Conservative
Government?</p><p><a name="06071459000319"><b><a name="06071459000770">Charles
Hendry:</b> No one can deny that there has been a very
significant increase in the funding of the health service, but that is
not resulting in better quality health care on the ground. What we have
also found is that there is pressure each and every year
on&#151;</p><p><a name="06071459000320"><b><a name="06071459000771">Madam

endeavour to ensure that I am not tempted by further interventions away
from the Bill&#146;s Second Reading.</p><p><a name="06071459000322">Secondly, there is the issue of
water resources. The south-east is one of the driest regions in Britain
and has high rates of per capita consumption of water compared with
other English regions. Inevitably, 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1634</b><br>demand for water resources will increase as a result of population
growth, a decreasing average household size and growing use of
water-intensive appliances. The current water restrictions in the
south-east resulting from exceptionally dry weather have brought a
requirement for new house building into sharper focus. I find it
inconceivable, with about 10 million people in London and the
south-east facing a hosepipe ban and the continuing possibility of
standpipes this summer, that the Government have not reduced their
house-building plans for the area. Those houses will all be built
before a single new reservoir can be built.</p><p><a name="06071459000323"><b><a name="06071459000773">Lyn
Brown:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</p><p><a name="06071459000324"><b><a name="06071459000774">Charles
Hendry:</b> I have already been generous in giving way, so
perhaps the hon. Lady will make her own speech in due course.</p><p><a name="06071459000325">The House of Lords Science and
Technology Committee report on water management recently considered
water infrastructure in relation to the Government&#146;s
house-building targets. Many of its findings are particularly damaging.
It says that</p><a name="06071459000609"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the ODPM
failed sufficiently to consult the water industry directly&#151;or to
give due consideration to the water management implications&#151;when
formulating the Sustainable Communities Plan and selecting the growth
areas.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000326">The report also
said:</p><a name="06071459000610"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is
worrying that the housing growth plans have not in many cases been
factored into the water companies&#146; long-term plans due to the
way in which Government have initiated the
planning.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000327">Thirdly, the
Lords report recommends the provisions in the Bill, urging
that</p><a name="06071459000611"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Government
consider making water companies statutory consultees on applications
for developments comprising a number of properties that exceeds a given
threshold. It would also be desirable to make the Environment Agency a
statutory consultee on water supply issues in these
circumstances.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000328">The
irony is that the Government will allow water companies to raise prices
to meet the enormous cost of providing new water
infrastructure&#151;a double blow for residents in the south-east,
where people are effectively being asked to fund the infrastructure for
houses that they do not even want. Even the Government&#146;s
preferred think-tank believes that current policy has been conceptually
flawed. The Institute for Public Policy Research commission on
sustainable development in the south-east noted in its final
report:</p><a name="06071459000612"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Only
with significant water efficiency savings in existing and new homes,
and the timely provision of new water resources, will there potentially
be enough water to meet rising demand for new housing and domestic
consumption.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000329">Flooding
is the third issue. It is now nearly six years since devastating floods
affected 10,000 people at the cost of &#163;10 billion. According to
the Environment Agency, 5 million people in 2 million properties are
already at risk of flooding. More than 40 per cent. of people are
unaware of the threat and 30 per cent. do not have adequate insurance
cover. One of the worst towns affected in the flooding of October 2000
was Uckfield in my constituency. Nearly six years on, no money has been
spent on new flood defences. We have had pledges, a reception at
Downing street, ministerial visits, consultants employed and even the
drawing up of a model that showed miraculously that if water is 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1635</b><br>poured into it, it comes out somewhere else&#151;but not a single
pound on flood defences to prevent a recurrence has been spent. Yet
Uckfield is expected to accommodate hundreds more houses over the next
few years, with more concrete and more drains putting more water in the
self-same rivers.</p><p><a name="06071459000330">Despite planning guidance
directing development away from areas at risk of flooding,
inappropriate development is still occurring. Data from the Environment
Agency for 2004 shows that 34,000 new homes are envisaged within the
indicative flood plains in local plans and that in the south-east
growth areas, 30 per cent. of development sites planned for 2016 to
2031 will be in flood-risk areas. That is yet another aspect that has
not been assessed and addressed.</p><p><a name="06071459000331">Fourthly, there is transport.
The total transport infrastructure in the south-east is estimated to
be &#163;21.3 billion. Increases in traffic congestion and
pollution are cited by residents in the south-east as their two top
local priorities, but there is no sign of significant improvement.
There has been a legacy of underspending on transport in Britain and
further public spending will be tighter in the coming years. By 2010,
road traffic is expected to increase by 23 to 29 per cent. in England
and by more than 25 per cent. in the south-east compared with
2000.</p><p><a name="06071459000332">There is
specific evidence to show that congestion in the south-east acts as a
brake on new development. For example, a total of 13 junction
improvements on the M1, the M11, the M20, the M3, the M27 and A3(M) are
necessary for proposed developments. However, those improvements are
subject to highways authority holding objections. The A2 outside Dover
is now the only stretch of single carriageway main route between
Carlisle and Italy. East Sussex has no motorway and there are only 12
miles of dual carriageway in the county. Vital improvements in dualling
the A27 along the south coast have been abandoned or put on
hold.</p><p><a name="06071459000333">On top of that,
there is the problem of maintenance backlogs. The average county
council has an estimated &#163;200 million to &#163;300 million
worth of maintenance work to do to bring highways up to a satisfactory
standard by 2026, but poor financial settlements mean that the
necessary work cannot be done.</p><p><a name="06071459000334">My hon. Friend the Member for
Mid-Sussex has continually highlighted the traffic problems around East
Grinstead. I was born in East Grinstead and a bypass was being
discussed even then. Indeed, it has been talked about since the 1920s.
Although the town&#146;s population has doubled in my lifetime, the
A22 through the town remains a disaster. I support my hon. Friends the
Members for Mid-Sussex and for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) in saying
that the town cannot take more houses without improvements in the road,
and that any solution must also be a solution for the surrounding
communities, such as Forest Row in my constituency and the villages in
East Surrey.</p><p><a name="06071459000335">Let us
consider rail. Concerns about overcrowding, especially on commuter
trains in the south-east, constitute the most common complaint that the
Office of Rail Regulation receives. Although some improvements have
been made, 4 per cent. of rail passengers into London in 2004-05 were
still without a seat. That figure will increase further with additional
house building. Along with the 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1636</b><br>hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker), I have been working with the
county council to examine the case for reopening the Uckfield-Lewes
rail link, which would not only provide an improved local service but
open up a strategic new link to the south coast. Despite thousands of
new houses being imposed on us, the Government will not put one penny
piece into that key infrastructure project.</p><p><a name="06071459000336">The message
could not be clearer. The Government expect the south-east to bear all
the pain of the new houses but none of the gain of improved
infrastructure. If we could prevent the unwanted new houses being
built, we would love to do that because they will destroy areas of
remarkable beauty for ever. However, the Bill is not about that. If the
Government are determined to impose such huge numbers of new houses,
against the wishes of local people, the least they can do is establish
the investment that is needed in the infrastructure to accommodate
them, and the Bill provides for that.</p><p><a name="06071459000337">The measure
requires local planning authorities to consult a range of authorities:
the health authority to ensure that GP and hospital services can meet
the additional demand; the relevant water companies and providers of
sewerage and waste services to ensure that they can meet the additional
demand; the education authority to ensure that local schools have
adequate capacity; and the highways authority and Network Rail to
ensure that there is capacity on the road and rail
networks.</p><p><a name="06071459000338">The Bill is
eminently sensible and commands great support in areas that face the
greatest housing pressure. It is an urgent measure and I hope
that it will be given time to proceed today. I urge hon. Members
to support
it.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000637">12.43
pm</h5><p><a name="06071459000339"><b><a name="06071459000775">Mike
Gapes (Ilford, South) (Lab/Co-op):</b> My situation is similar
to that of the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) in that there
is a lot of new build in my local authority area. However, my
constituency is urban and we have a lot of new build because we are
surrounded by the green belt, which acts as a straitjacket on all the
open spaces in the London borough of Redbridge, to such an extent that,
in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the
population in my borough, especially in my constituency. The
Conservative council in Redbridge has given planning permission for
33-storey and 21-storey tower blocks, and many additional housing units
are being
built.</p><p><a name="06071459000340">My
electorate, which was 78,000 at the election, will increase to about
82,000 in the next three or four years and will probably reach 90,000
10 years from now. I therefore face considerable pressure. Problems
involving changes of circumstances and a lack of facilities apply
equally in urban areas, with one exception&#151;the beautiful
Valentines park, where Essex used to play their
cricket.</p><p><a name="06071459000341">We
had a problem with finding additional school places, but a long
campaign was run over many years by a local residents association
against the development of a former sports field for a new primary
school. The council has just compulsorily purchased that sports field
to build the new school. In fact, we are having two new primary schools
built. However, we will also need a new secondary school in the near
future, and I have 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1637</b><br>absolutely no idea where the land for that will be found. Our existing
schools are all full, and I regularly see constituents in my surgery
who are being told that they must take their children to schools in the
north of the borough, four or five miles away, where there are places,
because there is none in the south of the borough.</p><p><a name="06071459000342">We all face such problems due
to rapid population change. I would like to point out to the hon.
Member for Wealden that it is predicted that the population in England
will increase from 50.1 million in 2004 to 55.8 million in
2026. That is an increase of 11 per cent., or 5.7 million people.
London&#146;s population is now increasing after years of decline,
and it will continue to increase because of London&#146;s
success as a global city and the great success of the economic policies
of this Government.</p><p><a name="06071459000343">We face a
real problem, however. There is insufficient land in London to provide
housing for all the people who are already in desperate housing need,
including those in the London borough of Redbridge and other boroughs
who are in temporary bed and breakfast accommodation. I have
constituents who have been placed in my borough by Tower Hamlets,
Hackney and Newham councils because they cannot find housing for them
in their own boroughs. For several years, my council was placing people
in guest houses in Southend-on-Sea out of season in order to deal with
the emergency housing needs of so many homeless people.</p><p><a name="06071459000344">We need new housing. We need
the new housing in the Thames Gateway, but we also need it in other
areas. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech was a little like the
curate&#146;s egg: parts of it were good, and parts were very bad.
The bad parts illustrated to me that the Bill is not all that it seems,
and that it represents a very sophisticated form of nimbyism. It is
saying, &#147;We want to carry out an audit, and when we find that
the facilities are not there, we will stop the houses being built in
our area.&#148;</p><p><a name="06071459000345">People in urban centres such as
my constituency do not live in a green and pleasant land. We have the
dark, satanic mills&#151;except that they are no longer mills but
rows and rows of houses, because manufacturing industry has gone and
the landscape has been transformed. Nevertheless, we do not have the
same green and pleasant areas that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
constituency has, yet the building will go on in our areas rather than
elsewhere in the region. I suspect that many of the people who live in
his constituency get on the train and come into London to work, earn
their nice salaries from working in our capital city and go back to
their homes and enjoy their environment.</p><p><a name="06071459000346">Many of my constituents suffer
as a result of the lack of space and the congestion caused by the
growth of the city, but we have to recognise that nimbyism is a threat
to the vast majority of people living in urban areas. Someone must
speak up for people who cannot speak for themselves, and do not have
sophisticated pressure groups and campaigns to preserve this or stop
that. Although the hon. Gentleman made a number of valid points, he
also made a number of sophisticated nimbyist points.</p><p><a name="06071459000347">As the hon. Gentleman will
know, the Government have conducted various surveys to forecast the
number of homes that will be needed for our growing population. An
inevitable consequence of changes in lifestyle and the ageing
population is the fact that we 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1638</b><br>have more and more single households. Between now and 2026, the number
of households will grow by 209,000 a year, and 72 per cent. of them
will be single-person households. But we are not delivering 209,000
homes a year; in 2004-05, the most recent year for which we have
statistics, we delivered only two thirds of that number&#151;168,000.
There is a
gap.</p><p><a name="06071459000348">People
are having to live in overcrowded accommodation, with friends or
relatives or in temporary accommodation because they cannot obtain the
housing that they need. The private rented market has not provided
enough homes to meet the social needs of people in all categories. We
therefore need social housing, and a mechanism to ensure that it is
provided throughout the country, not just in certain areas. That
necessitates a proactive approach from central Government, consulting
and, I hope, in co-operation with local authorities. In London we have
a Mayor with planning powers, and what he does is very important, but
we need a national strategy. The brunt should not be borne by those of
us who live in urban areas, or in new areas such as the Thames
Gateway.</p><p><a name="06071459000349">We can do
some valuable things. Yesterday I spoke at a public meeting organised
by Friends of the Earth in the neighbouring constituency of my right
hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge). She and I were
both on the platform. A representative of Barking council talked about
the borough&#146;s interesting plans to deal with the huge increase
in its population as part of the Thames Gateway development. There will
be about 140,000 new homes, or housing units, in the Thames Gateway.
Many of the homes in Barking will be built at a higher level than the
town centre. The hon. Gentleman talked about flood plains. Although
these homes are being built on a flood plain, they will be in less
danger of flooding than the existing
ones.</p><p><a name="06071459000350">The new housing
will enable us to do something about climate change. We can introduce
solar panels, and district heating schemes. We can use the surplus
water from power stations: when the water has cooled them, it can be
used for district heating schemes. Enormous gains can be made from
modern, technological housing development. We do not all benefit from
living in areas containing 17th-century and 18th-century cottages; any
that existed in Ilford have long gone. In the 17th and 18th centuries
Ilford was just a little hamlet, an adjunct to Barking, where the abbey
was. The only buildings of any great age in my constituency are the
hospital chapel, a fantastic building that dates back to the 11th and
12th centuries, and Valentine&#146;s mansion, which dates back to the
end of the 17th century. My constituency, like many others, only had a
few thousand people 120 years ago, and then the railway came. As a
result, my borough has a quarter of a million people. Further growth
and urbanisation of London followed as the suburbs linked together, and
we ended up with a global city.</p><p><a name="06071459000351">Change is inevitable, and we
need to manage that change. Last December, in response to the Barker
review of housing supply, the Government published several documents,
including a consultation document on the planning gain supplement,
which contained several interesting proposals, including modifications
to section 106. That also raised the issue of whether it is right that
people derive private benefit from huge increases in the value of their
land and in their ability to make money, effectively at the public
expense, while 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1639</b><br>a mechanism is not provided for the public to
benefit in return. The community, not just the private interest that is
fortunate enough to own land in an area of development, needs to
benefit.</p><p><a name="06071459000352">The
Government&#146;s response in December 2005 set out a commitment to
provide more homes for future generations and an ambitious package of
measures to help people into home ownership and to increase social
housing, which is vital. When I was young, I lived in a council
house&#151;</p><p><a name="06071459000353"><b><a name="06071459000776">The

is younger than me, but we will not go into that.</p><p><a name="06071459000355">When I was younger than I am
now, many years ago, the area where I was growing up, Hainault, in the
Ilford, North constituency, had a large body of social housing. There
was as huge estate. Since the 1970s, almost all the houses have been
sold. Compensatory social housing has not been built in the London
borough of Redbridge. Since the Labour council of a few years in the
1990s, a policy of housing association developments has been in place,
but the total number of social housing units is only a few
thousand.</p><p><a name="06071459000356">Every week
at my advice surgery, people complain about shortages of housing. They
say that they bid for a property under the Choice scheme, with a glossy
booklet produced by the east London councils. After checking, we find
that there were 250 bids, and that the constituent is, say, number 37
or 64 on the list. The constituent says, &#147;What is the point of
bidding?&#148; We contact the council, and the council officers issue
a standard letter&#151;I know what it will say before I read
it&#151;that there is a scheme, people can bid and the constituent is
entitled to do so. That is it, unless, there is some overriding medical
need.</p>

<p><a name="06071459000357">I have quite
a lot of large families in my constituency, and I was told that, apart
from new build, only about four or five local authority or housing
association properties with four bedrooms become available in the
borough every year. There might be 40 families with overriding medical
needs, yet they will not get one of those properties. We need new
housing to meet those social needs and we cannot allow selfish nimbyism
in certain areas to prevent the majority of people from accessing the
housing that they require. Not everybody has the ability or resources
to purchase a property. We therefore need mixed tenure&#151;joint
ownership, shared equity and so on. Above all, we need to build
properties for people to live in, and we need them in areas where we
have the land, access and
communication.</p><p><a name="06071459000358">We also
need sometimes to create new communities. The hon. Member for Wealden
(Charles Hendry) referred in error in his interesting speech to Essex
and motorways. My constituency has the Redbridge roundabout, which is
the second most polluted area for particulates in the air, according to
the <i> Evening Standard </i>survey two years
ago&#151;</p><p><a name="06071459000359"><b><a name="06071459000778">Madam

comes down to the Redbridge roundabout, and along its route communities
have been growing. Throughout Essex and Cambridgeshire, one can see
hamlets and new housing all along the motorway. The M11 has provided a
means for new build and new communities. I agree with the hon.
Gentleman that improved road communication in his constituency and
elsewhere would be good, but would he campaign against a motorway going
through the beautiful countryside, the virtues of which he was
extolling? Perhaps he would. I would welcome an intervention if he
wishes to intervene. Obviously not; I will carry
on.</p><p><a name="06071459000361">The Government
have an ambition to raise the level of house building in England to
200,000 a year by 2016. That is a big ambition, but in the 1960s we
built far more than that a year. Many of the properties that we built
at that time&#151;we must learn the lessons&#151;have had to be
knocked down because they were tower blocks and not very good, but we
desperately need the housing and transport infrastructure, particularly
if London is to maintain its position as a global city. In that
context, Crossrail is vital, and I look forward to the Bill going to
the other place very soon.</p><p><a name="06071459000362"><b><a name="06071459000780">Charles

the Bill? The Bill calls for such infrastructure. We are grateful for
his

Gapes:</b> The hon. Gentleman was listening and he heard what
I said. I said that his Bill is an interesting, sophisticated form of
nimbyism. His speech was a curate&#146;s egg. I am endorsing some of
what he said, but I also have concerns. Those who are against new
housing and who are nimbyish will hide behind aspects of the Bill,
because they see it as a way of delaying, prevaricating and stopping
the housing development that is so
vital.</p><p><a name="06071459000365">We need to ensure that new
homes are built in areas where they are needed. The hon. Gentleman is
right that we need to look at the infrastructure and at water supply. I
agree that there is a serious problem of water shortages in London and
the south-east, but the main cause is the water companies and their
massive leaks, which waste far more water than could be lost through an
hon. Member with a leaky tap.</p><p><a name="06071459000366"><b><a name="06071459000782">Lyn

Water&#146;s record is truly disgraceful? Would it not be abhorrent
to our constituents if that private sector company&#146;s record
stopped them from getting the homes built that they desperately
need?</p><p><a name="06071459000367"><b><a name="06071459000783">Mike

Suffolk Water and Thames Water&#151;operate in the London borough of
Redbridge. We need to take a serious approach to the water companies,
because it is a disgrace that water charges increase while those
companies continue to waste our water through
leaks&#151;</p><p><a name="06071459000368"><b><a name="06071459000784">Madam
Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. However serious that complaint is,
it is not relevant to the Bill.</p><br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1641</b><br><p><a name="06071459000369"><b><a name="06071459000785">Mike
Gapes:</b> I appreciate your words, Madam Deputy
Speaker.</p><p><a name="06071459000370">The
Government&#146;s housing and planning policies are set out in
planning policy guidance note 3, which was published in 2000, and in
the draft planning policy statement that is to replace PPG3 later this
year. An essential part of PPG3 is a move away from the old-fashioned
predict and provide approach, which seems to underlie the Bill, to a
planning, monitoring and management approach. Local authorities and
central Government must use much more forward planning and, in that
respect, I have some sympathy with some of the comments of the hon.
Member for Wealden. Forward planning is needed in relation to both
housing and capacity, both existing and planned and thought must be
given to the provision of schools, doctors&#146; surgeries, hospitals
and other infrastructure.</p><p><a name="06071459000371">We also need
to take account of the potential for unexpected developments. For
example, the number of people in work affects the amount of traffic on
the roads. In the days of Conservative Government, when we had 3
million unemployed, far fewer people were travelling to and from work,
so there was less traffic and less congestion. Under the Labour
Government, people are more prosperous. There are 28 million people in
work, more people own cars and drive them to the supermarket to shop or
on holiday. The downside to higher levels of economic activity, as I
pointed out to Friends of the Earth last night, is that, sometimes,
that affects our ability to meet our targets on carbon emissions and
other targets. However, I do not want to live in a world where we all
go back to living in caves&#151;or the Conservative version, where we
have 3 million unemployed. I would rather have a Labour Government and
high employment and prosperity, but recognise that we have to manage
the consequences.</p><p><a name="06071459000372">That is why we need planning.
That is why sometimes we have to say to local communities that it is
all very well their saying no to this and no to that, but there is a
greater good and a greater need. The residents of two streets might not
want a school to be built opposite them because they think it will
generate traffic, but we have to take account of the families living in
the 30 surrounding streets who have children who will attend that
school and benefit from its existence. That, of course, is when we have
to take on board the wider community interest. The same arguments apply
nationally, as well. For that reason, I welcome the fact that the
Government are going to revise their planning policy guidance and I
look forward to the outcome later this
year.</p><p><a name="06071459000373">We
need to create mixed communities. I hope that we have moved away from
the ghettoisation of poor people and people in social housing. Many of
the new housing developments in my borough mix different housing
together. Under the rules laid down by the Mayor of London and agreed
with central Government, a proportion of social housing has to be
provided in all new housing developments above a certain size, but
clearly there are ways in which developers get round that. They find
smaller units and try to get under the threshold. We must make sure
that people of all kinds can get housing in the areas where they need
to live.</p><p><a name="06071459000374">One
by-product of that is the impact on our economy. In the debate on the
previous Bill, we talked about public service workers and protecting
emergency workers. 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1642</b><br>They need protection and they need to be prevented from being obstructed
in their work, but they also need somewhere to live. In London, we
increasingly find that people who work in our health services, and our
police, teachers and firefighters&#151;people who work in the whole
range of public services&#151;cannot afford to live in the boroughs
where they work. They have to commute from a long way out because of
the lack of social housing or affordable housing in the big cities.
That is not a healthy development, because, apart from anything else,
it means that people do not necessarily relate to the communities in
which they work, because they do not live there. We need to get a
balance. I am not saying that we should tell people where to
live&#151;far from it. There should be freedom of choice, but people
should have that choice. They should have the ability to purchase a
property or to pay the rent in the areas where they wish to
work.</p><p><a name="06071459000375">In my borough,
there are young teachers who spend their first three or four years
after qualifying working in our primary schools. Then they look for
promotion and immediately move out of the London borough of Redbridge
and the excellent schools in Ilford to some other part of the country,
because they can afford the housing there and they cannot afford it in
their current area. We lose their experience, which is not good for
continuity or the needs of young people.</p><p><a name="06071459000376"><b><a name="06071459000786">Lyn
Brown:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the biggest
difficulties that both of our communities face is high private rents?
They would more than cover the mortgage of an individual. People who
are being forced to live in private rented accommodation in our
communities because of the lack of availability of public sector
housing often find themselves in a poverty trap and cannot work,
despite wanting to, because they cannot afford to work and pay the
private rents.</p><p><a name="06071459000377"><b><a name="06071459000787">Mike
Gapes:</b> My hon. Friend is right. That is the biggest
problem. When someone is paying &#163;230 or &#163;260 a week in
private rent for a three-bedroom property, which seems to be about the
going rate in my borough, they have to have a large income to afford
it. The problem is that people get trapped. People who want to work
cannot get off the benefits cycle. As soon as they get a job, their
housing benefit is reduced and they are in a situation in which working
has become almost useless to them in terms of bettering their
life.</p><p><a name="06071459000378"><b><a name="06071459000788">Madam
Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Again, may I remind the hon.
Gentleman of the content of the Bill? Perhaps he will address his
remarks accordingly.</p><p><a name="06071459000379"><b><a name="06071459000789">Mike
Gapes:</b> The planning system has an important role to play
in ensuring that the housing market is flexible and responsive to these
needs and that we can provide homes for all the people in all our
communities, including those who are trapped and paying extortionate
private rents. Some people become trapped in other ways. A couple might
move into a social housing property when they had no children, or one
child, and then expand their family so that they end up with three or
four children but are then unable to find a property in their area
within their price range, become subject to the whims of the housing
association, and cannot find a property to transfer to 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1643</b><br>near to where the children are at school. That is dilemma that I hear
about
regularly.</p><p><a name="06071459000380"><b><a name="06071459000790">Lyn
Brown:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that London has the
highest rates of overcrowding in the country? There has been a 20 per
cent. increase in overcrowding since 1991. The only way in which we can
deal with that and with private rents in a market-driven way is to
address the supply of public sector and private sector housing to drive
down rents and increase the affordability of
tenancies.</p><p><a name="06071459000381"><b><a name="06071459000791">Mike
Gapes:</b> I agree. I therefore welcome the various
initiatives recently introduced by the Government. They are not
sufficient, but at least they are a step in the right direction. I also
welcome the issuing of the code for sustainable homes, on which there
was a consultation that ended in March. That code is to be strengthened
to improve the environmental sustainability of homes so that when
people move to a new home it is not of poor quality but subject to a
high standards. The Government are going to revise the code to ensure
that energy efficiency ratings are made mandatory for new and existing
homes. That will help poorer people because it will reduce their fuel
bills. There will also be minimum standards of water efficiency and
measures to ensure that builders and people in the building trade must
have the highest standards and not engage in jerry-building and
competing on the basis of low
quality.</p><p><a name="06071459000382">Many
things can be done to ensure that we meet the needs of our communities.
We must consider energy and micro-technology. Wind turbines, which are
popular, should be put not only on the houses of people with lots of
money in the countryside but on those of people in cities where that is
sensible and
sustainable.</p><p><a name="06071459000383"><b><a name="06071459000792">Madam

Gapes:</b> The audit that the Bill proposes is unnecessary. We
already have many forms of planning guidance, consultations and other
measures that have been put forward by the Government over many years.
The essence of the Bill is a sophisticated delaying
tactic&#151;</p><p><a name="06071459000385"><b><a name="06071459000794">Michael

grateful for the recognition. Cunctator is my
nickname.</p><p><a name="06071459000387">I
believe that the promoter of the Bill has the best of intentions, but
it is misguided and will not help to deal with the problems of my
constituents. It is unnecessary because there are already many
different forms of planning that take account of these needs. We do not
want a static picture that relates only to the current situation.
Foresight is needed, as we must consider the future. We need, too, to
build in flexibility to accommodate the unexpected, including changes
in world energy prices and the economic cycle. We need sophisticated
measures 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1644</b><br>to take into account a range of issues and, although the Bill is well
intentioned, it is not necessarily the best way forward.</p><p><a name="06071459000388">Finally&#151;hon. Members
will be pleased to hear that word&#151;may I refer to measures that
are already under consideration, including water management. The
Department for Communities and Local Government is working with the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to look at water
resources and the needs of new communities. That work should be
strengthened so that the water companies deliver their commitments over
a 25-year period or longer. We must make sure that new homes are built
in areas that are environmentally sustainable. It is not just a
question of water but of other resources in the
region.</p><p><a name="06071459000389"><b><a name="06071459000796">Lyn
Brown:</b> Does my right hon. Friend agree that sustainable
communities should provide a community-based infrastructure which,
however, was not provided in the docklands in the early 1990s? Homes
were provided, but not schools, hospitals or any community facilities
at all by the London Docklands development corporation. The Government
have recognised the folly of such
activity&#151;</p><p><a name="06071459000390"><b><a name="06071459000797">Madam
Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Lady&#146;s comments are
rather wide of the Bill.</p><p><a name="06071459000391"><b><a name="06071459000798">Mike
Gapes:</b> I shall avoid delving into the history of the
docklands, Madam Deputy Speaker, but I agree with my hon.
Friend.</p><p><a name="06071459000392">There is
already statutory consultation on regional spatial strategies and local
development frameworks by the Environment Agency and water companies,
and planning authorities will have more statutory powers to require
water companies to consult on the management of water resources in
future. Such powers are overdue but, hopefully, they will be introduced
next year.</p><p><a name="06071459000393">Other
measures are in hand to look at the question of household growth, and
that should be taken into account when water companies consult Ofwat
about pricing and so on. It is essential to take a coherent, planned
approach to many of those things, and it is not sufficient to look at
them purely in the local context. We need, too, to emphasise the need
to save water&#151;a subject I have already touched on&#151;and we
need to make sure that statutory bodies, including Government agencies
and Departments, consumer organisations and the Consumer Council for
Water take part in the consultation to ensure that the correct
decisions are made.</p><p><a name="06071459000394">The new code for sustainable
homes must ensure that builders and home owners are given guidance on
ways in which they can improve existing properties. It is all very well
dealing with new build, but people who build conversions and
extensions, or otherwise change their properties, could install solar
panels or mechanisms to use waste water to irrigate their garden. Such
measures are small steps, but they make a huge difference. I should
add, in passing, that if everybody was told to take their televisions
off standby and disconnect their mobile phone chargers from the socket,
they would save a lot of electricity.</p><p><a name="06071459000395">I hope
that, over the coming years, we will see a significant increase in the
amount of housing and home building. It is urgently needed. I hope that
some 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1645</b><br>of it will continue to be in my constituency, but I also hope that we
will not be put in a straitjacket and that all new developments will
not take place in already overcrowded areas that suffer from traffic
pollution, congestion and a shortage of public open space, parks and
leisure facilities. I hope that we will be able to say that the country
as a whole is benefiting as well as making a contribution to the
building of sustainable communities and decent homes for
all.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000638">1.26

Nicholas Soames (Mid-Sussex) (Con):</b> It may not be

parliamentary away-day, I won one of the chameleon awards for the
biggest contribution to environmental affairs for my extensive role in
nature conservation work. I say that because listening to the hon.

near-death experience, and when I was wondering why, I remembered that
gapes is a fatal disease in
grouse.</p><p><a name="06071459000397">I
realise that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s role today is to act as a
logjam, but I have seldom heard more nonsense talked, even on a Friday,
about a serious Bill, of which my right hon. Friend the Member for
Horsham (Mr. Maude) is the promoter and I am pleased to be a
sponsor. The Bill was admirably and expertly introduced by my good
Friend and parliamentary neighbour the Member for Wealden (Charles
Hendry) who, together with me and many other local Members of
Parliament, is involved in a campaign that could not be further from
the vices attributed to us by the hon. Member for Ilford, South.
Indeed, it will be the answer that the Under-Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley
(Meg Munn) uses, if and when she has a moment to
speak.</p><p><a name="06071459000398">A number of
us&#151;my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham, and my hon.
Friends the Members for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) and for Arundel and
South Downs (Nick Herbert) and the chief executives and leaders of the
district councils&#151;went to see the Minister for Housing and
Planning to talk about the problems associated with infrastructure and
housing targets. We explained that we were not against more housing and
understood the need for further and more affordable housing in the
south of England, but she accused us of being nimbys, not wanting the
housing and so on.</p><p><a name="06071459000399">May
I lay to rest the suggestion that the Bill is a plot to stop the
building of more housing? It is a plot to prevent the Government from
imposing housing targets on areas of the south-east which are already
creaking and do not have the infrastructure to cope with the housing
that we already have, that which we are going to get and that which
will be imposed on us in the future. Let us dispel the impression
created by the 50 minutes of drivel from the hon. Member for Ilford,
South and return to a first class Bill that is trying to do something
very important&#151;that is, to secure the quality of life for people
of all backgrounds and all walks of life.</p><p><a name="06071459000400">The picture portrayed by the
hon. Gentleman of some downtrodden urban minority struggling in the
inner cities, as opposed to people who spend their entire lives in
traffic jams, is pathetic. I agree that the 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1646</b><br>problem is a national problem. It cannot simply be looked at locally.
The Bill is a serious attempt to devise a national procedure for an
audit of the infrastructure, so that what his Government have always
promised can, unusually, be made true, and infrastructure will keep
pace with housing development.</p><p><a name="06071459000401">I first raised this question
years ago. In 2000 I went to see the right hon. Member for Streatham
(Keith Hill), who was then a Minister at the Office of the Deputy Prime
Minister and is now the Prime Minister&#146;s admirable Parliamentary
Private Secretary, to discuss the real problems caused by the creaking
infrastructure in my constituency and other constituencies such as
Wealden, East Surrey and Horsham&#151;the places that we know best,
which are struggling to cope with further housing. At that time, I
participated in serious discussions about the infrastructure
deficit.</p><p><a name="06071459000402">My hon.
Friends the Members for Arundel and South Downs, for Chichester and for
East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) all wanted to be here today,
but they are attending meetings to try to save some of the most
important assets in the health service in the south of England, St.
Richard&#146;s hospital in Chichester and Worthing hospital, which
are in danger of being downgraded. That illustrates the vital
importance of health infrastructure, which my hon. Friend the Member
for Wealden has mentioned.</p><p><a name="06071459000403">My hon. Friend the Member for
Wealden was generous in his comments about the campaign that we have
fought in Mid-Sussex to preserve vital services at the Princess Royal
hospital in Haywards Heath and the Queen Victoria hospital in East
Grinstead, which is particularly well known to him. Incidentally, the
Government have not even consulted the health service on major housing
targets. No one has bothered to consult the NHS on plans for the
future. If anyone had, the strategic health authority in my area would
not be starting another consultation, which will lead to further
recommendations to cut services.</p><p><a name="06071459000404">I want to relate the Bill to
one particular problem in my constituency. We must provide about 14,100
homes in Mid-Sussex between 2006 and 2026. The plan is to build some
2,500 of those homes on a greenfield site in the beautiful town of East
Grinstead in addition to a further 2,000 homes in the town, making a
total of up to 4,600 houses in one small market town, which is out of
all sense of scale and proportion. The plan has been subject to a
planning consultation, which has just ended, in which it attracted
almost universal objection from local residents, who are extremely
anxious. I anticipate that the result of the consultation will be a
strong no to what the council has had foisted on it and is having to
propose.</p><p><a name="06071459000405">As I have
said, the plan would result in about 4,500 new houses in East Grinstead
alone, which would result in a new population of more than
11,000&#151;3,000 extra schoolchildren, 1,600 extra school places,
1,500 pensioners, a requirement for 5,000 jobs, 2,000 extra commuters
and 6,000 extra cars on the road. To put the matter in context, that
development does not include a single penny of Government funding for
infrastructure to maintain my constituents&#146; quality of life
under such a huge weight of development.</p><p><a name="06071459000406">The Minister may have heard of
the Gatwick diamond, which is an economic zone. There is a proposal to
build 41,200 houses between 2006 and 2026 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1647</b><br>in the Gatwick diamond, which is more than 2,000 houses a year. That
level of activity is almost twice that of Ashford and similar to that
of Milton Keynes. Both Ashford and Milton Keynes receive enormous
public support and help for building infrastructure to keep pace with
the development of homes. No help at all is available in Mid-Sussex
from the Government. At present, the infrastructure charge per house is
likely to be about &#163;46,000. How will that help affordable
housing? How will people be able to afford house prices that will
sustain such an infrastructure spend?</p><p><a name="06071459000407">Another consideration is water.
A distinguished environmentalist who sits on the Labour Benches said to
me yesterday, &#147;There are 14 million people in the south of
England at present living under a hosepipe ban. A massive increase in
housing development is proposed. Where do the Government expect the
water to come from?&#148; How can this be called sustainable
development?</p><p><a name="06071459000408"><b><a name="06071459000800">Mr.

not.</p><p><a name="06071459000410">Does the Minister
have any idea of what sustainable development is? When I asked a
parliamentary question three years ago&#151;I was seeking a
definition of sustainable development&#151;the answer was, &#147;I
will reply to the hon. Gentleman shortly.&#148; There was not even an
answer. Since then, what sustainable development means has changed
according to the whim of the Minister at the time.</p><p><a name="06071459000411">There is a water shortage.
There is great anxiety about the quality of water, about the treatment
of sewage, about the quality of life and about roads, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Wealden rightly said. The exit turn of the A23 to East
Grinstead is already running at full capacity. Just up the road at
Horley, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for East
Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth), there is a development of 2,000 houses. The
occupiers of those houses will use the A23. There are 4,000 houses to
be built at East Grinstead. The exit turn of the A20 is already running
practically at capacity. I assumed that it was a national asset and
that the Highways Agency would want to pay for it. Not a bit of it. It
is to be paid for by the developers. How are developers to pay for the
exit turn of the A23 and improvements to the A264 and the A22, build a
relief road, build schools, create green places and build all the other
things that make a civilised, viable contribution? How is all that to
be provided just by the developers, without any contribution from the
Government?</p><p><a name="06071459000412">I say to
the Minister, &#147;You cannot go on willing on the south-east a
scale of development which is intolerable environmentally.&#148; By
any definition of sustainability, environmental security and of all the
other things the Government witter on about, what they are willing on
the south-east of England is utterly unfeasible. There needs to be an
audit of the infrastructure.</p><br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1648</b><br><p><a name="06071459000413"><b><a name="06071459000802">Mr.

disgusted by what is going on in the House today to try to thwart a
piece of legislation that is both environmentally important and
important for all our local
communities?</p><p><a name="06071459000414"><b><a name="06071459000803">Mr.
Soames:</b> My hon. Friend makes an essential point. The
Government&#146;s intentions are clear. The speech by the hon. Member
for Ilford, South (Mike Gapes) was a disgrace and will be noted by
constituents throughout the land who have a vital interest in their
quality of life, that of their children and that of their
grandchildren. Terrible harm will be done to the environment of the
south-east because of what the Government are willing on
us.</p><p><a name="06071459000415">I have in my hand
a letter from the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury dated 10
February 2000. It was written after I had raised questions with him and
had asked for an audit of the infrastructure in mid-Sussex and wider
Sussex. He
said:</p><a name="06071459000613"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Again, I
can offer an assurance that this will be one of our principal concerns
once a decision is taken on numbers of new houses to be built is
resolved. There is no question of planning for new homes while
excluding planning for the range of services required to build thriving
communities.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000416">That has
been shown to be a bare-faced terminological inexactitude. It has not
happened, and it is not happening. The Government are not doing what
they promised to do. They have not backed with plans and Government
money the additional infrastructure required to sustain the level of
housing that the Minister and her hon. Friends are
demanding.</p><p><a name="06071459000417">Other
Members want to speak, so I do not wish to go on&#151;as I could
do&#151;except to make two further points. This is a terribly serious
matter. The environment cannot be played with like a toy, at the
political whim of whoever happens to be in power. It needs to be at the
heart of development in the south-east of England. At present, the
Government are denying that, and they are destroying much of what has
been built up over the
years.</p><p><a name="06071459000418">Decades of
unsustainable development has put our region&#146;s environment under
significant pressure, and that makes the Bill even more important.
Development is not always bad. Indeed, it is often good; it can be good
for the environment, as long as it is in the right place, well designed
and well supported by properly funded infrastructure. Without planning
for water supply and sewerage, waste disposal, flood risk management,
proper roads and railways that function, communities simply cannot
function. The quality of life of my constituents in East Grinstead,
Haywards Heath, Burgess Hill and the surrounding areas, which are the
engine room of the economy of this country, inevitably will
decline.</p><p><a name="06071459000419">The
current infrastructure in south-east England is struggling to cope with
existing demand. The most careful planning is needed to accommodate the
proposed number of new houses. The Minister nods her head, but that is
not happening; there is no plan whatever to support the infrastructure
in and around my constituency with Government money. There is no plan.
All the 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1649</b><br>money has gone to places such as Ashford&#151;to what are called the
growth areas. If these developments go ahead as planned, there will be
very serious consequences for the environment of this
country.</p><p><a name="06071459000420">The
decisions that need to be made are very difficult. They involve a whole
series of issues, which are all connected to one another, and
constitute the most formidable challenge for Government policy and for
the lives of our constituents throughout the country. They include
climate change, pollution, biodiversity, the countryside and water.
They also involve all the other things that go to make a civilised
life: how we deal with waste; how we enable our people to travel to
work; how we enable our children to be educated, and where they play;
the quality of public space and our whole urban landscape; working and
living patterns; and the fact that the natural landscape of this
country is about to be concreted over. Other issues include traffic
jams, juggernauts in rural areas, the balance between road and rail,
carbon emissions, demographic change and the supply and affordability
of housing.</p>

<p><a name="06071459000421">It is
just not possible to separate those issues. They have to be addressed
in the round. That is why the Bill is so important: it would make the
planners conduct an audit of infrastructure in every regard, in order
to understand whether there is the local infrastructure to support the
kind of development that the Government are willing, and the housing
that we do indeed need in our constituencies to accommodate
people&#151;to enable people to continue living in such areas and to
enable people new to those areas to buy
homes.</p><p><a name="06071459000422">It is not
possible to docket such issues in one Government Department or under
one heading. It is a disgrace that they are being dealt with in the
current disjointed and dysfunctional way. The Minister must report back
to her Secretary of State that they need to get a grip of that, and
understand that such development cannot be just handed down by diktat
without any thought or concern for the quality of the lives of those on
the receiving end of the Deputy Prime Minister&#146;s odious plans.
The problems are not just environmental, social, or economic, but all
three at one and the same time. The way in which we think about and
handle those problems will have the most profound effects on our
financial prosperity, our society, our environment, and above all, on
the quality of life of not only all our people living now, but those to
come in the
future.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000639">1.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06071459000423"><b><a name="06071459000804">Barbara
Keeley (Worsley) (Lab):</b> The Bill is concerned with the
tension between two groups in our local communities that has been
reflected in the past two speeches that we have heard. The first group
are those who need homes, but find that they cannot get them because of
a substantial housing shortfall, especially in urban areas. The second
group are those who are living in areas in which they do not want
further and more intensive development. It is difficult to balance
those two groups&#146; concerns, and that is something of which I
have experience.</p><p><a name="06071459000424">When
I served as an elected member on the Trafford local authority in the
north-west, I represented a town-centre ward for nine years. That part
of Trafford is a desirable area with good schools, so it was a target 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1650</b><br>for housing development. Most of the substantial planning applications
resulted in a large volume of objections from local residents, and a
key part of my work as an elected member was dealing with them.
However, at the same time, we had a shortage of homes in the area. The
situation was difficult for couples, families and young people who
wanted to get their first independent accommodation and move out of
their parents&#146;
home.</p><p><a name="06071459000425">We know that the
number of households has increased by 30 per cent. over the past 30
years. We clearly have an ageing population because people are living
longer. However, we must balance other key factors when we consider the
mix of housing that we need. There are now more lone-parent households.
Most elected representatives, especially those in local government,
will find that they are continually dealing with couples who have split
up, both of whom want accommodation in which their children can live
for part of the time, which also increases the numbers of houses that
we need.</p><p><a name="06071459000426">It is
predicted that the population will have grown by 11 per cent., or 5.7
million people, by 2026. The number of households is increasing by
209,000 a year, of which 72 per cent. will be single-person households,
which is a key point. However, there is a gap, because we are building
only 168,000 extra homes a year. We must acknowledge that there is thus
a shortfall in housing. The Government&#146;s ambition in response to
the Barker review is to increase the supply of new homes to 200,000 a
year by 2016. Of course, it is also recognised that new homes must be
in sustainable
communities.</p><p><a name="06071459000427">Planning
guidance has been changing since I served in local government. The main
guidance for planning policy on housing was set out in planning policy
guidance note 3, which was published in 2000. PPG3 became a well-known
acronym in local government. However, I understand that it will be
replaced later this year by planning policy statement 3. The main
difference seems to be a move away from the simple predict-and-provide
approach to housing towards one of planning, monitoring and managing.
We need such an approach on planning, so the choice is to be
applauded.</p><p><a name="06071459000428">The local
housing market has not responded to local need, and it is no
exaggeration to say that the shortage of housing causes absolute misery
in communities. We want residents to be able to get their first step on
the housing ladder. People often want to take that first step in the
area in which they grew up, where their family and friends are.
However, my experience shows that areas often become overheated. In the
town centre that I represented, small, new apartments that were built
were put on the market for about &#163;200,000, which was way above
what a young person or couple in that area could
afford.</p><p><a name="06071459000429">The
planning system has a role to play in improving the responsiveness and
flexibility of the housing market because everything that I saw
suggested that if the housing market was left to its own devices, it
would not meet all needs. So we need affordable units of starter
accommodation for couples and young people and in other areas we need
affordable family homes. We also need much more accommodation for older
people. The area I represented had the largest concentration of older
people anywhere in the borough. Some of 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1651</b><br>it&#151;sheltered housing, for example&#151;was very good, but
nowhere near enough of that type of housing was available to support
the many people growing older and frailer.</p><p><a name="06071459000430">The Bill may prevent the
development of sufficient accommodation for older people&#146;s
needs, which is one of my main concerns about it. We are considering
what we need in sustainable communities, but I feel that the needs of
older people merit much more
consideration.</p><p><a name="06071459000431">A
constituent told me about one of his friends who had grown older and
whose wife had died. His standards declined and he even failed to wash
or keep up at all with how he looked. He simply could not keep up the
maintenance of his home, which was burgled, so he became fearful and
his health went into even further decline. My constituent, speaking on
behalf of his friend, asked whether there was a service to help with
the very difficult move from his lifelong home. The man was living in
the place he had shared with his wife and he needed to move somewhere
warm and secure that would be more suitable for him as he got older. I
faced the difficulty that local government did not really have such a
service at that time, when the housing market just produced what the
housing market produced and there was nobody around to help that person
with the move.</p><p><a name="06071459000432">At
that time, the sort of help that the man required did not exist, but I
believe that it is more available now because we have sheltered housing
with wardens and even a move to extra care in housing, so that people
can remain in their own homes and receive the sort of care that was
previously available only in nursing homes. That is the mix of housing
needed in most areas. Having suitable and sufficient accommodation for
older people and a change in the type of accommodation as people grow
older is increasingly becoming a problem. It has started to be
recognised, but we need to pay much more attention to it.</p><p><a name="06071459000433">I have spoken about the mix of
houses needed in most areas. Without the appropriate mix of
accommodation to meet the needs of older people, their health can
rapidly decline, so we really need the right mix. We also need a mix of
measures to make new houses sustainable, to make them energy efficient
and efficient in the use of water in the kitchen and bathroom, which
the last two speakers mentioned. Improved fittings and appliances can
help. The bigger issue is that water companies must address the level
of leaks, but that matter is probably outside the scope of
today&#146;s debate.</p><p><a name="06071459000434">I understand that there is to
be a strengthened code for sustainable homes, which will ensure that
new homes are efficient in energy and water. That is important not just
for the environment, because as the code suggests, householders need
better information about the running costs of their homes. There is now
a virtuous circle: using less water and energy is the aim, but it
entails saving money on utility bills, which most people want. I
believe that the strengthened code will incorporate that.</p><p><a name="06071459000435">In growth
areas such as health and education, I understand that the Government
are ensuring that the main public expenditure programmes are flexible
and responsive to growing communities. In my constituency, 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1652</b><br>education presents the opposite problem to securing adequate supply
because we have falling rolls. Schools across my constituency,
particularly primary schools, are having to contemplate school mergers
because not enough children are being born in our communities. Having a
better housing mix, particularly more family homes in some areas, would
help to ensure the continuing viability of our schools. It is not only
a question of there being too few homes, because in some areas it is
the type of home that unsuitable.</p><p><a name="06071459000436">I want to return to health
planning, which the Bill touches on and we discussed in today&#146;s
earlier debate. For me, health planning, as I mentioned in an
intervention earlier today, is not about saving small hospitals. The
key point about hospitals in respect of what communities need as more
houses are built is that they should provide safe and effective
services. A difficult tension is developing. There is a tendency for
hon. Members of all parties to argue for &#147;save the local
hospital&#148; campaigns when we should campaign for safe and
effective services for our constituents. We need hospitals with
appropriate neo-natal and paediatric services. Those are often highly
specialised units and it is not possible for them to be available in
every hospital. We need suitable diagnostics, and every hospital should
have an MRI scanner and the other sorts of scanner that are needed for
care and
treatment.</p><p><a name="06071459000437">All the
discussions that I have held with NHS professionals suggest that we
need hospitals of a sufficient size to provide the right number of
staff with expertise, especially consultants. When I was in local
government, we had a long-running battle to try to hang on to our
district general hospital but, as we discussed the matter with NHS
professionals, we began to realise that there was problem with the
number of consultants that a hospital of that size could sustain. We
discussed whether it was safe, whether there would be a proper career
path and whether we would get the right and best people for our
hospital. Those matters are important, too.</p><p><a name="06071459000438">Not just anybody can diagnose
cancer. It requires expertise, and operations and treatment should be
conducted by those who are experienced and can manage to perform the
required number of operations every year. Health planning must
therefore be linked to more effective community and primary care
services. That is beginning to develop in a&#151;dare I say
it?&#151;healthy way in my
area.</p><p><a name="06071459000439">In the Leigh
area, there is an admirable walk-in centre, which also serves my
constituency. A new primary care centre is about to be built in Walkden
in the centre of my constituency. The new local improvement finance
trust&#151;LIFT&#151;centre will include GP services, a clinic that
offers physiotherapy, rehabilitation, audiology and a children&#146;s
clinic. It is vital to my community for all those service to come
together so that, for example, an older person who has had a stroke
will not have to travel to Hope hospital some distance away, or to
Bolton or Wigan, but can get the rehabilitation treatment and
physiotherapy locally. That also means that family members could
accompany the person more easily.</p><p><a name="06071459000440">Transport, which the Bill
describes as condition 6, has been mentioned in the debate. The measure
would provide for</p><br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1653</b><br><a name="06071459000614"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;sufficient capacity on the
existing road network... to sustain any increase in...
traffic that is likely to be generated by the proposed
development&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000441">That is
peculiar. Most people in local government have been working with the
assumption that we should encourage people to use public transport. In
my area of the north-west, that means the Metrolink tram. A guided
busway from Leigh to Manchester will soon be added to that. The tram
has led to people switching from private to public transport and
lessening road use. As with the tube in London, people find that the
tram is a good mode of public transport.</p><p><a name="06071459000442">Transport is another weak
aspect of the Bill because we should not simply cater for an increasing
amount of traffic. The assumption in planning is to encourage the use
of public transport. To go by the staff who work in my constituency
office, we cannot assume that younger people will drive to work. We
should encourage them to use public transport. The Bill does not cover
that and is therefore
deficient.</p><p><a name="06071459000443">I
understand the competing issues that affect planning and I have several
years&#146; experience of dealing with residents who are concerned
about new housing developments. Such concerns are still expressed to me
as a Member of Parliament, and that happens to many other hon. Members,
too. However, people in all age groups are affected by the problem of
not finding a home suitable for their needs. In my constituency, that
means young people, including couples, families and older people. If
the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) does not believe
the amount of homelessness that exists&#151;some of his comments
implied that he did not&#151;I suggest that he attend the surgery of
one my hon. Friends with a London
constituency.</p><p><a name="06071459000444"><b><a name="06071459000805">Lyn
Brown:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that it might be a good
idea for the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) to visit one of my
constituency surgeries, given that two of the wards in my constituency
have the highest amount of overcrowding in the
country?</p><p><a name="06071459000445"><b><a name="06071459000806">Barbara
Keeley:</b> Yes, I do. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be
interested in that invitation, but he does not seem to be responding to
it at the moment.</p><p><a name="06071459000446">A recent case
in my constituency involved a mother with a 14-year-old daughter who
had always lived in an upstairs flat and had never had a garden to play
in. There are also an awful lot of old or frail people who cannot find
a home suitable for their needs. It will be very difficult to deal with
such people, or with people being treated for cancer or other
conditions, who are living in unsuitable accommodation, if we do not
proceed in a different way to provide the necessary growth in
housing.</p><p><a name="06071459000447">There is a
case for housing growth, and we have to listen to it; otherwise, we
shall condemn children and families to live in overcrowded homes, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South (Mike Gapes) mentioned. We
need to reflect on this issue and to take it seriously, although some
hon. Members do not appear to do so. There are people bringing up a
family over many years&#151;perhaps decades&#151;in a two-bedroom
flat. As the children get older, it becomes more difficult for siblings
of different genders to share a bedroom, so the living space has to be
used as bedrooms. If all the accommodation space is used as bedroom
space, there 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1654</b><br>is no living room in which the children can do their homework and study.
Educational underachievement then becomes a factor of overcrowding, as
well as poor quality of life.</p><p><a name="06071459000448"><b><a name="06071459000807">Lyn
Brown:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that overcrowded
households can also have an impact on the health of the children and
families involved? We often see an almost constant succession of
illnesses in such households, owing to the fact that there is
inadequate space and ventilation for a growing
family.</p><p><a name="06071459000449"><b><a name="06071459000808">Barbara
Keeley:</b> I very much agree with my hon. Friend. This
affects not only children, although we think primarily of children when
we are discussing overcrowding and housing need. After all, why should
a child grow up in an overcrowded home? Anyone who uses Westminster
tube station will have seen, going down the escalator, the large poster
showing this Chamber overcrowded with babies and children. Every time I
see it, I think it is a powerful image. Those of us who are adequately
accommodated should think through what it is like for people trying to
bring up a family in an overcrowded situation. We cannot have
that.</p><p><a name="06071459000450">I am talking
not only about the start of life, although these problems are bad
enough at that time. If we read through to the end of
life&#151;</p><p><a name="06071459000451"><b><a name="06071459000809">Madam
Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I should like to remind the hon.
Lady that the Bill is about an infrastructure audit. I would be greatly
comforted if her remarks could come back to that
subject.</p><p><a name="06071459000452"><b><a name="06071459000810">Barbara
Keeley:</b> I was just about to refer the effect of
overcrowding at the end of someone&#146;s life, in that people cannot
be discharged from hospital to die at home, even if that is their wish,
if their home is overcrowded. Those who propose measures such as those
in the Bill that would reduce or restrain housing development should
take overcrowding into account. It is the biggest driving factor in
these issues, and we cannot have that.</p><p><a name="06071459000453">We must
provide the homes that our communities need, in terms of the mix of
housing that I have mentioned, and of the energy and water efficiency
measures. I welcome the fact that the Government have changed their
planning approach, through planning and policy statement 3, from the
plan, monitor and manage approach to a plan-led approach that will
allocate land for housing and then assess the capacity of existing and
planned social and transport infrastructures.</p><p><a name="06071459000454">The Bill applies to the
construction of more than 150 houses or flats by the same developer on
a single site, or on contiguous sites, within a period of five years. I
do not think that that aspect of the Bill really helps.</p><p><a name="06071459000455">As I said
earlier, I have had experience of a housing hot spot. Developers there
were keen to build expensive apartments in quite small numbers. They
would buy a plot containing one or two large properties, of which there
were many in the town-centre ward that I represented, then build 10 or
15 expensive luxury apartments. They would repeat the process on many
sites. Housing change of that kind caused a number of problems in
itself. When we speak of audits, or of planning that will affect 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1655</b><br>only areas containing at least 150 houses, we ignore the fact that a
community can be significantly affected by small numbers of
units.</p><p><a name="06071459000456">As was
pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South, those who
build small developments consisting of 10 or 15 luxury apartments can
avoid the requirement to provide affordable homes. We found again and
again that it was the small developments that did not provide such
homes. Some of the larger developments of flats or houses&#151;the
few that we had&#151;were more likely to provide them. I think that
local authorities could do more to ensure that some mid-scale housing
developments supplied affordable housing, to the benefit of the
community.</p><p><a name="06071459000457">I believe
that the plan-led approach of PPS3 can ensure that local authorities
provide homes, and that sustainable communities and homes are
developed.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000640">2.6

Younger-Ross (Teignbridge) (LD):</b> I congratulate the right
hon. Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude) on the Bill, and the hon.
Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry), who presented it so ably on his
behalf.</p><p><a name="06071459000459">I understand
the reasoning behind the Bill because of my background in architecture.
I spent most of my life as a junior in an office talking to other
architects, who would sit and puzzle over how we would design, for
instance, a housing estate. The planners would debate with us what
could be on the estate, and about the height and design of the houses,
while failing utterly to provide the infrastructure that the estate
required. I found it puzzling that there was so little joined-up
thinking about how we developed our towns. It must be said, though,
that having seen what planners did in the 1960s as a result of
joined-up thinking, we have knocked a good deal of it down. Perhaps the
lack of any real planning constituted a reaction to some of the
appalling planning decisions of the late 1950s, the 1960s and the
1970s.</p><p><a name="06071459000460">I understand
the problems that we are discussing. When I first set eyes on
Teignbridge in about 1990, the electorate was 74,000. It is now the
fourth largest in the country, at 88,000. We envisage more development
to deal with an increase of 10,000 in the population, and even more at
a later stage. We are suffering from the consequences of the lack of
joined-up thinking. There are pressures from time to time on the health
service&#151;on doctors&#146; practices and on hospitals&#151;to
say nothing of roads and water.</p><p><a name="06071459000461">We have heard a great deal
about housing need today. During a period in which 3,000 council homes
were sold off, the building of only 1,300 social homes has been
allowed. During that time, I have seen the number of families on the
housing register rise from 1,000 to 4,000. The basic figures in
themselves represent an appalling indictment of the total failure of
the Labour Government&#146;s housing policy. The Government&#146;s
inability to provide the homes that are needed has increased the misery
of those living in overcrowded accommodation, and the pressure on that
accommodation must be relieved. That, along with social changes such as
more single families and the fact 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1656</b><br>that few of us are living with our parents, is one of the reasons we
need new homes. Parents on both sides of the family died last year, but
I must confess that when I was a young man the last thing that I wanted
to do was live with the in-laws or the outlaws&#151;I wanted to set
up a home with my wife. Again, that creates extra pressures.</p><p><a name="06071459000462">The other
problem is our growing elderly population. We need to bring in
immigrant workers to maintain the tax base and to ensure that elderly
people can afford to retire in dignity. All those factors are creating
extra pressures. That does not mean, however, that we should not give
careful consideration to housing development and where it is placed.
Increasing audit is an idea that has much to commend it, although I
would not want the Bill as it stands to be passed. It has some merit in
some parts, so I shall not oppose it at this stage. I have grave
reservations, however, about some of the detail and some elements of
the Bill.</p><p><a name="06071459000463">One of those
reservations relates to how this Bill will link up with local
development and the work that local government ought to do&#151;and
that some parts of it are doing&#151;to audit the provision of
services and the needs in an area at the same time. It might not be
this Bill per se that is needed, but a responsibility on local
authorities to have a more wholesale approach. Perhaps we ought to plan
the infrastructure that is needed rather than having the current
piecemeal, ad hoc approach.</p><p><a name="06071459000464"><b><a name="06071459000812">Meg
Munn:</b> The hon. Gentleman will find that the guidance on
the production of regional spatial strategies provides for exactly
that.</p><p><a name="06071459000465"><b><a name="06071459000813">Richard
Younger-Ross:</b> There is some element of that, and I have
looked at some regional spatial strategies. In relation to district
councils and more local problems, I have not seen that approach. I will
be interested to see how the provision works its way through, and
whether it ultimately delivers anything.</p><p><a name="06071459000466">There are some other
difficulties relating to predictions and auditing. The hon. Member for
Wealden referred to auditing in relation to hospitals, and gave some
figures on growth of hospital need. That is a difficult calculation,
because it depends on what basis is used. Were we to take a crude
figure of 400 bed spaces in the local hospital, we could say that a
doubling of the population would necessitate 800 bed spaces in 10
years&#146; time. That does not quite follow, however, because we
must take account of the changes in hospital care. With micro-surgery,
keyhole surgery and other techniques, more people are being kept in
hospital for shorter periods. Therefore, even were the population to
double over a period, the number of bed spaces needed might be only
600, not 800&#151;an increase, but not a doubling.</p><p><a name="06071459000467">I therefore have some
reservations about the crudity with which the Bill operates at some
levels, which might cause some difficulty. That does not mean, however,
that it is not worthy of debating in Committee. One good reason it is
worthy of such debate is that it would show the paucity of some of the
Government&#146;s action in the past.</p><p><a name="06071459000468">The hon.
Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley) mentioned the definition of
&#147;significant&#148;. I hope that I have pronounced her
constituency name correctly, as 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1657</b><br>Members are always mispronouncing my constituency&#146;s
name&#151;it was mispronounced earlier. The Bill refers to 150 houses
as &#147;significant&#148;. My background is in architecture, and
one does not have to be bright to work out that if
&#147;significant&#148; is 150 houses, a developer looking to build
300 houses would build 298. He would build 149 now, which he would get
through without the additional burden. A couple of years later, as he
had land-banked the land&#151;given the size of the development, one
does not build 300 houses in one go anyway&#151;he would put in
another application for a further 149 houses. He would therefore get
round that definition a second time. That difficulty and failure would
need to be addressed, but that does not mean that it is not an
important thing that should be
tackled.</p><p><a name="06071459000469">My
constituency is beautiful&#151;from Widecombe in the Moor, across
lots of Dartmoor, to rural coastal towns. The building of 150 houses in
Widecombe in the Moor would be devastating. Developers would never get
consent from the national park authority anyway, but the principle of
the argument is that far fewer houses would be significant in such
areas in their impact on doctors&#146; surgeries, on roads&#151;the
roads are narrow and Devon banks are very high&#151;and on other
parts of the infrastructure. A far more flexible approach would be
required.</p><p><a name="06071459000470">I come to
the next stage of the problem in how we deal with the planning process.
Part of the difficulty is that many of the services have been
privatised. By their nature, such services will respond only once there
is a market. Therefore, water companies will by and large look at
resolving the problem after demand has been created. In some cases they
do not even do that, which is why Thames Water is getting itself into
hot water, as it were. We have to find a way&#151;special planning
begins the process&#151;to get the infrastructure in place before
construction or at the same time.</p><p><a name="06071459000471">That cuts across&#151;without
digressing too far&#151;much Government thinking in other areas. Very
often, funds from the closure of a care home, for instance, will be
used for another facility, but the care home is closed before the funds
are made available and the other facility is not provided for two
years. Exactly the same applies in planning. We cannot leave a gap of
two years between the creation of the need and the construction of the
road, the extra water supply, hospital or
school.</p><p><a name="06071459000472">The
hon. Member for Wealden criticised the Government&#146;s proposal to
change section 106 agreements. Let us be clear, section 106 agreements
are a form of bribery. A developer comes along and says, &#147;Right,
I want to build 150 houses. What do you want&#151;a new school, a new
link road?&#148; That is how it works. Small parishes might really
want a new school and somebody might come along and say, &#147;I know
that you really don&#146;t want 150 houses; you only want about 50.
But you allow us to build 150 and we&#146;ll build you a new
school.&#148; That is the reality in this country and that is why
getting rid of 106 agreements is an exceedingly good
idea.</p><p><a name="06071459000473">I
have reservations, too. The idea that the funding will go into a pot
and move out of the local authority is deeply worrying. I would like to
be assured that there is some way of getting that money back into the
community to pay for infrastructure. I am somewhere between the two: I
am not convinced of the Government&#146;s proposal, but I know that
the way in which 106 agreements work at the moment is deeply
flawed.</p><br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1658</b><br><p><a name="06071459000474"><b><a name="06071459000814">Mike

Gentleman agree that many local authorities do not use their powers
effectively and that sometimes they agree to housing developments

Younger-Ross:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point;
local authorities often do not take such things into account. A
developer in my constituency said following the process, &#147;Cor!
They were a soft touch. We would have put in twice as much money if
they had asked us.&#148; The system relies on the skilled
negotiations of the planning department in extracting as much money as
possible. Planners are good at spatial design; we do not train them to
be negotiators and to extract money from developers. That is not part
of what they are taught at
college.</p><p><a name="06071459000476">Comments have
been made on the intentions behind the Bill. In neither the opening
remarks of the hon. Member for Wealden nor the speech made by the hon.
Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) did I find one hint of nimbyism.
Perhaps some local authorities would use the Bill for nimbyism, but
existing legislation is used for that purpose. However, to accuse the
hon. Gentlemen of that is to do a disservice to them and to the Bill.
For my part, I think that the Bill has some merit. Sadly, I doubt that
it will get much further, but it has given rise to an interesting
debate and raises serious issues that the Government need to
tackle.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000641">2.20

David Anderson (Blaydon) (Lab):</b> As an MP from the
north-east of England, I wish that we had some of the problems that
have been identified in the south-east&#151;too much work, too many
people wanting to live in the area, too much investment. If we had some
of those problems, I might share some of the views that have been
expressed today.</p><p><a name="06071459000478">I live in a
village that was the epitome of a sustainable community. It was a
mining community that was first developed in the early 1820s, when a
local colliery was sunk. They started building houses in 1832: the
houses were part and parcel of the job of the miners and remained so
for the next 150 years, becoming part of the village scene. Not only
were there houses that working people lived in, but the miners union
developed houses for retired miners who had been thrown out on the
streets when they finished working so that they could remain in the
community. The people developed parks, sanatoriums, welfare systems,
football fields, cricket clubs and brass bands. It was the epitome of a
sustainable economy&#151;sorry, a sustainable community; it was
anything but a sustainable
economy.</p>

<p><a name="06071459000479">Unfortunately,
everything changed when the Thatcher Government, in their wisdom,
decided that it was a good idea to do away with this country&#146;s
indigenous coal industry. As a direct consequence, they destroyed
thousands of homes and hundreds of communities throughout the
country&#151;homes that were valuable to the people who lived in them
but that, unfortunately, had no real value on the property market. They
were in areas where there was no work and people had no interest in
moving there; they continued to be lived in by people who could not
afford 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1659</b><br>to move out because the houses had no market value. Eventually people
did move out, or elderly people moved into homes or, sadly, died in
their home, and the local authorities brought in people that they could
not house elsewhere. That led to a spiral of despair: drugs, burglary,
petty crime and violence sucked the life out of the
communities.</p><p><a name="06071459000480">Now, houses
are being pulled down and we need new ones. We need new houses in a way
that we have not needed them before. We do not need restrictions or any
form of nimbyism to prevent the development that we need. We want
high-quality, environmentally sound houses that our young people can
afford to buy and live in. We do not want obstacles such as the ones
that we faced when we were younger put in the way of positive, quality
developments for the people of the
future.</p><p><a name="06071459000481">We
in the north-east do not have some of the other problems that have been
identified today. We have a plentiful water supply, mainly because we
developed resources such as the Kielder reservoir. It was created to
help the steel industry and the coal industry in the north-east, but in
the 1980s, the Tory Government decided that they did not want to use
British coal to keep the steel industry going; they bought Polish coal
instead. As a result, we have a reservoir with underground links to
three main rivers, but the water is not needed except for public
consumption. We do not have the problem that affects the south-east, so
why should we in the north-east be subjected to the limitations that
the Bill would impose?</p><p><a name="06071459000482">We do need
infrastructure development. We need investment in new roads, we need
our railways infrastructure to be built up and we need more and better
housing. We are seeing quality development in houses and businesses
across the north-east, but we want more. Obstacles are being thrown up
in certain areas, with people saying that they do not want building in
their area because they think that they have enough. That is nimbyism
and it is not helpful. What my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South
(Mike Gapes) said was nimbyism, clearly is. It may be a sophisticated
term and I am not the man to ask about sophistication, but it is clear
that, if the Bill goes through as it stands, we will have a situation
in which a private company can say, &#147;We aren&#146;t satisfied
that we can deliver in the way that you are asking us to.&#148; To
me, that is a built-in veto.</p><p><a name="06071459000483">If private
companies such as Thames Water cannot produce enough water for the
people of the area to use, why should we allow them to dictate the
system and stop development? I have just moved into this area. I have
bought a flat in Wandsworth common. I am told that I need to go
carefully with my water. I am paying for it, so why should I go
carefully with it? Twenty years ago, those people were allowed to take
control of our public water supply&#151;helped by investment from the
Government. We were told that part of the deal&#151;the reason we
were giving control to the private companies&#151;was that those
people would develop the infrastructure, look after us and make sure
that we had water, without any problems. That is not the
case.</p><p><a name="06071459000484">What is Thames
Water doing to improve my water supply? Is it fixing the leaks? Is it
employing mechanics and engineers to dig the roads up and put the leaks
right? It has put adverts in the newspapers and on 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1660</b><br>billboards to say, &#147;This is how much more water we will provide
for the next 10 years.&#148; There are adverts featuring Battersea
power station and other buildings in London. Those adverts say,
&#147;This is how much water we will save.&#148; Instead of talking
about it, Thames Water should get on with it. It has had 20 years to
get on with it and unfortunately it has not succeeded.</p><p><a name="06071459000485">It is clear
that one of the drives behind water privatisation was that promise and
that promise is not being delivered. Why, then, should we allow those
people to say to us, &#147;We aren&#146;t satisfied that we can
deliver. Therefore we will block what has been suggested.&#148; Those
involved in running the sewage system can do the same, as can the
Environment Agency and the people who get rid of our waste. In the area
where I live, there are massive issues about waste disposal. There are
already big planning arguments involving companies such as Sita which
have long-standing contracts in our area to fill up old quarries and
mine shafts. They are having massive planning arguments under present
legislation. Why should we give them another veto so that they can say,
&#147;We are not satisfied, therefore this cannot go
forward.&#148;? That is not right or proper. That may not be the
intention of the Bill, but I am convinced that it is how some people
will use it.</p><p><a name="06071459000486">The
difference between what happens now and what is proposed is that, at
present, any developer has to consult certain bodies. It has to say to
people who provide waste systems, sewerage, water and power,
&#147;Can you deliver for us?&#148; and they can say yea or nay.
What they cannot do, and what the Bill will mean they can do, is say,
&#147;We aren&#146;t satisfied we can do it, therefore you
can&#146;t move forward.&#148; That is what we will end up with.
Lectures from the Conservatives, who sold off social housing and then
refused to build more houses to replace it, do not in any way enamour
me of taking lessons from them on providing sustainable communities and
decent-quality affordable housing for our young people. That is what
this is about.</p><p><a name="06071459000487"><b><a name="06071459000817">Mr.
Soames:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</p><p><a name="06071459000488"><b><a name="06071459000818">Mr.

to me.</p><p><a name="06071459000489">One of the
questions that the hon. Gentleman raised was, how can we save water?
Well, we could say to some of the millionaires in the south-east,
&#147;Why don&#146;t you turn your swimming pool into a
sandpit?&#148; That could go a long way towards saving some of the
water that we need. The clear intention in the Bill is nimbyism. The
intention is to stop things moving forward and to block the development
of quality housing in a particular area. That will have a massive
impact on the rest of the country and that should not be
allowed.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000642">2.28

Mackinlay (Thurrock) (Lab):</b> On a point of order, Madam
Deputy Speaker. Earlier this week, as you may recall, I won the
sympathy of Mr. Speaker when I complained about the tardy approach of
the Home Office to making available documents due for debate in the
House of Commons. I draw your attention to the fact that, in business
questions yesterday, we were told that on Thursday 25 July the main
business would be a motion to approve the Terrorism Act (Proscribed
Organisations) (Amendment) Order 2006.</p><p><a name="06071459000538">I came to the House this
morning to obtain the order and any related documents, so that I could
study them with other people this weekend, because the issue is
important. That document is not available in either the Vote Office or
the Journal Office; indeed, they have not seen the order at all, as it
has not been tabled. That might not be breaking the rules of the
House&#151;I understand that, in theory, it can be done right up to
the eleventh hour&#151;but it is the convention of the House to allow
two weekends between the publication of major legislation to make it
available to hon. Members and its being debated. The order is not a
Bill, but nevertheless it is an important piece of legislation. 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1664</b><br>It is not unreasonable for the House of Commons to expect from the Home
Office at least one weekend in which to study the order. I am
desperately anxious, as this is not a one-off incident. Twice in one
week, the Home Office has shown a blatant disregard for individual hon.
Members&#151;even if it is not fit for purpose, they wish to be fit
for purpose&#151;who wish to provide scrutiny and accountability, and
who wish to study and prepare for
legislation.</p><p><a name="06071459000539">My final word&#151;this is a
serious point&#151;is that although the Whips expect me to support
the order, lemming-like, next week, I have not had an opportunity to
study it or take cognisance of its contents. I personally think that
that is outrageous, and I hope that you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and
perhaps Mr. Speaker, will intimate a similar view&#151;in your way,
of course, which is not quite the same as mine&#151;to the Home
Office. We cannot go on like this, because it makes what we do in the
House a
charade.</p><p><a name="06071459000540"><b><a name="06071459000836">Madam
Deputy Speaker (Sylvia Heal):</b> I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for giving notice of his point of order. I have asked for
inquiries to be made, and I have been informed that the order will be
laid on Monday, although I regret that that means that the hon.
Gentleman will not have the opportunity of reading it this weekend. It
will be in the Vote Office on Monday, and his comments are, of course,
on the
record.</p><p><a name="06071459000541"><b><a name="06071459000837">Michael
Gove (Surrey Heath) (Con):</b> On a point of order, Madam
Deputy Speaker. May I ask your advice as the guardian of the rights of
Back Benchers against the overweening power of the Executive? There
have been two examples today of the Executive exerting their power to
crush the right of Back Benchers to raise the vital issues of the
environment and social justice as they bear on housing and planning
development. First, in the course of debate on the Infrastructure Audit
(Housing Development) Bill, which was introduced by my right hon.
Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude), one speech lasted more than
25 minutes and another more than 45 minutes. Those speeches were made
by hon. Members whose constituencies were not directly affected by the
provisions of the Bill. The Bill had extensive support and backing, and
I exercised forbearance in my own speech to try to ensure that the Bill
would reach Committee. Unfortunately, the
Minister&#151;</p><p><a name="06071459000542"><b><a name="06071459000838">Madam
Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman has made his
point. There was nothing in the course of the debate that was
disorderly. I must therefore ask him to resume his seat, rather than
continue the debate on Second
Reading.</p><p><a name="06071459000543"><b><a name="06071459000839">Greg
Clark (Tunbridge Wells) (Con):</b> On a point of order, Madam
Deputy Speaker. Is it reasonable, when Ministers have intimated their
personal support for my Bill, that the Whip on the Government Front
Bench objected to a Bill that his colleagues have
supported?</p><p><a name="06071459000544"><b><a name="06071459000840">Madam

Stewart Jackson (Peterborough) (Con):</b> Thank you, Madam
Deputy Speaker, for allowing me the opportunity to raise an urgent and
pressing matter on behalf of my
constituents.</p><p><a name="06071459000547">Peterborough
has an excellent record of harmonious community relations, having
evolved from a relatively small cathedral city of about 48,000 citizens
after the second world war with an economy based on engineering, the
railways and agriculture, to a diverse cosmopolitan city of about
160,000 people, according to the 2001 census. Although manufacturing
has declined, service industries such as insurance and finance,
retailing, transportation, warehousing and distribution have expanded
significantly since 1991. Recently, the city has been an urban hub for
agriculture and food
processing.</p><p><a name="06071459000548">The
decency and tolerance of local people are marked by their willingness
to welcome newcomers over the years: refugees from poverty and
oppression, such as the Italian community to work on the Fletton
brickworks after the war, Irish immigrants to work on the railways, and
Pakistanis and especially Kashmiris in the 1960s and early 1970s. The
latter are now third generation Peterborians and they contribute hugely
to the business and civic life of the city of Peterborough.</p><p><a name="06071459000549">Although the Pakistani
community could be said by some to be socially insular, we have rarely
seen the social antagonism, resentment and communal violence witnessed
in other cities and towns in England, such as Oldham, Burnley and
Bradford, between the white working class and Asian youth. Indeed, the
Pakistani community is well led and moderate in its political outlook.
It is proud of its historical heritage, well educated and politically
engaged and values its hard won place as an integral part of the host
community.</p><p><a name="06071459000550">For
instance, Pakistani residents make up 60 per cent. of the population of
the Central ward. Across the whole of the unitary authority area, the
non-white population is over 10 per cent. It is appropriate to add that
the city also contains three wards in the bottom 250 most deprived
wards in England&#151;Central, Dogsthorpe and East wards&#151;and
has a male life expectancy four years lower than that of Cambridge, as
well as higher rates for infant mortality, teenage pregnancy, heart
disease and strokes than the eastern region and England and Wales as a
whole.</p><p><a name="06071459000551">A series of
events began in the 1997 Parliament that has jeopardised
Peterborough&#146;s enviable record as an exemplar of middle England
accepting and embracing change for the common good. In 2000,
Peterborough was designated a dispersal centre by the Home Office and
the National Asylum Support Service. It was decreed without any proper
consultation with the people of Peterborough or their elected
representatives that the city should receive 80 per cent. of all the
asylum seekers and their families dispersed to the eastern region.
Despite efforts by officers of the city council, elected Members and
others, including my predecessor in the House, the actual number of
asylum seekers in Peterborough was never quantified and was 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1666</b><br>the subject of Government obfuscation, with the frequent citing of
commercially sensitive contracts with private sector housing
contractors such as Clearsprings as a pretext to hide the true
picture.</p><p><a name="06071459000552">In December
2004, the official figure for the number of asylum seekers in
Peterborough was 255, which was still more than the figures for Luton,
Norwich and Ipswich. However, sources within Peterborough city council
estimated that the figure was much higher&#151;perhaps as high as
4,000. For no discernible reason other than self-interest, the
unaccountable and unelected members of the East of England regional
assembly colluded with that official deceit, much to their discredit.
Other agencies such as the police and local health bodies preferred to
take the path of least resistance rather than speaking out, either
because of political correctness or because of collective cowardice.
Predictably and contemptibly, any attempt to debate the policy in a
rational and reasoned way was met with the cry of
&#147;Racism&#148; to close down the
debate.</p><p><a name="06071459000553">The issues of
immigration and asylum, as well as crime, quickly reached the top of
the political agenda in the Peterborough constituency, which played a
major part in costing the Labour party the parliamentary seat at last
year&#146;s general election. Many people were affronted by the
high-handed decision by central Government and the lack of
consultation. That said, there was a consensus across the political
spectrum that community cohesion was at risk if the city council and
local taxpayers were not financially assisted to deal with assimilation
and integration and the burden they were placing on council tax payers.
The then Home Office Minister, who is now Secretary of State for
Defence, correctly surmising the gravity of the situation, made this
pledge in the Peterborough<i>  Evening Telegraph</i> on 15 December
2004:</p><a name="06071459000615"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The fact
of the matter is that any charge asylum seekers place on local
authorities, we in Central Government will
meet.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000554">After
prolonged lobbying by the city council and other key stakeholders, such
as the greater Peterborough primary care partnership and Cambridgeshire
constabulary, the Government agreed in November 2004 to fund through
the Treasury&#146;s invest to save budget the establishment of the
new link project, which was set up under the auspices of the city
council&#146;s asylum and migration service in Lincoln road in the
Millfield area of Peterborough. It involved the amalgamation of nine
key projects undertaken by seven voluntary and statutory agencies and
was designed to help the integration of not only asylum seekers, but
refugees and economic migrants. The scheme was awarded &#163;2.2
million over three years to develop key projects in areas such access
to information and training, volunteering, citizenship, English
language courses, mediation, translation services, setting up community
groups and research on new arrivals and
cohesion.</p><p><a name="06071459000555">At the
outset, I was a sceptic about new link, but I am a pragmatist. My view
is that it was necessary to support the work of new link to safeguard
the long-term harmony and stability of my constituency and to prevent
the resentment and alienation felt justifiably by many of my
constituents against Government policy, which, incidentally, resulted
in a 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1667</b><br>candidate standing at the general election as &#147;National
Front&#151;Britons not Refugees&#148; receiving 931 votes at last
year&#146;s
election.</p><p><a name="06071459000556">I was also
impressed by the leadership of the project&#146;s manager, Leonie
McCarthy, and her team at new link and by the experiences of some of
their clients. Leonie has worked hard to make the most of a difficult
situation and has steered clear of political controversy, preferring
practical action to political posturing.</p><p><a name="06071459000557">Some weeks ago, I was
privileged to visit new link and launch the website of the newly
established Peterborough African community association, which is a
confederation of people from 18 African countries. I met its chairman,
Dan Cissikho, an asylum seeker who was originally from Senegal, who is
working hard to integrate new African residents in the city as a
community leader and using his practical skills, which he obtained
while running an IT business in his homeland, in order to help
others.</p><p><a name="06071459000558">The local
police have also praised the work of new link. In particular, they have
pointed out that its ongoing work helps to release scarce police
resources, which are decreasing, to concentrate on other major crime
problems in the city. In the jargon, new link is defined as
&#147;part of the complex Social Cohesion jigsaw&#148; in
Peterborough. Its work was recently recognised in the UK housing awards
2005, where it won an award for excellence in promoting community
cohesion.</p><p><a name="06071459000559">Do I applaud
the Government funding? The answer is yes. Do I think that our work on
community cohesion is finished? No, I do not. As we all know, every
silver lining has a cloud. I intend to tell the House why I think that
two policy decisions taken by this Government, discrete but
interrelated, have the potential to destroy all the good work that new
link has achieved since November 2004, and potentially to plunge
Peterborough into a state of social dislocation and even civil strife,
and to create a breeding ground for the emergence of the plausible
racist bigots in the shape of the British National party.</p><p><a name="06071459000560">Despite significant evidence
that the work undertaken by new link is both valuable and
cost-effective&#151;that was its raison
d&#146;être&#151;and vital to maintaining community
cohesion, the Government intend to end all invest to save funding for
the project from March 2007. The Government envisaged across-the-board
savings of &#163;5 million on its &#163;2.2 million investment.
There is the important work in areas such as community development,
training, learning, information and assistance. If that work is to
continue, most of the burden will thereafter fall on the hard-pressed
city council tax payers. A sum of certainly &#163;1 million will be
necessary to keep the work
going.</p><p><a name="06071459000561">Despite tabling
half a dozen parliamentary written questions to Ministers over the past
12 months, I have yet to receive even the basic rationale for this
short-sighted decision, which effectively will terminate one of the
most successful projects of its sort in the UK. The Government seem to
have closed their mind to any debate on this issue. The Minister for
Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality advised me on 19 June that
there were no plans to discuss invest to 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1668</b><br>save projects with local authorities or other key stakeholders. He added
that there were</p>

current plans to visit any Invest to Save Budget (ISB) projects or to
make a statement.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 19 June 2006;
Vol. 447, c. 1677W.]</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000562">I
assume that the Government are proceeding on the basis of an
essentially false premise, which is that the sticking plaster of 2004
is no longer needed and that the problem of potential community
conflict has gone away. Nothing could be further from the truth. There
are enormous potential problems brewing in Peterborough.</p><p><a name="06071459000563">In the summer of 2004, tensions
between Portuguese youths and the Pakistani community boiled over into
small-scale violence in the Gladstone street area. A further
conflagration was avoided only by the quick deployment of the
Cambridgeshire police. Recently, there have been problems between the
significant Kurdish population in Peterborough, many of whom are asylum
seekers or failed asylum seekers, and other ethnic groups.</p><p><a name="06071459000564">That brings me to the substance
of the debate. The second Government policy that puts the diverse
community in my constituency at risk of major social disorder is a
result of inadequate funding for delivering basic local government
services. There was the decision alone by the UK, unlike any of the
major economies in the EU, not to impose any restriction on migration
to the UK after 1 May 2004 of members of the EU accession
countries&#151;namely, Cyprus, Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Malta, Lithuania, Slovakia and
Slovenia.</p><p><a name="06071459000565">The Prime
Minister predicted that only 13,000 such workers would travel to the UK
and that the bulk of them would return after a short stay. That was a
massive underestimate. Even the Government now admit that more than
400,000 eastern European workers have come to the UK since May 2004.
That is 15 times the official prediction.</p><p><a name="06071459000566">Those figures are based on
information provided by the workers&#146; registration scheme, a
scheme that the respected Centre for Research on Nationalism, Ethnicity
and Multiculturalism at the university of Surrey found likely to
account for 36 per cent. fewer than the true number of migrants, giving
a more indicative figure of 600,000 eastern Europeans having migrated
to the UK in the past two years.</p><p><a name="06071459000567">There is substantial evidence,
too, that large numbers of migrants bypass the need to register with
the workers registration scheme, due to its cost and bureaucracy. The
problem with such an unprecedented and arguably unsustainably high
level of immigration is that it affects relatively few areas, which are
usually urban and outside London. As it stands, the workers
registration scheme is largely irrelevant in terms of immigration and
border
control.</p><p><a name="06071459000569">Currently,
no checks are made on the health of migrants, their language skills and
other skills, or whether they have criminal records. Indeed, the UK
decided not to participate in a European Union scheme, begun in May, to
share criminal records data across a number of EU countries. In
addition, how can we ensure that we recruit highly skilled workers who
will make a vital contribution to the UK economy? The answer to that
is: we cannot.</p><br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1669</b><br><p><a name="06071459000570">It would take another
Adjournment debate to analyse fully the folly of this
Government&#146;s immigration and asylum policy. However, I want to
focus on the impact on Slough&#151;as well as on Peterborough, of
course. I mention Slough because it is experiencing precisely the same
problems as we are in Peterborough, but its situation is better
documented, in no small measure as a result of the brave and principled
stance of the borough&#146;s chief executive, Cheryl Coppell. That
information gets to the heart of the ways in which unrestricted
immigration can have a huge impact on a small geographical area, and on
its social mix and economy&#151;especially on the funding available
for its local services, heavily dependant as they are on central
Government support.</p><p><a name="06071459000571">Reasonably, Slough is
challenging official statistics showing that it had a net loss of 3,000
people in the 12 months before 2003-04. Indeed, 9,000 new
national insurance numbers have been issued there in the last year. It
maintains, as do I, that the methodology for measuring population is
outdated and inaccurate. Anecdotally&#151;of necessity&#151;Slough
borough council officials maintain that there are 10,000 new Polish
residents in the borough, taking advantage of the economic activities
in the Thames valley and the supply of cheaper housing in the
town.</p><p><a name="06071459000572">Peterborough is
in a very similar position, especially as it is a regional hub for
agriculture, horticulture and food processing and packaging. According
to some estimates at the East of England regional assembly, the number
of post-May 2004 migrants from eastern Europe is 16,000&#151;that is
in a city of 160,000 people. Yet official statistics state that the
number of migrants in Peterborough had fallen by 150 in the 12 months
to mid-2004. That would be a moot point, were our funding not so
inextricably tied to population statistics, and in particular to the
Office for National Statistics population estimates and
projections.</p><p><a name="06071459000573">How can
the Government contradict that anecdotal figure? They cannot, as they
simply have no idea of the extent of migration to, and within, the UK.
The independent Statistics Commission has recently written to
Ministers&#151;including the Minister for Policing, Security and
Community Safety and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs&#151;to express its concern at the inaccuracy of
population statistics. However, the Department for Communities and
Local Government has refused to act on the
matter.</p><p><a name="06071459000574">A letter from
Karen Dunnell, the national statistician, which was placed in the House
of Commons Library in May 2006,
stated:</p><a name="06071459000617"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There
is now a broad recognition that available estimates of migrant numbers
are inadequate for managing economy, policies and
services&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000575">Glen Watson,
director of social reporting and analysis at the ONS, has conceded that
at present data on migrant statistics is &#147;limited&#148;.
Although the ONS has set up a task force on migration statistics, it is
unlikely to report for a number of months, and it certainly will not be
ready to report in time for the local government financial settlement
for 2007-08, to be fixed later this year. Regrettably, without
help from central Government, local authorities such as Slough and
Peterborough are forced to commission their own research to support
their contention that they require 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1670</b><br>extra help as a result of a Government policy over which they have no
control, and which costs them scarce and irrecoverable public
funds.</p><p><a name="06071459000576">What are the
problems in practical terms? The Home Office community cohesion panel,
which was set up in the wake of disturbances in northern cities in
2001, reported in July 2004. In its document entitled &#147;The End
of Parallel Lives&#148;, it stated, inter alia,
that</p><a name="06071459000618"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;inward migration
does create tensions and these do not necessarily revolve around race.
It is easier for affluent communities to be tolerant towards newcomers
as they do not perceive them to be a threat...by contrast, many
disadvantaged communities are in competition for scarce resources and
public services, such as housing and social services. These fears
cannot be
disregarded.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000577">Furthermore,
it stated:</p><a name="06071459000619"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there
are...concerns about the speed at which newcomers can be
accommodated. Housing, education, health and other services all take
time to expand...The identity of the host community will be
challenged and they need sufficient time to come to terms with and
accommodate incoming groups, regardless of their ethnic
origin&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071459000578">Those
words could have been written about the Millfield and New England areas
of Peterborough, which were hitherto settled and peaceful, if not
affluent, but are now at the centre of mass migration. Those areas are
not alone in their progressive degradation. They are becoming run down
and ghettoised. They are scruffy and more threatening, especially to
older people. They have a massively increased number of houses in
multiple occupation, with many properties housing eight, 10 or even
more eastern European workers. Such people are on the minimum wage and
prey to unscrupulous landlords and gangmasters. They are picking
vegetables on the fens from 5 am so that they can send money back to
their families in eastern Europe. Is that what we want for them, or for
the economy of a great city&#151;or indeed the UK? The streets are
littered. Rubbish is dumped in back alleys, neighbour disputes are rife
and established shops are
closing.</p><p><a name="06071459000579">The demand on
public services grows each week. There are children at schools such as
Dogsthorpe junior school and Beeches primary school who speak no
English, but cannot be turned away. There are demands on housing in a
city in which there are 6,000 people on the housing waiting list. There
are demands on the police to keep disparate communities from conducting
turf wars, which prevents them from tackling more routine crime. The
police also face the growth of crimes such as drug dealing, casual
violence, sex crimes and people trafficking. Resentment, anger and
hostility is rising all the time in the host
communities&#151;white-British, Afro-Caribbean and Pakistani
alike.</p><p><a name="06071459000580">I know that the

determination and alacrity of Slough borough council, but that is not
the case. Unfortunately, the city council neglected to take part in the
December 2005 consultation on the sub-regional population projections
for England. It is only now preparing to commission its own research,
but it is keen to collaborate with authorities in similar situations.
With the exception of Councillors Charles Swift and Keith Sharp, who
represent the city&#146;s North ward, few local councillors have
spoken out. Despite having strong leadership at elected member and
officer level, a combination of ignorance and inertia has led the city
council to make the belated and palpably underestimated guess that only
700 more international migrants now reside in Peterborough than were
projected last year, but, of course, it does not really
know.</p><p><a name="06071459000585">I will conclude
now to allow the Minister to make her comments, although there is more
to say. We need the new link project to continue its work. It is needed
now more than ever before, so to disband it or dissipate its work would
be an act of community vandalism. I hope that Ministers will realise
the consequences of their decision on EU migrants prior to May 2004,
and the impact that that is having on a small number of localities in
respect of the funding of local services and the social dislocation
that it is causing. They should do something about the problem.
Ministers can help to stave off the pernicious attractions and
opportunism of the racist right, with its easy solutions and vicious
bigotry, or they can sit back and risk another Oldham or Burnley. I
hope and trust that the Government, in the interests of my constituents
and the whole community, will make the right
choice.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071459000645">3.3
pm</h5><p><a name="06071459000586"><b><a name="06071459000842">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Meg Munn):</b> I congratulate the hon.
Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) on the securing the
debate. However, I must say that the purpose of an Adjournment debate
is to get a response from a member of the Government on a specific
issue&#151;and unfortunately I will not be able to respond to him as
fully as I had hoped, because he has left me very little
time.</p><p><a name="06071459000587">A cohesive
community is one in which there is a common vision and sense of
belonging for everyone, and in which the diversity of people&#146;s
different backgrounds and circumstances is appreciated and positively
valued. In such a community those from different backgrounds have
similar life opportunities, and strong and positive relationships
develop between people from different backgrounds in the work place, in
schools and within neighbourhoods.</p><br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1672</b><br><p><a name="06071459000588">The Government&#146;s strategy
to increase race equality and community cohesion, &#147;Improving
Opportunity, Strengthening Society&#148;, is designed to help ensure
that people are not discriminated against because of their race or
religion and that all can make a contribution to our society. It
includes specific goals to reduce perceptions of discrimination in a
wide range of public services, reduce employment inequalities and
monitor the progress of minority ethnic communities across major public
services from education to
housing.</p><p><a name="06071459000589">Community
cohesion can be linked to race issues, but not exclusively. Barriers to
community cohesion are formed through different cultures, lifestyles
and beliefs. The Government know that community cohesion should be at
the heart of regeneration policies locally. They believe that strong
and positive relationships between people from different backgrounds
are built within neighbourhoods and communities through bottom-up
approaches, which devolve power from central to local government, and
from local government to its citizens and communities. The
Government&#146;s &#147;Together We Can&#148; action plan is
another way in which we hope that the relationship between citizens and
public bodies can be transformed.
</p><p><a name="06071459000590">Moving on
specifically to issues in Peterborough and Cambridgeshire, if we look
at Government policy in the round, the amount of funding targeted at
community cohesion and regeneration is considerable. The neighbourhood
renewal fund, for example, was worth more than &#163;1.875 billion
between 2001 and 2006, with a further &#163;525 million to 2008.
Other funding has been made available, but the hon. Gentleman has not
left me sufficient time to go into all that.</p><p><a name="06071459000591">Peterborough is one of 100
areas in receipt of the neighbourhood element funding allocated to
areas that include the 3 per cent. most disadvantaged communities
nationally, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. The funding is worth
&#163;1.6 million to the Greater Dogsthorpe area of Peterborough over
the next four
years.</p><p><a name="06071459000592">The
Government&#146;s community cohesion pathfinder programme was
designed to place the pursuit of mutual understanding and the creation
of common ground between communities at the heart of community
development. It involved 14 local
partnerships,</p><p><a name="06071459000593">including
Peterborough, and between April 2003 and September 2004, each local
area was awarded &#163;285,000 to pioneer approaches to cohesion. An
&#163;18 million connecting communities plus grants programme forms
part of our strategy and it provides funding for activities that
encourage race equality and community cohesion. That funding follows on
from two rounds of the Home Office&#146;s race equality grant scheme,
which ran between 2000 and 2006 and included funding of &#163;104,000
to Peterborough race equality council to develop a &#147;Positive
Images&#148; project. Furthermore, &#163;7.5 million in
funding was awarded this financial year to 578 faith-based groups. The
hon. Gentleman really must concede that the Government have given
considerable resources to organisations in and around Peterborough to
promote work that will benefit community cohesion.</p><p><a name="06071459000594">Let me deal specifically with
the invest to save budgets and the new link project. There have been
eight rounds of invest to save budgets, which is a joint
Treasury/Cabinet Office initiative with the aim of 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1673</b><br>creating sustainable improvements in the capacity to deliver public
services in a more joined-up manner. Details of round 9 of the invest
to save budget will be announced shortly, but it is expected to focus
on the voluntary and community sector&#146;s role in building fairer
communities and the delivery of public services.</p><p><a name="06071459000595">Peterborough&#146;s invest to
save bid under round 8, which is worth &#163;1.5 million of the total
project cost of &#163;2.2 million, includes the development of a new
link, new arrivals partnership. New link provides an integrated network
of service providers, statutory agencies and support workers to ensure
the successful integration of new arrivals in the city. It is already
perceived as a success. The innovative work undertaken here has won
awards nationally. We are currently supporting the project management
team in establishing its strategy for long-term sustainability of the
services provided in the public, voluntary and community
sectors.</p><p><a name="06071459000596">The purpose
of invest to save is in its title. It is not meant to be an ongoing
funding stream. Too often, public sector organisations cannot adjust
their services to meet changing demand, such as that that the hon.
Gentleman outlined in Peterborough, because all their resources are
tied up in meeting ongoing demand. The schemes are put together to
enable organisations to 
<br><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2006 : Column 1674</b><br>invest funds in changing their services with a clear plan to save on
budgets in the future.</p><p><a name="06071459000597">The
Government&#146;s commitment to assist Peterborough to tackle
community cohesion also includes financial support to establish a post
of community cohesion manager, based with the Greater Peterborough
partnership, and the first permanent post holder in that role took up
post in May.</p><p><a name="06071459000598">We will
work with the Government office for the east of England to identify
additional cohesion projects in the regions, including in
Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, for support from the Department for
Communities and Local Government this financial year.</p><p><a name="06071459000599">I had a great deal more to say.
The East of England Development Agency recognises that,
despite contributing more than &#163;360 million to the economy of
the east of England, migrant workers continue to face barriers that
prevent them from making full use of their
skills&#151;</p><p><a name="06071459000600"><i> The
