 I thank my right hon. Friend for that reply. I genuinely wish the FA every success in its bid for the World cup, because it could be the only route to qualification that the team get, and it makes it easy for us Scots to come down and compete. Will the Secretary of State confirm that he will encourage the games authorities to do more to establish a lifetime legacy for a World cup bid to ensure that grass-roots football is delivered to people, particularly those in poorer countries such as Africa and, indeed, throughout the rest of the world?</p>

 What provocation! I am barely out of the traps at DCMS questions and my hon. Friend goads me in that way. I hope that we will both see the 2018 World cup in England. I very much agree with him that we should learn from the failed bid of 2006 about how to go about bidding. At that time there was a sense of &#147;Football&#146;s coming home. It is our turn; give it to us&#148;, but this time we must bid differently and more cleverly and recognise that English football has a reach in Africa and Asia that other national leagues do not. Because of that, there is so much that English football can take to the world to the benefit of football. That should be the spirit of the bid; I am grateful for my hon.

 I warmly support the bid. Does the Secretary of State agree that in this very deep world recession the strongest case that we have to put at the next meeting with FIFA representatives is that we already have the infrastructure and ability to take on the games? In the present financial circumstances, FIFA would be ill advised to take a chance on a country that does not have the facilities already available.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman makes a solid point, and I very much agree with him. FIFA is taking the World cup to South Africa and then to south America; I think it would be in everyone&#146;s interest to have a World cup in 2018 that can do so much to reach out around the world. He is right that, because of our football grounds infrastructure, unlike others we can spend time working with other countries through our status as host nation. That is one of the compelling aspects of our bid. It feels to me that this is the right time for the country to get the FIFA World cup&#151;not because we deserve it or because it is our turn, but because we can do so much more to enhance football around the world.</p>

 My hon. Friend will know that we recently appointed David Davies, the former Football Association executive, to consider the protected list. It is 10 years since we last reviewed it, and the time is right to look again at what shape the list should have in a world when we will all be watching digital multi-channel TV. That review is ongoing and I am sure that all interested parties will feed into it. My hon. Friend should also know that the issues are being tested at the European level. The UK has offered support to Belgium, which is currently facing a test on its own list. We strongly believe in the importance of a protected list to ensure that all people can watch for free events that are of national significance, which can help them to be inspired by sport. That will remain our case.</p>

 I am sure that the Secretary of State saw the remarks of FIFA president, Sepp Blatter, over the weekend. He supported the view of the Scottish Football Association, the tartan army, and the overwhelming majority of Scotland fans that a &#147;team GB&#148; would threaten the independence of the Scottish football team. Given that it has all been about FIFA assurances, will the Secretary of State now drop those plans and instead support our proposal to have all the home nations participating in the 2012 Olympics, just as they did in London in 1908?</p>

 I profoundly disagree with the hon. Gentleman. Late last year, the FIFA executive passed a resolution specifically saying that the independent status of the four Football Associations would not be affected by the fielding of a British team at the London 2012 Olympics. Might I say that FIFA takes issue with some of the reporting published at the weekend and has today resolutely confirmed its position, which it minuted  <br>

in December. I understand that, individually, the home Football Associations may not want to be part of the machinery that creates a team in 2012, and I understand that it is their right to take that decision, but I say to the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues that the British Olympic Association wants to put forward a British football team, and it should be the strongest team that we could possibly field. No sanctions should be applied against any young person who wants to accept the call-up to that team and represent their country in their home-soil Olympics. To deny young people that opportunity would, I think, be a crying shame.</p>

 This is a new question. Given the good will towards the bid from both sides of the House, does the Secretary of State think it appropriate that nearly half the members of the bid board are from the Labour party?

 I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and I hope that he is not trying to make a party political issue out of the bid, because the strength of our Olympic bid was its cross-party nature. Might I point it out to him that there are figures linked to the bid who represent both political parties? The recent announcement that Lord Coe accepted an invitation to join the board is welcome. Party politics really should not play a part; this should be a bid that represents all opinion, all football supporters and, indeed, all people who love sport in this country. I am confident that the balance on the board properly reflects the interest in sport throughout the country.</p>

 I certainly share my hon. Friend&#146;s concern about, as she puts it, the erosion of the work force at a local level. I do not think that there is a constituency represented in the House that has not seen some pressure on its local newspapers as a result, obviously, of the cyclical pressures in the economy and, perhaps more importantly, the structural change in the media industry. Lots of advertising spend is migrating away from press towards other advertising. Those are the real issues that we have to address. I gave her a commitment that I would meet the National Union of Journalists parliamentary group to discuss that, and I believe that we now have a date set for that meeting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o0"><a name="90302-0001.htm_para0"><a name="0903027000048">I believe that those issues are of the most profound importance, because they affect the health of democracy at a local level. We need to come forward with proposals to ensure that there are high-quality training and media at a local level across all media. As part of the &#147;Digital Britain&#148; process, we have an ability to place focus on that issue to raise it up the agenda, because to be frank it does not often get a good airing in this place.

 Does the Secretary of State accept that in many communities the local newspaper is as important as the local post office, the local shop or the local pub? Given the number of closures, which he has already referred to, and the fact that journalists are being laid off, offices are being centralised and newspapers are becoming more distant from their local communities, there needs to be urgent action, in particular to relax the competition rules so that markets are judged more broadly in terms of media consumption, and also to encourage local newspapers to take part in consortiums for the provision of regional news, while at the same time perhaps addressing the problem in the broadcast market for news.</p>

partnership between the BBC and a commercial operator in the provision of regional news on television, for instance. Obviously the BBC may have a broader role in helping to sustain local newspapers by providing access to information and, possibly, pictures and footage. There are all kinds of possibilities. As I have said, we need to approach the matter with an open mind, recognising that things will probably need to change if we are to provide an infrastructure to support local media in the long term.

Does my right hon. Friend accept the importance of the grant regime and will he look at it to see whether there are ways in which we can expand it and make slightly different use of it?</p>

 I certainly endorse the importance of those points. The money that DCMS has made available has helped to develop community radio, although I acknowledge that the more community radio stations there are, the more thinly the money has to be spread, so I take on board the general point that my hon. Friend makes. We can look at the issue again, but in the long term community radio also needs the unlocking of sources of funding at local level. I promise my hon. Friend that I will look at both those things together. Having been involved at the very beginning, when the first White Paper came along suggesting community radio as a good development, I am very committed to it and I want to work with the community radio sector to develop services around the country.</p>

 The Secretary of State is right in saying that community radio is a fledgling industry, but is he aware that the services provided by those stations are incredibly important and popular? As it is a new industry, will he remove the dead hand of government from the regulatory consultation he is going through and let those stations flourish and deliver to local people the kind of local service they are beginning to miss?</p>

 A moment ago, I was being asked for more of the dead hand of government to help the stations along their way, so the hon. Gentleman needs to acknowledge&#151;as I think he did&#151;that the sector is at a very early stage of development and we have to get the process right and think it through at every stage. The other point is that there is pressure on the commercial media industry at local level, as we were just discussing, so in relaxing any rules that affect community radio we have to be aware of the knock-on effect that that might have on commercial radio or even local newspapers if everybody is competing for a smaller ad spend locally, but I hear the point that the hon. Gentleman makes. I have visited lots of community radio stations and they do a skilful job locally, but we need to take things forward carefully.</p>

 The Licensing Act has resulted in a considerable reduction in red tape. Administrative savings are estimated at &#163;99 million per annum, with benefits not just for business but for the third sector and non-profit-making clubs. Although we do not have specific data on the impact on small businesses, they represent the majority of applicants and will thus be major beneficiaries of these savings.</p>

We have made sure that the enterprise finance guarantee scheme, whereby 75 per cent. of the loan is met by the Government, will be applied to tied houses so that such pubs can benefit from real help from the Government and banks.

 The hon. Gentleman mentions the Licensing Act. Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether your drinking habits have changed over the past 10 years, but that is certainly the case for a growing minority of younger Britons. A decade ago, the Government promised a renaissance in the approach to licensing and responsible drinking: town centres would be tamed, binge drinkers would be brought to heel, and councils would be empowered to create the so-called new caf&#233; culture of Britain. The reality could not be further from that. Does the Minister agree with the Opposition and with recent reports which show that since 1997 teenage lawlessness has increased by 300 per cent., one in three girls now admits to binge drinking and there is a 30 per cent. increase in alcohol-related obesity? All this proves that, under this Government, binge drinking is slowly becoming the norm. Labour is giving Britain a beer belly and a worrying taste for alcohol-fuelled antisocial behaviour.</p>

 It would help if the hon. Gentleman did his research, as we all know that Mr. Speaker is, in fact, a teetotaller. I certainly do not recognise the picture the hon. Gentleman paints. The Licensing Act gives people the opportunity to have a drink at the time they choose, with local government and the police being able to make sure that is properly monitored. Also, most of the licensee trade supported the principles of the Act.</p>

 I absolutely do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s pessimistic view. As he will know, the Inspire mark can be earned by organisations that have demonstrably achieved in relation to Olympic goals; he might like to encourage the sports clubs in his constituency to do that. He could also take the time and trouble to talk to the governing bodies across the board about the generally impressive efforts that they are making, not just to see their sportsmen and women compete and succeed at the highest level, but to get more and more people participating in sport&#151;rowing, cycling, sailing, athletics; I could go on.

 Essex is one of the counties that has been making representations about the cost of policing venues external to London.

 We are making very good progress on the implementation of plans for the legacy of the London 2012 games. We recently provided Parliament with an update on the progress and future plans in the annual report on the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games. That was published on 5 February. The nature of the priorities for the Olympic legacy will vary across the regions of the UK, and it is important that those regional preferences are properly reflected.

We must then seek to address the other barriers to girls&#146; participation, whether they are to do with gender, ethnicity or religion. We must then ensure, at the very top of sport, that women have equal chances with men&#151;and, in some cases, men have equal chances with women&#151;to take part in Olympic events.

 In line with the indication I gave in Committee, we have considered raising the recordable and reportable thresholds in view of the concerns expressed by parties about the burden of compliance with the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. As the House knows, the 2000 Act was a landmark piece of legislation that brought, for the first time, transparency to the sources of political funding. It has been a huge step forward for democracy and I am sure that all in the House agree that we are all the better for it, and that our democracy works better as a result.</p>

We had a lot of discussion on this matter in Committee, and there is a balance to be struck. We have to act in a way that is transparent and accountable to the public whom we serve, but we must never forget that political activity in this country is largely carried out by volunteers&#151;selfless people who give their time and effort to political parties across the House. Without them, none of us could function effectively in representing our constituents.</p>

This Government are fundamentally committed to transparency. It is worth noting that the Bill before us makes important provisions to increase transparency.

 It was a judgment. From memory, if we had increased the thresholds in line with inflation, the figure would have been about &#163;250, give or take; I hope that I will not be held to a precise figure. The increase is not quite as great in percentage terms, but we had to take account of anecdotal experience and make a judgment. This was a judgment, and it is entirely a matter for the House if it wants to reject the threshold that we are proposing. We are doing our best, and we are making a judgment about where to strike the balance. It is in the nature of the task of striking a balance, as I am sure the right hon.

 We are talking about recordable thresholds at the moment, not reportable thresholds, so the hon. Gentleman&#146;s last point does not quite stand up. However, I do not disagree with him about the fundamental principle: of course the public have a right to know who is giving money to whom. That is the fundamental principle of transparency, and of course we agree with it. However, sometimes in life&#151;political life and all other areas of life&#151;fundamentally important principles can conflict with each other. It is important to have a vibrant democracy. That is a fundamental principle, and it is sustained by the efforts of volunteers, who are also fundamental to the health and vibrancy of our democracy.

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="90302-0005.htm_para7"><a name="0903027000230">Of course the hon. Gentleman is right to say that we have to set these thresholds at a level at which the public can be confident that no one is buying influence. Most Members would be utterly appalled to think that anyone believed that their voice in the House could be influenced or bought by a donation, however large or small. We would be utterly appalled by that prospect, but that is not the only issue. I paraphrase the hon. Gentleman here&#151;I am sure that he will intervene on me if I am doing so incorrectly&#151;but I think that he is saying not only that that must not happen, but that the public must be confident that that is not happening. In that, I am entirely at one with him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="90302-0005.htm_para8"><a name="0903027000231">The question is: at what level do we strike the balance? No one would think that it was worth placing a huge burden of compliance on those volunteers for the sake of the odd fiver here or there. However, I am sure that everyone would agree that &#163;1,000 was worth recording, let alone &#163;10,000, &#163;50,000 or &#163;100,000. There is no argument about that. The question arises about the relatively small sums of money, and, as I have said, that is a matter of judgment. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s judgment on the matter might be different from ours, and that is a matter for him. It is implicit in what he is saying that there is a balance to be struck. The question is not one of whether there is a balance to be struck, but one of how and where to strike it. That is what we are discussing.</p>

If we on the Government side have got this particular threshold wrong, we will happily revisit it. There is nothing at stake here other than the desire to strike the right balance. If we have inadvertently struck it in the wrong place, I gladly pledge that we will come back to the House and change it&#151;in whatever direction: whether we are imposing excessive burdens on volunteers that are not justified by the increased transparency, or conversely, if we set the threshold too high. I hope that Opposition Members will agree with that approach. If they feel that this is the right level, experience shows that they will support it in future and not seek to change it.</p>

I think that this is a matter of public record and of common sense; every Member knows about it from their own experience. We must be very careful.

Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) if I explained more about the difference between the recordable and the reportable threshold, so let me say a few words about that. The recordable threshold requires recipients to verify the permissibility of the donor and to keep details about it, but the information is not reported to the Electoral Commission unless, in aggregate, donations from the same donor exceed the reportable threshold in a calendar year. We believe that the burden for parties and others of keeping records of really quite small donations&#151;those of &#163;500 or less&#151;exceeds the benefits of verifying their source.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="90302-0005.htm_para11"><a name="0903027000236">We also propose to increase the thresholds for reporting donations, loans or other regulated transactions to the Electoral Commission from the existing level of more than &#163;1,000 to more than &#163;1,500 and from the existing limit of more than &#163;5,000 to those with a value of more than &#163;7,500. We believe again that increases of that order are proportionate and that they strike the right balance between the transparency that everyone agrees is so necessary and the burden of compliance. A certain increase would have been merited by inflation, but we decided that to increase the thresholds by more than inflation alone was merited for precisely the reasons that I have set out in respect of recording donations, loans and other transactions.</p>

In our view&#151;it is our view&#151;this is the key area of public interest, and the moderate increases in reportable thresholds should be considered in that context. I know that hon. Members have referred to percentage increases, but I think that this is one of the occasions where percentages can be misleading&#151;more misleading than the numerical figures themselves. I hope the House will focus on the number of pounds involved rather than on the percentage increases. As I say, they may be misleading about the overall impact of these changes.</p>

We have therefore tabled amendments to increase that threshold to &#163;1,500, in line with new clause 19, which would increase the threshold above which party accounting units and regulated donees, except members&#146; associations, must report donations to &#163;1,500.</p>

We may find ourselves again in the position that we are intoday, when the thresholds have not been examined for a long time. Some Members have drawn attention to the percentage increase, but in numerical terms the sums are relatively modest, and, as I have said, we think that the right balance has been struck.</p>

 I believe that indexation as proposed in the Opposition amendments would complicate the Bill and lead to a lack of clarity. It would also add very small, insignificant sums that would not substantially change the position on party funding or the complex process that donors must undergo. In fact, it would change things very little and would only introduce massive complexity. Tiny percentages would be added, creating a rather strange figure for the Electoral Commission to monitor, at a time when we are increasing these sums by massive percentages&#151;150 per cent., or 50 per cent.&#151;which would wipe out the impact of any indexation over a very long period.

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="90302-0006.htm_para2"><a name="0903027000249">Of course the hon. Gentleman is right about complexity. We should always try to avoid it, for precisely the reasons that he mentioned. We want to make the compliance burden as light as possible, although there has to be a compliance burden: let there be no doubt about that. Compliance is essential, transparency is essential and accountability is essential, for all the reasons that I have already given. Complexity can militate against those elements&#151;I will concede that point to the hon. Gentleman&#151;but, as always, it is a matter of striking a balance. I think it important for us to accept and entrench the principle of a threshold&#151;that is implicit in all previous legislation, and it is implicit here&#151;along with the principle that, although where we strike the balance is a matter of judgment, wherever we strike it there is a threshold below which donations should not be recorded.</p>

That means that we will not have to return to the threshold, because we will not see it being eroded over time by inflation. Of course, under this Government we have had record low levels of inflation thanks to the prudent management of my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the current Chancellor of the Exchequer, and as a result of that historic achievement we face a global recession much better equipped than we would have been otherwise. Nevertheless, we cannot legislate for future Governments, and we do not know how successfully they will handle whatever inflationary challenges may emerge in future.

 Those are important points, but if I may I shall conclude the point I was making about the value of the Opposition amendment. I look forward to hearing what Opposition Members have to say and I have no doubt they will correct me if they think I have misunderstood the purpose of their proposal.

Every time we come back to the House for these sorts of discussions, we hear contributions such as those from the hon. Members for Castle Point and for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart). They are quite properly scrutinising what the Government propose and our approach to Opposition amendments. That is what they should be doing. They scrutinise us vigorously and I am grateful for it, because it will enable the Bill to be more muscular and to achieve its effect. I have no doubt whatever about that. However, in doing so they call into question public trust not just in the Government, the Opposition or any of the minority parties, but in the whole political process. That is not necessarily helpful. We need to be scrutinised and we must be accountable, but constantly having to revisit subjects such as these feeds a pervasive cynicism in the political process, which is not always justified.

understanding of the point behind the proposal&#151;that we entrench the principle of a threshold. Once the House has collectively agreed what it should be, it will be entrenched and can be uprated in line with an appropriate measure of inflation.</p>

Member for Rochford and Southend, East was alluding to the fact that we could use a variety of indexes&#151;with or without housing costs or earnings.

Does he agree that there is some merit in setting out in the Bill the approach that is to be taken? We are considering transparency, and are seeking not to give the impression that things are being hidden away or swept under the carpet.

Perhaps the best way to emphasise transparency is to express the information as clearly as we can in the Bill.</p>

I do not want to give the Conservative party any loophole through which it can jump; nor do the public and nor do those in the media, who are watching us carefully in the House.</p>

 The hon.

The commission is already compelled to act reasonably when it considers civil sanctions. If it fails to do so, that is grounds for appeal against any decision to impose a sanction. So what I suspect is the desired effect of amendment 121 is already achieved in the Bill by other means. In fact, although I accept that that amendment is well intentioned, it would be distinctly unhelpful in that&#151;I think that this is the point that has been made&#151;it would make the commission&#146;s opinion central to the offence. Accordingly, in a case where the police and the Crown Prosecute Service decided that an offence was so serious that it warranted criminal prosecution, rather than civil proceedings instituted by the commission, a court would still be required to consider what the commission thought to decide whether an offence had been committed. Surely, that cannot be the intention, and I certainly do not think that it would be right.</p>

I think that we all agree that the commission must act proportionately. It has repeatedly said that the new range of civil sanctions that we propose will help it to achieve that, but the phrase &#147;innocent mistake&#148; carries no legal weight. Indeed, it is quite vague and confusing. I do not believe that it is helpful. In any event, given the nature of the conduct required for the offence, which I have already described, that or similar wording would not add much to ensuring that inadvertent errors were not unfairly penalised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="90302-0007.htm_para1"><a name="0903027000288">Amendment 122 would insert a requirement for an individual to make a declaration about their reasonable belief, rather than requiring them to act to the best of their knowledge and belief, as the Bill is currently drafted. To adopt that wording would substantially weaken the requirement and make it inconsistent with other declaration requirements contained throughout the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act. I think it is right that we ask the best of people, rather than something less, given that they will be penalised for a failure only if they act intentionally or recklessly in making the relevant declaration. As I have said, the requirement for an act to be carried out knowingly or recklessly will not, in my view, catch a person who makes a statement in good faith. That strikes the right balance between rigour and fairness in this context, and I do not think we should disturb that balance.</p>

We recognise the concern that a number of Members expressed on Second Reading and in Committee about a perceived lack of transparency with regard to unincorporated associations.

<p><a name="st_o159"><a name="0903027000291"><a name="90302-0007.htm_spnew2"><a name="0903027000594"><b>Mr. Jonathan Djanogly (Huntingdon) (Con):</b>
 As the Bill stands, clause 8 creates a new requirement for a donor to make a declaration in respect of donations for a sum exceeding the specified threshold. The intention behind the clause, and the related schedule 3, is to clarify the source of donations. Essentially, transparency is the goal. Schedule 3 makes changes analogous to those made by clause 8 in relation to donations made to individuals and members&#146; associations so as to recognise third parties and permitted participants. Although we support the goal of transparency, earlier in the Bill&#146;s passage we had many concerns about the provision. In particular, we were concerned to ensure that small donations were not subject to a potentially burdensome and demanding declaration system. After much negotiation and effort, we have, thankfully, made great progress since then, particularly in increasing the thresholds for declaration from the low original sum of &#163;200. In this day and age, using that sum was particularly out of touch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="90302-0007.htm_para4"><a name="0903027000292">The Government have also removed the unworkable requirement that parties verify the donation. In combination with the &#163;200 threshold, that requirement would have made the administration of donations almost impossible. It was agreed by all, including the Electoral Commission, that amendments increasing the thresholds and removing the verification requirement were the way forward. Again, the verification requirement would have placed a great burden on local and national party officers alike. Of greatest concern was the potential impact on local party officers. As the Minister said, they are frequently volunteers, and we felt that the Bill in the form considered in Committee risked permanently discouraging those at the grass roots of politics from engaging with the political system. Even for lawyers or experts in money laundering, the requirement would have been almost unworkable, let alone for busy unpaid local volunteers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="90302-0007.htm_para5"><a name="0903027000293">When the Bill went into Committee, any donation of more than &#163;200 would have come within its ambit. That would have resulted in approximately 100,000 declarations being required in relation to Conservative party donations alone, leading to an administratively unworkable work load. As a result, we felt that the political system would be damaged, rather than enhanced. After much effort in Committee, the thresholds were increased to &#163;5,000 at national level and &#163;1,000 at local level. We still had concerns, however. It is a simple fact that political parties need funds to fulfil their democratic roles, and the thresholds are still set at a lower level than we had expected. Fortunately, the Government have come back again and admitted that the clause is still deficient, and have tabled these amendments that we are discussing today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90302-0007.htm_para6"><a name="0903027000294">Government amendments 94 to 111 and new clause 19 are a response to widespread objections to the surprisingly low thresholds for declaration originally proposed in the Bill. The Government amendments increase the sums to &#163;7,500 for donations made nationally and &#163;1,500 for donations made locally. I shall return to the thresholds in discussing our amendments. I can confirm that we are reasonably satisfied with the national threshold, but that we have tabled amendments to increase the local threshold from the &#163;1,500 proposed by the Government to the more appropriate figure of &#163;3,000. We had considered increasing this figure to match the  <br>

national threshold, as that would have been simpler for all concerned, but &#163;3,000 is where we are at on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="90302-0007.htm_para7"><a name="0903027000295">New clause 19, which addresses the so-called &#147;permissibility threshold&#148;, serves two important purposes. First, it introduces further consistency to the 2000 Act by amending relevant sections so that the figures are in line with the proposed increased thresholds in amendments 94 to 111. Secondly, it increases the recordable threshold to &#163;500 from &#163;200&#151;another improvement. As it stands, part IV of the 2000 Act imposes restrictions on the sources of donations; it prevents certain foreign and anonymous donations to political parties and makes registered parties subject to reporting requirements when in receipt of donations of more than a certain value. The new clause serves to amend the relevant sections of PPERA, specifically in part IV, and the related schedules 7, 7A, 11 and 15. The Act specifies which payments or services to a party are not to be regarded as a donation and are therefore not subject to any requirements&#151;any donation of &#163;200 or less is to be disregarded. The new clause amends the sum, increasing it to &#163;500. Accordingly, any donation of &#163;500 or less would not be subject to the regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="90302-0007.htm_para8"><a name="0903027000296">The increased figure serves a number of goals, and the threshold, generally, is a significant one. Principally, the increased sum aims to reduce administrative burden&#151;a reduced strain will be placed on parties in relation to less financially significant sums. The sum should also prevent donors of smaller sums&#151;those up to the more realistic figure&#151;from being discouraged from contributing money. I am thinking of, for instance, ticket prices for attending local fundraising events. It is important that less significant sums donated in that manner are not caught up in the complexities of this Bill. Again, I stress that we should be encouraging engagement at the grass-roots level of politics; by having a higher level, we carve out individuals who are involved at the base level of politics and who are in no way targets of the legislation. It is sensible to remove entirely from any such conversation those lower sums. I am sure that all hon. Members will be aware that the voluntary levels of party structures and local fundraising are normally entirely divorced from the more complex upper echelons of party funding. Furthermore, as the Minister has pointed out, it should not be forgotten that the PPERA provisions that set the &#163;200 level were debated almost a decade ago. Given the time lag, there is a need for a more valid and fair level at which to disregard the potentially oppressive PPERA restrictions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="90302-0007.htm_para9"><a name="0903027000297">Although we approve of increasing the threshold, we remain concerned that &#163;500 is not enough. That sum is still very low in the grand scheme of party financing, and for the reasons I have highlighted, extra caution should be exercised to ensure that minor donations do not end up falling within the ambit of this substantial and intimidating&#151;for individuals&#151;legislation. Although we appreciate that the Government have attempted to address these widespread concerns, new clause 19&#146;s changes to part IV of the 2000 Act may not go far enough; a greater sum of &#163;1,000, for example, might be more appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90302-0007.htm_para10"><a name="0903027000298">As the Minister said, this is a matter of judgment and balance. The potential for excessive burden does not extend solely to the donor; in particular, I draw hon. Members&#146; attention to the potential for requirements to  <br>

be placed on local volunteers in relation to small donations that nevertheless remain above the proposed level of &#163;500. The accounting rules are extremely technical and complex, as is even the guidance produced on the rules. In addition, we need to consider the fact that, because of the voluntary nature of local associations, many of those responsible for accounting are volunteers. Again, I suggest that it is sensible to remove entirely the possibility of an unnecessary burden being placed on donors and volunteers; extending the threshold to a sum such as &#163;1,000 would ensure that there was far less room for doubt.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that raising the level to &#163;1,000 would make it relatively easy for a donor making a weekly donation of that sum to give &#163;50,000 without it even showing up on the radar of the political parties legislation? Would that not open the door to large-scale donations that would go unrecorded and unreported?</p>

 I do not think that that can happen, because it is a catch-all provision. However, we are not opposed conceptually to anti-avoidance provisions. I am talking about the good guys who want to give money for the right reasons, not the loopholes, which we would be happy to see addressed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o162"><a name="0903027000301"><a name="90302-0007.htm_spnew5"><a name="0903027000597"><b>Martin Linton:</b>
 But this provision would create a loophole, because it would set the recording level. The recipient of donations of as much as &#163;999 would not even be obliged to write down the name of the donor on a piece of paper. The donor could be someone from overseas, and they would be able to make large donations.</p>

 My understanding is that there are anti-avoidance provisions. Taking the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point at face value, the same problem could be held to exist for a limit of &#163;500, &#163;200 or any other amount. If the anti-avoidance provisions need to be tightened up, we would not be averse to considering that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="90302-0007.htm_para11"><a name="0903027000303">If the threshold were extended to &#163;1,000, there would be less room for doubt. It has already become increasingly difficult to recruit and retain volunteers, but we need to encourage enthusiasm for politics at a local level. In that context, I do not understand the Electoral Commission&#146;s concerns that the Government&#146;s proposed increase has the potential to reduce confidence in the transparency and integrity of party and election finance. From previous conversations, we know that the Government have an open mind on this issue, and it may be that their low-bid amendment reflects the concern held by the Electoral Commission. When it comes to setting a level, however, I would argue that it is a matter for Parliament to decide the limit. While we accept new clause 19, we are concerned that the permissibility threshold is reviewed further in the later stages of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="90302-0007.htm_para12"><a name="0903027000304">Our amendments 124, 125, 129, 131 and 133 would increase the threshold for local donations to &#163;3,000 from the current level of &#163;1,500. They would also provide for indexation, about which we are concerned because of the likely high levels of inflation as we come out of Labour&#146;s recession. Such sums can look out of kilter after only a few years. I should note that we have tabled other amendments, such as amendments (a), (b) and (c) to new clause 19, which would provide for indexation for all the threshold figures in the Bill.</p>

Smaller donations, which will comprise the majority in number, should be less rigorously regulated.

 It would not do so if the Government adopted the excellent proposal that someone made earlier&#151;that the adjustment should be made only once in each Parliament. In that case, the complexity for the individual volunteer would be the same whether the figure was &#163;450 or &#163;550 or stayed at &#163;500.

That would ensure that an appropriate level of scrutiny was applied to the more significant sums. Indeed, it is in relation to the larger sums that suspicious and offending activity is most likely to take place. Finally, an increased limit would remove the discouraging requirements in relation to smaller donations.

sums under &#163;3,000. If we succumb to the temptation to over-regulate, we will succeed only in taking the political system further away from the general public. In this way, we will defeat some of the Bill&#146;s key goals in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="90302-0007.htm_para17"><a name="0903027000313">By tabling their own increases, the Government have shown that they support the principle behind increased thresholds. We therefore believe that the further increase introduced by our amendments would reinforce the theme of the Bill, rather than detract from it. The Minister&#146;s acknowledgement of the fairness of our &#163;3,000 proposal is welcome. In the light of his kind offer, we shall not press the amendment to a Division. We look forward to seeing the Government amendments in the other place. I take the Minister&#146;s point on certain technical issues that he mentioned, which his draftsmen will no doubt address in their drafting of his amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="90302-0007.htm_para18"><a name="0903027000314">As I stated, clause 8 creates a new responsibility for donors to political parties to declare any outside source of a donation. Although I repeat our support for the concept of transparency, there must be sensible limits in place to protect the vast majority of honest and genuine participants in the democratic process. The general impact of clause 8 could be costly in both time and money for parties locally. It is at this most fundamental and important level that such burdens are most heavily felt. Bearing in mind this negative potential, our amendment 121 seeks to provide a positive defence for those who have made an innocent mistake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="90302-0007.htm_para19"><a name="0903027000315">As we have emphasised throughout our deliberations, this is a complex Bill and it may prove easy to innocently fall foul of the law in PPERA. Even a brief review of the clause in relation to a declaration reveals the lack of certainty for a lay person&#151;for example, the concept of &#147;value of the benefit&#148; and the provision of a benefit &#147;in connection with&#148; a donation. Although we do not dispute the need for such provisions, it is important to ensure that a positive defence is in place if the complex measures are unwittingly not complied with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="90302-0007.htm_para20"><a name="0903027000316">By including the commission in the process, amendment 121 looks to see that adequate and specialised scrutiny would be placed on any person who asserted the defence. By positively confirming that the defence exists, we can ensure that the Bill is in kilter with other legislation that creates criminal offences. It is important to remember that guilt of a criminal offence, with the obvious stigma attached, is at stake. As it stands, the drafting of proposed section 54A(6) to the 2000 Act does not adequately address our concerns. It merely states:</p>
<a name="90302-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="0903027000399"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A person who knowingly or recklessly makes a false declaration under this section commits an offence.&#148;</p>

Subsection (2) applies if another person has provided the donor with money or another benefit in excess of the threshold in subsection (2)(b). It therefore has two layers: the fact of the provision and the value of the provision. In the case of the latter, subsection (2)(b) applies if the &#147;value of the benefit&#148; exceeds the threshold. Satisfying that requirement could be especially difficult.

 My hon. Friend, and indeed the Minister, talked about the concept of acting in good faith.

Does my hon. Friend agree that there is an issue as regards the &#147;best endeavours&#148; obligation&#151;the extent to which people need to make investigations to ensure that they are satisfied&#151;and that there is, equally, a correlation with the recklessness test that appears later on as to whether an offence is triggered?

Essentially, it is a look-through provision in respect of which we agree with the Electoral Commission; it is too widely drawn, such that is onerous and disproportionate.

As I said, we believe that they are important provisions that will ensure that inflation does not leave the thresholds at an excessively low real level, and that the figures will increase in line with inflation. Some have said that they do not like the proposals or that there is no practical need for them for various reasons, including that section 155 of the 2000 Act already allows the Government to increase thresholds to reflect changes in the value of money.

 This is one of those odd occasions where I was in favour of the new clause the Minister was proposing until I heard his reasons for it. I could have understood an argument that said, &#147;These figures take no account of the rate of inflation since 2000, and there is a need to stick to round figures because people do not understand small fractions, so one may as well increase the number upwards to the next round figure and leave it at that for a long time.&#148; The figures are nine years short of where indexation would normally get us, so one could then have said, &#147;We don&#146;t intend to change the figures for a while.&#148; That would be especially important given the fact that inflation is now very low&#151;in fact, we are looking at deflation.</p>

The Minister quite rightly said that we do not have any scientific evidence about public opinion on this matter, but I caution him against making too many assumptions about whether public opinion would find what he proposes acceptable. I would be happy for him to do some research to show me that I am wrong, but to increase the figures by 50 per cent. and also to index, is to lay ourselves open to a charge that we are going too far in one go.</p>

 I welcome the Minister&#146;s attitude towards new clause 19. As a result, my comments will be quite brief. I welcome the increased donation limits, because they will mean that political parties will be less reliant on public money, trade union money and businesses&#146; money, which is bound to be a good thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="90302-0008.htm_para20"><a name="0903027000356">I would welcome hearing from the Minister by how much he predicts overall private donations will increase as a result of the increased thresholds. Some people who now donate at a level just below the threshold will donate at a level just below the new, higher threshold. That is not for any criminal reason, or for any other reason that might make us uncomfortable. I can give the House three examples of people to whom I have spoken about this. The first is a bailiff, who wanted to contribute to a political party, but who did not want his name in the public domain, and who has a policy of keeping his name and address private. The second was a constituent who had won quite a bit of money on the national lottery, and who was conscious of the need to keep their name out of the public eye for fear of receiving unsolicited requests for donations. The third was a relatively junior civil servant who wanted to make quite a large contribution to a political party, but who felt that that might go against them in their workplace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="90302-0008.htm_para21"><a name="0903027000357">Conversely, some people might increase the amount of money they donate because they want it to appear on the register. For example, I was considering making a &#163;50 donation, having met Rebecca Harris, the Conservative candidate in Castle Point. That would have been below the &#163;200 threshold. I am actually incredibly proud of wanting to make that donation, and I think that I shall increase it to &#163;201, so that it can go on the record, as part of the attempt to bring greater democracy and accountability to Parliament, rather than having to wait until the threshold goes up to &#163;500 to make the same point. That would also be an awful lot more expensive for my pocket. So Castle Point Conservatives can expect a &#163;201 donation from me as a result of this debate.</p>

Heaven forbid that we should find ourselves in that position in 15 months&#146; time, or before, if the country remains undecided about who they want to solve the problems that the Government have got us into.

People wishing to donate money should not be assumed to be buying influence or to be potential criminals. Innocent mistakes can happen, and everything the Bill does should encourage people to make political donations, and, indeed, to be proud of making them and proud to back the vitality of our democracy.

In the long discussions about the Bill, which is supposed to be about political parties and their funding, this is the first time that we have been able to debate the central issue of whether transparency in donations&#151;as we have discussed over the last hour and a half&#151;is enough, or whether, as I and my party believe, there should be far stricter control than just knowing who donated money, as we need to limit the amount donated itself.</p>

However, while those talks were going on, this particular proposal for a donation cap at around &#163;50,000 gained support on all sides, so I would be astonished if it were opposed today by parties and politicians who previously supported it.</p>

 I hope to expand on this point if I catch your eye, Madam Deputy Speaker, but does the hon. Gentleman accept that Hayden Phillips made his proposal for a donation limit of &#163;50,000 as part of a comprehensive package, which included state funding, and that he said words to the effect, &#147;You cannot have one without the other&#148;? I think he used the phrase, &#147;There can be no cherry-picking; this is a comprehensive package.&#148;</p>

 Sir Hayden Phillips did say that it was a comprehensive package, but I understand that the talks never got to the discussion of state funding. Later in my speech, I shall get to precisely that point, because it is important to understand exactly what effect a &#163;50,000 cap would have on the existing parties, the extent to which it would produce a funding gap for the parties and the extent to which state funding would be required to fill that gap, if at all.

to the perception that big money, as he puts it, is buying influence, why set the cap at &#163;50,000? Surely it should be considerably lower, although the great British public at large would think even such a sum one that could influence decision making or give access to politicians.</p>

 No, the issue is not only transparency, but whether public confidence can be maintained solely by transparency.

 That is precisely right and it is what we are trying to achieve. The hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd) is correct in that trade union members who do not contribute to the political fund should not in any way be contributing to a political party, because donations other than those from a political fund are not allowed in law. Nevertheless, the political fund is not limited to affiliations; it can spend on donations as well as affiliations, so it does not follow, as the hon. Gentleman seems to think, that if a union makes a payment from the political fund it is automatically an affiliation. That is not the case.</p>

I support the general concept of a cap on donations, but surely the hon.

The key point is that individuals know what is happening and are clearly able to opt out if that is what they want. All Members who have had anything to do with unions in the course of their lives&#151;I have had a lot to do with them from my early childhood&#151;know that some unions are more open and their political fund is easier to opt out of than others. As I mentioned at Second Reading, when my wife tried to join the union Unite she found it very difficult to opt out of the political levy, even though in the circumstances she did not feel like donating money to a party that was trying to oust me from my seat&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;She might have.&#148;] She might, but I can assure the House that she did not. The point is that the Electoral Commission should lay down clear guidelines about what counts as sufficient clarity in union rules and documentation to satisfy the commission that the union is giving its members a clear, open and transparent choice.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to say that public perception is the acid test. I tend to support the direction of new clause 1, provided that it is linked to new clause 8, as he explained it was. It achieves the balance for which Labour Front Benchers called in an earlier debate. On the Hayden Phillips spending-caps pillar, can the hon. Gentleman advise the House? If there were a &#163;50,000 limit, except for trade unions in certain circumstances, what would that give the main political parties? Has he done any research on that? I congratulate him on the way in which he has brought the debate forward; it is excellent.</p>

 A set of figures available from the Electoral Commission and on the parties&#146; websites gives us a clue as to what might happen if there were a &#163;50,000 cap. We have to make certain assumptions. One of them is that a donation of more than &#163;50,000 would become a donation of &#163;50,000&#151;that is, that the whole donation would not be lost, and that only anything above &#163;50,000 would be lost. We also have to make assumptions about how a scheme like that in new clause 8 would apply, because there is a distinction between affiliation, which would continue to be allowed, and donations to which the cap would apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="90302-0009.htm_para13"><a name="09030218000004">With all those caveats, I suggest that the situation would be as follows. The three main English parties, if I may put it that way in the presence of the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)&#151;the British parties, or, as the First Minister of Scotland says, the London parties&#151;spend about &#163;62 million in a typical non-election year, if we take 2008 as a typical year. However, it is worth saying that in a non-election year, they often have, between them, a surplus of about &#163;10 million, so they actually raise about &#163;72 million. If a &#163;50,000 cap or something similar were in place&#151;I think that this goes some way towards answering the question that the Secretary of State posed&#151;it would have the effect of reducing the total income of the parties by some &#163;10 million. Of course, that &#163;10 million would not be distributed evenly among the three parties, but then the Labour party spends about &#163;25 million a year, and the Conservatives about &#163;32 million. The Liberal Democrats spend about &#163;3 million or &#163;4 million a year. The losses for the Liberal Democrats would be proportionately small, but at about the same sort of level as the losses of the other parties.</p>

For a number of reasons, I do not think that they would necessarily be in that bad a position. The first reason is the surplus. The loss is about the same as the annual surplus, although the counter-argument is that the surplus is accumulated in non-election years and spent in election years. Even if we put the surplus to one side, a reduction of 15 or 16 per cent., although difficult to make in one go, is not, in my view, entirely out of the question for the political parties, especially the two bigger parties.</p>

 Is not the hon. Gentleman making the case that new clause 1 is unfortunately detached not only from new clause 8, but from new clause 10, which his party put forward? As Hayden Phillips&#151;and, indeed, Select Committees&#151;suggested, such arrangements need to lean on each other and cannot be separated from each other, if the logic is to work.

What could the parties do in the medium term to deal with the gap that would be created by such a cap? It seems to me that they could do a lot of things. First, the Conservative party employs several very highly paid people, whose salaries are said to be in the region of a quarter or a third of a million pounds a year. Certain economies are therefore quite easy. Secondly, we all know that parties waste a lot of money on campaign techniques whose efficacy is far from established.

 As the Secretary of State says, the conclusion was that a donations limit should be considered in the context of state funding and other forms of funding. One obvious form of funding is to raise money in small amounts, as Barack Obama&#146;s campaign in the US did. One of the great attractions to party fundraisers of the possibility of very large donations is that only a few big donations are needed for the required money to be raised. In the United States, where the donation cap is very low, techniques have been developed to raise money in smaller amounts but in large numbers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90302-0010.htm_para2"><a name="09030218000015">The question to consider is whether it would be necessary for parties to receive large amounts of state funding on a permanent basis, which the Government keep implying would be the inevitable result of a donation cap. I do not believe that it would be necessary. The amount of state funding required would be quite modest, and whether there would be any need for it to be provided on a permanent basis is an open question. We must therefore ask whether it is true that we could not introduce a donation cap without already having worked out some elaborate and permanent state funding scheme. I do not believe that that would be necessary, because in the context of the spending cap and the relationship between the Labour party and the unions, the donation cap stands by itself. It does not need those further measures.</p>

 Surely, the hon.

Quite apart from affiliation fees, does he not recognise that the money that ends up in the political funds of trade unions has been put there after a collective decision in the political fund ballot and after a series of individual decisions not to contract out of the political fund levy? The money is there as a result of many small decisions by individuals.</p>

 Yes, the money goes in by individual decision, but it comes out by collective decision and, for that precise reason, it should be treated as a donation, unless one can show that it is, indeed, an affiliation fee being passed on individually.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman; he is being very generous with interventions.

 I cannot understand how the hon. Gentleman thinks that our proposal is the opposite, because we want both an effective national spending limit all year, every year, not just sometimes, and an effective local spending limit all the time as well, in combination with a cap. The restoration of public confidence depends on having both those things, not just one of them. We often hear arguments that one side wants transparency on donations but is willing to have a cap on spending and that the other side wants things the other way around, depending on what is to its short-term advantage. That is not good enough; we need both spending and donation caps simultaneously all the time.</p>

 We would also end the situation whereby individuals gave the Labour party &#163;1 million to change a policy and it all came out in public, so the Labour party gave back the money, but the policy still stayed changed. That seems to me to be the best-value donation of all time. However, it does not do a lot of good for any of us to bandy around the names of individuals in one party or another who have been found to have done something of no credit to politics.

 I am glad that we have an opportunity to discuss the crucial issue of the role, if any, of donation caps in a properly transparent system of party funding that commands the greatest degree of public acceptability. This issue was first considered at great length by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which examined it in 1997, after the general election of that year; and in its landmark report of 1998, under its then chairman, Lord Neill, it set out its view of the case for and against donation caps, because&#151;surprise, surprise!&#151;the Liberal Democrats were at that time urging on the Neill committee donation caps of &#163;50,000.

Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) made a very bad point for himself, but a good point for the rest of us, when he referred&#151;in rather delphic terms, but we might as well refer to it publicly&#151;to the Ecclestone donation to the Labour party, which emerged, with a certain amount of excitement, in the autumn of 1997. That donation was made under the old regime&#151;the untransparent regime&#151;whereby donors were entitled to request confidentiality for their donation, and I recollect, although I am open to correction, that that is what happened. The profound change made by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 was that that donation, which was well above the &#163;5,000 limit, would have had to be on the record and be declared by the Labour party. People could then have made up their own minds about whether undue influence was being brought to bear. If the purpose of giving the money was, as it were, to purchase a policy, the donor might well have decided that, as there would be total transparency, it might not be such a good idea. I am pretty certain that none of the problems that arose would have arisen had the provisions of the 2000 Act been in force in 1997. Therefore, this is a point for those of us who believe above all in transparency, and in doing nothing that might undermine a transparent regime.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_brev2"><a name="09030219000039"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The individual or company wanting to give might consider that the cap infringed a basic right and there would be a strong temptation to seek to evade the limit, perhaps by spreading resources amongst friends and relations or by setting up subsidiary companies in order to legitimise any donation by sub-dividing it. There would be no easy way to detect such a stratagem, nor to enforce the cap. In our view, the panoply of rules and bureaucracy which we believe would be required to enforce such a system would not be justified by the purpose of the cap&#148;.</p>

Indeed, that was exactly how Hayden Phillips read those proposals, because he was considering the matter in parallel to the Constitutional Affairs Committee and, in a sense, took as his starting point for his proposals what was in its report, to which the hon. Member for Cambridge signed up.</p>

 As I say, my starting point has always been the position that was taken by Neill and by my party, and by the Conservative party, its Front-Bench spokesman, the shadow Home Secretary and a panoply of Conservative Uncle Tom Cobleys, who all said that they are not so keen on donation limits, for perfectly sound reasons. What we were involved with at the same time as Hayden Phillips&#151;the hon. Member for Hornchurch will recall that the interim report was published in October 2006&#151;was seeking a compromise with the other parties. We were not so keen on donation limits, but we were keen on spending limits&#151;I have always been keen on those&#151;and other parties were keen on other elements of this, and we came together to agree what I thought was a comprehensive package.

These measures are in the public interest, and it is fair and reasonable to use public funds to help offset their financial impact.</p>
</ul><a name="90302-0010.htm_brev8"><a name="09030219000045"><ul><p class="tabletext">Second, our political parties all face long-term financial instability because of the rising costs of their business, and it is this which has prompted them to follow the trend among large non-profit making groups to pursue large donations from wealthy individuals and organisations. Financial instability is the enemy of healthy politics, and an injection of public funds is merited if we are to maintain public confidence in our democracy.</p>
</ul><a name="90302-0010.htm_brev9"><a name="09030219000046"><ul><p class="tabletext">Third, there is a widely discussed and lamented decline in democratic engagement in this country, manifested in falling election turnouts and falling party membership rolls. Properly targeted, public funding can make some contribution to reinvigorating the parties&#146; drive to involve and engage more members of the public in political debate.&#148;</p>

The Liberal Democrats and the Labour party had initialled it but, for reasons that we need not go into at length, the Conservative party was unable to support it.</p>

 Perhaps the Secretary of State has hit the nail on the head. Does he agree that the problem we face in this debate is that the outside world probably thinks that each party&#146;s position depends on its own self-interest and that the bigger picture is lost? I believe that anybody, including trade unions, should be able to give whatever money they have freely. If trade unions wish to give their money, they should be free to do so&#151;it is their decision.

 I agree with that. May I say something else on the issue of donation limits? I shall do so briefly, as I know other hon. Members wish to contribute. There is no doubt that the proposals from the Constitutional Affairs Committee, which were agreed by all sides, were predicated on the basis of state funding, as were the Hayden Phillips proposals and those that were discussed in the Hayden Phillips all-party talks. A donation limit would make any sense&#151;and could gain my support and the Government&#146;s, for similar reasons to those that I believe have been expressed on many occasions by the hon.

It would have been difficult to introduce in 2007, but in the midst of the worst recession we have seen since the war and when there is great demand on public finances and will be for some years to come, we would need to take leave of our senses to propose that hard-earned taxpayers&#146; money should be used to support our political parties. If we wanted to make one decision that would ensure that the esteem in which we are held&#151;which is not that high anyway&#151;rocketed through the floor, it would be to introduce extensive state funding.</p>

 My hon. Friend raises a further issue of complexity, and we would have to think very hard before we went down that route. If he will forgive me, I will try to provide him with a more detailed answer should I catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, later to sum up the debate.</p>

The Constitutional Affairs Committee waxed eloquent about the Canadian example, and how Prime Minister Chr&#233;tien had introduced a system of state funding with low spending and donation caps. This was the future, it said, and so it was&#151;for a period. However, if political parties were to be significantly funded by the state, we should all remember the temptation for a Government who might be under pressure in terms of public finance to seek to use the money going to their opponents to political advantage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="90302-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09030219000026">Last year in Canada, notwithstanding the clear all-party agreement about state funding for political parties, Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister, decided&#151;as part of an austerity package and without consulting the other parties&#151;to propose that the state funding should be significantly cut. He was entitled to do that, but it led to paralysis in the Canadian Parliament. Had he not then prorogued Parliament peremptorily, it would have led to a motion of no confidence in him. It led to Parliament being suspended for many weeks, and he has now had to withdraw the proposal. That vulnerability to partisan advantage shows that not much good may flow from extensive state funding.</p>

It will be back to cash for honours and people giving &#163;1 million to the Labour party so that they end up in the other place.</p>

Finally, it is an insult to donors small and large to all political parties to suggest, imply or insinuate that the overwhelming majority do it to curry favour or to buy advantage. They do not.

 New clause 1, tabled by the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth), proposes a cap on donations set at &#163;50,000, which would be an annual limit. It would insert a new subsection 1A into section 54 of PPERA requiring that parties do not accept donations from a permissible donor if that donor had already donated &#163;50,000 in the same calendar year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="90302-0011.htm_para4"><a name="09030219000030">Taken by itself, the new clause looks fairly straightforward, so I agree with the hon. Member for Cambridge that taking this new clause on its own is somewhat misleading, because it is of course a very complicated issue, as the Secretary of State set out. It is the unfortunate backdrop to the debate on new clause 1 and other new clauses tabled by the Liberal Democrats that secrecy and suspicion have long tainted the donation regime. However, as the Secretary of State pointed out, most people who make donations are honest and want to contribute to the societies in which they live through their donations to political parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="90302-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09030219000031">As the Secretary of State said, the process started with Lord Neill&#146;s Committee on Standards in Public Life, and the subsequent inquiry, &#147;The Funding of Political Parties in the United Kingdom&#148;. The Neill report was published in October 1998 and suggested, among other things, greater transparency in donations. While the Committee&#146;s report is relevant to the new clause, it did also pave the way for further work in the area of electoral reform, and the gauntlet was recently taken up by Sir Hayden Phillips. His report, published in March 2007, made several suggestions intended to breathe life into the democratic system and revive political engagement. Indeed, by his calculations, party membership had sunk from one in every 11 citizens 50 years ago to about one in 88 in 2007. That is a grave statistic that we should all think long and hard about.</p>

Gentleman&#151;we can accept for the purposes of this debate that his suggestions are, as a package, behind the new clause and others that the Liberal Democrats have tabled. However, we are concerned about the timing and whether this Bill is the correct forum in which to discuss such wide-scale reforms that have, for better or worse, been discounted so far.</p>

The harsh reality, which the Liberal Democrats seem to fail to recognise, is that what is on the table today is a Bill that, I agree, is somewhat lacklustre. The debate surrounding individual and collective caps is therefore a debate for another day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="90302-0011.htm_para7"><a name="09030219000035">In the report Hayden Phillips was keen to emphasise that a common approach cannot be delivered in the short term, and that consensus must be reached in finding a long-term solution. The Bill is designed to ensure that that Electoral Commission has adequate powers to deal with the provisions of PPERA. It introduces some transparency through reporting requirements and adjustments to thresholds. Yes, the Bill is a tinkering exercise rather than an overhaul, but the Conservative party will remain willing to seek that overhaul, even if that means moving back to the Hayden Phillips process or, as seems probable, beyond it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="90302-0011.htm_para8"><a name="09030219000036">Let us be clear that when we have that further debate we shall require a thorough review of the relationship between the trade unions and the Labour party.

If any Labour Member thinks that we conceded that only to allow unions to vote on having a political fund every 10 years, they should think again. The hon. Member for Cambridge will not have our support for his amendment, although we recognise his position as a matter to be included in the wider debate on party funding that will take place in due course.</p>

The plain fact is that people believe that parties can be bought, and they may be right.

The big donor culture has created a perception of corruption and we must do something about it.

public opposition to more state funding would be enormous, and my sympathies would be with the public on that. We would do well to recall that existing levels of state funding for political parties are already very high. Roughly half of our party politics is funded by the state directly or indirectly&#151;a much higher figure than is commonly supposed.</p>

It would have to be designed to encourage very local campaigning and a regeneration of grass-roots politics, and that would mean tax relief or match funding. It would also mean that cash-per-vote schemes, such as the Liberals have supported and the Conservatives considered in the 2005 proposals, and which were published at that time, would not be serious runners again for some time. I was never enthusiastic about those schemes, and I do not support them now. However, I do support match funding.</p>

It probably could; any campaigning benefits that parties pick up from the use of such money have to be offset against the negative publicity that comes with it. Something must also be made of the Lord Chancellor&#146;s point that a very high proportion of donations are honourably intended. It should be&#151;and is, I think&#151;a mark of a healthy democracy and polity that donors big and small should be prepared to donate money. It would be wrong to assume that all big donors are in it for access, honours and influence, although unfortunately a few of them are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="90302-0011.htm_para20"><a name="09030227000013">Any answer to the question whether parties can cope with the donations cap must also address the special and unique needs of the Labour party. As it stands, new clause 1 would limit trade unions to &#163;50,000, because affiliation fees&#151;rightly, in my view; there are also many supporters of the same view on the Labour side of the House&#151;are treated as collective donations in law. The consolidation of the trade union movement would make the new clause particularly punitive for the Labour party, because that consolidation would reduce even further the number of donations that the trade unions could make to it. The trade unions are, of course, the Labour party&#146;s paymasters, directly and indirectly, on a huge scale. As I mentioned, the unions make no secret of their desire to influence Government policy; they often boast about their successes in print and in public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90302-0011.htm_para21"><a name="09030227000014">We have to decide whether it is in the interests of British politics for us to carry on in that way. In my view, it cannot be right that in the 21st century a pressure group, or a collection of them, however steeped in tradition, should retain such an influential place in the life of a major political party. Parties, like democracy itself, must be aggregations of the decisions and will of individuals. The age of corporatism should be long gone. New clause 1 would end it, and that key ingredient of it attracts me.</p>

 There are two problems with that. First, we do not need to look in a crystal ball. We can read the book: we can see that political parties&#151;this Government and previous ones&#151;do appear to have given things in return for money, and on a sizeable scale. Secondly, even if the problem is only one of perception, it will not go away, and we need to deal with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="90302-0011.htm_para22"><a name="09030227000017">I want to allude to the Hayden Phillips negotiations, which centred on the treatment of affiliation fees. Throughout that period, the Conservative position was absolutely clear, as it still is. Special treatment of affiliation fees can be considered as part of the introduction of a &#163;50,000 cap. I mean &#147;special&#148; treatment, because logically a &#163;50,000 cap should be accompanied by a complete restriction, meaning that only direct payments by individuals should be permitted as a legitimate source of funding for political parties. Corporate donations and donations from institutions and intermediaries, including trade unions, in which the individual is subsumed, should in the long run be restricted&#151;and brought to an end after an interval. That point was set out in the Conservative party&#146;s proposals published in 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="90302-0011.htm_para23"><a name="09030227000018">Incidentally, this is also the view of many in the Labour party, although only a few are bold enough to speak up and say so. Matt Taylor, former adviser to Tony Blair, has set out in detail in print and in a number of speeches exactly the position that I have described. A good number of Blairites on the Government Benches have told me privately that they agree, although very few are prepared to put their heads above the parapet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="90302-0011.htm_para24"><a name="09030227000019">We are left with a crucial question. How could affiliation fees be allowed to cheat the logic of the &#163;50,000 cap while upholding the principle that those donations are matters of individual choice? There are three requirements. First, there should be a genuine choice for an affiliated member. In the course of the Hayden Phillips investigations, we discovered that many affiliated members scarcely knew that they had made a donation to the Labour party. That, no doubt, accounts for the absurdity that, when polled, a majority of affiliated trade union members turn out to vote for political parties other than Labour. It beggars belief that they should want to donate to Labour while voting for the Scottish National party, the Liberal party or the Conservative party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="90302-0011.htm_para25"><a name="09030227000020">The second requirement must be that the choice should be extended to donations from other parties. Therefore the means by which the choice is presented to the affiliated member as he joins the trade union must enable him not only to choose not to give to one party, but to choose to give to another. The third requirement must be that the individual must periodically be given an opportunity to review his decision&#151;in practice, that does not happen in many trade unions. That opportunity should be provided annually.</p>

first would be that all parties were short of money. Does that matter? I have already discussed that question. Spending on party politics in this country is already high and it could probably be brought down. Billboards have been mentioned, and numerous other savings could be made with no material damage to the fabric of our party political system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="90302-0012.htm_para1"><a name="09030227000022">Incidentally, I did a comparison, taking into account per capita income, between the amount spent in the recent US presidential election and in this country&#146;s last general election. To my surprise, I found that the numbers were broadly comparable&#151;and without taking into account a costing of the party political broadcasts, which parties get free in this country but pay a fortune for in the United States. We already spend a lot of money on party politics in this country and I think that we could do the job with less. Of course, that is why we Conservatives support the reduction of the cap on general election spending from &#163;20 million to &#163;15 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90302-0012.htm_para2"><a name="09030227000023">New clause 1 would have a second big effect, which I would not find acceptable. The playing field would no longer be level; it would be fundamentally altered to the detriment of the Labour party. It would be grossly unfair to disadvantage a party without giving it any time to adjust, however reasonable the principles on which that adjustment was taking place. What kind of adjustment would it be? Well, Labour Members could start to devote some time to thinking about how to make use of their party&#146;s huge databases of affiliated members and find ways of turning some of them into genuine individual Labour party members like members of other parties, instead of just sitting there moaning about how this is an assault on the fabric of their constitution, which is, in legal terms, complete nonsense. However, I recognise that that process would take time&#151;perhaps a long time&#151;and that a long transitional period would therefore be required.</p>

party grassroots activism in British politics, it must be right that different parts of the country, and different constituencies, should have widely different levels of spending. That is why, quite apart from the administrative impossibility, local caps on spending are a non-starter. A global cap of some sort is the way forward.

As this debate progresses in the country, and as the degeneration of respect for parties proceeds&#151;as I predict that it will unless we take action&#151;the pressure will reach a point whereby even the Labour party will be prepared to come seriously to the negotiating table to discuss a change in the relationship between it and the trade unions with regard to affiliation fees.</p>

 I am only surprised that the proposed cap in the new clause is so large. If I look back over what has happened to politics in my time in this House, certainly over the past 15 years, I see, election by election, a decline in voters&#146; attention to a fundamental necessity in their lives&#151;the political process. If donations can be allowed to be so large, that makes things unequal because, naturally and understandably, it is an obvious observation that political parties become very interested in the large donor and let go of the little donor. As a consequence of that detachment from political processes over the years, revenues at local level have fallen and political parties are contracting. In many constituencies, parties are shadow organisations with very few members exercising, for instance, choice over who should be the candidate. Big donations have enabled the centralisation of political choices through party headquarters. The parties in London seek to garner all this money, so they run campaigns aggrandising the centre, but the vitality of the political history of this country comes from the grassroots. All the great movements that have swept this country, including the extension of suffrage, were intensely public, popular movements supported by the many, not the few.</p>

We used to have an expression in this country: &#147;You cut your coat according to your cloth.&#148; Political parties are bypassing that by seeking very large donations that will determine the future of our political processes from the centre, whereas I profoundly believe that constituency parties from each part of this kingdom are the dynamic that should determine what it is we are about.</p>

To think that we can only fight an election with &#163;15 million or &#163;20 million, which requires large donations or, as a substitute, the poor, oppressed taxpayer having to reach into their pockets. The process by which we are trying to determine an ideal or a principle has not been gone about in the right way. Parties should run on the small donations that they can raise. Someone mentioned what Barack Obama had succeeded in achieving through new communications&#151;although those communications are well beyond my pay grade. If one has a cause and stands for something, one can reach the people in this country.

At the moment, one of the things coming between us and those people is big money. The process that the hon.

That is precisely its intention. Conservative Members argued against the new clause on the ground that the amount of &#163;50,000 is too large, and I agree. It is too large, and I would like to see the amount reduced, but we have to start somewhere and so we have started with a proposal to which the Conservatives, as a party, agreed in principle, as part of the Hayden Phillips process. I urge Conservative Back Benchers to think about what they will be doing if they fail to support the new clause.</p>

 These new clauses form an important part of our plans to transform electoral administration. It is significant and complex, so I hope the House will bear with me as I set out first the context of the new clauses, which I hope will assist the House in forming a judgment, before turning to deal with the details. In Public Bill Committee, we discussed&#151;and, it is fair to say, we all agreed&#151;that democracy is undermined when significant numbers of people are not able to participate in elections because they are not registered to do so. Registration is the source from which democratic participation flows. Those who are not registered are denied that participation, so we must all be concerned that it has been estimated that more than 3 million eligible people are not able to vote in this country because they are not registered.</p>

I hope that we can also all agree that the steps taken to tackle that problem must be on the basis of a level playing field for all democratic political parties. Anything that undermines that principle is partisan and risks illegitimacy. We must constantly strive to ensure that the register is as comprehensive as is reasonably possible, on the basis of a level playing field. That is one fundamental principle of electoral registration. The other such fundamental principle is that the register must be as accurate as possible.</p>

 I absolutely agree with the right hon. and learned Gentleman, and that is precisely what I said. It is one of the two fundamental principles of electoral registration that the register should be as accurate as is reasonably possible. Electoral registration should be comprehensive and accurate&#151;those are the principles.</p>

We agree with those who have argued that a system of individual registration in Great Britain would represent a significant step forward in improving the integrity of the electoral register. We also believe that there are other principled, important arguments in favour of individual registration, but our concern has been that, in pursuing the realisation of one fundamental principle of electoral registration, we should not jeopardise the achievement of the other. The simple fact that many individuals, currently registered under the system of household registration, would under a system of individual registration be required to provide personal information for the first time in order to register is very likely to deter some&#151;perhaps many&#151;from registering unless we take important remedial action.</p>

Act 2006 placed a statutory duty on electoral registration officers to take all necessary steps to maintain the electoral register, including sending the annual canvass form more than once, making house-to-house visits and inspecting records that electoral registration officers are permitted to inspect. Much of that is common sense, and many electoral registration officers are doing excellent work in maintaining and expanding their registers.</p>

<p><a name="st_o262"><a name="09030242000020"><a name="90302-0014.htm_spnew9"><a name="09030242000145"><b>Mr. Andrew Love (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 I echo my right hon. Friend&#146;s comment that many electoral registration officers are doing an excellent job, but the reality nationwide is that only 91 per cent. of those eligible to be registered are registered. Must not we prioritise getting a comprehensive register before we do anything else?</p>

<p><a name="st_o263"><a name="09030242000021"><a name="90302-0014.htm_spnew10"><a name="09030242000146"><b>Mr. Wills:</b>
 My hon. Friend is quite right. Those two things have to go in lockstep together, but 91 per cent. is not acceptable. As I will point out in a few moments, any of us can be satisfied only when we can be absolutely confident that the register is at 100 per cent. of those who are eligible to vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="90302-0014.htm_para14"><a name="09030242000022">As I say, many electoral registration officers are doing an excellent job. Some, however, need to raise their game. The new duty has required them all to raise their game. Since its introduction for the 2006 annual canvass, registration rates have increased year on year. In the past three years, the registration figures for parliamentary elections have increased by 371,000 in 2006; 307,669 in 2007; and 111,595 in 2008. There are now 45,194,449 parliamentary electors registered in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="90302-0014.htm_para15"><a name="09030242000023">Similarly, the registration figures for local government elections also increased by 513,054 in 2006; 463,000 in 2007; and 227,374 in 2008. There are now 46,147,877 local government electors registered in the UK. Those increases are a great achievement and they show what can be done, but that is a beginning, not the end. That end will come only when 100 per cent. of those eligible to vote are so registered to vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="90302-0014.htm_para16"><a name="09030242000024">Estimates from 2005 suggest, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) has just said, that only about 91 per cent. are so registered, so we have a considerable way to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="90302-0014.htm_para17"><a name="09030242000025">I am sure that the House will have registered the fact that the figures that I have been referring to are national figures, and there are significant differences in different parts of the country&#151;again, as my hon. Friend has just said. Some parts of the country having fewer of their eligible voters registered to vote than others corrodes democracy in this country. We must do everything possible to tackle that problem.</p>

Electoral registration officers in Great Britain have recently self-assessed their performance against 12 individual performance standards, and the Electoral Commission will publish the results of that this month. After that, local authorities will be required to report annually on their performance. The commission will also shortly publish data on the financial resources devoted to registration by local authorities.</p>

 When I have tabled parliamentary questions asking about the amount per elector in each local authority area, I have been told that the information is not collated in England, but it has been collated in Wales. The point made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) about the importance of ring-fenced funding is crucial. In Wales it was found&#151;lo and behold&#151;that the authorities that spent more money on electoral registration had bigger, better registers, while those that spent less had worse registers. Funding is key. If the Ministry of Justice sends the money to local authorities for that purpose, it must be spent for that purpose.</p>

 I fully support the sentiments that the Minister is expressing, but there is a problem with uniform national standards in the context of electoral registration. It has nothing to do with deprivation; it simply has to do with the demographic circumstances of different authorities. Cambridge has a massive turnover of population&#151;not just the student population&#151;and to hold such areas to the same standards as even neighbouring authorities such as South Cambridgeshire, which has a very stable population, would not be fair on the authorities in the city of Cambridge.</p>

but may have other problems because of the massive churn of the population. Other areas may have difficulties caused by large numbers of people living in houses of multiple occupation. Every area has specific problems. What we cannot accept is that any of those problems constitute excuses for anything other than the utmost effort to ensure that the register is as full as possible.</p>

We propose to take three further steps. Electoral registration officers in areas where there is one tier of local government can already gain access to data held by education departments and social services which help them to maintain and enhance their registers, but that is not the case in two-tier areas. We therefore intend to introduce secondary legislation under powers 2006 Act to enable EROs in areas with two tiers of local government to access data held by the higher tier, to help them to target individuals who are not registered and check the accuracy of their registers. That will help them to identify, for example, young people attaining the age at which they can vote and persons in care homes, all of whom have a right to vote but many of whom may not be registered.</p>

We intend to make clear in legislation that the section 9 duty imposed by the 2006 Act applies throughout the year, not just during the annual canvass period. We know that some officers conduct mini-canvasses outside the main annual canvass period to increase registration rates in areas where they are low. We want all EROs to undertake similar activities where necessary, and to do so throughout the year. That will challenge them, but it will assist them as well. It will challenge them to do more, but we believe that it will also assist them by clarifying what is expected of them.</p>

 When we give powers we naturally expect them to be used, and we will monitor the position. That is the point of the performance standards.

We will expect all of them to measure up to the standards of the best, and to strive to meet the 100 per cent. target. We may not achieve that, but it must always be a pressing obligation for us all.

 Is it my right hon.

 If my hon. Friend bears with me for two or three minutes, I will come to that point, because the two things are linked, although not quite in the way that he suggests. In the early stages, to ensure that we take time to acclimatise the electorate to the radical change that is proposed, there would be no distinction drawn between those people who were registered to vote through having been included on a household form, and those who had voluntarily provided their identifiers. Household registration would effectively remain in place, but a base of identifier data would be being built up alongside it. I will work closely with electoral administrators and the Electoral Commission to ensure that the lessons of the Gould report are applied during the initial, permissive period.</p>

 If the hon. Lady reflects on that, she will see that the two timetables are not too different. As always, there is an element of judgment involved, but we are talking about a profound shift. If we got it wrong and, as a result of shifting to individual registration, which we all agree is desirable, large numbers of people who were eligible to vote fell off the register, it would be a disaster. We must not botch it if we can possibly avoid doing so. A proper time scale enables us to ensure that we do not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90302-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09030242000094">A crucial element that we have not discussed so far is the census; I am happy to try to reassure the hon.

As the hon. Lady will be aware, it is methodologically extremely difficult to get a figure for the proportion of eligible voters who are registered. The figure of 91 per cent. was mentioned; that was the result of an extremely complex methodological exercise, and the figure is hedged around with caveats. However, we know for a fact that far too many people who are eligible to vote are not registered to do so.</p>

It is worth remarking that, as I understand it, the data will not begin to be processed until well into 2012, after which lessons will have to be learned. If the hon. Lady does some simple arithmetic&#151;she can borrow it from the Liberal Democrats&#151;she will find that the two timetables are pretty close together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="90302-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09030242000099">However, we also intend to provide that that shift will proceed in 2015 only if two statutory tests are met. Those tests will be on the state of preparation for the change and the robustness of the existing registration system, which the Electoral Commission will assess no earlier than January 2014. The commission will have to have a reasonable expectation that the move to compulsory provision of identifiers would not compromise the accuracy or comprehensiveness of the register by the point of full individual registration being introduced in 2017. It must believe that the electoral register is both as comprehensive and accurate as is reasonably practicable, and that the effectiveness of the registration system is improving across Great Britain. That finding will have to be supported by performance standards data and other measures.</p>

 My query is about the previous part of the plan, the point at which the provision of identifiers is not yet compulsory. I have a number of concerns about that. What the Minister is announcing is immensely important, and by the time identifiers become compulsory we must have learned as much as possible about what the pitfalls might be. How will the system work during that run-up period? Will different areas do different things? Unless they are, surely we will not be able to learn the possibilities of the scheme. For example, a student library card might be an identifier in a student area, but not in a different area. What will happen so that we get experimental data in that period?</p>

 The Minister is right that a comprehensive register is an important object of policy, but so is establishing a register that prevents fraud and abuse, particularly with regard to absent voting. What troubles me in listening to him is that it appears that the Electoral Commission, in making its adjudications, will concentrate primarily on gaining comprehensiveness. In the criteria that the commission will be given, how important will the objective of preventing fraud be? That does not necessarily work in tandem with ensuring comprehensiveness, and for me, preventing fraud is more important.</p>

The right hon. and learned Gentleman is absolutely right that we cannot compromise on the integrity and accuracy of the register, but neither can we compromise on its comprehensiveness.

Given that it is so important that this historic move is non-partisan, we have put the Electoral Commission at the centre of the move to individual registration, although, crucially, as I have said, Parliament will have the final say.

I have no theological problem with the concerns about modalities that have been expressed by Opposition Members. What is absolutely fundamental&#151;I hope that the House will agree on this today&#151;is that we endorse the fundamental principles and that we move to individual registration on the basis of a register that is as comprehensive and accurate as possible, and these new clauses are the start of that process.</p>

 We welcome these new clauses. The Minister has stressed several times during his speech the fundamental principles, and we agree with him on those principles. Indeed, the Opposition said from the very beginning, when the Bill was first introduced, that there was no point in having a Bill about political parties and elections without the sort of provision that the Minister has introduced this evening. Although I understand his explanations about the practical difficulties that he has faced in introducing his proposals tonight, what is sad is that, if the provisions been included at the beginning of our scrutiny of the Bill, by this point in the proceedings&#151;we are minutes away from the debate on Third Reading&#151;he would have had the consensus that he asked for. As far as I can tell from long and detailed consideration in Committee, we are all in agreement about what we are trying to achieve.

Does she agree that the best course of action would be for the Minister now, with a manuscript amendment, to recommit the Bill with his new amendments, so that it can be reconsidered in Committee and we can do the job that the House is elected to do, rather than giving it to another House that is not elected?</p>

 Well, had I had a chance to do so, I would have extolled at much greater length the virtues of individual voter registration and personal identifiers. Some in this House will know that we dealt with those matters at great length in Committee, so I am satisfied that the principles have been thoroughly examined.

in principle by the Government. I am delighted about that; I would even go so far as to call it a U-turn, and I am delighted that it is a U-turn in the Conservative direction. We appreciate, of course, that the new clauses are necessary in order to ensure that as many people as possible who are entitled to vote are properly registered to vote. Just as importantly, people who are not entitled to vote should not be on the register, and it should not contain any names that are not those of real people&#151;the integrity of the register itself is so important.</p>

 I do not have the exact number at my fingertips, but that is not the point. The hon. Gentleman has made his point a few times this evening, and I do not entirely agree with him. He says that one side of the argument should take precedence over the other, but I do not believe that it should. Surely we can devise a system that ensures that all those who are entitled to vote are registered and are encouraged and able to vote, while also stopping fraud in the register.

 I believe that I am on the record as saying that, but just in case, I am happy to go on the record right now and say it. Of course, I agreed with the Minister on the fundamental principles that he put forward. Some 91 per cent. of those entitled to vote are registered to vote, and that is not good enough. Every single person, especially those who, because of disability or other reason, have difficulty in registering to vote, should be helped to register to do so. That is extremely important and in our own personal campaigning in our constituencies we do all we can to ensure that all the people whom we can reach register to vote and do vote, especially&#151;no, I shall not say any more about which way they vote.

 This has been a remarkable hour and a half. Through a group of new clauses about data sharing, the Government have announced a reform of the entire electoral registration system, and in a wholly new direction. It should be said that my party has called for that new direction for some time; we certainly welcome it and we thank the Government for it. I should also say that, unlike some Conservatives, I have always accepted the Government&#146;s other point, on which the Minister spent a good deal of time before he got to the details of the major concession. It is that if we are to move to a system of individual registration, there needs to be some preparation and a comprehensive study of the possible pitfalls and problems. We do not want there to be a move to an individual registration system that results in a great fall in the number of people registered.

parochial point from my own constituency, a typical question that arises when one moves to a system of individual registration is what happens to students. At the moment, students in halls of residence are often treated by the electoral registration officer as living in a single household, and the university or college authorities take the role of head of household and fill in the electoral registration forms on behalf of those students. If we are to move to a system of individual registration, as we should, it will take a while for those institutions to work out new ways of encouraging their students to register. That is possible, and it is not something to be afraid of, but it needs time to work through to ensure that it happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="90302-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09030251000037">Like other Members, I am concerned about the process by which this change of direction has been announced. The Minister says that he has been listening in the course of the debates on Second Reading and in Committee. That is true. I would like to pay tribute to the way in which he has approached the Bill; he has indeed listened. However, if someone is listening, they should take sufficient time to work out what they are going to do as a consequence of what they have heard. He might have felt somewhat rushed by the fact that we have had one day on Report, with a second day now under way, and felt that he had to announce these proposals before they had been properly written down. It would have been better, in process terms, and would have shortened the debate&#151;certainly, shortened his speech&#151;if we had taken a few more days before getting to the second day on Report. We would then have had before us proposals that were fully written out and that we could consider and debate in the normal way. As it is, we will end up taking even more time and there will be even more worries about the content of what is proposed.</p>

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. My understanding is that we voted on new clause 23 although it had never been moved. Could we vote on my amendments 84 and 85, which were supported by 216 Members of Parliament? I think we should vote on those amendments.</p>

 Order. We are governed by a programme motion, and the opportunity to vote on any earlier amendments has now passed.</p>

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. The decision to allow a vote on new clause 23, which was in a group that had not been reached, was of course within your discretion, but can you confirm that it is very unusual for the Speaker to allow that to happen? Given that the issues raised in the new clause are quite different in the context of the additional costs allowance, are you at liberty to explain why you allowed a vote to take place on new clause 23, which had not been reached and had never been discussed?</p>

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker, which relates to a completely different matter. You were in the Chair when the Minister made a very important announcement about personal registration. You heard the Minister say that the Government intend to table amendments in the other place. This House has never had an opportunity to consider them, or even to see them in draft. We have not a clue what the Government will do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90302-0019.htm_para4"><a name="09030251000879">Will you, Madam Deputy Speaker, exercise your undoubted discretion to accept a motion without notice to recommit the relevant parts of the Bill to the Standing Committee, so that the Government can table their intended amendments, and the Committee can consider them and report back to the House? That would enable very important amendments to be considered by this place and not, in the first instance, by the other place.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. We have been experimenting this evening with a procedure that is unfamiliar to almost anyone in the House or outside, but, once a new clause has been given a Second Reading, is it not normal for it to be added to the Bill and for the opportunity for a Division to be taken? Given that we are now on Third Reading, has that procedure been followed?</p>

 Not after 9 o&#146;clock, when the timetable has come into effect. I understand that there is some concern in the House, although the procedures that have been followed are usual in every way if one looks at the terms of the programme motion that the House adopted. Sometimes, hon. Members may be surprised, if not disappointed.</p>

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I wonder whether it is possible to say whether the Speaker could be a little more open about decisions when they are surprising and unusual. [Hon.

Gentleman looks at that, it will be quite clear. I am not without advice on this, but nothing has happened this evening that is in any way different, as far as I am aware, from any previous occasion. We have followed the terms of the programme motion, which is not, in itself, essentially different from many of the programme motions that have come before the House.</p>

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I want to proceed only because it is fundamentally important that the House decides collectively the rules that we apply to Back Benchers and Opposition Members and new clauses. I asked earlier whether anyone could cite a precedent for a debate and a decision to add a new clause that had not been discussed on Report, and I am told that there is no precedent&#151;certainly, nothing that anyone can cite to me. I have looked at the Standing Orders. I have looked in the programme motions that govern the Bill. Is it not normally the case that, where those things are silent, the Speaker or the acting Speaker in the Chair rules in favour of the existing procedure, not a new procedure? May I ask you and your colleagues to reflect between now and tomorrow on whether we have unwittingly  <br>

Member anywhere in the House moved that that new clause be added to the Bill. I do not think that it was in the Clerk&#146;s hearing, but I am sure that you will be advised if it was.

 Order. I do not think that is a matter on which the hon. Gentleman&#151;or, indeed, the House&#151;should want me to rule. I think it is absolutely clear that there was a vote on Dr. Lewis&#146;s new clause, which the Chair accepted. It was a single vote, and I do not think anyone could have been in any doubt about what was happening at that time. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I have given my advice to the hon.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="90302-0020.htm_para16"><a name="0903031000013">In the short time available to me, I wish to place on record my thanks to all those on both sides of the House who have worked to make this Bill better. It began its journey as a set of proposals in a White Paper, which I brought before the House in June last year. It was introduced on 17 July, and there was then a three-month period over the summer break for Members to consider it. Its Second Reading was on 20 October, it moved upstairs into Committee in November and it has been back on the Floor of the House on two days&#151;in February and now in early March.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="90302-0020.htm_para17"><a name="0903031000014">The Bill is now different from the Bill that was published on First Reading, and it has, in our judgment, been improved. One of the reasons why we have had to take time over it, and in some cases introduce amendments at quite a late stage, is that we have been listening with great care to representations made on both sides. We have sought wherever we can to improve the Bill, and I believe that it has been improved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="90302-0020.htm_para18"><a name="0903031000015">The provenance of the Bill goes back to the establishment of the Hayden Phillips inquiry more than three years ago. That time scale is similar to that of the original Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The reason why that Act and this Bill have taken so much time is twofold. First, party funding is inherently complicated&#151;we have just had a little introduction to that. Secondly, and more importantly, from whatever perspective Members may start debating&#151;and it can sometimes be very partisan&#151;they have in general been careful to recognise the importance of not seeking partisan advantage in the regime for party funding and elections. That was certainly the approach I took in 1999 and 2000 in respect of what became the 2000 Act, and I have taken the same approach on this occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="90302-0020.htm_para19"><a name="0903031000016">In the Bill, we have achieved major reform of the Electoral Commission and important reforms in respect of donations and expenditure, including by establishing an upgraded regime for unincorporated associations. We have also achieved significant advances in respect of electoral registration.</p>

<p><a name="st_o403"><a name="0903031000017"><a name="90302-0020.htm_spnew20"><a name="0903031000452"><b>Pete Wishart:</b>
 Does the Secretary of State not agree that what we are passing tonight is nothing other than a complete mouse of a Bill? All the public&#146;s concerns about cuts in political donations and about trade union funding have been totally ignored.

Friend the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills). I appreciate the concern that there will not have been a chance to discuss the new clauses on registration in this place. I shall therefore make two commitments. First, we shall use our best endeavours to have them discussed informally in draft with the parties before they go to the   <br>

 Tonight&#146;s episode has been a pretty unseemly end to what I believe the Justice Secretary will admit has not been a particularly glorious legislative process that the Bill has gone through in this House. The Bill started life in autumn last year as a thoroughly partisan measure designed to achieve&#151;let us face it&#151;political advantage. The policy goals were exceptionally poorly thought through, leaving the unfortunate parliamentary draftsman an impossible task. The main provisions attracted significant criticism from all sides; the Electoral Commission pointed out that a number went well beyond what it had sought and that other provisions provided no benefit and had a significant downside. All the political parties, including his own, attacked several of the Bill&#146;s original provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="90302-0021.htm_para0"><a name="0903031000021">The storm of obloquy that the Bill attracted prompted the Secretary of State to return, belatedly, to the path of discussion and common sense, even if consensus was not achieved in all matters. The requirement to verify the source of donations was sensibly dropped, the powers for the Electoral Commission were sensibly trimmed back and the thoroughly partisan proposal to reintroduce triggering was dropped; the Bill is completely different from what was introduced in the autumn of last year. This has been achieved much less by dint of having full and open debate in the Commons&#151;in this House and in Committee&#151;because of the rigidity of the programme motion that was introduced, which allowed very little scope for the sort of matters that my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) raised this evening and has led to what most of the House would recognise to have been a fairly unseemly process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="90302-0021.htm_para1"><a name="0903031000022">The Bill is a massive missed opportunity to deal with the big donor culture by having a genuine across-the-board cap on donations.</p>

 I do not have time to give way. The Liberal Democrats have occupied enough air time tonight and I am certainly not going to give them any more.</p>

At some stage these issues will need to be addressed thoroughly. Every effort should be made at all times to seek consensus on these matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="90302-0021.htm_para3"><a name="0903031000026">I am glad that at the eleventh hour the Government have, at last, agreed to move ahead with individual voter registration, albeit in what still seems to be a lamentably leisurely time scale. They committed to the principle of individual voter registration many years ago, but a bit like St. Augustine, they seem to be saying, &#147;Make me chaste, but not yet.&#148; Some Labour Back Benchers seemed to be suggesting that this process, which is scheduled not to be completed until 2015, should be allowed to run yet further, but that is quite wrong.

 It gives me a great deal of pleasure to submit this petition, although I do so with somewhat disappointed feelings, on behalf of the council tenants in the Portsmouth city council area. They are disappointed that the Government continue to take many millions of pounds from them; the Government have taken &#163;8.7 million, including &#163;4.6 million this financial year, from the rents of the city council tenants for general Government expenditure. The tenants hope that the House will urge the Government to reverse that trend and take account of not only the campaign by Portsmouth city council tenants, but that of tenants throughout the country of England; the other parts of the UK are covered by separate legislation on this point.</p>

 One of the great privileges of being a Member of Parliament is that, in this the most important debating chamber in the world, one can raise issues that really matter to one&#146;s constituents. I have rarely been as angry about a matter as I am about this case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="90302-0022.htm_para0"><a name="0903031000400">Two of my constituents, Mr. and Mrs. Ellis, have suffered the awful indignity of Mr. Ellis having had three strokes. He is therefore unable easily to look after himself and has to be looked after day and night. They decided that it would be a good thing if they had a mobile home that was easy for them to deal with. They went to a country park in my constituency, Carlton Meres, which was run extremely well by a charming couple, and they bought a mobile home at a cost of &#163;28,280, on condition that there would be a proper path to the home and a proper ramp for Mr. Ellis&#146;s wheelchair to be pushed along so that he could use the home. Without those, there was no possibility of its being used. I have here the sales purchase agreement that was made, at the bottom of which it says: &#147;Ramp to be provided&#148;. The ramp was not provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="90302-0022.htm_para1"><a name="0903031000401">A couple of months later, the couple were told that the ownership of the park had changed. The ramp had still not been provided. By the time it came to October&#151;they having bought the home in March and hardly having been able to enter it, let alone use it&#151;they decided that they would sell it. Under their original agreement, it was said that they would certainly be able to sell it at a proper price. Indeed, late in October, the salesman told them that the selling price should be more or less what they paid for it because it was new and had not been used. In the event, they were provided with a sum so derisory that it is almost impossible to repeat it&#151;having paid &#163;28,280, a few months later they were given &#163;8,000. When the couple complained, the solicitor for the company, one Mr. Johar of Leicester, said that the reason for that reduced sum was that the ownership of the company had changed and they did not have an agreement with the new owners. When they wrote to me with the document, an eagle-eyed assistant of mine noticed that the name of the company from which they had purchased in the first place was the same as that of those owners. True, the directors had changed, but the company was the same company, so under the law it was responsible for everything that the previous company had agreed to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="90302-0022.htm_para2"><a name="0903031000402">I got in touch with the company and said this seemed to me an entirely unacceptable proposition. It did not answer any letters&#151;that, of course, is the convenient way in which these people behave&#151;so I looked it up and discovered that it already had a history of taking over perfectly well-run sites and then behaving in this appalling manner. I shall give one example: the Riverview and Silver Sands caravan sites in Scotland, about which the list of complaints continues. The owner appears to be a Mr. Barney, who appears on all occasions calling himself Tony and, of course, never giving his full name. It turned out that he told all the owners of the static holiday caravans that they would be required to remove them at the end of the season because he would be  <br>

replacing them with residential homes. He was told by park residents and the holiday caravan owners that the site license did not allow for that, but he made light of that, saying that it would not be a problem. He was very upset when they identified him because he is known in the business. If one looks up his directorships, one finds a whole list of caravan sites where that kind of activity continues.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is articulating concerns of mine. I wonder whether, by any chance, the same individual is in charge of Welch Homes, which is my constituency. If someone buys a place there, they have to be interviewed, they have to be over 50 and they have to have no children. If they then sell their place, they have to pay 10 per cent. back to the company.</p>

 In the Isle of Wight, constituents have come to me concerned that owners of Medina mobile home park are abusing their position and ignoring current laws. Mr. Sines and Mr. Crickmore are driving out owners of older mobile homes so that they can build new homes on the plot. They even vetoed the owners selling their property, and then offered to purchase the property for a much-reduced price. That is wrong; it must be corrected.</p>

difficult is that this company tells direct lies. It told that couple that it was not the same company, when it was. It told them that it had no duty to carry out the promises made by the company, although it did. It also told them that they were lucky to get the &#163;8,000.

I just hope that he will read this and perhaps decide that this is not an organisation with which he wishes, even indirectly, to be associated. Lifestyle Living, Arncliffe Leisure and a dozen other organisations are owned and run by a Mr. A. J. Barney and his wife, Mrs. D. M.

In that sense, it is a great privilege for me to be able to say to the House that Mr. and Mrs. Ellis should not be in this position, and that the Government should do something about it. They have not done anything about it to date, and I am not asking them to do anything about it retrospectively, but they ought to ensure that no one else is ever tempted to buy any such mobile home from Arncliffe Leisure, or from Mr. Barney, Mrs. Barney or Mr. Johar.</p>

The case that he has outlined is extremely distressing, and I wish Mr. and Mrs. Ellis all the very best. Unfortunately, it is clear from the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution and from interventions by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) and my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine), that there is a culture of unscrupulous behaviour and bad practice in this sector on the part of site owners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="90302-0022.htm_para16"><a name="0903033000002">I think that the House would accept that, as the right hon. Gentleman himself said, that those owners represent a minority of the sector and most sites are managed by professional and competent persons who maintain good professional and sometimes caring relationships with their residents. In support of that view, I am very much aware of the efforts of the trade organisations to secure high standards of performance and behaviour among their members and to promote good practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="90302-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0903033000003">Unfortunately, as the right hon. Gentleman said and as I often see from correspondence I receive directly from residents or through hon. Members, professionalism is not universal in this sector and the standards of management on some sites are clearly woefully inadequate. Moreover, as the right hon. Gentleman said and if what is reported is correct, a few cases that I have read about are criminal&#151;quite literally criminal. Because of their vulnerability, many park home residents&#151;very much like Mr. and Mrs. Ellis&#151;are simply not able to stand up to those owners. As this industry promotes itself as being particularly suitable for the older members of our community, it must cater for their needs as consumers, yet some site owners clearly take advantage of and exploit their residents&#151;precisely because of their vulnerability. The truth is that, in some cases, we have to accept that only enforcement with meaningful penalties&#151;focused and targeted enforcement&#151;is likely to change behaviour or drive the unprofessional operators out of the sector.</p>

 I know that my hon. Friend will be aware that many of these people are using the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 and applying it to mobile homes, but as the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) said, these are not mobile, but permanent homes. Is it not time that we looked to amend the 1960 Act so that we can cover those individuals?</p>

 I understand what my hon. Friend is saying and I pay tribute to the fantastic work he is doing in exposing unscrupulous managers of park homes and sites in his own area. I have a great deal of sympathy with what he says, but my difficulty&#151;and the difficulty for the House&#151;is that changing the definition of caravans and mobile homes will, frankly, open up a can of worms for the law on property. The essential concept of mobile homes as dealt with in the 1960 Act is that they are located on someone else&#146;s land and permission is given to base them there on the proviso that they are allowed to move them. That is the difficulty. If we addressed that specific point by addressing the specific rights of caravan owners, we would open up a huge range of issues regarding property, which would be counter-productive. I am keen to look further into this, but I must think about the limitations that follow from the complexity of property law. That makes me reluctant to do something that might have unforeseen consequences.</p>

 I am not pressing the Minister to change the definition in the legislation. I do not want that, because the legislation enables people to acquire homes that they would not otherwise be able to acquire. I press the Minister to say, however, that if people have mobile homes on a static site&#151;we all know what happens&#151;there should be an application of reasonable rules that would make it possible for people to appeal to somebody. It might be a financial ombudsman or someone else who can take a decision about this sort of issue. That would mean only a very small change in the operation of the law.</p>

My officials are studying the responses we have received to the consultation and I intend to announce the way forward on that proposal shortly.

They give residents a voice in the management of the sites that they occupy, and I strongly urge park home owners to form associations. I believe that a collective voice can and does achieve results.</p>

 There is a technical problem with that as 50 per cent. of the residents are supposed to be involved. What happens? There are often two residents in each of the mobile homes and it is easy to prove that 50 per cent. of residents are not involved, so it is important to introduce a change that enables a reasonable number from those in each unit to be able to form a residents&#146; association with powers under the Act.</p>

 That is not my understanding, although I can take that point away and look at it.

If someone wants a licence to station park homes on a site, provided that he or she has planning permission to do so, the authority must issue the licence and give it free of charge, except in very limited circumstances. Once a licence has been granted, it is extremely difficult for an authority to take it away from that person, no matter how unsuitable that person may be.
