benefit claims from post offices to banks. People no longer know
whether the Post Office card account will be maintained. Furthermore,
the Minister for the Cabinet Office, who is in her place next to the
Deputy Prime Minister, talks about social exclusion, when the sub-post
offices most likely to be closed are in the most rural areas. Two
sub-post offices in my constituency at Bolingey and Portloe have been
closed and the buildings sold because a profit cannot be sustained. In
those areas, however, one in four people do not have access to a car

Japan and South Korea, the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, the
Foreign Secretary Ban Ki-Moon&#151;the United Nations
Secretary-General designate&#151;State Councillor Tang, who is the
co-chairman of the China taskforce set up by my right hon. Friend the

decisions on matters such as education are taken by the directly
elected politicians in Northern Ireland. That is one reason why we want
the St. Andrews agreement to succeed. The agreement is very open about
what is necessary. We need to resolve the issues in relation to
policing, but there is a tremendous desire right across the political
parties in Northern Ireland for the St. Andrews agreement to be
implemented. The basic deal that has been at the heart of it since the
outset has been peace in return for exclusively democratic means being

cases, new technology is shortening waiting times, specialist care is
being developed, and more is being done in primary care settings now.
All that is part of necessary change. The Conservative party, having
first opposed all the investment in the NHS, now apparently also
opposes reform. The only way in which the NHS will improve is if we

the decisions on nuclear power now, both our energy security and our
effort to defeat climate change may be put at risk. The reason is
simple: over the next 10 or 15 years, we will move from
self-sufficiency in oil and gas to importing 80 or 90 per cent. of it.
We will lose the existing nuclear power stations. We have already done
an immense amount in terms of energy efficiency, renewables and so on,
but without the component of nuclear power it is hard for me, at least,
to see how we can both reduce carbon dioxide emissions and ensure that
we are not dependent on foreign imports of oil and gas in the

of Government&#146;s accountability to Parliament, but to be
effective the occasion needs to conducted efficiently so that as many
Members as possible can contribute with direct questions. Following a
recommendation from the Select Committee on Modernisation of the House
of Commons in October 2002, the House agreed that, of the hour or so
allotted to statements, the opening ministerial statement should last
no longer than 10 minutes and that the reply from the official
Opposition should be confined to five minutes. My view is that it is
appropriate for the Liberal Democrats, or any other party, to be
confined to three minutes. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I knew that I was
being generous. The purpose of these restrictions, as the Committee
made clear, is to give Back Benchers a fair chance to question
Government Ministers on matters of public importance. I would expect
Back Benchers to ask one supplementary question each. I am therefore
informing the House that these rules will be adhered to in the new
Session, so as to give Ministers the opportunity to make full
statements to the House and be questioned effectively about
them.</p><br>

Industry Association estimates that as many as 300,000 such bikes have
been sold since 2001. Yet the existing statutory vehicle registration
scheme applies only to those vehicles required to be licensed, and the
requirement for licensing a vehicle is that it is to be used on the
public highway. That means that bikes introduced into circulation as
off-road bikes are not registered and do not have to undergo any
meaningful safety evaluation, and that they can be marketed as toys and
sold to children, despite the fact that many now reach speeds of up to
60 mph.</p><p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="61101-0004.htm_para3"><a name="06110156000174">I believe

nuisance generated by off-road bikes ridden across these places. This
can cause particular aggravation to the most vulnerable in our society.
One Worsley constituent who has very limited eyesight told me he feared

spoken this week to two Worsley constituents who have seen damage done
to land and property by off-road bikes during the summer months.
Mr. Les Higgins coaches a junior football team in Little
Hulton, in my constituency, and on many occasions the team could not
continue with their practice or play on the football pitch due to being
ridden at by off-road bikes. The bikes, which were often ridden by two
or three young people at a time, were ridden at the young football
players, with the riders only swerving at the last minute.
Mrs. Renee Cavanaugh, who also lives in Little Hulton, has
been plagued by the nuisance from off-road bikes being ridden at the
rear of her property, sometimes from as early as 8 am on weekends.
Damage was also caused to her car when an off-road bike ran into it.
Those riding such bikes illegally in this way are uninsured, so people
whose land or vehicles are damaged by these riders have no source of
redress.</p><p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="61101-0004.htm_para6"><a name="06110156000177">Sadly, we now
have the concept of the &#147;hit-and-run&#148; off-road biker. A
police officer in Greater Manchester was injured when he was knocked
off his bike and ridden over by an off-road biker riding in a gang of
20 such bikes on a public footpath. Pedestrians aged from 14 to 77 have
also been injured in collisions with off-road bikers, and a 16-year-old
cyclist from Greater Manchester died after a collision with an-off-road
bike.</p><p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="61101-0004.htm_para7"><a name="06110156000178">So off-road
bikers can cause death and injury to others, but they are also at risk
themselves. I am saddened whenever I drive past a particular lamp post
in my constituency, which is strewn with floral tributes to the young
man aged 18 who died there last year when the off-road bike that he was
riding along the pavement hit the lamp post. In Greater Manchester
alone, one teenage rider per month dies as a result of riding off-road
bikes illegally or
dangerously.</p><p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="61101-0004.htm_para8"><a name="06110156000179">Greater
Manchester police believe that preventing the irresponsible use of
off-road bikes is difficult because the nature of the bikes enables a
speedy getaway, and current legislation is not strong enough to enable
police enforcement. There is an inherent problem for the police in
trying to catch those misbehaving on these bikes. An untrained teenager
is at grave risk of accident or injury if he or she tries to flee at
speed from the police on an off-road bike. Chases would also endanger
the police and
pedestrians.</p><p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="61101-0004.htm_para9"><a name="06110156000180">Although
the police do have some powers under section 59 of the Police Reform
Act 2002, Greater Manchester police believe that these powers are
cumbersome and ineffective in dealing with the scale of the problem.
The powers are also seen as balanced in favour of those who commit
antisocial behaviour. To deal with this, the Greater Manchester police
authority have set out plans for a registration scheme for off-road
bikes analogous to that for licensed road-going vehicles. That will
have the following benefits. First, it will reduce the theft of such
bikes, as a clear system of ownership will be established. That will
also help to deal with the flourishing criminal market in stolen bikes.
Secondly, it will improve consumer protection. Bikes will be subject to
safety checks and it will also be impossible to market the bikes as
toys. Thirdly, it will increase the efficiency of police action through
the ability to identify owners.</p><br>

notices and issue 233 warnings. That was commendable work by the police
and it has made some difference. However, as the testimony from my

for example, when I was a special adviser to the 1970s Labour
Government. The establishment of permanent departmental Select
Committees by the then Norman St. John-Stevas, when he was Conservative

Committee chairs by proper remuneration; reduced deadlines for tabling

me now turn to the main part of our debate, the three motions on the
report from the Modernisation Committee on the legislative process,
which was published in early September. A key part of my role as Leader
of the House is to ensure that our work is understandable to, and open
to involvement from, the public. The unanimous proposals in the
Committee&#146;s report will help to achieve that. I am grateful to
my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield

proposal in the package is for improved Committee consideration of
Bills. There has long been concern about the ritual nature of Standing
Committee proceedings. I can see the hon. Member for Buckingham (John
Bercow) nodding. All that I can say is that it is a bit less ritual
than when I entered the House, when the aim of Opposition Members when
they first joined a Standing Committee&#151;and none was more
practised than me in that regard, for the 18 years that I spent in that
penury&#151;was to speak as long as possible into the small hours, in
the mistaken belief that one&#146;s constituents or anyone else was
noticing. The Government Back-Benchers simply did their correspondence
or went outside to make phone calls, to be called back by the Whips.
Proceedings gradually ground to halt, which was what everyone was
aiming for. Then there was a three-hour guillotine debate, when outrage
was expressed by the Opposition, and the Government routinely quoted
all the occasions when the Opposition had introduced the guillotine
when in government. The guillotine was passed, and the rest of the Bill
sailed through without proper scrutiny.</p>

made. First, it would not be appropriate for all Government Bills. It
would not be applied to Bills that are not programmed at all. It would
thus not apply to the Finance Bill. Under these Standing Orders, all
other Bills&#151;except insofar as committed to the Floor of the
House or, in rare cases, to a Select Committee&#151;would go to a
Committee with the power to take evidence. The Committee itself, via
its programming Sub-Committee, would decide how many evidence sessions
were necessary. The programming Sub-Committee would be free to propose
that there should be no evidence sittings, and that is what we would

a transitional measure, we envisage that evidence-taking would only

constituency case load. When I entered the House 28 years ago, the
total allowance was something like &#163;1,500, which was terrible,
because we could not provide a proper service to our constituents.
Before any further allowance comes into effect, there will be a further
debate&#151;if this motion is carried&#151;on a formal motion on
any proposal brought forward by the Members Estimate Committee. Now is
not the only occasion for the House to consider the matter, but if the
process is worked through and the allowance is agreed, we will see hon.
Members of all parties making use of the allowance&#151;there will be
no particular party profile involved&#151;according to their
different expectations and the pressures on
them.</p><p><a name="st_o161"><a name="06110156000279"><b><a name="61101-0006.htm_spnew24"><a name="06110156002756">David

That means that they have been tabled before the House has had the
opportunity to air its views on Second Reading, and before the issues
that are likely to be controversial have been identified. It is
therefore impossible to programme properly if the motion is taken
immediately after Second Reading. We should allow more time, and any
programme motion that is taken immediately after Second Reading should
be limited in its content, with a further motion following it a couple
of days later, after it has been possible to have discussions on the
information that came to light during the Second Reading debate. By

not only the Government who would benefit from such a change. It would
also make it easier for members of the Committee considering the

post-legislative scrutiny, we need greater clarity from the Government
on the whole purpose of the Bill in question. That matter was raised
earlier by the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth). Such clarity
of purpose is important but, sadly, has been reduced. This is
particularly the case now that more and more legislation is passed down
to be dealt with by secondary rather than primary legislation. Large
amounts of legislation are now being passed through secondary
legislation, most of which receives no debate at all. Those proposals
that are debated are normally debated for only an hour and a half in
Committee. The recent exchange between my hon. Friend the Member for
Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) and the Deputy Leader of the House
on the delegated legislation to establish the new strategic health
authorities provided a good example of this. That legislation was
introduced in June and came into force on 1 July. The strategic health
authorities came into being on 1 October. However, the order was
debated in the House in the middle of October, after all that had
happened. We need to consider not only the volume of secondary

legislative scrutiny. The ability to take evidence also represents a
significant step forward. My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham
raised the issue of who should chair the public Bill Committees, as
they will be known, assuming that the motion is passed today. I shall
now perhaps put my head on the block by saying that, in my view, they
will be more akin to the present Standing Committees than to Select
Committees, and that it would therefore be appropriate for them to be
chaired by a member of the Chairmen&#146;s Panel. There could, of
course, be issues involved in taking a piece of legislation from its
pre-legislative scrutiny through its scrutiny in the House, in relation
to the amount of time that a Member would need to spend on the
Committee. However, they will essentially be Standing Committees
considering legislation, rather than Select Committees, and their
chairmanship should be determined on that basis.</p><br>

ourselves in a situation in which a variety of resources will be

Members&#146; ability to get a limited amount of stationery and
post-paid envelopes is not the right way forward. I would prefer
Members to be able to choose how to use a limited single budget. It
might be that special dispensation would be needed for Members who
experienced something such as the Lockerbie disaster in their

have to stick, rather than various allowances on which we can draw,

not of the House, but of individual Members of Parliament, which is an
entirely different matter. The danger is that the allowance will
strengthen the position of incumbents because Members could spend the
money to shore themselves up and make them more difficult to challenge.
There is no better example of that than the hon. Member for Hendon

by Conservative Members. There is a fine balance to be struck. Members
have a duty to inform their constituents about activities related to
their job. That job does not just involve sitting in this place and
passing legislation. It involves working on community issues and
matters that have been raised in the constituency. However, if
correspondence does not inform constituents about Members&#146;
activities in relation to their job, it becomes party political
literature, as the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey
(Simon Hughes) said, rather than literature that should be funded by
the
taxpayer.</p><p><a name="st_o205"><a name="06110156000355"><b><a name="61101-0008.htm_spnew3"><a name="06110156002800">Ms

hearing in relation to the communication allowance. It depends whether
we consider ourselves constituency MPs who communicate with our
constituents, or Members who just sit in the House and spout Opposition
arguments. Those of us who are constituency MPs communicate with our
constituents as much as we can, as many times as we can. An annual
report adds to that. I have found that people contacted me after
receiving an annual report. As the right hon. Lady said, our job is not
confined to the House. We have to communicate with our constituents.
Those MPs who are not doing so should be ashamed of

we reintroduce the two weeks of September sittings that we had in 2003
and 2004. I do not think those worked particularly well in terms of the
business that was dealt with during those sittings. There were other
issues in relation to the works on the House, but the way in which the

welcome the opportunity that was introduced this year to table

to consider the issue of public sittings of the European Scrutiny

a preface to my remarks, the House may be interested to hear what
occurred&#151;or did not occur&#151;with regard to allowances 40
years ago, when I first entered the House, for another constituency.
There was no secretarial allowance, but hon. Members got a third of
what they paid their secretary back in tax. It was rarely a full-time
secretary, for obvious reasons. We paid postage for all letters, which
was not an incentive to do any copying, and for telephone calls outside
London. Notepaper was strictly rationed, and I can remember trying to
argue the case for more. Some might say, but not necessarily me, that
we have gone from one extreme to
another.</p><p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="61101-0008.htm_para11"><a name="06110156000381">I accept that
my amendment, which is supported by hon. Members on both sides of the
House, probably represents a minority viewpoint. I have no illusions: I
know that all the indications are that the majority of Members will
reject it. Nevertheless, it is important that the point of view that it
represents should be put to the House and voted on. As I have said this
in interventions on other hon. Members, it seems quite wrong for the
House to go into recess for a continuous period of 11 weeks. The issue
is not whether we sit for longer than other Parliaments&#151;we may
well sit for longer than others in western Europe, and than the United
States and Canada&#151;but whether it is right that the House should
be in recess for such a long period. That is the crux of the issue. I,
like the hon. Members who will vote with me, find that unacceptable.
There has been some progress: one could cite the example of written
questions, which is obviously an advance, but it cannot possibly be
considered a substitute for the House
sitting.</p><p><a name="st_o221"><a name="06110156000382"><b><a name="61101-0008.htm_spnew19"><a name="06110156002816">Pete

the amendment were agreed to, which it will not be, it would obviously
give us a great incentive to do as the hon. Gentleman suggests and to

true that on the last occasion, in 2004, hooligans invaded the Chamber,

Where is the evidence that it was wrong to hold those sittings, or that

He said that the term &#147;recess&#148; is not used outside the

problem we face is that many of our constituents think that that is

the House is time, which is needed by the Government to ensure the
progress of their legislative programme. It matters to people affected
by the legislation, as it ensures that there is proper scrutiny. It is
important to Opposition Members, who should have the opportunity to
raise serious matters on their parties&#146; behalf. It is important,
too&#151;this ingredient is often forgotten&#151;to Back Benchers,
who often do not have the opportunities that are afforded to their
Front-Bench colleagues, to raise issues that are vital for their
constituencies during the passage of legislation and at other times.
Any discussion that enables us to use the time available to the House
more effectively is therefore valuable. I applaud the Leader of the
House for introducing a wide-ranging series of motions. I do not agree
with every proposal in that gallimaufry but, nevertheless, the House
should have the opportunity to discuss them. He introduced them so

implicit approval of the House if we agree the third motion. I applaud
the work of the Modernisation Committee, but I wish to raise a number
of issues on which it has not done such a good job and which give cause
for concern. Addressing the thorny issue of programme motions and their
consequences, it helpfully proposed that programme motions should not
prejudge the interests of Front-Bench spokesmen on Second Reading or,
as I suggested earlier, of Back Benchers with a particular concern that
they wish to pursue in Committee. It is absurd that Government business
managers affect to understand, before Second Reading, which issues are
likely to be important, producing a programme motion on committal

proper response to the earlier proposal from the Procedure Committee to

legislatures, parties meet to programme business effectively, not by
edict but by agreement, thus determining the legislature&#146;s
opportunities to scrutinise business. We must return to that matter
because the programme motion regime is simply not working. Programme
motions work as guillotines, but they are introduced in circumstances
in which guillotines are not required, as the House can manage its own

Modernisation Committee did not properly address two other parts of
Bill procedure, the most important of which is the Report stage. First,
when a Bill is on Report, it is the one opportunity for Back Benchers
to table and debate amendments. The opportunity is often denied by the
timetabling, which curtails discussion on Report and which orders the
business in such a way that Front Benchers have their say while later
amendments are not debated. Secondly, swathes of Government amendments
that are barely scrutinised are often introduced on Report, which
denies the House the opportunity to do justice to its scrutiny role.
The other place is offended when it gets a half-scrutinised Bill, large
elements of which have never been seen or discussed by this House,
because it has to try to put right what we have failed to do on primary
legislation.</p><br>

specifics, the proposal on public Bill committees will commend itself
to the House. There is widespread support for the suggestion that we
should take a more reasoned view, including taking evidence, before
conducting line-by-line scrutiny, although one should not be at the
expense of the other. I hope that we will not lose the capacity closely
to scrutinise what is written in statute, because I am one of those
old-fashioned people who thinks that it matters what we write into laws
and that what we write into laws should be right. At the moment, that
happens in Committee, and I do not want to lose that

the Leader of the House. Given that so much legislation that has a
crucial effect on our constituents is now secondary legislation, there
may be occasions when it is appropriate for a Committee considering
delegated legislation to take evidence before reaching a conclusion. I
support the view that it should be possible to amend delegated
legislation, because we often make bad law simply because there is no
way to express a different view. It would also be in the interests of
the Government to be able to accede to a sensible amendment in a
Committee considering delegated legislation rather than passing flawed
legislation that must be amended
later.</p><p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="61101-0009.htm_para13"><a name="06110156000416">The

individual hon. Members, so I can only speak personally, but I have not
been persuaded that the communications allowance is necessary. I find
it difficult to understand how some hon. Members manage to spend quite
as much as they do on their postage allowance within the rules of the
House, as I understand them. Some hon. Members have extraordinarily
busy inner-city constituencies, and they deal with a huge volume of
correspondence that is far beyond what, for example, I would expect to
receive in my constituency. Those hon. Members reply to all that
correspondence by letter, but they get nowhere near the upper limits
that other hon. Members find it appropriate to claim.</p><p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="61101-0009.htm_para14"><a name="06110156000417">I suspect, although I cannot

current rules. The starting point should be interpreting the rules
consistently and ensuring that the rules are clear. There are instances
in which it is appropriate to write on House of Commons notepaper to a
particular constituent, because one is aware of something that will
affect that constituent directly and one would like their view, which
is legitimate parliamentary

face difficulties because our allowances system does not properly cater
for the variances between the running costs of constituency offices.
The most appropriate cost to ring-fence might be that of office rental,
because that can differ hugely as between a central London location and
somewhere in an extremely rural area. It seems perverse that some
Members can spend a large part of their so-called expenses just on
ensuring that they have an office available to their constituents while
others will pay much less and have more money available for other
activities that they undertake. I worry that the rules sometimes seem
to be applied in a very arbitrary fashion, not because the Fees Office
wants to be arbitrary but because we have failed to provide sufficient
and adequate guidance as to what are appropriate
expenses.</p><p><a name="st_o238"><a name="06110156000420"><b><a name="61101-0009.htm_spnew13"><a name="06110156002833">Mr.

that we could be on a slippery slope to creating different types of
Members of Parliament based on value judgments as to the type of

have a lot of asylum and immigration cases in my constituency, but it
would be a retrograde step to make a value judgment that my caseload

recognition that different costs are involved. Given that our allowance
system is supposed to equalise Members to make it equally possible for
us all to do our work effectively, where there are fixed costs, which
take a very large percentage of some Members&#146; allowances and not
those of others, it is sensible to recognise that rather than to
pretend that it is otherwise. We do that in relation to accommodation,
so why not office accommodation? That is an odd discrepancy. I will not
support the communications allowance because I suspect that it acts as
a strong support for incumbency, which is not necessarily a good
outcome.</p><p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="61101-0009.htm_para17"><a name="06110156000422">On September

Greg Knight (East Yorkshire) (Con):</b> I shall start by
referring to the two motions relating to sub judice, but before I get
on to the meat of my argument, I wish to thank all members of the
Procedure Committee for their support and hard work. It does not
involve trips to exotic places overseas, and often there is no media
coverage, but, nevertheless, it is very important. I also join the

sub judice rule effectively prevents debate on individual cases while
they are active before the courts. The rule is set out in a resolution
that was agreed to by each House in 2001. Our predecessor Committee
reported on the resolution as a whole in March 2005 and, while
recognising that it has sometimes created difficulties for Members,
particularly in terms of delaying debates, that report did not
recommend any change to the rule itself.</p><p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="61101-0010.htm_para14"><a name="06110156000454">We decided to return to the
subject mainly because of representations that we received from Members
that the implementation of the rule was preventing them from debating
issues that deserved to be raised in Parliament. There was particular
concern about coroners&#146; courts, where an inquest could be opened
that then adjourned for months, and even years. One case that was drawn
to our attention was adjourned for more than two years while police
inquiries and other investigations were carried out. I shall return to
the issue of delay.</p><p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="61101-0010.htm_para15"><a name="06110156000455">It
was put to us that the House authorities were repeatedly over-cautious
in the advice that they gave, and that as a consequence, Members were
finding that any hint of active court proceedings was enough to prevent
debate or questioning not only on the case itself, but also on related
issues of general policy. That is not the purpose of the rule, and
Members should not be given the impression that it is.</p><p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="61101-0010.htm_para16"><a name="06110156000456">As we pursued our inquiry, we
discovered a number of reasons why that impression had been created.
First, the rule is, in its entirety, subject to the discretion of the
Chair. Mr. Speaker has the power to set it aside if it is
his opinion that a particular case is of sufficient importance that
debate, or questions relating to it, should be allowed. Our predecessor
Committee recommended in its report that where Members believe the rule
to be unreasonably impeding the work of Parliament, they should refer
the matter to Mr. Speaker and ask him to exercise his
discretion.</p><p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="61101-0010.htm_para17"><a name="06110156000457">However,

Mr. Speaker to exercise his discretion. In particular, some
Members did not appreciate that the discretion

negotiated with Clerks in the Table Office. We have therefore
recommended that the Table Office should produce a short printed guide

of other aspects of the
rule.</p><p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="61101-0010.htm_para18"><a name="06110156000458">Secondly, the
House authorities have, perhaps, been somewhat over-cautious in their
advice on the implementation of the rule. That is because&#151;to be
fair to them, and to borrow the frank words of the former Clerk of the

reason, we have recommended that there should be a new Standing Order
that explicitly gives Mr. Speaker power to direct a Member
to resume his or her seat if he or she oversteps the agreed mark in

agrees to these proposals, I should expect to see fewer refusals to

the introduction of the Standing Order, the House will be establishing
a new and firmer base from which the Speaker will be able to exercise
his discretion, confident that he has both the power of the Standing
Order and the support of the House.</p><p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="61101-0010.htm_para25"><a name="06110156000469">We did consider whether the
rule itself was wrong or needed amendment, but like our predecessor
Committee, we concluded that the rule should stand, that there was no
need for a change to the wording of the resolution, and that
coroners&#146; courts should remain within the scope of the
House&#146;s sub judice rules. These conclusions are based, first, on
the risk of prejudice to specific cases or inquests, and, secondly, on
the ground of comity or non-interference with the
judiciary.</p><p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="61101-0010.htm_para26"><a name="06110156000470">The
Committee also considered in detail the issue of delay, which has been
a particular problem with coroners&#146; inquests. As I mentioned
earlier, an inquest can be opened and then adjourned for months or even
years. It is ironic that if a constituent is seriously injured it is
likely that the Member concerned will have no difficulty in raising the
issue in the House, but if that constituent is killed rather than
seriously injured, because the death results in an inquest, which is
likely to be opened and then adjourned, the matter instantly becomes
sub judice. We considered whether it would be practical to establish a
trigger point later than the opening of the inquest for the application
of the sub judice rule to coroners&#146; courts. I am afraid that in
the light of the evidence that we took&#151;including from the
Attorney-General&#151;we were forced to conclude that there is no
alternative point to which the trigger could be connected.</p><p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="61101-0010.htm_para27"><a name="06110156000471">We did, and I do, recognise
that these delays are very frustrating for Members. However, under the
Contempt Of Court Act 1981, the length of time between an alleged
contempt and the proceedings of the case itself is an important
criterion by which the extent of the contempt is judged. Although I do
not believe that that Act can or should be applied to proceedings in
this House, we do recommend in our report that Mr. Speaker
take particular account of the question of delay in considering whether

was looking into this matter, and particularly the very long delays
that often occur when inquests are adjourned. In referring to the draft
Coroners Bill, she said the
following:</p><a name="61101-0010.htm_brev3"><a name="06110156002417"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I
should like to draw your attention to one change of policy,
underpinning the draft Bill which may reduce the number of occasions
when the sub judice rule needs to be invoked. The Bill makes a
distinction between coroners&#146; duty to investigate and their duty
to hold an inquest. This distinction will mean that, in practice,
coroners will not, as they do now, routinely open and adjourn inquests
at the start of their inquiry into a death. Instead, when coroners
believe that a death falls into a category which they are obliged to
look into, they will begin an investigation. They will not, therefore,
open an inquest until later in the process when they are ready to
either hold a pre-inquest hearing or to hear the case in
full.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="61101-0010.htm_para29"><a name="06110156000473">That is very

will need to assess how this change will impact on the exemption that
coroner&#146;s cases receive from debate in Parliament under the sub

coroner&#146;s investigation and inquest would equate to the
distinction in the criminal justice system between a police
investigation and the commencement of court
proceedings.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="61101-0011.htm_para0"><a name="06110156000474">I hope that

extending the time for tabling amendments. If we can find a way of

to me all the responsibility for dealing with the then Leader of the
House on that issue; the Leader of the House at that time was the late
Robin Cook. Although in debate he obviously made the point about
holding the Government to account, Robin Cook's main concern&#151;in
fact, it was an irritant with him&#151;was that every year the press
had the headline, &#147;MPs away on a three-month holiday&#148;.
His argument to me was that, if we had a system where we came back for
two weeks, and the recess after that time was a constituency and
conference recess, the press would not be able to say that MPs had gone
away for three months&#146; holiday. Judged by that aspect of it, the

countries throughout the world? It is an important part of Parliament's
duty to be in touch with countries throughout the world. The work of
the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association and the British-American Parliamentary Group is very
important. The Whips in this House are less and less prepared to allow
people to go abroad unless there is total parity between the political
parties. That makes the work of those groups increasingly difficult. Is
that not something that should be taken into account when we consider
September sittings? A great many of those visits take place in

managers have a certain luxury, which I envy; I never had it. My hon.

just two of the motions before us: motion 6 on the communications
allowance and motion 7 on September sittings. Starting with the
communications allowance, I do not welcome that. On the contrary, I am
wholly opposed. I believe that it is a misuse of public money and I
intend to vote against it. Some of our discussion earlier this evening
has confused two issues. There are legitimate constituency issues, some
of which do require quite large-scale mailings. I have no problem with
that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="61101-0011.htm_para10"><a name="06110156000499">The other issue
is the recent growth in thinly disguised party propaganda paid for out
of the public purse, which I am wholly against. As I see it, the
purpose of the proposed allowance is to legitimise a practice whereby
Members increasingly spend public money, which is rightly made
available to us to provide a service for our constituents, on what
amounts to vanity publishing for the purposes that I described. It
consists usually of unsolicited glossy brochures, often in party
colours, advertising the good works of the Member concerned, who acts
as a sort of fairy godmother to his or her constituents. As I
mentioned, I have seen examples that contain 16 or even 20 photographs
of the Member concerned. The brochures are often indistinguishable from
party political propaganda, except that, if the Members concerned are
sensible&#151;and not all of them have been&#151;they take care not
to mention their party or to criticise their opponents. They are not
only printed but, often, distributed at public expense. We need only
consider the huge discrepancies in Members&#146; spending on postage
to recognise that there is a rabbit away somewhere. I read recently
that one Member would have to be sending out 680 letters a day to
justify his postage bill. It is hard to see how that could be
justified.</p><p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="61101-0011.htm_para11"><a name="06110156000500">Some such

between legitimate parliamentary activity, which can be funded out of
the IEP, and party political and campaigning activity, which cannot. I

both sides of the House, take a different attitude to the job from
those who have been here longer. Those of us elected in 1997 and
subsequently have more of a constituency focus in our work; we are much
more alive to the need to try to keep our constituents aware of what is
going on&#151;not just what we have been doing, but what is going on
in the House and also in our communities. They often cannot find such

a level playing field in relation to councillors. My constituency has a
Conservative council. Some six weeks before the last election, the
leader of the council wrote a letter to everyone on a council estate
that was undergoing regeneration attacking my position on the
regeneration scheme. I was not allowed to answer those attacks, because
that communication would have been unsolicited. It cannot be fair or
right that we are subject to more controls than the councillors in our
areas.</p><br>

Kevan Jones:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that this question
relates not only to councillors&#146; and council leaders&#146;
access to mailings but to the glossy magazines produced by some
councils, irrespective of their political persuasion, the cost of which
makes our proposals today seem quite
trifling?</p><p><a name="st_o302"><a name="06110156000578"><b><a name="61101-0013.htm_spnew9"><a name="06110156002897">Mr.
Dismore:</b> My hon. Friend is right. When I was leader of the
Labour group on Westminster city council 10 or 12 years ago, the then
leader, Lady Porter, had a communications budget of more than &#163;1
million for sending out glossy leaflets. Judging by what hon. Members
with London homes in Westminster see coming through their letterboxes,
I suspect that even more are now being sent out, at an even higher
budget. I am very concerned about that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="61101-0013.htm_para6"><a name="06110156000579">The same problems apply to
Scottish and Welsh Members because MSPs and AMs are not subject to any
restrictions. Countries such as France have no restrictions either.
Other parts of the world are much better at recognising that part of a
Member of Parliament&#146;s job is to communicate effectively with
their constituents. Whether the communications allowance will provide a
solution remains to be seen when the details are worked out. Obviously,
it will depend on how much it is. I shall certainly not use it for
glossy leaflets; I shall want to buy stamps with it. I hope that we
shall be able to introduce some common-sense rules. I agree with the
point made by other hon. Members that the present rules are unclear.
</p><p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="61101-0013.htm_para7"><a name="06110156000580">I also hope that we
shall be able to carry out surveys on important issues. The only time
that I have had a complaint against me sustained was when, a few years
ago, Transport for London wanted to widen the north circular road. It
held a consultation, which had a very short shelf life, but we then
found all its consultation leaflets dumped in a skip. On that occasion,
I felt justified in writing to my constituents who were directly
affected to ascertain their views. A Liberal Democrat councillor
objected to that and I had to pay the postage costs. I made no
objection to doing that, however. I felt that it had been the right
thing to do&#151;it is the kind of thing that we should be allowed to
do, whether using the communications allowance or by some other
means&#151;to ensure that those constituents&#146; views were heard
in time, given that the official consultation had gone so pear-shaped.
The answer to hon. Members on both sides of the House who do not want a
communications allowance is that they do not need to claim it if they
do not want to use it. However, those of us who do like to communicate
with our constituents should be permitted to do so.</p><p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="61101-0013.htm_para8"><a name="06110156000581">I do not favour September
sittings. September is an important time for us to communicate with and
meet our constituents. It is also a good time to visit schools. The
rest of the time that we are in recess, schools tend to be on holiday
or half-term holiday, which makes it difficult for us to visit them.
Once they have settled down after the start of term in September, it is
a good time to visit them to see whether there are any problems that
they would like us to take up.</p><p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="61101-0013.htm_para9"><a name="06110156000582">Also, the evenings are still
light in September. Those hon. Members who, like me, wish to call on
their constituents can do so for a couple of hours on a weekday evening
during September, but that is not a practical proposition in November,
for example.</p><br>

wrong. I have been here for some time, and my

expenses more than anything else that brings us into public disrepute,
which is a reason why the communications allowance should be stopped
quickly. The only comfort that I can take from the situation&#151;I
say this to the hon. Member for Hendon&#151;is that there is
considerable statistical evidence showing that such local efforts make
absolutely no difference to the election result whatsoever because the

Front-Bench spokesman today, although he could have covered the

Democrat Front-Bench spokesman yesterday, although he could have
covered the territory in 20 minutes. The shadow Foreign Secretary spoke
for 20 minutes yesterday, but the Liberal spokesman felt that he had to

that the dividing line is drawn much too far away from the

so that we can try to redefine the Speaker&#146;s discretion in the

it wrong on September sittings. I bought the argument, voiced by the
right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) earlier,
that the long summer recess gave the media a stick with which to beat
us. It was too long period for the Government to escape scrutiny.
However if we compare Parliament with other legislatures, we can see
how enthusiastic and conscientious we are. League tables are very much
in vogue, and I have with me one showing that, in 2005, the US Senate
sat for 159 days and the House of Representatives for 140 days; in
2004, the House of Representatives sat for 110 days, and the Senate for
133 days. In 2005, the House of Commons sat for 133 days in 2005 for
160 days in 2004&#151;the highest number of sitting days for any

is worth noting the efforts, or the lack of them, expended by the
German Bundesrat, which managed a princely 12 days in 2004 and 11 days
in 2005. The Bundestag, which is the lower House, managed 67 and 64
days respectively. We are not top of the league, as the Leader of the
House and I discussed earlier. Greek parliamentarians win the gold
medal, because in 2005, they managed to sit for 248 days, and for 110
days the previous year. I do not know what happened in Greek politics
between 2004 and 2005, but it took up an awful lot of parliamentary
time. Without boring the House with endless figures, out of all the
modern Parliaments, we not only sit for more days, but sit for longer
hours,
too.</p><p><a name="st_o330"><a name="06110156000638"><b><a name="61101-0014.htm_spnew5"><a name="06110156002925">Malcolm

analysing what we achieved during the September sittings in 2003 and
2004. That information is provided by the hon. Member for North Devon
(Nick Harvey), who answers on behalf of the House of Commons
Commission. Over the past three years, approximately &#163;17 million
was spent in each summer recess on works projects across both Houses of
Parliament, about &#163;10 million of which&#151;some 60 per
cent.&#151;was spent in the Commons. The cost of disrupting those
works has been estimated at an additional &#163;2.5 million for both
Houses, or &#163;1.5 million in the Commons. The experiment was not
without cost&#151;and did we achieve that much, apart from putting
through a ban on fox hunting and allowing people to invade the House of
Commons while we tried to operate in a building site? In 2003, the
House sat from Monday 8 September to Thursday 18 September&#151;a
total of eight sitting days. On two of those days&#151;25 per cent.
of the time&#151;there were no Divisions. On one of them&#151;a
Wednesday, when one would expect us all to be here&#151;the maximum
number of Members participating in the six Divisions that occurred was
346. That is not a great track record for the experiment of September
sittings.</p><p><a name="st_o336"><a name="06110156000652"><b><a name="61101-0014.htm_spnew11"><a name="06110156002931">Andrew

into the chasm of assuming that if Parliament sits there must be
legislation and Divisions. In my view, we could hold light sittings for
questions and statements in a Committee Room that did not need to be
reinstated because of ongoing works. That would enable Parliament to
undertake scrutiny and deliver accountability at low cost or no
cost.</p><p><a name="st_o337"><a name="06110156000653"><b><a name="61101-0014.htm_spnew12"><a name="06110156002932">Martin

unfortunately that option is not before us. As the Leader of the House
knows, there is a case for a more radical look at the parliamentary
year, and I hope that we will do that. The question before us today is
whether we return to the September sittings envisaged in the Cook
reforms, and I would say that there is a powerful case against that. I
could quote similar figures for 2004, but I will not detain the

between them to table 733 questions relating to every Department apart

for some time. My hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland,
South&#151;he is not present now, but I said that I would mention
this&#151;made some rather acerbic comments. I am not surprised,
because his views are known, and the figures show him to be one of the
lower users of the Members&#146; postage budget. He has been in this
place for a long time and I have huge respect for him, but those who
have been here for a long time should not so readily dismiss the
enthusiastic and conscientious way in which many Members elected from
1992 onwards have chosen to go about their business. There is no rule

best to represent our

postage budget is quite low this year; it has been higher in previous
years. I agree with much of what was said by the hon. Member for
Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Maples). There is no direct
correlation between the amount that a Member spends on postage and his
or her eventual electoral result. The fact remains, however, that huge
issues sometimes blow up in our constituencies. In an intervention
earlier, I mentioned the closure of Ashford hospital, which affects the
hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire). He presented a
petition with 25,000 signatures; the closure was a huge issue in his
constituency. Because there was no postage cap, he could legitimately
write to every one of the constituents who had presented him with the
petition.</p><p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="61101-0015.htm_para2"><a name="06110156000662">I too have
carried out mass mailings to petitioners on important subjects. It all
depends what is blowing up on the patch at any one time, but the fact
remains that if Mr. Speaker chooses&#151;as he has the
right to&#151;to impose a cap on our postage and establish a finite
budget, when problems explode in constituencies, Members on both sides
of the House will not have the wherewithal to do the job that they want
to do in the way they want to do

Hardly anyone would argue with that, but how on earth would we fund the
production of surgery cards and contact details if they were to be
distributed to every elector within our present budgets? As I said
earlier, many of us are topping up those budgets from our own
pockets.</p><p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="61101-0015.htm_para4"><a name="06110156000664">In June 2004,

with constituents on matters on which they themselves are statutory
consultees&#151;I have mentioned the closure of post

cannot have a total free-for-all on allowances. In my view, our
allowances are very generous. There is the office cost allowance and
the staffing allowance, which together total some &#163;108,000.
Moreover, we are allowed to rob Peter to pay Paul&#151;we can take
money out of our staffing allowance and put it into the office cost

provide an average sum of perhaps &#163;4,000 a year, on which most
of us could operate, give or take a little less or a little more. But
if we could not, we could always make up the difference from our office
cost allowance&#151;it is called managing a budget. We expect people
in the public sector and in the NHS to manage a budget, so it is quite

been a lot of debate about a number of issues this afternoon. I want to
say something about September sittings but first I want to draw
attention to some of the other aspects of the report of the
Modernisation Committee, on which I am privileged to serve. I want to
highlight the fact that, if we seize opportunities offered in that
report, there will be important consequences not just for the way in
which we carry out business in the House but for the way we relate to
the wider public, which is one of the themes that the Committee report
addressed. I want specifically to refer to the proposal for Standing
Committees in effect to be turned, in the normal course of matters,
into evidence-taking Committees. If that is done properly&#151;it has
to be done properly&#151; it could radically transform the way in
which this place operates for the better.</p><p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="61101-0015.htm_para24"><a name="06110156000688">Because of the location of my
constituency, obviously, I observe quite closely and read a lot in the
media about the workings of the Scottish Parliament. Like all
institutions, it has its good points and its bad points, but one of its
good points&#151;this is widely recognised&#151;is the effective
way in which its committees take evidence and have a direct impact on
the legislation that comes out at the end of the consideration process.
That results in better legislation. If we can get outside organisations
regularly expressing their views to Members of Parliament, we will have
a better chance of getting legislation changed before it becomes set in
stone by the Government, or by the intricacies of the political
process.</p><p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="61101-0015.htm_para25"><a name="06110156000689">In addition,
the opportunity to have a dialogue with organisations, groups and
society outside Parliament is an extremely important way of rebuilding
trust between the political process and the wider community, which we
all recognise that we have lost to a certain degree. Therefore, the
importance of the proposals for Standing Committees should not be
underestimated. However, it must be recognised that we have to adopt
those enthusiastically as a Chamber if we are to make the most of them.
As hon. Members have pointed out, the procedures to allow us to do that
have been there for many years and they have not been taken up, so it
is important that, as well as agreeing the proposals today, as it
appears we are likely to do, given that no one has spoken against them,
we put them enthusiastically into practice and do not allow them to
fall by the wayside.</p><p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="61101-0015.htm_para26"><a name="06110156000690">In that connection I have some
reservations about the consensus that appears to have developed that it
will be a member of the Chairmen&#146;s Panel who will chair the new
Special Standing Committees. I say that because there must be a danger
that, in some cases, the member who will be chosen to serve as the
Chair of a Special Standing Committee may not have any particular
expertise or interest in the subject matter of that Committee. It may
be that members will adopt that interest for that Committee, choose to
become heavily involved in its work and act in a proactive way, as
Select Committee Chairs often do. If not, in some cases, there would be
a danger that the Special

full enthusiastic support to the idea of September sittings, although

Government to account, to scrutinise the work of Government and to
raise the important issues of the day, if we think that it is
necessary. This summer is a case in point. We did not have a recall of
Parliament, although many of us wanted one. There was every reason to
have a recall, because there were important issues to
address&#151;not least what was happening in the middle
east&#151;and many of our constituents asked us to raise their
concerns. My constituents were taken aback when I replied that I could
write to Ministers and ask for a recall, or write articles for
newspapers, but I could not do much more in exercising my duties as a

keep in touch, but what if one is not in that fortunate situation?
During the summer recess, one is way out of touch with what is going on
in the centres of power. We are not always in touch when we are here in
the House, but we have more chance to take part in the more nebulous
type of policy debate and holding the Government to account if we are

more weeks, instead of a situation in which for three months of the
year we are hardly in Parliament and for eight months&#151;apart from
weekends&#151;we are hardly in our constituencies. It would be good
to have a better mix between being in Parliament and being in our

noted several times today, the widely observed problem of disconnect
between Parliament and the public might be a contributory factor to
lower turnouts at elections. The Hansard Society published a report
that challenged Parliament to up its game in its relations with the
public. We have started to do that. Our Select Committees, and the
House itself, employ press officers to explain our work to the public.
More outreach officers go into constituencies and local education
authorities to explain the work of Parliament. The education unit has
expanded its programme of school visits and produced new films about
our work, while its work books are part of the national curriculum. In
addition, a major overhaul of the parliamentary website is under way,

Hansard Society note that when the public are asked what they think
about MPs in general they have rather a derogatory view, but they
usually take quite a benign view of their own MP. There is a challenge
for MPs to take more of a role in their constituencies in explaining
their own work and the work of the House. There is nothing illegitimate
in an MP making a report, in non-partisan terms, about what the MP is
doing and about what Parliament is doing.</p><p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="61101-0016.htm_para11"><a name="06110156000718">The existing arrangements are
profoundly unsatisfactory, however. As the House knows, during this
Session I have been serving on both the Members Estimate Committee and
the Committee on Standards and Privileges, so I have seen the issue
from both ends. Concerns about the current arrangements have been
knocking around for a long time&#151;certainly longer than I have
been involved&#151;and it has taken two or three years for a
constructive proposal to be put on the table. We have one before us
today, in the shape of the recommendation from the Leader of the House

issue.</p><p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="61101-0016.htm_para12"><a name="06110156000719">Members have
already touched on the anomalies in the existing regulations. I will
start with pre-paid post and House stationery, to which Members have
unlimited access at present. In the year running up to the election, we
reached a ridiculous situation: Members&#146; average spend on those
two items put together was about &#163;3,500, but in one or two cases
there were some outrageous expenditure totals, one of which stretched
to more than &#163;50,000. The system cannot be working properly when
some Members, seemingly within the regulations, can spend up to 15
times the average. Clearly, that has to be
addressed.</p><p><a name="st_o357"><a name="06110156000720"><b><a name="61101-0016.htm_spnew4"><a name="06110156002952">Mr.

money for Members of Parliament, when it is actually an initiative that
would put a cap on irresponsible
behaviour.</p><p><a name="st_o358"><a name="06110156000721"><b><a name="61101-0016.htm_spnew5"><a name="06110156002953">Nick

regarding envelopes and stationery is curious, as Members have already
observed. The rules say, in principle, that Members are not supposed to
use those facilities to send out unsolicited mailings. The Committee on
Standards and Privileges, the Serjeant at Arms and the commissioner
found some difficulty&#151;I choose my words carefully&#151;in
picking their way through the regulation. It is absurd that if a post
office was due to close in a village of 100 houses in a Member&#146;s
constituency, he or she could not write about the closure to the 200
residents who live in those houses&#151;yet if the Member received a
petition on the future of the planet signed by 30,000 people, it would

Whatever else happens, if we leave in place a system that allows
unlimited use of post and stationery, we need far clearer and more
definite rules than we have at present. If anything, the rules are
rather over-prescriptive; I should prefer a more sensible regime, but
with a clear cap on the expenditure. We cannot have our cake and eat

and similar communications sent out by Members that can be funded by
the IEP, where there are also some strange rules. For example, the
content of those reports is rightly supposed to be non-partisan, but if
we include a direct quote of something said in Parliament, it becomes
possible to refer to our own speeches in Westminster Hall, during which
the most scandalously partisan points may have been raised. Such
comments could be passported straight into the report with no
infringement of the rules. That is clearly absolute nonsense, which
makes a complete mockery of the system, and it needs to be tightened
up.</p><p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="61101-0016.htm_para15"><a name="06110156000724">The motion before
the House invites us to consider the communications allowance and the
Members Estimate Committee is invited to bring forward regulations that
would allow us to address all the anomalies to which I have referred.
Some have asked why we need a communications allowance and why we are
not simply allowed greater use of envelopes and stationery. For one
thing, that is an incredibly expensive way for MPs to take proactive
communication out to the constituency. Each item sent will incur the
full postage rate whereas there are, as hon. Members will know, much
more economically viable ways of communicating with large numbers of
people. Rather than use ordinary postage of the Royal Mail, it is far
better to have a communications allowance through which Members can use
their own ingenuity and ability to manage a budget&#151;to refer back
to an earlier point&#151;in order to get the best solution that best
suits the communications that they want within the rules that are
rightly understood as necessary to exclude party political
purposes.</p><p><a name="st_o359"><a name="06110156000725"><b><a name="61101-0016.htm_spnew6"><a name="06110156002954">Andrew
Mackinlay:</b> It is the ingenuity point that worries me
because it leaves great scope for misunderstanding and avoidance. The
US Congress allows mailings, but they are all in the same format. If we
are to go down this road, we should opt for parity of treatment,
similar format and minimal scope for innovation. We should all have the
same degree of communication.</p><p><a name="st_o360"><a name="06110156000726"><b><a name="61101-0016.htm_spnew7"><a name="06110156002955">Nick
Harvey:</b> I certainly agree with the objective of trying to
put Members on an equal footing. As I have said, it cannot be right
that some are spending 15 times more public money than average on
communications. We could go down the route of having a precisely equal
format, but I do not welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestion of
trying to stamp out innovation. In the modern era, there are many
different ways of communicating and there could be generation gaps
between different Members in how they proceed. We need a certain amount
of flexibility. The motion calls for the rules to be worked out, so it
would be perfectly in order for the hon. Gentleman to make his
recommendations to the Committee.</p><br>

regulations to accompany the allowance. The right hon. Lady will have a

much we are costing them. One figure that my hon. Friend did not
provide was the cost of the two-day emergency recall in September 1998,
which was estimated to be &#163;375,000 in work costs. There were
other staff costs, mainly for security and some overtime, which
amounted to &#163;33,200. That was for an emergency recall, the
reasons for which we all understand. However, having a September

into the Chamber, the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas
Winterton) was making an intervention about foreign trips in September.
I had the honour, through the Inter-Parliamentary Union, of leading a
parliamentary delegation to Algeria in September. It was the first
delegation of its kind, and it had the blessing of the President of
Algeria and our Prime Minister. It was an important trip for the
purposes of opening up our democracy to the democracy of Algeria, a
strategic partner in the Mediterranean and in Africa. It would have
been a tremendous blow if that delegation had not been allowed to go
ahead because of a September sitting. When we were in Algeria, we were
told that a Minister of the Crown was due to visit the country in
October and that people were looking forward to that visit. However,
there was some hesitation about whether it would go ahead because the

their parliamentary reporters. They no longer have a parliamentary

about the various allowances and expenses&#151;I should say

Minister at the Dispatch Box. Not once were Ministers able to make
statements in the House before Members could quiz them over their

100 or so written ministerial statements that were rushed out just

clear in the House on several occasions my views in favour of September
sittings. However, I am not suggesting that the House sits for two
weeks in September and then reconvenes in October after the conference

as to why it would be impossible to begin the parliamentary term in
September, and a deal of opposition has been expressed. Let us consider
the objections. As a recent parliamentary answer by the hon. Member for
North Devon (Nick Harvey) suggests, the building works programme is
planned to fit in with the expected parliamentary timetable, and by
changing the timetable it would cost more because building works would
have to be carried out in a shorter space of time. What a ridiculous
excuse to use. There is no reason why works could not be planned around
a new parliamentary timetable. I refuse to believe that that would cost
taxpayers more money in the long run. Quite the reverse&#151;if
during September we were to properly scrutinise the Executive and
Government Departments, we could perhaps save taxpayers millions upon
millions of pounds. Are we really saying that building works should
determine when the mother of Parliaments

assumption always was that if at some time September sittings were to

I do not buy the excuse that parliamentary sittings in September would

no new legislation would be introduced.</p><p><a name="st_o373"><a name="06110156000763"><b><a name="61101-0017.htm_spnew7"><a name="06110156002968">Mr.

account.</p><p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="61101-0017.htm_para12"><a name="06110156000765">Secondly, and
most importantly, it is not the case that a Member of Parliament can
either be in his constituency or attend Parliament&#151;it is the
role of Members to do both. It is not the case that, when Parliament is
sitting, hon. Members do not visit their constituencies. When
Parliament is sitting, I am not prevented from seeing constituents,
holding weekly advice surgeries, or continuing with my rolling survey
of constituents through my &#147;Listening to Wellingborough and
Rushden&#148; campaign. I attend meetings, events and functions, yet
I am still present in Parliament for questions, debates and Divisions.
The situation would be no different if Parliament met in September. If
Members wished to remain in their constituencies for the whole of
September, there would be nothing to prevent them from doing so, but
September sittings would give Members who wanted it parliamentary time
for genuine debate and scrutiny. September sittings would allow us to
fulfil both of our major roles as Members of Parliament. If Parliament
reconvenes in September, we will have a real opportunity to be
innovative in how we use the parliamentary

attempt to answer the questions that I put to them, and some responses
were incorrect. I have expressed concern about such problems many times

times in the House&#151;I shall continue to use it until a member of
the Government admits misleading the House&#151;since November 2005,

doing the job how they want to see it done. The public interest and

said that I had heard comments from public and private agencies in
Scotland&#151;British organisations that deal with both the Scottish
Parliament and Westminster, and can make comparisons. They have
concluded that the way in which legislation is handled in Scotland,
whether or not it involves a partnership or shared responsibility
between Westminster and the Scottish Parliament, is much more efficient
and effective and that the quality of the legislation is much higher.
That is not because the calibre of the political animal in Scotland is
necessarily better, but because the process ensures that evidence is
taken and that committees help to shape legislation through their
deliberations. Problems of the kind that we have here, whereby
legislation is ill prepared and there are lots of late Government
amendments, do not happen to anything like the same extent. The Leader
of the House&#146;s proposal seems to give us a much better chance of
achieving that quality, which would benefit the House, outside agencies
wishing to influence legislation, and, ultimately, the Government, who
will end up with better laws.</p><p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="61101-0018.htm_para3"><a name="06110156000791">There is a demarcation dispute

The hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow), who is not in his place,
declared his interest as a member of the Speaker&#146;s Panel. I am
surprised that relatively few members of the Liaison Committee have
taken part in the debate, because they said at a meeting last week that
they were somewhat unhappy with some of the proposals, and I would have
thought that some might come here to say so. The process of taking
evidence is different from that of deliberating on a Bill. It is no

Indeed, an amendment of a somewhat similar character stands in my name.
It is worth recalling that before the introduction of September
sittings, the House was recalled during the summer recess in 1992,
1998, 2001 and 2002. In 2003, when the right hon. Member for Neath

in, week out, except for 13 weeks when it does not go on at all. I
think that most people understand that there is a period in August when
hardly any other Parliament in the world sits, other than in extremis.
As the then Leader of the House said, Members can hold back for a few
weeks if we know that the House is going to be sitting and that we can
marshal our arguments before we make our case. It is not credible to
suggest that we can do the job that we are elected to do effectively
when the House does not sit for 13 weeks at a time. Frankly, I found
some of the contrary arguments breathtakingly
unbelievable.</p><p><a name="st_o389"><a name="06110156000797"><b><a name="61101-0018.htm_spnew2"><a name="06110156002984">Mark

The hon. Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter) is not present, and I
am not being ironic when I refer to the proposition that we only turn
up here when there is a Division and the Whips require us to do so. It
is true that there may well be occasions when only 30 or 40 of the 645
Members feel the need to be here, but the fact is that every Member has
the opportunity to be here. Ministers have to be here, the exchange of
information is here, and the public can observe what is going on and
what is being said. That is what matters. Each of us&#151;all 645
Members&#151;must account to our constituents for where we were and
why we were there, and I think most of us are big enough and ugly
enough to be able to handle that reasonably competently. I believe that

vote for the motion, she hoped that we would revisit it. I heard what
the Leader of the House had to say, but my honest view is that if the
House votes for his motion, that is the last we shall hear of it until
pressure and embarrassment build up again, and the House comes to its
senses and concludes that not sitting for 12 or 13 weeks is an
unacceptable way in which to conduct our business in modern times. I
believe that the Leader of the House, who used to be in favour of

have expressed the view that our September sittings were not very

recall, well known that many Ministers did not really approve of them,
feeling that they were a nuisance and a pain. The Government business
managers, of course, control what goes into those two weeks. It is very
easy to look back and say that it was not very much, but there were
Second Reading debates and Report stages. There was legislative
progress, which may have reduced the ping-pong pressure at the end of
the parliamentary year.</p><p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="61101-0018.htm_para12"><a name="06110156000804">In an intervention, the hon.

business, the pattern of sittings, and how business can be managed
effectively. I think that those who say, &#147;The September sittings
did not work very well and we should revert to the status quo

sittings in a better and more effective way.</p><br>

should be surprised when I mention it now; nor is it the main part of
my argument. But we have had debates, on which the whole modernisation
process hinged, about making the House a family-friendly institution.
That &#147;family-friendly&#148; institution was designed mostly
for London Members. I am not saying that it is perfect for them, but if
the House rises at about 7.30&#151;as it will
tonight&#151;presumably they can be at home with their families by 8
pm, and even earlier on Thursdays. Indeed, they can nip home between
votes on Mondays and Tuesdays, unless there is a running whip. This is
not special pleading from a Scottish Member. Any Member whose
constituency is significantly out of town will be either in London or
in the constituency, not running between the two&#151;with the
possible exception of the hon. Member for Falkirk (Mr.
Joyce).</p><p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="61101-0018.htm_para14"><a name="06110156000806">The serious
issue is to do with the fact that most people come to Parliament for
the three or four days in the week that the House is sitting to conduct
their parliamentary business and they then leave, and squash in
whatever they can in terms of consultations and visits in their
constituencies, which they get back to on Thursday night if they are
lucky, although in some cases not until Friday morning. The hon. Member
for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) again made some
sensible suggestions on whether we could have shorter weeks, but more
of them, to allow for a better balance; that might work. But the House
needs to take on board the fact that we are in danger of completely
ignoring the family considerations of out-of-town Members, in terms of
considerations such as school
holidays.</p><p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="61101-0018.htm_para15"><a name="06110156000807">On a
personal basis, when I analysed the situation as of two years ago, I
found that the only times when my children and I were off together were
Christmas and the first two weeks of August; there was no other time
when the children were off and the House was not sitting. I am not
suggesting that we can accommodate all variations to do with school
holidays, given that they are changing. But I got the impression that
almost every Member liked the idea of rising earlier in
July&#151;that that suited most of us, throughout the United Kingdom.
That is the case not least because in recent years we have found that
the hottest and most uncomfortable weeks tend to be the last two weeks
in July, and the Leader of the House will know that not only is the
weather at that time uncomfortable, but it makes life worse for him, as
hot and bad-tempered Members who wish they were with their families or
abroad are not the most compliant and helpful of
legislators.</p><p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="61101-0018.htm_para16"><a name="06110156000808">The
original proposal was that we rise earlier in July and go back in
September. I completely agree with those Members who have suggested
that having a two-week sitting in September and then another break for
several weeks does not work. That is why, although I am happy to
support the amendment of the hon. Member for Walsall, North
(Mr. Winnick), my amendment suggested that we required
further consultation to try to work out a pattern and balance of
sittings of the House that meets the various considerations. I wrote to
the Leader of the House on this matter, and he courteously wrote back
acknowledging the content of my letter, and I honestly thought that
that was what he was engaged in&#151;that he

long recesses for the foreseeable future, or until such time as a head
of steam for change builds up again&#151;and anybody who has been a

stage, I plead with the Leader of the House to go further than he has
done in this debate. On the basis of the way that the vote is likely to
go, he should say to the House that he takes on board the idea that we
must think hard about how we manage the business process during the
year, that he acknowledges that a 12-week recess without a break is not
acceptable, and that he genuinely intends to consult more widely to see
whether we can come up with a way of working that meets the needs of
the House itself, our constituents, Members&#146; families and the
effective working of our democracy. If he does that, he will be
welcomed as a Leader who is engaging the House in good faith. But my
gut feeling is that the Government never liked the September sittings,
and that they want to bury them once and for all. That would be an
extremely regrettable
development.</p><p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="61101-0018.htm_para19"><a name="06110156000811">Debates

Members who vote will not have listened to the debate. But the Leader
of the House has listened to the debate, and I give him credit for
having been here for a very substantial part of it. I hope that he will
take seriously the representations that have been made. If we simply
abandon September sittings, or any reform of the pattern of sittings of

the source of the hon. Lady&#146;s major complaint, in cases where an
inquest is

Keeble:</b> I was going to deal with that as one of the three
points. I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for drawing attention
to the matter.</p><p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="61101-0018.htm_para26"><a name="06110156000822">First,
it is important that there be clarification about issues of national
importance. The case that my right hon. Friend the Member for
Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) raised was of national
importance; it was about security. The case that I brought was about
the death of a boy. The death of a boy in a secure training centre is
an enormous tragedy. In this case, it had implications for the types of
holds that are used for such children in secure training centres up and
down the country. They had to make changes, and there are still
outstanding issues. Therefore, it was of national importance in that it
affected national policy on secure training centres.</p><p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="61101-0018.htm_para27"><a name="06110156000823">The death of a boy in the
custody of the state is sufficiently important for the Home Office to
be called to account on the Floor of the House to explain why that
happened and what was being done to put it right. Therefore, the
definition of &#147;issues of national importance&#148; must be
clearly spelled out. It must be clearly spelled out why the death of a
14-year-old boy in custody may not be regarded as an issue of national
importance. In the interim, there has been a complaint to me that
another boy was substantially injured while he was being held in
restraint in a secure training centre, so there was a similar episode,
albeit that the outcome was different.</p><p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="61101-0018.htm_para28"><a name="06110156000824">The second point is about the
guidance to Mr. Speaker. There has been much discussion
about the difference between our sub judice rule here and the sub
judice rule that applies to the media. One of the big things with the
media is that they break the rule first and are then tried for
contempt, but here if we ask in advance whether we can raise something
and we are told no, that is the end of the matter. There are no means
of effective challenge. I ask my right hon. Friend the Leader of the
House to answer that point. He may want to set out exactly how he
envisages the guidance being applied.</p><p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="61101-0018.htm_para29"><a name="06110156000825">The third point was raised by
the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight), and
is about the letter from the Minister of State, Department for
Constitutional Affairs about the changes to coroners courts, which are
going to have investigations, instead of opening and adjourning
inquests. We need to know when that is going to happen, and to be clear
exactly how that will interrelate with the sub judice rule as we apply
it to ourselves. It has to be made clear that the coroners are going to
be consistent in what they do, and that we are going to be consistent,
in that we are going to regard investigations as not being judicial
legal proceedings.</p>

case about which I was concerned is not going to be until next

colleagues in their office about that case, to do work with the media

has covered the ground comprehensively, and it is striking that one of
the consistent themes expressed on both sides of the House is that
Members are anxious better to serve their constituents.</p><p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="61101-0019.htm_para2"><a name="06110156000829">I want to make two points, not
least to the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) and
others. I do not think that he was in his place when I opened my
remarks&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>If he was, I apologise. In my
opening remarks, I was spelling out factual evidence suggesting that
the House has become more effective, not less, in scrutinising the work
of Ministers. I do not dispute that we still have a long way to go. The
27 years that I have been in the House, however, have seen the crucial
introduction of departmental Select Committees by the then Leader of
the House, Norman St. John-Stevas, in the 1979-80 Session, and their
considerable strengthening over the years. We have seen the
introduction of Westminster Hall. In relation to the intelligence and
security agencies, of which not only was no parliamentary scrutiny
allowed but Governments&#146; official position was not to aver their
existence, we now have the Intelligence and Security Committee.
Legislative changes that we have made, such as the Modernisation
Committee agenda but also the Human Rights Act 1998 and Freedom of
Information Act 2000, have opened up government to an extent undreamt
of a generation or so ago.</p><p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="61101-0019.htm_para3"><a name="06110156000830">My second point is on the issue
of trust and the media. If we go outside and ask people whom they most
and least trust, the most trusted include ministers of religion,
doctors, teachers and nurses. Competing at the bottom for the wooden
spoon, depending on which day one asks such questions, are estate
agents, journalists and politicians, with a special place reserved for
those estate agents who are also journalists and politicians.
Generally, we get low scores. But if we ask members of the public to
say what they think about their own Member of Parliament, or a Member
of Parliament they reckon they know, the scores rise rapidly. If they
not only know their Member of Parliament but have respect for them, the
scores are high and, these days, rising. I see part of my task as
Leader of the House to increase those scores for everybody, in order
better to facilitate the work of Members.</p><p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="61101-0019.htm_para4"><a name="06110156000831">Let me deal with the main
issues in turn. I am grateful to the House, and I know that all members

the changes proposed to the way in which Bills are scrutinised in
Committee, and for the changes proposed for greater flexibility on
Report. As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr.
Heath) has pointed out, Report has been up to now among the most
important stages. We want Committee to be of equal importance.
Additional scrutiny in Committee, provided that we introduce it
carefully with improved resources available and commitments on all
sides, should help to achieve that. I also commend my hon. Friend the
Member for Brent, South (Ms Butler) who, in relation to the use of
technology, has been committed to trying to bring the House into the
21st century at the beginning rather than the middle or end of the
century. She has not only made important points but proposals that have
fed their way into pages 32 and 33 of the report.</p><p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="61101-0019.htm_para5"><a name="06110156000832">On the communications
allowance, it is fair to say that the principle of it has received
general but certainly not universal support. I emphasise, however, that
if colleagues read the motion, they will see that it asks them to
welcome the principle of the proposal without committing themselves at
this stage to its final introduction, which will have to await the
recommendations of the Members Estimate Committee. The matter will then
come back to the House. Of course, the Members Estimate
Committee&#151;the Commission under a different title&#151;will
take full account of the observations made. The right hon. Member for
Maidenhead (Mrs. May) raised the issue of whether there
should be one allowance or two, and it depends how we construct the
rules.</p><p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="61101-0019.htm_para6"><a name="06110156000833">To pick up a
point made by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr.
Pelling), the one thing that is certain is that once the allowance is
introduced, there will be caps on spending on communication, both on
stationery and envelopes and on wider communications. Whether we have
one allowance or two, the aggregate amount will be less than the sums
currently being spent by some hon. Members on both sides. This should
not be seen as Members having the chance to spend even more money: it
should be seen as a way of responding to the changing expectations and
increasing demands of constituents. It is also a way to improve
probity, rather than undermine
it.</p><p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="61101-0019.htm_para7"><a name="06110156000834">The right hon.
Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) formerly opposed the
proposal, but when he reads his speech in <i> Hansard</i> tomorrow I
hope that he will see that he made a very good case for change, and the
introduction of a rules-based communications allowance. That was the
gravamen of our
report.</p><p><a name="st_o398"><a name="06110156000835"><b><a name="61101-0019.htm_spnew1"><a name="06110156002993">Mr.

envelopes.</p><p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="61101-0019.htm_para8"><a name="06110156000837">The third
matter is that of September sittings. The right hon. Member for Gordon
(Malcolm Bruce) is right. When the proposal was made originally, in
2002, I was strongly in favour of them, as a member of the Government
who had been in the hot seat, in different jobs, for several summers.
In 1998, a recall was requested because of the Omagh bombing, and I was
Home Secretary. In 2001, the recall was for 9/11 and I was Foreign
Secretary, as I was in 2002, when it was for Iraq. My view was that
given that we had calls for a recall every summer&#151;and we
responded to three out of six of those calls between 1997 and
2002&#151;it was better to schedule sittings in September, instead of
having to respond to a silly season summer story. In retrospect, the
judgments look straightforward, but they were quite difficult at the
time, and had to be made in consultation with the Leader of the
Opposition and with you, Mr.
Speaker.</p><p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="61101-0019.htm_para9"><a name="06110156000838">The second
reason I supported September sittings was that, like many others, I had
been embarrassed by the charge that we were away for 11 weeks and the
ridiculous notion that we were all sunning ourselves in warmer climes
for almost all that time&#151;and if we were not abroad, we were in
our gardens. That is nonsense, and every journalist knows it. Whatever
other criticism there may be of Members of Parliament, the charge that
we are slacking and not doing our work is not one that can be made. All
the evidence shows&#151;it is there to be published&#151;that MPs
work very hard for very long hours. There may be an issue with how
productively we work, but there is no doubt about how hard we work.
There is also no doubt that the demands on us have risen exponentially.
Overall, therefore, I used to think that it was better for us to come
back.</p><p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="61101-0019.htm_para10"><a name="06110156000839">My hon. Friend
the Member for Brent, South spoke about evidence, but we have to rely
on our own experience. In 2005, as I said, we could not have sittings
here because of the installation of the security screen. Leaving that
aside, most hon. Members to whom I have spoken believe that, on
balance, the experience of September sittings has not worked as
intended.</p><p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="61101-0019.htm_para11"><a name="06110156000840">The hon.
Member for Wellingborough said that we can dismiss the costs involved,
and he is right, but they need to be weighed in the balance. It is not
an overriding argument to say that it may cost anything up to
&#163;12 million to interrupt the progress of major maintenance work
for two or three weeks, but it is certainly a factor that needs to be
considered.</p><p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="61101-0019.htm_para12"><a name="06110156000841">I
listened to the speech of the right hon. Member for Gordon with great
care, and I agree that we should take account of the Scottish
Parliament&#146;s experience. Recently, I met a delegation from that
body&#146;s equivalent of our Procedure Committee and we talked about
how that Parliament progressed legislation. We need to share best
practice with all comparable Parliaments, and especially those in the
UK, and we also need to take account of what they do in September. In
the end, though, we must make our own decisions about what is
suitable.</p><p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="61101-0019.htm_para13"><a name="06110156000842">Neither the

the Labour party and then the Conservative party. Were it not for those
conferences, it would be relatively simple for us to come back in
September, and stay back. However, they remain a
difficulty.</p><p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="61101-0019.htm_para14"><a name="06110156000843">Meanwhile,
I hope that the discussions taking place will make progress in
determining whether the party conferences, which are very expensive for
all the parties, can be held at different times of the year. The Labour
party conference used to meet at other dates, so September is not set
in stone. However, changing dates would take a long time to achieve, as
conference venues are booked for years ahead. Following the
recommendation from the previous Modernisation Committee, I have
introduced having written questions and written ministerial statements
in September. If the House approves it, the relevant motion before us
will strengthen that system for the future.</p><p><a name="st_o400"><a name="06110156000844"><b><a name="61101-0019.htm_spnew3"><a name="06110156002995">Robert

increasing regularity with which Select Committees meet and produce

the UK. That was not done in previous years. September gives Select
Committees a clear run to do serious

hours.</p><p><a name="st_o402"><a name="06110156000846"><b><a name="61101-0019.htm_spnew5"><a name="06110156002997">Mr.

periods than other Parliaments. We probably sit for as long, or longer.
The crux of the matter for the House to decide tonight&#151;and it
seems that those of us who favour September sittings are in the
minority&#151;is that we should not be away on what is called a
recess for 12 weeks, or a quarter of the year. In my view, and in the
view of those who agree with me, that is totally
unacceptable.</p><p><a name="st_o403"><a name="06110156000847"><b><a name="61101-0019.htm_spnew6"><a name="06110156002998">Mr.
Straw:</b> I understand that that is the crux of the matter,
and it is why I strongly supported September sittings when they were
first proposed. However, they did not work out as intended. Other
factors have intervened, including the party conferences. Furthermore,
I was determined that the House should decide the matter on a free vote
and that it should not be imposed by the Government, so I hope that my
hon. Friend will concede that point. It is important to establish that
principle. I promise that before the end of this Parliament the
Modernisation Committee will review progress and the further experience
of not sitting in September and will make any further recommendations
that it deems fit.</p><p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="61101-0019.htm_para15"><a name="06110156000848">Two

Straw:</b> Yes is my answer to that intervention. The right
hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) makes a point
about the importance of interventions on Ministers. I spent many happy
hours when in opposition, sitting on the Back Benches waiting to be
called to speak in debates, and I always used to think that three
minutes was better than no minutes. She may not agree and there may
well have been people on the other side who thought that no minutes

three!</p><p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="61101-0019.htm_para20"><a name="06110156000861">I commend all

agrees that this be achieved by Standing Orders through the programming
process, with such committees having freedom to decide how many
evidence sessions should be held; agrees that the notice period for
amendments to bills to be selected for debate in standing committee
should, subject to the discretion of the Chair, be extended from two
days to three days; supports the renaming of the various kinds of
standing committee along the lines proposed by the Committee; and

Gisela Stuart (Birmingham, Edgbaston) (Lab):</b> I should
first declare an interest in the matter. The concerns that I am
addressing tonight are the concerns not just of my constituents in
Birmingham, Edgbaston but of the constituents of all Birmingham MPs: my
hon. Friends the Members for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr.
Simon), for Birmingham, Hall Green (Steve McCabe), for Birmingham,
Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne), my right hon. Friend the Member for
Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short), my hon. Friends the Members for
Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden), for Birmingham, Perry Barr
(Mr. Mahmood), for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones), and
for Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath (Mr. Godsiff),
and the hon. Members for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming) and for
Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell). They are either here in the
Chamber or have pressing business that prevents them from being here,
but they are in agreement. Also in agreement is the Birmingham gateway
consortium, which includes Network Rail, Birmingham city council,
Advantage West Midlands and Centro passenger transport
executive.</p><p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="61101-0022.htm_para6"><a name="06110156002364">For those
members who are lucky enough not to be as familiar with New Street
station as we are in the west midlands, I should perhaps paint a
picture of the station, past and present. New Street station was opened
in 1854 and was one of the first major transport hubs in the west
midlands.</p><p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="61101-0022.htm_para7"><a name="06110156002365">The station
has since undergone a variety of transformations, and was entirely
rebuilt in 1967. It became the first in the country to make a
commercial venture out of the air space above it. That is common now,
but at that time building on top of the station and using that space
for shops was unique. The decision to capitalise on that valuable
strategic area was a commercially astute one, which served to off-set
the cost of redeveloping the station. New Street was in fact something
of a flash of modernity, featuring a range of characteristics that were
both intriguing and
ingenious.</p><p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="61101-0022.htm_para8"><a name="06110156002366">Forty years
on, the parts of the station that once felt impressive now seem rather
more dated. It is a station that, to pick up on a common phrase these
days, is no longer fit for purpose.</p><p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="61101-0022.htm_para9"><a name="06110156002367">New Street station handles more
people than Gatwick airport, and there are more trains through the
station than planes through Heathrow each day. Congestion at the
station has become a serious concern and staff have had to close it on
several occasions in the past few years as a result of
overcrowding.</p><p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="61101-0022.htm_para10"><a name="06110156002368">Nor is
it a problem that will go away. The recent west midlands rail capacity
review, which examined rail capacity requirements in the context of
proposals for the redevelopment of New Street station, highlighted a
number of key points. It showed that passenger numbers are growing
fast, with a further 50 per cent. growth forecast by 2026; that New
Street station will remain the hub for local and regional services; and
that the network can accommodate significant passenger growth&#151;up
to 120 per cent. on regional and suburban 
<br>

<meta name="Date" content="1 Nov 2006">

<notus-date day="1" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>1 Nov 2006 : Column 425</b><br>lines and perhaps over 144 per cent. on long-distance
services&#151;but the station itself cannot cope with the forecast
demand.</p><p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="61101-0022.htm_para11"><a name="06110156002369">To give
Members some indication of the numbers involved, during the peak
three-hour period, around 40,000 people go through the station. That
rises to more than 120,000 over the day as a whole. Those numbers are
based on 2003 figures. In short, more passenger capacity is desperately
needed at New Street.
</p><p><a name="st_o414"><a name="06110156002370"><b><a name="61101-0022.htm_spnew2"><a name="06110156004482">Richard
Burden (Birmingham, Northfield) (Lab):</b> As my hon. Friend
says, her comments have the support of all Birmingham Members. Would
she emphasise, however, that the renewal of New Street station is not
just a local or even regional issue but of strategic significance to
the national railway network?</p><p><a name="st_o415"><a name="06110156002371"><b><a name="61101-0022.htm_spnew3"><a name="06110156004483">Ms
Stuart:</b> My hon. Friend is correct. The station handles
about 80 per cent. of daily services to Birmingham, including
long-distance trains from Euston to the north, services from the south
and south-west of Scotland, Newcastle, Manchester and Liverpool, and
east-west services to East Anglia and through central Wales. Only
recently, we found out that yet more services will terminate at New
Street. Birmingham New Street is therefore an essential hub for both
long-distance travel and shorter journeys throughout the UK. Its
significance should therefore be considered within the wider context of
the Government&#146;s strategy for the future of inter-city rail
travel.</p><p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="61101-0022.htm_para12"><a name="06110156002372">The problem
is not simply one of capacity. The Government have a clear target to
reduce the environmental impact of transport. Trains create far less
carbon dioxide than road or air transport for every passenger that they
carry or tonnes of freight that they move. By rail, the average
passenger generates 49g of CO2 per km, against 109g by car
and 180g on a domestic short-haul flight. We must therefore create the
opportunity for the modal shift away from cars and planes to trains.
The recently published Stern report highlights the national economic
necessity of getting those decisions right now.</p><p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="61101-0022.htm_para13"><a name="06110156002373">Moreover, transport
infrastructure is one of the key factors that determines the success or
otherwise of a region&#146;s economy. According to the west midlands
transport partnership, the business community believes that congestion
in the west midlands is currently costing our local economy &#163;2.2
billion a year. Government funding of &#163;350 million is a small
percentage of that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="61101-0022.htm_para14"><a name="06110156002374">The restraint on the west
midlands because of inadequacies at New Street station is simply not
sustainable in the long term. I know from the experience of businesses
in my constituency and in the surrounding west midlands area that New
Street station no longer provides the sort of entrance that
Britain&#146;s second city and the region
deserve.</p><p><a name="st_o416"><a name="06110156002375"><b><a name="61101-0022.htm_spnew4"><a name="06110156004484">Mr.
Andrew Mitchell (Sutton Coldfield) (Con):</b> As an Opposition

specific point but with the thrust of what she says, which will be

Stuart:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. I stress to
the Minister, who may not be sufficiently aware of Birmingham politics,
that for all 11 Birmingham Members to agree so thoroughly and campaign
jointly on an issue is very unusual. It is a reflection of the strength
of feeling on the matter.</p><p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="61101-0022.htm_para15"><a name="06110156002377">The region has too often lost
out on funding decisions of this kind. In stations around the country,
from Manchester Piccadilly to Leeds Central, Liverpool Street and
Paddington, we are slowly beginning to build a railway system of which
we can be truly proud. The west midlands, however, has been left
behind. The people of Birmingham and the west midlands feel passionate
about this matter, which has received plenty of media coverage, and I
am sure that it will be an election issue. It is not a matter for party
politics, however, as it is not just MPs for the city, across the
parties, who have come together. The city and the region have also come
together to represent and fight for the needs of the city. There is
much about the Conservative-Liberal city council administration of
which I disapprove, but on this occasion, we are very much in support
of each other and working together. We all want a station of which the
city can be proud.</p><p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="61101-0022.htm_para16"><a name="06110156002378">For example, we all want people
to come shopping at the newly built Bullring, an iconic building of
this thriving region. If they must first go through New Street station,
however, we do ourselves a disservice. In preparation for the
Adjournment debate, several Members asked me, &#147;What do you want
to do with New Street station? Do you want to bulldoze it? If you do,
can I drive the first bulldozer, because I have had the misfortune of
having to travel through it?&#148; Anybody who has ever been to the
station knows that we need to do something.</p><p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="61101-0022.htm_para17"><a name="06110156002379">The Birmingham gateway
proposal, which would take us forward, is currently being examined by
the local planning authority, and it offers a real opportunity to make
a difference to Birmingham and the west midlands. The proposals are for
a light and open train station, a far cry from the dark and cramped
experience at present. The proposed redevelopment would not only be a
catalyst for regional growth and development, but offer an excellent
return on the necessary investment. It would generate new jobs and
opportunities, as well as improve pedestrian and rail links to the key
parts of the
city.</p><p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="61101-0022.htm_para18"><a name="06110156002380">Moreover, the
redevelopment would meet the region&#146;s transport and urban
regeneration objectives. Perhaps most importantly, it would secure all
of that with the minimum of disruption for passengers and local people.
The plans are being scrutinised and will be improved by the process of
inquiry. It is clear that something needs to be done now before it is
too late, and New Street, as the natural hub of the region, should see
that investment.</p><p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="61101-0022.htm_para19"><a name="06110156002381">I am
pleased that this campaign has the support of my right hon. Friend the
Prime Minister. During the Hodge Hill by-election, he commented
that</p><a name="61101-0022.htm_brev9"><a name="06110156002549"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we know New Street

Street railway station and the action being taken by Government to
address those matters. I hope that my hon. Friends will forgive me if I
repeat some of the facts already mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member
for Birmingham, Edgbaston.</p><p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="61101-0023.htm_para1"><a name="06110169000453">Birmingham New Street is one of
the most significant stations on the rail network in Great Britain. It
serves the prosperous business and residential centre of what some call
the second city, although as I represent a Glasgow constituency, I
would not necessarily use that phrase. New Street station is, however,
an equally important location for passengers changing
trains.</p><p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="61101-0023.htm_para2"><a name="06110169000454">The original
station at Birmingham New Street was first established in the mid 19th
century. The site was once occupied by two adjacent stations, built by
rival companies. A major rebuilding scheme was undertaken in the 1960s.
That produced the present station, which opened in 1967, complete with
the Palisades shopping centre, built over much of the operational
station. At the time of rebuilding, New Street station was handling
some 640 trains a day, resulting in around 60,000 passengers a day
passing through the station. It now caters for more than double that
number&#151;some 1,350 trains a day, passenger numbers also having
doubled to 120,000 a
day.</p><p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="61101-0023.htm_para3"><a name="06110169000455">Business
continues to increase, as witnessed, for example, on the west coast
main line, where the trains operated by Virgin are now carrying 30 per
cent. more passengers than before the recent upgrade to the line was
implemented in September 2004. Virgin currently operates a half-hourly
service to and from London. That is planned to increase to one every 20
minutes from December 2008, such is the demand for rail
travel.</p><p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="61101-0023.htm_para4"><a name="06110169000456">The station is
also an important destination for other trains. It is the focal point
for Virgin Cross Country&#146;s long distance services. It is also a
hub for the local and regional services of Central Trains, which play a
vital role in the life of the west midlands. Trains provided by Arriva
Trains Wales also serve the station on routes to and from Chester, mid
Wales and Aberystwyth.</p><br>

important role in the life of Birmingham and the west midlands. Some
train services have increased business by more than 50 per cent. in the
past five years alone. Indeed, rail&#146;s share of the travel market
in the west midlands has risen from 12 per cent. some ten years ago, to
nearly 20 per cent. today. There is every expectation that such rail
business will increase, and we must plan accordingly. That is
especially important as we consider how best to deal with the transport
needs of the west midlands in the longer
term.</p><p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="61101-0023.htm_para6"><a name="06110169000458">A recent study,
led by Network Rail but involving all the relevant train operators and
the Department for Transport, concluded that the present rail system
around Birmingham New Street could absorb a substantial volume of
additional passenger traffic, sufficient to meet all medium-term and
most longer-term needs. It also said that a doubling of business could
be accommodated by lengthening trains&#151;adding
carriages&#151;rather than by increasing train frequencies. New
Street station could certainly accommodate longer trains, but platforms
would have to be lengthened at some other stations.</p><p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="61101-0023.htm_para7"><a name="06110169000459">As my hon. Friend the Member
for Birmingham, Edgbaston said, the present station at New Street is 40
years old, and the need to improve its size and ambience so that it can
better handle increased passenger flows is a subject that has exercised
the Department, Network Rail and Birmingham city council for some time.
My hon. Friend mentioned the proposal prepared by the city council and
Network Rail for the Birmingham gateway scheme, which has received wide

alleviate overcrowding and facilitate long-term growth in business.
There would be a much larger circulation and concourse area, with
enhanced access to platforms, improved lighting and passenger
facilities in general, and better access to the city centre. An
integrated shopping centre would be provided, along with the
opportunity for commercial development to offset overall
costs.</p><p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="61101-0023.htm_para9"><a name="06110169000461">However, all
that comes at a high cost. The present figures show a need for
&#163;380 million of public funding. Of that amount, &#163;280
million is requested from the Department for Transport, with the
balance coming from the Department for Trade and Industry. An expected
contribution of &#163;140 million from the private sector would help
towards the &#147;all-up&#148; cost of &#163;520
million.</p><p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="61101-0023.htm_para10"><a name="06110169000462">Although I
commend the promoters for the hard work that has enabled the scheme to
be designed, it represents a substantial sum and I am sure that the
House would agree that we must make certain that it is the best-value
way forward. Departmental officials are working hard to examine the
business case presented by the city council and Network Rail that is
designed to support the requirement for public funding. For example,
the Department is in dialogue with the city council about the
commercial risk associated with the project. The Government are not,
and certainly do not want to become, the last resort for any cost
overrun, nor do they want to pick up the pieces over any failed deal
with the private
sector.</p><p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="61101-0023.htm_para11"><a name="06110169000463">The gateway
proposals are also being considered alongside the Department&#146;s
current work on what is

what the Government want railways to deliver in the period from April
2009 to March 2014. An announcement, in the form of a White Paper, is
likely to be made next
summer.</p><p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="61101-0023.htm_para12"><a name="06110169000464">Simply put,
any scheme for New Street must be affordable. Given the significance of
the gateway scheme, and its impact on the railway and on available
resources, it is likely that a way forward on options for the project
will be included in the statement on the high-level output
specification. I hope that that answers the question that my hon.
Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston asked about the timetable
for an
announcement.</p><p><a name="st_o419"><a name="06110169000465"><b><a name="61101-0023.htm_spnew0"><a name="06110169001882">Mr.
Khalid Mahmood (Birmingham, Perry Barr) (Lab):</b> My hon.
Friend the Minister has spoken about the projected cost, but I remind
him that the costs of the Manchester metro are far higher. However, the
shopping complex that would be placed over New Street station would
provide many jobs; thus the scheme would be of far greater benefit to
UK taxpayers. By integrating the project with the private sector and
not relying only on the public sector, we can ensure that we get a
return on the project. I accept that my hon. Friend has concerns about
the private sector, but I assure him that we have gone into all those
matters. As happened with the neighbouring Bullring project, improving
New Street station would provide great employment and high returns
locally.</p><p><a name="st_o420"><a name="06110169000466"><b><a name="61101-0023.htm_spnew1"><a name="06110169001883">Mr.
Harris:</b> My hon. Friend makes a valid point, but I hope
that he will forgive me if I am not tempted to compare the New Street
project with important transport projects elsewhere in the country. All
such projects have business cost-benefit ratios attached, and some are
better than others, but we should concentrate on Birmingham in this
debate.</p><p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="61101-0023.htm_para13"><a name="06110169000467">The Department
is urging Birmingham city council and Network Rail to finalise work on
the business case. Further information is being provided and I urge the
promoters to deliver it as quickly as possible. I understand that the
earliest that the promoters consider work can begin on the gateway
scheme is December
2008.</p><p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="61101-0023.htm_para14"><a name="06110169000468">The Department
is concerned that in any project to improve New Street station,
disruption to passengers should be minimised. The Government want a

Friends will be aware that the Department is currently re-tendering a
number of passenger franchises that serve New Street. All of them are
designed to improve reliability, provide additional capacity and meet
stakeholder aspirations. In the invitation to tender for the new
cross-country timetable, for example, the Department acknowledges the
challenges that New Street station may present for many rail users. The
public information document on the franchise states
that</p><a name="61101-0023.htm_brev0"><a name="06110169001442"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;for many journeys,
where a change is necessary, there are alternatives such as
Wolverhampton, which has seen recent investment in new waiting areas,
lifts, a footbridge and customer information systems. Other
alternatives include Banbury &amp; Cheltenham Spa stations, where the
operational layout dictates that only &#145;same platform&#146;
changes are
necessary...Bidders&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="61101-0023.htm_para16"><a name="06110169000470">for

required to demonstrate in their bids how they intend to expand upon
traditional customer service practices to ensure that the need to
change trains does not become an
inconvenience&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="61101-0023.htm_para17"><a name="06110169000471">The
services for the new cross-country franchise have, in any case, been
designed to remove conflicting train movements at New Street, thus
producing a more robust timetable and improving reliability. In the
case of the west midlands franchise, there are, for example, planned
increases in services for the Birmingham-Coventry-Northampton corridor.
I am pleased that the West Midlands passenger transport executive,
Advantage West Midlands and other key local stakeholders are also
involved in work to come up with the right solution for New Street. We
need to secure the right long-term answer. Such bodies have important
duties and responsibilities for the area, and they bring their
expertise to the table. The Government look forward to the continuation
of what I hope will be a team
effort.</p><p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="61101-0023.htm_para18"><a name="06110169000472">As my hon.
Friends will have noted, the Government fully understand the situation
at Birmingham New Street and are working with the city council and
Network Rail to find a sensible and affordable solution. No decisions
have yet been made; before we reach that stage, a considerable amount
of work remains to be undertaken. However, I hope that I can reassure
my hon. Friends, their constituents and rail passengers who use
Birmingham New Street that we will ensure that the railway and New
Street station are indeed fit for
purpose.</p><p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="61101-0023.htm_para19"><a name="06110169000473"><i> Question

this House takes note of European Union Documents No. 10014/06, Draft
Council Regulation laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct
payments provided for in Regulation (EC) No.1782/2003 establishing
common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural
policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, and
amending Regulation (EC) No. 1290/2005; and welcomes the voluntary
modulation proposal as a means of providing additional funding for
rural development programmes in the United Kingdom which will help meet
the government&#146;s commitment to sustainable rural development;
but supports the government in wanting to ensure that the voluntary
modulation rules operate in a way appropriate to the needs of the
United Kingdom.</p></ul><br><i> The House
