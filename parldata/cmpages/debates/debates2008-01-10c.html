 My hon. Friend raises an important point. Although the Government have made clear their desire to reprioritise some of the funding to those who have never had the chance to go to university, we are also protecting for equivalent or lower qualification funding foundation degrees, which are a major route of vocational retraining, and a list of exempt, strategic and vulnerable subjects that are important to the economy and are, therefore, most likely to provide employment opportunities to a woman who is retraining.

proposals. Unless the Government do a U-turn&#151;there is no shame in that; they have done many before&#151;there will be a detrimental impact on all the students, all the staff and, in particular, the budgets of those universities. The hon.

 I do not accept the figures that have been presented as a realistic prediction. Even if one set aside the transitional protection, which means that no institution will lose in cash terms over three years, the figures ignore the fundamental point that no money is being lost to higher education. The &#163;100 million that is being reprioritised will be available for students who have not otherwise had the chance to go to university, so the universities that say they will lose money are effectively saying that they do not believe that they can recruit a single additional student from the vast pool of people who have never been in higher education. In reality, all those institutions are already recruiting such students successfully. They simply need to build on the efforts that they have already made. We are clear that we need to provide the transitional protection that enables those institutions to adjust the ways in which they work to make sure that that happens.</p>

 The proposals that we make affect the funding of English students. With reference to the interest that exists in the devolved Administrations, the most important answer is the one that I gave in response to the previous question. We are making sure that we have put in place the transitional protection and the support for relevant courses to ensure that important universities such as the Open university are able to recruit additional students, change their way of working, come through strongly and deliver the education that is needed. There is no reason why any student who might be planning to go from Scotland in the future should fear that the open university that they wish to attend will be damaged by our proposals.</p>

 I, unlike the hon. Gentleman, respect the devolution settlement and believe that it is important. It is not my job to persuade another devolved Administration to adopt particular policies. However, as reference has been made to the debate earlier this week, I point out that it has not escaped the attention of many people&#151;including, I am sure, many members of the Open University Students Association&#151;that the Opposition motion did not oppose the principle behind our proposals. A number of my hon. Friends signed the early-day motion, but Tuesday&#146;s debate was about securing the interests of the institutions that would be affected by the change.

 That was a very complacent answer.

Will he confirm that he has even united <i> The Guardian </i>and the Church of England in opposition to his policy? I applaud him for creating such a broad coalition, but I thought that the new Prime Minister wanted to create broad coalitions in favour of his policies, not against them.

 One of the responsibilities of government, which I accept, is that sometimes one takes difficult decisions that are widely criticised. It is true that not everyone accepted our decision to prioritise opportunities for people who never had the chance to go to university.

They will be able to consider those avenues, and that will help them to retrain and reskill.</p>

 It might help the House if I put a couple of facts on record. The budget of the Science and Technology Facilities Council is going up over the next three years by 13.6 per cent.&#151;an increase of &#163;185 million over the budgetary period. The STFC will spend &#163;1.9 billion during that three-year period, a significant proportion of which will be spent in the north-west. Like other research councils, the STFC has to make some difficult decisions, and it has to decide what its priorities should be. The Government are concerned about the health of all the disciplines, which is one of the reasons we have asked Research Councils UK to undertake a series of reviews of the health of the disciplines, starting with physics. Bill Wakeham will lead that review, and its terms and references have been scoped out.</p>

Because of the difficult decisions the STFC has had to make, it has announced a voluntary redundancy programme for all its sites, not just Harwell, but Daresbury and in Scotland as well. It will be some time before the pattern of voluntary redundancies becomes clear. I do not think that it is right to say that there is a definite figure for job losses at Daresbury or anywhere else.

 I agree with Dr. Brian Cox that scientific research is not a luxury, but an absolute necessity, and in the north-west a great deal of world-class scientific research is conducted. During the past few weeks, the university of Liverpool have been developing a model that can predict the risk of any person developing lung cancer in a five-year period. The university of Manchester, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, has discovered a key process that may be involved in the spread of cancer, which could lead to new treatments to stop 80 to 90 per cent. of cancers in their tracks. A great deal of research into other matters, too, is being undertaken at north-west universities. As I said earlier, the budgets of all research councils have grown&#151;for example, the STFC budget has increased by 13.6 per cent. and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council&#146;s budget has increased significantly. However, it is up to research councils to determine their priorities, based on their best assessment of the science.

 Ministerial questions and answers are often characterised by spin and bombast. I therefore hope that the Under-Secretary will answer a straightforward and short question. A few weeks ago, on 21 November, the Prime Minister said that there were 250,000 apprentices. Just before Christmas, as the Under-Secretary knows, official figures were released detailing whether apprenticeship figures had gone up or down. Do they show that the number of apprentices at level 2 and level 3 is greater or less than the number that the Prime Minister cited in November?

 And the hon. Gentleman talks about bombast and spin! He knows that when we talk about apprentices, what is important as a statement of fact is the number of apprentices starting and then completing. Apprenticeships last for different periods across the country. They are not like university courses; they do not start in September and end three years later in June. They start at different times. I can confirm that the average number over the past three years is 250,000. I have to say that when we inherited apprenticeships in 1997, there was no inspection and the completion rate was less than 25 per cent. We therefore make no apology for ensuring quality and ensuring that some employers and providers are not in the system, which accounts for the drop most recently.</p>

We want that bottom-up influence on the use of LSC funding to grow in the years to come, because I acknowledge that, in the process of driving up standards in education&#151;for example, through the improvement in the completion of apprenticeships, which is one of the LSC&#146;s real achievements&#151;the LSC has at times been felt to be insensitive to local needs.

 The answer is that the Government need a mechanism to distribute the record sums of funding to deliver adult education. The amount of funding going to adult skills over the next three years will increase by 17 per cent.

 My hon. Friend puts the case brilliantly. It is important to ensure that this group of young people has the same status in our society, frankly, as graduates. That is what we are seeking to achieve in the apprenticeship review, as we understand that, in the end, an apprentice is mentored and assisted in routine, discipline and dedication, which are skills that parents across the country want for their young people. We must ensure that we celebrate the success of these young people, which is exactly what we will seek to achieve in the months ahead.</p>

 My hon.

 We need to get the balance right. Overseas students are a significant benefit to our universities and to the country; they are worth about &#163;5 billion to the UK economy. However, we have to tackle illegal immigration. That is why we established the education and training register three years ago. Since then&#151;I regard this as a virtue of the system&#151;124 colleges have been removed from that register. We now conduct unannounced visits to institutions that wish to go on to the register, and I believe that the introduction of the new Australian points-based immigration system will give us greater powers to identify bogus colleges and remove them from the list.</p>

 It is obviously important that apprenticeships lead to secure employment.

The apprenticeship review that I hope we will publish in the fairly near future will set out how we strengthen the leadership of the apprenticeship programme. I hope that it will find ways of demonstrating more clearly that the programme is delivering what we want, which is an increase in the number of people both going on to apprenticeships and successfully completing them.

not least from the volume of questions asked by hon. Members this morning. I am sure that many will welcome the review of science funding announced by the Secretary of State.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that question. It is important to make a big statement of principle on this issue. The Haldane principle, established many years ago, says that Ministers should not intervene directly in the funding decisions of research councils. That is to protect the autonomy of research councils in deciding where research should take place. When the Science and Technology Facilities Council made its proposals, despite its above-inflation increase in grant, to reduce certain areas of physics expenditure, it would not have been appropriate to breach the Haldane principle, to step in and to take money away from the Medical Research Council and give it to the STFC. However, because of the concerns, I did my job by asking Professor Bill Wakeham, the vice-chancellor of Southampton university, to produce a report on the health of physics as a discipline, which will consider our overall funding of physics, including those areas that have attracted controversy.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement on UK energy policy. Our strategy, as set out in our energy White Paper last year, is designed to achieve two objectives&#151;first, to ensure that the UK has access to secure energy supplies and, secondly and together with other countries, to tackle the global challenge of climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="80110-0003.htm_para0"><a name="08011057000140">The competition for energy resources is increasing. Access to supplies across the world is becoming increasingly politicised. As a result, the cost of energy is rising. And few who have been exposed to the science of climate change now doubt the immediacy of the threat to our planet. As the UK shifts from being a net energy exporter to a net importer, our ability to source a diverse range of secure, competitively priced energy supplies will be one of the most important challenges that we face as a country&#151;affecting our economy, our environment and, ultimately, our national security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="80110-0003.htm_para1"><a name="08011057000141">Our strategy to manage these risks is based on three key elements, which are increasing energy efficiency and helping people and businesses make a real contribution to solving the challenges we face; using the widest range of cleaner energy sources; and ensuring that the UK is as energy independent of any one supplier, country or technology as possible. Let me touch on each of these.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="80110-0003.htm_para2"><a name="08011057000142">We have already set out the measures that we are taking on energy efficiency. These could result in savings of between 25 tonnes and 42 million tonnes of CO2 by 2020. We will keep these measures under review, going further and faster wherever we can. We are also planning for the amount of UK electricity supplied from renewable sources to treble by 2015. The Energy Bill, published today, will strengthen the renewables obligation and help to speed up the deployment of an even greater share of energy from renewable sources. Offshore wind, wave and tidal power will all gain from that new approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="80110-0003.htm_para3"><a name="08011057000143">The Government are also committed to funding one of the world&#146;s first commercial-scale demonstrations of carbon capture and storage. CCS is a technology that has the potential to make a critical contribution to tackling climate change. Measures in the Energy Bill will enable that to move forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="80110-0003.htm_para4"><a name="08011057000144">If we are to be as energy independent as possible, it is also vital, first, that we continue to press the case for energy market liberalisation in the EU, and secondly, that we look to maximise economic domestic energy production. Finally, we must ensure that energy companies have the widest range of options open to them when it comes to investment in new low-carbon power generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="80110-0003.htm_para5"><a name="08011057000145">Over the next two decades, we will need to replace a third of the UK&#146;s generating capacity, and by 2050 our electricity will need to be largely low-carbon, so we must be clear about the potential role of nuclear power. In October, we concluded a full and extensive consultation across the UK, seeking people&#146;s views on whether new nuclear power should play a continuing role in providing Britain with the energy that it needs. Today I am publishing the Government&#146;s response in the form of a White Paper alongside our analysis of the comments that we received. I can confirm that, having carefully considered the responses, the Government believe that new nuclear  <br>

power stations should have a role to play in this country&#146;s future energy mix alongside other low-carbon sources. The Government&#146;s view is that it is in the public interest to allow energy companies the option of investing in new nuclear power stations and that we should therefore take the active steps necessary to facilitate that.</p>

First, a continuing role for nuclear power will contribute to the diversity of our energy supplies. Secondly, it will help us meet our emissions reduction targets, as every new nuclear power station will save the same amount of carbon emissions as are generated by about 1 million households. The entire lifecycle emissions from nuclear power&#151;from uranium mining through to waste management&#151;are only between 2 and 6 per cent. of those from gas for every unit of electricity generated. Thirdly, nuclear power will reduce the costs of meeting our energy goals. Analysis of future gas and carbon price scenarios shows that nuclear is affordable and provides one of the cheapest electricity options available to reduce our carbon emissions. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

 Our energy suppliers recognise that, and in a world of carbon markets and high fossil fuel prices, they recognise that nuclear power makes commercial sense. For those reasons, I do not intend to set some artificial cap on the proportion of electricity that the UK should be able to generate either from nuclear power or from any other source of low-carbon energy. That would not be consistent with our long-term national interest. Given that nuclear power is a tried and tested, safe and secure form of low-carbon technology, it would be wrong in principle to rule it out now from playing any role in the UK&#146;s energy future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80110-0003.htm_para8"><a name="08011057000152">Not surprisingly, however, some important concerns were expressed during the consultation about nuclear power. They fall in to four broad categories: safety and security, waste management, costs, and the impact of nuclear power on investment in alternative low-carbon technologies. Ensuring the safety and security of new nuclear provision will remain a top priority. Having reviewed the evidence put forward and the advice of independent regulators, we are confident that we have a robust regulatory framework. The International Atomic Energy Agency concluded that our regulatory framework is mature, flexible and transparent, with highly trained and experienced inspectors.</p>

effective regulatory regime in the world. I believe that it could be a critical differentiator for the UK in securing access to international investment in new nuclear facilities. I have asked Dr. Tim Stone to take that work forward, alongside his continuing work on the financial arrangements regarding new nuclear power stations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80110-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08011057000154">Secondly, during the consultation, many argued that a permanent solution for dealing with existing waste must be developed before new waste is created. We have considered the evidence fully, and our conclusion is that geological disposal is both technically possible and the right approach for managing existing and new higher-activity waste. It will be many years, of course, before a disposal facility is built, but we are satisfied that interim storage will hold waste from existing and any new power stations safely and securely for as long as is necessary. In addition, before development consents for new nuclear power station&#146;s are granted, the Government will need to be satisfied that effective arrangements exist, or will exist, to manage and dispose of the waste that those stations will produce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80110-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08011057000155">The third concern relates to cost. It will be for energy companies, not the Government, to fund, develop and build new nuclear power stations. That will include meeting the full costs of decommissioning and each operator&#146;s full share of the waste management costs. The Bill includes provisions to ensure that, and transparency in the operation of the arrangements will be essential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80110-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08011057000156">So in order to increase public and industry confidence, we will establish a new, independent body to advise on the financial arrangements to cover operators&#146; waste and decommissioning costs. The advice of that new body will be made public. The nuclear White Paper published today sets out a clear timetable for action to enable the building of the first new nuclear power station, which I hope will be completed well before 2020. The Planning Bill will improve the speed and efficiency of the planning system for nationally significant infrastructure, including new nuclear power stations, while giving local people a greater opportunity to have their say. A strategic siting assessment, to be completed by 2009, will help identify the most suitable sites for new build. We expect that applications will focus on areas in the vicinity of existing nuclear facilities. Work is already under way on assessing the safety of the new generation of reactors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80110-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08011057000158">Finally, we must work with our EU partners to strengthen the EU emissions trading scheme to give potential investors confidence in a continuing carbon market. We look forward to the Commission&#146;s proposals later this month. I remain firmly of the view that there should and will be room for all forms of low-carbon power technologies to play a role in helping the UK meet its energy objectives in the future. Nuclear power can be only one aspect of our energy mix as, on its own, it cannot resolve all the challenges that we face. Meeting those challenges requires the full implementation of our energy and climate change strategy, with nuclear taking its place alongside other low-carbon technologies. The Energy Bill will ensure that we have a legislative framework enabling all of those technologies to make a positive contribution to our future requirements for cleaner and more secure energy.</p>

long-term interest. I therefore invite energy companies today to bring forward plans to build and operate new nuclear power stations. Set against the challenges of climate change and security of supply, the evidence in support of new nuclear power stations is compelling. We should positively embrace the opportunity of delivering this important part of our energy policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80110-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08011057000162">There has never been a more pressing time for responsible policy making. Carbon emissions are changing our climate, we are paying $100 for a barrel of oil and we are facing a clear and massive energy shortfall. It is our duty to set political scrapping aside so that we can make sure that we do what is right for the country. So let me make it absolutely clear that, where we can find agreement with the Government, we are up for it and we will reach that agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80110-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08011057000163">Our vision on nuclear is clear: we must refine the planning system, set a price for carbon to establish a long-term climate for investment, and ensure that there is clarity on waste and decommissioning. On no account, however, should there be any kind of subsidy for nuclear power. Judging by what the Secretary of State has just said, our position is, by and large, similar to the Government&#146;s. If business wants to invest in new nuclear power stations on that basis, it should be free to do so, and it should know that the investment climate will remain stable under any Conservative Government. Any such investment must not be allowed to detract from unrelenting effort to improve efficiency and to encourage renewable technologies, microgeneration, decentralised energy and feed-in tariffs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80110-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08011057000164">The first of our concerns&#151;and those of investors&#151;is the apparent weakness of our national skills base. Is it not the case that the nuclear installations inspectorate cannot find, recruit, train and retain the number of skilled employees it requires to assess and approve the different types of reactor for which licences are sought? Is it the Secretary of State&#146;s policy to require the NII simply to accept or reject the proven designs submitted to it, or will it be empowered to reject the endless subsequent design adjustments that have so dogged the industry in the past?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80110-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08011057000165">Both the Government&#146;s policy and ours is that there must be no subsidy. Although nuclear companies claim that they do not want subsidies, suspicions remain that the industry will end up asking for them, either through subsidised waste disposal or guaranteed off-take agreements. Is the Secretary of State satisfied that the industry will not later request some form of subsidy?</p>

In the spirit of the responsible approach that we wish to engender, does the right hon. Gentleman accept that it is illogical to continue with the climate change levy, which taxes nuclear, when a carbon regime should release nuclear from carbon penalties and affect only methods that create carbon?</p>

We regret that the Government seem to have rejected feed-in tariffs, even for microgeneration, but we welcome&#151;at least as a first step&#151;their proposal to band the renewables obligation to give more balanced support to emerging technologies in a way that removes the perverse bias towards onshore wind and methane.</p>

I hope that the hon. Gentleman will support the Planning Bill&#146;s progress through the House, because it is a critical part of speeding up the introduction of low-carbon technologies.

aspect of the safety and approval system. On his point about subsidy, there will not be a subsidy for new nuclear, and we have made that absolutely clear. As for the new body that he asked about, we will consider all the options. As I say, the Energy Bill is published today; its Committee stage will start in the next few weeks, and there will be plenty of opportunity to consider the argument then. He asked how the body would do its job. We will need to get good, decent, experienced people to serve on it, and I am sure that there will not be a shortage of people prepared to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="80110-0004.htm_para18"><a name="08011057000174">The hon. Gentleman asked what was meant by the &#147;full share&#148; of decommissioning costs. Each energy company that wants to operate a new nuclear power station will have to meet its full share of the cost of new nuclear waste. I do not think that that policy is unclear. Of course, what each company&#146;s share will be needs to be resolved, because it will obviously depend on how many nuclear power stations that operator runs. There will be an opportunity later in the spring for us to consult fully on the details of the financial mechanisms that we are proposing. I hope that the broad principles will be available for the Committee considering the Energy Bill later next month.</p>

We have proceeded on a prudent, conservative basis&#151;I hope that he will like that&#151;in terms of understanding the modelling of nuclear economics in future. We have taken the best international evidence from the International Energy Agency and others to form the basis of our calculations. On carbon pricing, we are waiting to see new proposals from the Commission on the ETS. We will keep all our options open for the long term to make sure that investors have sufficient confidence that the ETS will work in the way that we want it to. There has to be a robust, increasing price for carbon; it is a pollutant, and we have to make sure that we regard CO2 in that way.</p>

I am sure that there will be other occasions when we can consider the detail of those matters. Finally, I do not accept his view that the UK has slipped when it comes to carbon capture and storage. We are one of only three countries in the world to have signalled their willingness to invest and support the demonstration of a commercial-scale carbon capture and storage project. The others are the US and Norway. That puts the UK in a global leadership role; we are not losing ground on CCS.</p>

He can understand why people will ask, &#147;What has suddenly changed?&#148; On carbon prices, is he talking about some form of carbon price guarantee?

On his point about the ETS, we will have to wait and see what proposals come forward from the Commission later this month, but I have tried to put forward in the House today our view that we need a strengthening of the ETS.

Today, that signal is being given, but it was not previously. That is why there have not been new applications for some considerable time.

He said that the Government would now take the active steps necessary to facilitate new nuclear, but we are still not clear what they are. We still do not know how we will dispose of the waste.

welcome one in progress towards building a new generation of nuclear power stations. In that context, I am particularly glad about the response of my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan), which underlines the fact that there is now broad cross-party support for the issue in the House, which is genuinely welcome. Another key test that the Trade and Industry Committee laid down in its report 18 months ago related to a carbon price. The Secretary of State referred to that in his response. There is not much in his statement about that, and there is not much in the documentation. Will he repeat to the House his assurance that if the second phase proposals to the Commission are not strong enough, he will take unilateral steps in the United Kingdom to provide a firm price for carbon?</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the work that he and his colleagues on the Select Committee are doing. I agree that if there is cross-party consensus on these matters, that would be a tremendously good thing for the long-term future of our country. In relation to carbon markets, the most sensible thing for us all to do is to wait and see what the Commission proposes. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will look carefully at those proposals. We do not rule out any option, as I said, but it is important that the carbon price is strengthened in subsequent phases of the emissions trading scheme. That will be important for the economics of nuclear, and will be the right signal for our approach to climate change.</p>

 My right hon. Friend draws attention to the fact that we will have to replace one third of our power plants by 2020 or so. Bearing in mind the existing published material, including that from the Health and Safety Executive, his Department and various other agencies, on the timetable for justification for site search, planning permission and so on, does he accept that it is unlikely that there will be any new nuclear power plant on stream by the time we have to replace that one third of our energy plant? Does he therefore accept that our concentration now should be on replacing that one third of energy with renewable energy, to make sure that that new one third of power plant is indeed low-carbon?</p>

 We need to do all those things. I tried to make it clear in my response to the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb), who speaks for the Liberal Democrats, that our argument today is not that nuclear can fix all the problems. That would clearly be the wrong argument, but we should not rule nuclear out because on its own it cannot meet all the challenges. My argument today is that it has a role to play. I do not believe that it is unlikely that there will be new nuclear power stations operating in the UK by the middle of the 2020s. It is likely that there will be several nuclear power stations operating by that stage. We should also remember that it is not just the 2020 target towards which we must aim our sights&#151;it is 2050. Between 2020 and 2050 the challenge of responding to the science of climate change will intensify, not become easier to deal with. That is why it would be wrong in principle to rule out now one proven form of low- carbon technology.</p>

 I welcome the statement from the Minister and from our Front-Bench spokesman, my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan), and I look forward to being able to work on the progress of a Sizewell C. Does the Minister recognise that it will be much more difficult to do that if the second half of the Planning Bill is not changed? My constituents accept that the decision on the safety of nuclear power should be made here centrally, but when it comes to a discussion about the much needed road changes and so on for such a large construction, they want to have an inspector locally to whom they can put their case. If they do not, we will hold up the proposals to a degree that the right hon. Gentleman will find unimaginable. He must give local people direct influence, not hand the matter over to a quango. They want an inspector.</p>

 I welcome the first part of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments. I had the good fortune to be in his constituency yesterday to look at Sizewell B, which is a phenomenal success story&#151;probably the most successful pressurised water reactor in the world. It is coming towards the end of 445 days of full load capacity without a break. That is an extraordinary achievement, and I congratulate his constituents on it. His comments in relation to the Planning Bill will have been heard. The Bill is in Committee, and there will be an opportunity to consider the detail of that. As a point of information, which I am sure the right hon. Gentleman does not need but others might, the Sizewell B inquiry took 340 days. It dealt with local planning issues for only 30 of those 340 days, so anyone who argues that the current system is defensible does not live in the real world.</p>

We all accept that the responsibility for dealing with the legacy waste from the Magnox and advanced gas-cooled reactors will occur on the balance sheet of Governments for some considerable time. That is right, and there is no point pretending otherwise. Clearly, taxpayers will be involved to that extent. My statement was about the future of nuclear power. In a nutshell, we should learn from what has happened, and we can do so. There is a different way of doing it. We should be open-minded about the future. I know that my right hon. Friend follows these arguments closely. For me, the science of climate change is changing my understanding of these matters. It is imperative in our national interest that we do not take a decision now  <br>

 I am grateful to you, Mr. Speaker. Why on earth are we repeating the nuclear folly of the last years, when one power station was 14 years late, there were vast cost overruns, and &#163;75 billion was required to manage the waste? The new thinking on waste is to bury it in a hole in the ground, which was the answer 40 years ago. I appeal to the Government to turn away from this atrocious decision and turn to the renewables, which are practical and cheap, especially marine power, which has long been neglected, tidal powers and the other marine powers, which are clean, non-carbon, practical, British and eternal?</p>

 We are making significant support available so that the renewable sources of energy that my hon. Friend mentioned can come to fruition. Through the renewables obligation, all of us are subsidising renewable power. It is the right thing to do. We are not subsidising nuclear.

 The renewables obligation is a genuine market mechanism and that is why it has been successful. It has overseen a rapid increase in renewable energy in the UK and we should stick with what works.

We had a seven-and-a-half-hour Report stage on the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. More than four fifths of that time&#151;more than six hours&#151;was spent on Government new clauses, new schedules and amendments. There were 120 of them, all on matters that should not take time away from Government Back Benchers and Opposition Members. There were nine debates to be had on issues as important as blasphemy, prostitution, sex offences, pornography and personal data; yet we had only one out of nine. May I suggest that, in future, we negotiate the time for Report stage, which is the time for Back-Bench and Opposition contributions, and that if the Government want to do their own thing, they do it in extra time that they add to the agreed time? Only by doing that can we avoid the nonsense of the House of Commons considering one of the major Bills of the year but debating only what the Government wish to discuss, as happened yesterday.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman reinforced the points about the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. He expressed what is largely a shared view. The hon.

The hon. Gentleman is right that it has been a tight settlement. We must be careful with the public finances, but there has been a real-terms increase, which has been important year on year in areas such as my constituency and his in the London borough of Southwark. There has been a real-terms increase, despite the growing demand and the fact that we would all like more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="80110-0007.htm_para12"><a name="08011057000308">The hon. Gentleman asked whether, when we publish the SSRB report on 16 January, which is next Wednesday, and the written ministerial statement which sets out our position, and table our resolutions, we should make an oral statement. We are trying to make the written ministerial statement, which will be the Government&#146;s response to the SSRB report on MPs&#146; pay, as full and as explanatory as possible so that we not only table the resolutions and enable hon. Members to examine them straight away and consider their amendments, but ensure that they have the Government&#146;s argument, set out as fully as possible, in an inevitably lengthy written ministerial statement. That will give hon. Members quite enough material to work out whether&#151;and if so, how&#151;they want to amend the resolutions. They will have more than a full week before the debate on 24 January. A written but full ministerial statement is the right approach.</p>

 I beg to move,</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="80110-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08011057000380">I welcome the opportunity to debate preventive medical services. We often debate issues involving the national health service and the treatment of ill health, and it is important for us to be able to focus also on the prevention of illness and the promotion of good health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="80110-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08011057000381">The NHS has been engaged in preventive health services since its inception in 1948, and some preventive health services even predate its establishment. Wartime posters reminded mothers not to forget babies&#146; cod liver oil and orange juice to prevent rickets and scurvy, and photographs of child health clinics with lines of children waiting to be vaccinated are emblematic of the early days of a service that is unique in its offer of health care free for all at the point of need, liberating all of us from fears of unaffordable treatment and untreatable illness: comprehensive health care, publicly funded by taxation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="80110-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08011057000382">The announcement made on Monday by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister builds on that tradition by offering health checks where they will improve our ability to predict and prevent certain conditions in the people at greatest risk, including abdominal aortic aneurism in men over 65, which currently kills over 3,000 men a year. The screening programme is expected to halve that number. There will also be a mid-life test to identify vulnerability to vascular diseases that currently affect the lives of 6.2 million people, causing 200,000 deaths a year, and are responsible for a fifth of all hospital admissions. We announced last month that we would make available a vaccine to prevent the human papilloma virus, a major cause of cervical cancer. We have also made it clear that we support the implementation of further screening programmes when the National Screening Committee advises that the evidence base is sound.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="80110-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08011057000383">Some of the greatest improvements in the health of the population have been secured through preventive programmes. As a result of vaccination, once-dreaded diseases like diphtheria and polio are extremely rare in this country, and smallpox has been eradicated worldwide. Those campaigns have been so successful that we can easily become complacent about their worth. There used to be 500,000 cases of measles in Britain each year, but they can now be measured in hundreds. In other countries, however, measles remains a major childhood killer. We have seen how dependent we are on prevention to keep it at bay in this country when, as a result of vaccine scares, immunisation rates have fallen, leading to needless infections, complications and death.</p>

which are being revisited quite a long time after their inception. Dentistry is moving away from &#147;extraction and fill&#148; to a policy of prevention of tooth decay, but his comments will be looked at closely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="80110-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08011057000395">All the points that have already been raised make it clear that while we are, of course, concerned that we should have a national health service that is free at the point of need, treating people with illness, it also has a huge task to prevent ill health and to support individuals to have more control of their health in partnership with their clinicians. The NHS has discharged that role in the past 60 years, but it will need to do more in the coming years to empower people to monitor their own health. Screening programmes play a crucial role in that, such as the revolutionised child health care screening programmes, including hearing tests for new-born children, screening for sickle cell anaemia disorders, and the secured screening for cystic fibrosis, which will avoid lengthy diagnostic delays and minimise frequent hospital admissions for affected children. Those programmes play an important part in ensuring that people are able to stay healthy and fit and have a good quality of life, as well as treating them under the insurance policy that the NHS provides for all of us&#151;the very best treatment when we need it.</p>

 I will be happy to do so after I have made a little progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="80110-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08011057000398">Preventive health services are, of course, not the exclusive preserve of the NHS. An increasing range of commercial screening services are advertised, and there must be a degree of caution&#151;the health service certainly has that&#151;in considering the use of such programmes. Any screening service has the potential to harm people as well as to benefit them, because finding illness in a whole population who have no signs of illness is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Often, unnecessary concerns are raised, which can result in treatments that carry a higher risk of complications. Therefore, preventive health services in the NHS are designed to deliver the greatest benefit to both the individual patient and the population as a whole, and to ensure that the outcome of a screening programme is net benefit and not net harm. Those important issues need to be borne in mind. I have a feeling that the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) wants to raise this matter, so I shall give way to him now.</p>

<p><a name="st_o251"><a name="08011057000399"><a name="80110-0009.htm_spnew13"><a name="08011057001234"><b>Mr. Bone:</b>
 I entirely agree with the Minister about screening being a good idea, but the initial costs must be extraordinarily high. First, the screening must be done, and then the illnesses are found and must be treated. Any screening programme will represent a huge additional cost. Has that been budgeted for?</p>

 If any screening process is recommended&#151;I will discuss this later&#151;consideration will be taken of the risks and the interventions and assessments, as I said a moment ago. Of course, such considerations are made all the time by the national health service in terms of screening and preventive interventions. That is why the outcome must be net benefit and not net harm. We must ensure that screening  <br>

As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said, the future of the health service must be about building partnerships between patients and the NHS, and ensuring that patients are empowered to monitor their own health and to exercise real choice.

 No one in this House or this country would deny the importance or significance of preventive health care, nor would they criticise the Government for, at last, shining a light on public and preventive health care. Conservative Members recognise the benefit of prevention and earlier detection, diagnosis and treatment in improving the overall health and well-being of the population, particularly as preventive health services are key to combating health inequalities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="80110-0009.htm_para12"><a name="08011057000412">Let us begin by discussing where we agree with the Prime Minister&#146;s statement on Monday. We agree with devolved decision making and with greater emphasis on prevention. We want greater accountability, a more patient-focused NHS and greater individual empowerment, and a larger involvement for the charitable, voluntary and private sectors. We also want extended diagnostics in surgeries and greater access to screening, which all have the potential to save many lives. I am sure that the Minister will acknowledge that Conservative Members have called for all that repeatedly. However, the message delivered by the Prime Minister on Monday is in stark and direct contradiction to this Government&#146;s track record. Over the past decade the NHS has been overseen by the Prime Minister, who has presided over a command-and-control, top-down, centralised and process-driven system, and certainly not over a patient-centred NHS based on outcomes.</p>

Under this Government, our public health service is fragmented and there are few clear lines of accountability. Primary care trusts have no incentive to pay for public health interventions that will be costly in the short term as a result of additional demand. Public health budgets have been raided to bail out deficit-ridden trusts, and it is clear that, especially in London, there is an inverse relationship between socio-economic deprivation and public health expenditure.</p>

If we went down those lines, anyone who got pregnant would not be able to have an abortion on the NHS, because that would have been preventable too.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a good point, and I can confirm from the Dispatch Box that that is not the policy of the party that I represent from the Front Bench, nor, to be fair, do I suspect it to be the policy of the Government.</p>

On Monday, the Prime Minister promised everyone in the country a check-up for heart disease, strokes, diabetes and kidney disease. Of course, it is right that such checks are available to those who need them, yet instead of this being the initiative-seizing new start for the Prime Minister, the proposals have been criticised by the very people who are charged with implementing them.</p>

Instead, it recommends a narrower programme of risk assessment that could include measurement of risk factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose, alongside assessment of the all-important family history. Will she detail the clinical evidence for such whole population screening, which could divert finite, financial resources away from deprived areas and ethnic communities, where it is vital to reduce health inequalities?</p>

 Before we get on to the detail, I think that my hon. Friend can help me with the mystery that all this involves. We are debating just one aspect of the speech that the Prime Minister gave on Monday, because the Government have chosen to select just one part of it. What confuses me about that speech is that it contained numerous messages about patient power, concern about a health service that was driven by the needs of providers rather than those of patients and the phrase &#147;empowering patients&#148;. That all sounds hollow in my constituency, where people see NHS services being closed down, taken away and reduced&#151;they do not see how that reconciles with patient power. What does my hon. Friend understand the Prime Minister to mean when he talks about patient power? Does the fact that the only bit of the speech that the Government are focusing on today is a dissertation on preventive medicine mean that all the other things said by the Prime Minister were simply hot air?</p>

 My hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para0"><a name="08011057000422">I want to make some additional points about what the Prime Minister said on Monday. There is no timetable for delivery of the screening. He said that it would occur at some point between April 2008 and 2011, but could not say at what point in the spending round the money would become available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08011057000423">The House will also not be surprised to learn that some of the announcements made on Monday were not new. Conservatives have been calling for &#147;triple A&#148; screening for years, and the Government have promised to roll it out for at least a year. In the White Paper of January 2006, they recommended something called &#147;life check&#148;, which was supposed to include a mid-life health check, including checks on weight, blood pressure and cholesterol. That is remarkably similar to what was in Monday&#146;s announcements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08011057000424">Furthermore, no consultation on those proposals has taken place. Neither the National Screening Committee nor the British Medical Association were consulted on the screening plans. It is beyond belief that the Prime Minister did not consult the very groups set up to provide him with expert advice on screening, nor the doctors expected to implement those policies.</p>

<p><a name="st_o265"><a name="08011057000425"><a name="80110-0010.htm_spnew1"><a name="08011057001248"><b>Mr. Stewart Jackson:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the Prime Minister has form in that area? Last September, he told the Labour party conference that every hospital in the country would be deep cleaned. Figures recently released show that a tiny minority of hospitals and trusts have been deep cleaned, and many have no plans for a deep clean in place with their strategic health authorities.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to make that point, although that is not the specific area of debate for today. He is right to re-emphasise the point that, with this Government, one has to look carefully at their actions, not at what they say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08011057000427">Not only have there been the criticisms that I have highlighted, but it is peculiar that the Prime Minister is announcing policy at the same time as a detailed policy review is being conducted by Lord Darzi.

 The hon. Gentleman spoke with approval a moment ago about those who criticise whole population screening and prefer selective screening based on risk-factor selection. Does that mean that under a future Conservative Government, if people want to be screened but have not been selected by the bureaucracy on the basis of some risk factor, their only hope is to go to the private sector and pay?</p>

 That is not exactly what I said. The health service needs to take into account the clinical evidence base that supports the recommendations from the professionals.

I understand that the Department of Health is starting to resile from what the Prime Minister said on Monday. I shall set out what we intend to do later in my remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08011057000430">Not only have there been criticisms, but there are significant and glaring omissions. I just wish to give two brief, but representative, examples. First, despite what the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw), said inaccurately on &#147;Newsnight&#148; earlier in the week, pharmacists were not mentioned at all in the Prime Minister&#146;s speech, despite their vital importance and the potentially significant contribution that they can make to preventive health care. The Government claimed that the new contract would lead to exactly these types of checks in the community, but only 1 per cent. of pharmacies have been commissioned by PCTs to do that screening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para5"><a name="08011057000431">We also critically require primary prevention to improve nutrition. The estimated overall cost to the NHS of failing to treat under-nutrition is &#163;7.3 billion per year, but measures to alleviate this burden were not announced in the Prime Minister&#146;s speech on preventive health care. Recent figures detail that the number of patients being admitted to hospital in an undernourished state has increased by a staggering 85 per cent. since 1997, to more than 130,000 last year. Failing to prevent under-nutrition in patients leads to longer hospital stays, delayed recovery, an increased risk of contracting health care-associated infections, and poor respiratory function. In some studies, undernourished patients are estimated to have a mortality rate up to eight times higher than well-nourished patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para6"><a name="08011057000432">The Opposition believe that policies on such important issues as preventive health must be carefully and fully considered and appropriately resourced. We have consulted widely and made a number of proposals in that vital area of health policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para7"><a name="08011057000433">We have pledged an independent ring-fenced budget for public health, allocated through a new public health structure, overseen by local directors of public health jointly appointed by PCTs and local authorities. We want to see a strengthened chief medical officer&#146;s department, made more independent of Ministers. We will use the public health budget to enhance significantly the impact of health awareness campaigns, both for primary prevention, to convey an understanding of the impact of lifestyle especially on cancer risk, and for secondary prevention, promoting awareness of symptoms and encouraging early presentation. We would make greater use of the skills and expertise of health care professionals, such as pharmacists, who are close to their communities and well placed to provide information about medical conditions, lifestyle choices and medicine management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08011057000434">Sadly, we have seen no such policy rigour from the Government, and the Prime Minister&#146;s recent announcements have left health care professionals and patients confused over exactly what services will be provided, where the resources are coming from, and when the checks will begin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08011057000435">I have a few brief questions for the Minister and I hope that she will respond when she winds up. Will the Minister confirm that it is the Government&#146;s intention to fund fully any future recommendation from the National Screening Committee? Where are the resources coming from to fund the triple A announcement, which was first made in June 2004? What is the difference  <br>

 It is a pleasure to be able to speak in this debate on the subject of a more preventive health service. I apologise for my croaky voice, but I have a bit of a cold. Perhaps if I took more preventive health care decisions, I might not be suffering as I am today. <i> [</i><i> Laughter.</i><i> ]</i> The topic is a worthy one and, of course, we would not have been discussing it without the new time made available for topical debates, which I warmly welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08011057000441">I have lost track of the number of conversations I have had in my time as a Member of this House with health care professionals and constituents that have stressed the importance of taking a more preventive approach to health care in this country. I am sure that other hon. Members are no strangers to that topic either. The speech given by the Prime Minister earlier this week should be welcomed on both sides of the House as a step towards creating an NHS that is seen to be adapting to the new challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08011057000442">There has been an increasing focus in recent years on the impact of our lifestyles on our health. Lifestyle choices and the plethora of products available to support them are no longer a niche conversation or a niche market. The continued emergence of research that identifies risk factors associated with different diseases cannot be ignored. That is why a new focus on preventive health care is so timely. We now have the information available to support health professionals in seeking both to educate and protect our constituents. I am sure that I will not be the first or last Member today to utter the words &#147;prevention is better than cure&#148;, so I will get that one out of the way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08011057000443">I would like to discuss briefly three aspects to the approach. It is necessary to raise the importance of both awareness and screening in increasing prevention  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 Jan 2008">

of cancer and other killer diseases, and I would also like to ensure that Ministers are reminded of the continuing need to address health inequalities in the north-east. I would hope that long-term thinking and preventive health care will be able to make real inroads into health problems in Gateshead and Washington, and I will return to that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para15"><a name="08011057000444">The recent cancer reform strategy made clear the need for greater attention to be paid to raising awareness of rarer cancer symptoms and also began to set out improvements in screening that will continue to save lives throughout the country. If we are to see more preventive health care, we need better education of symptom awareness. Ovarian cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, but all too often symptoms go unnoticed by GPs and patients alike. England and the UK were recently revealed to have among the lowest ovarian cancer survival rates in Europe, with just over 30 per cent. of women surviving for five years. The figure has not changed significantly in more than 20 years. Most women&#151;75 per cent.&#151;are diagnosed once the cancer has spread significantly, making successful treatment difficult. If our rates could match the best in Europe, an extra 800 women a year would survive beyond five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08011057000445">I welcome Professor Mike Richards&#146;s statement that ovarian cancer will be included in the early awareness initiative that was announced as part of the cancer reform strategy. I welcome the active steps that are already being taken on better prevention through symptom awareness. The ongoing &#147;TLC&#148; campaign that encourages woman to &#147;touch, look and check&#148; their breasts for any signs of change also does valuable work in raising awareness of the risks of breast cancer. It is vital that Ministers continue to work with campaigners such as Breakthrough Breast Cancer to achieve the results that we all wish to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08011057000446">Alongside working to increase awareness, it is vital that access to screening continues to improve for those most at risk of developing cancers and other deadly diseases. I have been in touch with Cancer Research UK about that, because I know it takes screening seriously. The launch of the parliamentary phase of the &#147;Screening Matters&#148; campaign will be co-ordinated in partnership with other charities including Jo&#146;s Trust and the Breast Cancer Campaign. The message is incredibly simple: screening matters because it saves lives. Hon. Members will have an important role in spreading the word and I encourage them to attend the launch event, which will be held in the House during February.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para18"><a name="08011057000447">Breast cancer screening is estimated to save 1,400 lives a year. Bowel cancer screening for those at risk is also playing a role in detecting cancer early and increasing the chance of survival. The message that I continue to hear from organisations such as Bowel Cancer UK is that the steps being taken by the Government are hugely ambitious. Labour Members should share a sense of pride at having helped to support those changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08011057000448">The Prime Minister&#146;s announcement of a new vascular screening programme has been warmly welcomed by many, including health charities such as HEART UK, the Primary Care Cardiovascular Society, the National Obesity Forum and the British Heart Foundation. However,  <br>

<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column 562</b><br>
we must ensure that that ambitious programme is properly supported. We need to stick to well-founded examples of best practice, such as those established for vascular screening. We will not succeed unless we have appropriate treatments and expertise available for those who are identified through screening as suffering from a potentially terminal illness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para20"><a name="08011057000449">There is huge potential in the increased screening programme and it will make a real difference for many in my constituency. The introduction of the smoking ban, the success of the &#147;five a day&#148; campaign and improvements in the quality of school meals all add up to show the Government&#146;s strong and continuing commitment to public health in Britain. We now have more than 32,000 more doctors and 85,000 more nurses. Waiting times for operations are shorter than ever and screening projects are becoming more and more effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para21"><a name="08011057000450">I do not believe that we would have seen anything like the same degree of financial support or policy commitment under a Conservative Government. All the local authorities in Tyne and Wear are in the top two fifths of the most deprived areas of the UK. Gateshead and Sunderland, which cover my constituency, are both in the top fifth. I know from talking to staff at Gateshead Queen Elizabeth hospital and at Sunderland royal hospital that they are doing all they can to address the health inequalities that affect my constituency so badly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para22"><a name="08011057000451">Those inequalities are prevalent despite the excellent care that my constituents receive at those hospitals and across the wider north-east from skilled and dedicated staff. In the Sunderland metropolitan area, life expectancy is 18 months below the national average. Death rates from smoking, heart disease, strokes and cancer are all above the national average. The mortality rate for cancer is 136 per 100,000 compared with a national average of 119. Almost a third of children are dependent on means-tested benefits. That can be compared with a wealthy London Borough such as Kensington and Chelsea, where the cancer mortality rate is only 81 per 100,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para23"><a name="08011057000452">In Gateshead, life expectancy is almost two years below the national average. Again, deaths from smoking, heart disease, strokes and cancer are all above the national average. In fact, mortality rates for heart disease and strokes are at 110 per 100,000 compared with a national average of 90. The statistics create a compelling argument that cannot be ignored. It is a common-sense recognition that the more we can prevent killer diseases through medical progress and lifestyle change, the more savings we can make on health budgets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para24"><a name="08011057000453">Progress will be achieved only if primary care trusts and social care services work closely together to educate the public. Therefore, it is even more vital that we do not push the two services into a battle for funding so that gains for one only lead to losses for the other. That is why I am delighted about the recent provisional funding announcement, which will go some way to ending the problems that have been caused by the double damping of funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para25"><a name="08011057000454">In constituencies such as mine, health services need extra support to tackle ingrained public health problems. Many of us know the old sayings such as &#147;an apple a day&#148; and &#147;go to work on an egg&#148;, but in the current environment there is a risk that such simple messages can get lost in the myriad information and warnings about the impact of our chosen lifestyles.</p>

 It is pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Mrs. Hodgson). I immediately had a sense of affinity with her when she made her comments about her rough throat. I failed to take the preventive measure of a flu jab for the first time in 10 years, and the result was a miserable Christmas. I have a great deal of sympathy for her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para27"><a name="08011057000457">The debate concerns an issue for which there is no doubt universal support. No one objects to or resists the idea of preventive health care. It is in every citizen&#146;s interest that the NHS should focus on that. It is also in the NHS&#146;s interest. As Derek Wanless said when he advised the Government on NHS funding, unless we help people to care better for themselves, we will bankrupt the NHS; it is simply unsustainable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para28"><a name="08011057000458">The real debate is about whether the Government have delivered on preventive health measures and are likely to do so in future, as well as about the real meaning of the Prime Minister&#146;s speech on Monday. Like the Conservative spokesman, I was left with a degree of suspicion. It seems extraordinary that the announcement could have been made without discussion with the National Screening Committee or the involvement of clinicians or the British Medical Association. One is inevitably left with the sense that it is part of the big political battle over health and the Prime Minister&#146;s determination to recover lost ground on the health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para29"><a name="08011057000459">In a spirit of new year generosity, I will acknowledge that the Government have made some progress. For example, QOF&#151;the quality and outcomes framework&#151;introduced the idea of incentives to encourage primary care to engage in preventive measures. As the hon. Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West said, the screening programmes for breast cancer and bowel cancer have made progress. That should be acknowledged. I absolutely support the introduction of ultrasound screening for triple A, or abdominal aortic aneurysm, provided that it happens and is properly funded. As we have heard, the announcement was originally made some time ago and we are still waiting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80110-0010.htm_para30"><a name="08011057000460">The decision on vaccinations against cervical cancer was also absolutely right, and it will save lives. The debate is now about whether the programme can and should be extended to cover older age groups within the licence.

The national hip fracture database is a fantastic initiative to drive up standards and quality of care, and it focuses on preventing fractures. In the UK, 310,000 patients suffer fractures every year. The treatment of osteoporosis is key: 3 million people suffer from the disease, and the social and hospital care costs of their fractures amount to some &#163;2 billion a year. Proper treatment for all osteoporosis suffers could cut the fracture rate by 50 per cent., yet the Government have excluded osteoporosis treatment from the QOF arrangements in the negotiations that are under way. That is a big mistake. Osteoporosis was not mentioned in Monday&#146;s announcement, and the Government should think again.</p>

 This year, the NHS will have been in existence for 60 years. When I was preparing for this debate, the sobering thought occurred to me that I have been qualified for slightly more than half that time. I want to begin by paying a huge tribute to the 1.3 million people who work in the NHS, as they have created what I still believe is one of the best health services in the world, if not the very best.

However, we could not systematically screen patients, as we had no way to recall them or to call them in for checks. We certainly had no system to follow up everyone whose cholesterol was outside the normal range or whose blood pressure was over the top.</p>

Now, I work in a large, purpose-built surgery with 11 consulting rooms, eight partners and three full-time nurses. We have a professional team of managers to help us make sure that people are called in when necessary, and an enormous array of ancillary staff and health professionals are attached to the practice who offer a range of services that was simply unknown when I began as a GP. That has made a massive difference.</p>

Modern computerised systems and almost paper-free records mean that in a few seconds I can find out exactly how many people&#146;s cholesterol is above the recommended level, or how many people with diabetes have not had regular check-ups or the retinal screening that they need. The fact that GPs can do all that almost instantaneously means that we can contact people, call them in, remind them when they are due for health checks, and so on. That has made a massive difference to how people are treated, and makes screening and prevention a real possibility.</p>

 I recognise the changes for the better that have been introduced, but the hon. Gentleman will have seen the impact on public health budgets around the country and in his area of London.

 I listened to the hon. Gentleman very carefully, but I do not recognise the problem that he describes. The QOF system set up under the new GP contract is almost completely evidence based. It is reviewed every year by the British Medical Association and the Department of Heath to ensure that it reflects best practice. Everything that GPs do has a dedicated outcome and a proper scientific base, which means that we know that what we are doing is worthwhile medicine and that it genuinely improves patient care.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making an extremely good and effective speech, but he just mentioned that he can now get patients presenting with cancer or other serious symptoms a consultant-level appointment referral within two weeks. That is a fantastic improvement on the two or three months that it used to take. Does he agree that that would not have been conceivable without targets?

 My hon. Friend makes a valuable point, and it is deeply regrettable that the Opposition seem hell bent on getting rid of targets. He is right to say that targets have driven up standards in the NHS hugely and that they have massively improved patient outcomes. We are now able to measure the number of people with particular conditions. We can check that they are properly managed, recall those who need further treatment, and ensure that they are on the best drugs available. That is the way to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80110-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08011057000477">Although the history of prevention has not been very good, I have tried to make it clear that we are now at the point when we can take advantage of modern techniques to ensure that preventive medicine is used properly, but there are risks. As I noted in an earlier intervention, the previous Government appeared to want to improve patient outcomes and health but did not ensure that treatment was evidence based. The checks that doctors were required to carry out under the 1990 GP contract quickly led to disillusionment, because they were not based on anything that could be recognised as good patient care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80110-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08011057000478">The National Screening Committee has made it clear that it will recommend treatments to the Government only when there is evidence to prove their effectiveness. That is very important. There used to be the so-called &#147;stands to reason&#148; test among GPs: doctors would say that it stood to reason that measuring a person&#146;s blood pressure or cholesterol would do them some good. Yet that is not so, because there must be evidence that proves that interventions in those circumstance will change outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80110-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08011057000479">Getting such evidence is difficult, and that is why it has taken longer than I had hoped for the National Screening Committee to recommend triple A screening. It has now made that recommendation, because the evidence that that screening is worth spending on is now sufficiently solid. It has been shown that triple A screening can save around 1,600 lives a year among those men over 60 who are most prone to the diseases that it can detect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80110-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08011057000480">I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Men&#146;s Health Forum.

As a result of all our hard work, the Prime Minister has announced that the programme that we have been advocating would be taken up.

Unless we continue to reform the NHS and to reconfigure services, we will have no way to ensure that patients get access to the most modern treatments, in the most suitable setting and with the most appropriate staff mix. It is important that we continue our programme of reform, to ensure that all patients have access to what they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="80110-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08011057000482">Choice is also topical. In his latest speech, the Prime Minister said to us that he wants to make sure that patients are at the centre of choice. Patients now have a choice of where they are treated, to a large extent when they are treated, and to an increasing extent by whom they are treated. That is important, because if we are to expect people to take more responsibility for themselves and for their own health care, they have to have access to the information they need, and they have to feel that they, not the Government and not necessarily their doctor, are in charge of their condition. It is their condition, their body and their future; they must be central to making decisions on what happens. I believe that if we give patients that right, they will rise to the occasion and take the responsibility to improve their own health outcome, which will be important to improving their long-term condition.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has just beaten me to it&#151;I was about to mention osteoporosis and pay tribute to him for his comments in that respect. I entirely agree with him that osteoporosis is a worthwhile subject, certainly in terms of secondary screening and prevention. Someone who has had a low-impact fracture&#151;one resulting from a fall rather than a strike by a moving object&#151;should be screened for osteoporosis. People who fracture a joint or a bone in a fall should have a DEXA scan to ensure that they do not have osteoporosis; and if they do have the condition, they can be given appropriate treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="80110-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08011057000486">Like the hon. Gentleman, I have been calling for osteoporosis to be introduced into the QOF. In fact, only a few weeks ago, I spoke to Laurence Buckman of the BMA and tried to persuade him to ensure that it was put on the agenda for future QOF discussions. We will have to watch this space. Again, however, we will have to ensure that the evidence is there before we rush to decide whether it is a good idea or a bad one. I think that it is a good idea, and I hope that the screening committee will come to share that view in due course.</p>

 I do not think that the two aims are mutually exclusive. One of the points I wanted to discuss is capacity in the NHS. The Government&#146;s current policy, which I entirely support, is to ensure that people are treated in the most appropriate place, preferably near their own home, if that is possible. That entails moving more facilities into the community. As I said, that is already happening in my area. More clinics and services are available within communities; people have more things done in the local surgery and they can attend clinics in their local town. However, there is a big issue of capacity in the NHS. We have to decide how the extra work can best and most appropriately be distributed to the health professionals we have available. In general practice, as I said, I now have three full-time nurses, whereas previously I had none. However, we need more: we need health care assistants, so that the nurses can pass on some of the more routine work to them and get on with the clinical management of patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="80110-0011.htm_para19"><a name="08011057000489">The biggest untapped area of capacity in the NHS is pharmacy. I am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Minister of State mentioned pharmacy in her opening speech. We need to maximise the use of all parts of the NHS, and pharmacy is an important part. Almost every community has a pharmacy at its centre; almost all high streets have a pharmacy. Pharmacies are already open for the extended hours that the Government want primary care to be available, and they already provide out-of-hours services. Pharmacists are well motivated and highly trained professionals who, to a large extent, know their patients. I believe that, with the right negotiations with the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee and others, a good deal could be reached to ensure that pharmacists&#146; expertise and capacity are fully utilised for the benefit of patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="80110-0011.htm_para20"><a name="08011057000490">I envisage pharmacists becoming far more involved in screening. They can take blood pressure and cholesterol measurements, recall people for follow-up as necessary, and work with local GPs and others to ensure that that capacity is best used. As part of the launch of the pharmacy White Paper, I urge my right hon. Friend to include pharmacy as much as possible in the new screening programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="80110-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08011057000493">Today, I shall talk about something that affects people in every constituency in the country, but that has been a fairly acute problem in my area: the treatment of wet-eye age-related macular degeneration. Each year, the condition affects about 40 people in every constituency in the country, and it is the most common cause of blindness. The condition is treatable through a simple series of injections, which either stops the loss of sight that would end in blindness, or restores sight that has been lost. Several drugs are licensed for the purpose; the two most commonly used are Lucentis and Macugen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80110-0011.htm_para23"><a name="08011057000494">It is fairly easy for a patient to recognise the symptoms&#151;they are losing their sight&#151;so they go to their GP, who immediately refers them to a consultant. The consultant sees the patient, then tells him, &#147;You have wet-eye AMD. You could go blind within three months. The good news is that a simple series of injections will stop you going blind. The bad news is that you cannot have it on the NHS&#151;but come and see me two miles down the road, and I&#146;ll treat you at &#163;800 per injection.&#148; The NHS is saying to people that they can go blind, or they can go private and pay for treatment.</p>

At Prime Minister&#146;s questions, he rightly said&#151;I paraphrase&#151;that the situation was not right, but that it was a matter for NICE. Surprisingly, just two weeks after he said that, NICE came up with some guidance. The Royal National Institute of Blind People issued a press release immediately afterwards, entitled &#147;NICE delivers early Christmas present to thousands at risk of going blind&#148;. NICE said that primary care trusts should treat people who have wet age-related macular degeneration immediately with the new, approved drugs, Lucentis and Macugen. It put that guidance out to consultation.</p>

That is outrageous and there is no moral justification for it. We are talking about spending a few hundred pounds on action that will prevent people from going blind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80110-0011.htm_para30"><a name="08011057000501">The amount that the NHS would have to pay for treatment for someone who goes blind is enormous. Also, what about all the social consequences? I have a constituent, Mrs. Doreen Marshall, a lovely lady in her 80s. She is the carer for her husband, who is in his 90s, and who has some disability problems. They live separately, and they are not a burden to the state. She is going blind in both eyes. If she had not paid to have the treatment privately, the state would have had to pay out millions of pounds over the next few years. It is preventive health services of that kind that the Government are keen for PCTs to take note of. Luckily for Mrs. Marshall, a private company paid her treatment bills. When the Minister winds up, I ask her to reiterate what the Prime Minister said on the subject: PCTs should take notice of what NICE has just said, and should, as a matter of urgency, start to treat people who would otherwise go blind.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone). I know that he takes preventive health seriously, because we have been in the gym at the same time twice this week, so I congratulate him on the efforts that he makes. I will focus on one small, specific issue to do with preventive health services, so as to allow other Members their full time allocation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para0"><a name="08011057000503">The debate is topical because of the structural changes to Sport England. One might wonder why on earth that was a matter for a topical debate on the health service. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is rightly making Sport England concentrate on sport. That means that a vast amount of work is being done&#151;work that is increasingly important to all of us who have campaigned on sports and physical activity issues over the past decade. We recognise that the Department of Health, through the PCTs working with agencies such as local government, will be vital to increasing participation in physical activity and sport. That is needed if we are to prevent problems arising from what is probably the most important issue facing the country&#151;the levels of obesity that are likely in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08011057000504">The Foresight report demonstrated that by 2050, if no action is taken, or even if current levels of action are maintained, it is likely that up to 65 per cent. of men and 50 per cent. of women will be clinically obese.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 Jan 2008">

<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column 571</b><br>
That means that 40 per cent. of the national health service budget will be taken up by that issue. If there is a ticking time bomb, it is obesity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08011057000505">My hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) has been at the forefront of campaigning on the matter for a decade, and I follow. I am glad that he spoke on another topic today. If he had spoken about obesity, he would be the expert on it. We have talked anecdotally about the impact of obesity, but the Foresight report and some of the work that has been done by NICE, which is a well kept secret and does not seem to be in the public domain, has demonstrated that tackling physical activity levels and building in lifestyle changes to deal with obesity is one of the most cost-effective steps that we can take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08011057000506">I have some figures. NICE works on the basis that it would recommend a drug up to a cost limit of &#163;20,000 per life year. By contrast, the work that it has done on physical activity in the workplace and obesity, and the work that it is doing on physical activity and the environment, indicate a cost of just &#163;1,000 per life year for the introduction of physical activity. So as most speakers have said, prevention is better than cure. If we spend &#163;1,000 now, the likelihood is that we are helping to avoid the prospect of 40 per cent. of the health service budget in 2050 being devoted solely to tackling the problems of obesity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para4"><a name="08011057000507">I am one of those who has been going around saying that obesity will kill the present generation and our life chances will be reduced. We could be the first generation to see a reduction in our life expectancy. Foresight and some of the work carried out by NICE suggest that that is a myth. The reality and the problem is that obesity is an inefficient killer. That is not much consolation. Obesity makes us ill for a long time. It reduces our life chances eventually, but in the meantime we are an enormous burden on the national health service. More importantly for the individual, it is an enormous burden on their lifestyle. We need to make sure that obesity is at the top of the health agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08011057000508">In this crucial period during which the future direction of Sport England is decided, the Department should make it clear that it is willing to work with PCTs in local partnerships including county sports partnerships and local authorities, to encourage physical activity and bring about lifestyle changes. The Department cannot shirk that responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08011057000509">Now that the importance of school sports is recognised, about 30 per cent. of those leaving school will take part in activities that we recognise as sport&#151;team games and organised sporting activity. About 50 per cent., hopefully, will want to have a fairly active lifestyle and engage in other activities that reduce our chances of becoming obese. But 10 to 20 per cent. will require interventions, and that is where more work is needed&#151;for example, among young girls aged 13 or 14, where there is a significant drop-off in participation rates, among young Asian women, who have cultural issues, and among those with disability and special needs, who are still missing out on sporting activity in schools. Those who are involved in school sport and even the Youth Sport Trust, in discussions this week, recognise that progress has been made elsewhere, but admit that it is lacking for those with disabilities and special needs at school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08011057000510">Over the coming weeks and months, while Sport England is developing a strategy, it is crucial that the Department of Health offers guidance and support to PCTs to ensure that sport is delivered at a local level. Local partnerships exist already. I chair my own county sports partnerships. We are fortunate that the director of public health in Leicestershire is a triathlete. He is part-funded by the PCT and part-funded by the local authority. That situation represents a win-win, but it does not necessarily replicate itself around the country. In schools a decade ago, if there was a good head who was interested in sports, sport happened at the school. I want to make sure that for sport, there is no postcode lottery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08011057000511">Some PCTs have demonstrated the good practice of GP referral schemes, physical activity co-ordinators, creating the built environment and workplace activity. We should recognise that people&#146;s lifestyles are changing dramatically, particularly from a sports perspective. By 2010, 65 per cent. of people will be working an atypical working week, so working 9 to 5 or a 3 o&#146;clock kick-off for a football or rugby game will no longer be the norm. Sport, physical activity and recreation must take account of that shift in balance. That is why the workplace will be increasingly important. Governing bodies of sport and others need to try and work out what form sport and physical activity will take in the next 10 to 20 years. It will be very different. Everyone knows how difficult it is after a long day at work to come home and motivate oneself to go back out to do something physical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08011057000512">We know that 20 per cent. of people will always be keen to do sport and physical activity and another 20 per cent. can be encouraged, but the couch potatoes and others in the middle should not be put off or frightened by the prospect of having to take up a sport or to do something really dramatic such as joining a gym, because we can build a lot of activity into our daily lives. The World Health Organisation target of five times 30 minutes of moderate activity a week needs to be explained to people. We may be at the slightly difficult level of talking about active hoovering, but moderate exercise such as gardening and walking is enough to meet the WHO definition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08011057000513">We need to ensure that in our social marketing, which will probably be one of the most important things that we do, we sell the idea of building physical activity into our daily lives. I do not envy the Government because I have seen the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology paper on changing behaviour, which says that that is one of the hardest things to do. The problem is that everyone recognises the need to change their behaviour in order to reduce the potential for obesity, but as with new year resolutions, we may do well until the end of January but come February all resolve goes out of the window. We must change the whole way in which we lead our lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08011057000514">I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister met the premier rugby clubs recently who have been working on behalf of the Department on the five-a-day campaign. I visited Saracens rugby club to see its community programme and went to some of the schools with the players. The motivation that results from being told by a leading sports star to eat five portions of fruit or vegetables a day is far greater than  <br>

when a politician, someone in a white coat, or even&#151;with all due respect&#151;a doctor says so. I saw the motivation created as a result of the programme being delivered by sportspeople throughout the country, and I would urge that there should be a connection between sport and more moderate levels of physical activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08011057000515">This is a topical debate because the next few weeks, or possibly the next couple of months, will be crucial to delivering what most of us in sport have wanted for a decade or so, and that is for the Department for Health to take a real interest in increasing physical activity and changing lifestyles to tackle the obesity time bomb that is heading our way.</p>

 I thank those hon. Members who have spoken recently for accelerating to give me nearly my full time. I understand that the Minister will also be very generous and has said that she can manage with four minutes. I shall try to give her a little longer, but I am grateful for this opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08011057000517">I always enjoy following my friend on the Health Committee, the hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate), the only other doctor. I can cap his years in the NHS by quite some time, and I remember the terrible things that we used to do. We carried around hatpins with red knobs to test visual fields, and the sharp end we used to test for sensation from patient to patient to patient. Can you imagine it? Things have moved on tremendously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08011057000518">I shall be slightly pedantic and separate prevention from screening, because they are quite different and I do not want us to lose sight of the well-established preventive techniques that are essential because we are rushing to screening, which may not be so evidence-based. I do not need to mention stopping smoking because obviously the effect of not smoking in public places is already showing benefits in the reduction in heart attacks. That is absolutely incredible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08011057000519">Tackling obesity, as the hon. Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed) said, is crucial. I am sure the Minister is aware that one of the recommendations in the Health Committee report in 2004 on obesity was that there should be a specific Cabinet public health committee, chaired by the Secretary of State for Health, but bringing together Ministers with responsibility for health, education, sport, transport, trade and industry, environment, food and rural affairs and work and pensions&#151;the whole shooting match. When the Government responded to the report they said that such a Committee had been set up and I should like to know whether it is still active and what it has achieved, because that was important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08011057000520">I have just one quick point to raise on inoculation. The absolute value of inoculation is dramatically demonstrated when we hear about the greatest cause of death among children on the African continent&#151;it is not HIV, malaria or tuberculosis, but the pneumococcus. We have virtually eradicated that here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08011057000521">Prevention of sexually transmitted infections is vital. In the Health Committee report on that, we recognised the huge importance of sexual and relationship education, or SRE, at schools and recommended that it should become a core part of the national curriculum.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 Jan 2008">

<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column 574</b><br>
The Government response, just three months later, stated that SRE was a statutory requirement; I was never clear about whether it had been all the time or we had achieved it. The Government also said that they had asked Ofsted to report specifically on the progress of SRE teaching. Is that being done?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08011057000522">The Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology drew attention to the other alarming thing about HIV/AIDS in its recent note about the condition in the UK. People are less scared of HIV/AIDS than initially because it is now controllable, but the salutary warning is that the fastest increase in HIV/AIDS is happening among men who have sex with men. They are white men, who in the vast majority of cases acquire the disease in this country. The horrifying figure is that about one in 20 men between the ages of 15 and 44 who have sex with men are HIV-positive. The problem is huge; as we rush to screening, we must not forget the well proven bits of health prevention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08011057000523">I was delighted that the Minister mentioned the National Screening Committee because when I heard the Prime Minister&#146;s comments I wondered whether he had taken that into account. Certainly, aspects of cancer screening and screening for sexually transmitted infections are well established. However, as many hon. Members have said, blanket and not necessarily targeted screening for a wide range of conditions has not yet proved worth while.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08011057000524">I turn to screening for abdominal aortic aneurisms. My search on the website is obviously a few months out of date because I did not know that the National Screening Committee had got to the stage of recommending it. I found its draft studies on the issue and was horrified by the extent of the problem&#151;the number of people who would have to be screened and of staff who would have to be trained to do the screening. After that, there would have to be many people in vascular surgery departments to mend the aneurisms that had gone beyond certain limits. Once an aneurism is above a certain size, it has to be followed regularly, which involves more scans. I would love to know from the Minister that all that has been taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para21"><a name="08011057000525">I shall end by quoting something from that bible for doctors, the Merck manual. It emphasises some of what the Minister has already said:</p>
<a name="80110-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="08011057000914"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The premises of screening are that early detection of disease can improve outcomes in patients with occult disease and that the false-positive results that often occur during screening do not create a burden that exceeds the benefit of early detection.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para22"><a name="08011057000526">The paragraph concludes:</p>
<a name="80110-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="08011057000915"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If 12 different tests for 12 different diseases were done, the chance of at least one false-positive result is 46 per cent.! This underscores the need for caution when deciding on a panel of screening tests and interpreting the results.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para23"><a name="08011057000528">My hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Mrs. Hodgson) made an excellent speech in which she made two points. First, she drew attention to health inequalities and the importance of the role of prevention and strategies linked with public health policies to ensure that we reach out to hard-to-reach groups. As my hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed) noted in his important contribution, that must go much wider than just the health services themselves. The most important aspect of public health policy is the combination of understanding the risks and the causes and bringing together the public services, the voluntary and community sector and organisations such as Sport England to bear down on the particular issues that we need to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para24"><a name="08011057000529">My hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West is absolutely right as regards her second point on the importance of symptom awareness and early detection leading to treatment. As she and the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) said, screening matters. We must understand clearly the distinction between prevention strategies for ill health and all the various strategies that we can deploy, and use screening when necessary, when proven and when it gives the required outcome, quickly followed by the appropriate treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para25"><a name="08011057000530">The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) talked about human papilloma virus and vaccinations up to the age of 26. We are following the advice that has been given to us by the scientific bodies about where it is best to use such vaccination. This is about prevention, not treatment; that has been a theme throughout the debate. He also made an important point about financial incentives in the health service and how we can ensure that they are not skewed only to ill-health treatment. I assure him that the operating and outcomes framework issued to the national health service this December has many public health objectives within it and seeks to address exactly the point that he raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para26"><a name="08011057000531">My hon. Friend the Member for Dartford, eloquently using his experience, as ever, talked about the transformation in the health service and the enormous possibilities that exist to intervene speedily in cancers and other areas given early diagnosis and the crucial importance of screening, with a balance across all the fields. I entirely agree with him about pharmacies. They are a great untapped resource which will expand access in the NHS and ensure that we all get the appropriate treatment at the right time, and that we are able to be involved in and control our own health and well-being and to understand much more about the causes of ill health and therefore how we, as individuals, have a role to play in preventing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="80110-0012.htm_para27"><a name="08011057000532">I was sorry to hear the comments of the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) about wet-eye macular degeneration. He, with others, has been a great advocate in that regard in this House. We are talking specifically about a certain treatment. Although the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has not made a final determination, I have been clear in this House and in correspondence that until that happens the primary care trust should not refuse treatment in this area for any other reason than on a clinical basis&#151;that is the clear guidance given to PCTs. I am happy to consider the matter further and pursue it for him if he will send me the correspondence.</p>

I absolutely agree with him about the fantastic scheme that the Saracens are running, and about the importance of a comprehensive approach.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="80110-0013.htm_para0"><a name="08011057000550">I welcome the opportunity to debate issues relating to the men and women of the armed forces. It is common ground that they are remarkable people, who perform extremely difficult and arduous tasks in some of the most dangerous places in the world. I have been deeply impressed by their work and, especially through my visits to Iraq and Afghanistan, I have seen at first hand the magnificent efforts that they make. Everything we achieve is down to them and they have my deepest gratitude and most profound respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80110-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08011057000551">As a Government, we have a duty to ensure that we offer armed services personnel&#151;and their families&#151;the support that they need and deserve. Delivering that poses several challenges, but I believe that the Government are rising to meet them and will continue to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="80110-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08011057000552">In the past 18 months, we have made real improvements to the welfare package that we offer our forces. I will not list them all in detail here, but they include: the introduction of a tax-free operational bonus of &#163;2,230; council tax discount for those on operations; free post; more free telephone calls and internet access; a new child care voucher scheme that can be used both in the UK and overseas; improvements to mental health treatment; a military managed ward at Selly Oak, and an increase in the number of military nurses there. That is alongside all the improvements made to ensure that those serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have the best equipment and kit possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="80110-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08011057000553">Hon. Members will have seen reports in the media this morning about a small number of UK service personnel and civilians who received life-saving emergency blood transfusions of US blood while deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. That blood might not have had a valid retrospective test. First, I should stress that the blood transfusions saved those people&#146;s lives. However, even though only a small number of personnel&#151;18&#151;are affected and the risks of infection are very low, we take the matter extremely seriously. Immediately on learning about the risk to our people, my Department acted quickly and promptly to establish who might be involved and where those people were and to ensure that they were offered the appropriate support, counselling and testing. All 18 UK service personnel, whether still serving or veterans, have now been contacted. I would like to reassure hon. Members that, while our own procedures for blood transfusions on operations are robust, we are not complacent and review them regularly.</p>

Families have a key role in supporting their loved ones. Without them, the British armed forces could not be the success story they are. The frequency with which they are required to move location affects their access to health services, the education for their children, employment prospects for partners and, obviously, their personal relationships. We need to take stock of what we have already achieved and what more is needed.</p>

The personnel Command Paper will consider the progress already made, identify areas for improvement and propose new initiatives for our and other Departments. Key matters on which we will concentrate include accommodation, education, health, welfare and social care and inquests, and veterans support, which cuts across many of those issues and others.</p>

 I welcome the review of accommodation because it is important. However, given that the cross-party Public Accounts Committee has described nearly half of all service accommodation as substandard and that the Army&#146;s surveys show that half the soldiers feel that the maintenance of their accommodation is not what it should be, does the Secretary of State at least understand the strong feeling of many soldiers that the Government have forgotten the first world war concept of &#147;homes fit for heroes&#148;?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, which I shall tackle in more detail in my speech. To give the matter, which is so important to our armed forces, the priority that it deserves, I shall respond to his point generally now and deal with some aspects in more detail in a few moments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="80110-0013.htm_para6"><a name="08011057000558">The hon. Gentleman is right to identify the issue as an important one. I would have more respect for him if his memory of how we came to be in this position was a bit more comprehensive than it appears to be. I say that because we have discussed the issue over some months and I have been impressed by the ability of hon. Members on both sides of the House to recognise that it is a legacy problem, arising from a failure to invest in that accommodation over many decades&#151;and, in some cases, over the best part of a century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80110-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08011057000559">That means that all of us in the House have a responsibility. The issue needs to be addressed in this century, and within a reasonable time period. My responsibility as the Secretary of State is to identify the resources, and a time scale and a programme of work that are reasonable, taking into account all the other challenges that go with dealing with accommodation. They include the fact that we have busy armed forces that have to operate in the same environment in which we carry out that work and the fact that people have to live there. There must be a recognition of the capacity challenge in relation to our ability to do that and the logistical challenge in relation to planning. I have repeatedly set out our plans on that and will do so again in this speech. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that that is insufficient&#151;that there is a faster and more efficient way of doing the work and that his party intends to put in additional resources of such a scale that the work will be completed quicker&#151;he should give us chapter and verse on that. I would be pleased to hear that, because I have heard no such arguments from anybody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80110-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08011057000560">We have to accept that the responsibility will stretch over a period of time.

Gentleman to go round the estate and visit the places where those improvements are not just manifest, but are being enjoyed on a considerable scale by our armed forces. He has that invitation, and he can rise to his feet to tell me that he accepts it. If he does, I will make arrangements for him to go and see some of the best, as well as some of the worst if he likes.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that the problem with the example of the Hounslow barracks, to which the hon.

That decision must be taken before the major investments come forward, so although Hounslow is an example of bad practice, it is also a false example.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing that out. It would not serve this debate well for me to go through all the individual challenges that we face in accommodation and on the estate. It would serve us and our relationship with the armed forces well if we recognised that the issue has been neglected for far too long and that it is now being addressed on a scale that will improve the situation within a reasonable period of time. I will ensure that the resources that are devoted to that are properly invested and that if I find more, I will devote them to it, bearing in mind the challenges created by other work going on across the country on securing the building capacity to carry it out.</p>

 The issues that underpin the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question generate a significant amount of support across the House and in our wider society, as is also seen in campaigns to achieve the same.

Taking decisions about whether medals should be struck for service, valour or other contributions involves a process that this Department reports and accounts for, but in respect of which decision making lies outside and independent of that Department, which is as it should be. The assessment of whether recommendations should be made to the independent committee is made in the traditional way&#151;and it is now constitutional, I believe, as it is a convention of the constitution that is well practised by the chiefs of staff. That is where it is should lie. That is why, when I am constantly invited to express views about this issue, I resist the temptation to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80110-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08011057000573">Candidly, at the end of the day, if most politicians are honest with themselves, we all understand why it is better if politicians stand well away from this particular form of Executive decision making. I suspect that if it were left to politicians, there would be a tendency to over-decorate and present awards and baubles to too many people. That is not what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting, but I think that he understands my point, which is why the convention exists. I trust that he will allow me to respect that convention, without diminishing my tribute to the motivation that underpins his argument.</p>

they get back to the United Kingdom rather than on the first hour or two after suffering their injuries. However, if we want to ensure that they live, the first hour or two is the most important time for intervention. Is he confident that we do everything that we can in theatre and that we explore every scientific advance to ensure that as many of our casualties as possible are kept alive?</p>

 I unequivocally assure my hon. Friend that, if not the best, we are as good as the best in the world in the medical care that we provide to our forces in operations. I believe that I have made a total of 12 visits to Iraq and Afghanistan in the last 18 months and on every occasion, if my memory serves me correctly, I have made a point of attending the hospital and medical facilities in order to pay respect to, and admire, the enormous skill displayed there. The equipment is second to none and the facilities are second to none. That is now playing through.</p>

The success of their treatment during that period and thereafter is second to none. I believe that those people are receiving the best possible treatment, and that the centre is the match of the best polytrauma centres in civilian hospitals and the equal of any other military medical facility in the world. That is to the credit of those who&#151;during our time in office, but before that as well&#151;have met the difficult challenges of designing a modern medical facility and service. By common consent it was not always the best that it could have been, but I believe that it is now.</p>

As I have said before, along with the chiefs of staff, they are stretched. We are asking a great deal of our service personnel, and the operational tempo is high. However, we have taken decisive action to address that. In the last 12 months alone, we have reduced our commitments in Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Iraq. Between July and September this year, 17 per cent. of regular forces were deployed on operations. That is a reduction of 5 per cent. on the previous quarter. This spring, conditions permitting and subject to the advice of commanders on the ground, we aim to improve on that and reduce numbers in Iraq further.</p>

infantrymen have accepted it. Contrary to what hon. Members may have been led to believe by recent media reports, recruitment to the armed forces has increased. The most recent annual statistics show an increase in the number joining the forces. In 2006-07, we gained 19,790 new recruits from civilian life&#151;99.6 per cent. of the target. That is an increase of 9.3 per cent. Army recruiting increased by 8 per cent. during the last financial year, with infantry enlistments up by 25 per cent.</p>

 I thank the Secretary of State for his generosity in giving way again. The fact remains that while recruitment may be improving, he knows very well that retention in training is appalling&#151;40 per cent. of infantry recruits fall out&#151;and retention in service is equally dreadful. Will he be quite clear about the depth of the crisis that faces, in particular, our combat arms, many of which are having to deploy at 50 per cent. of their combat effectiveness?</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman knows, I have enormous respect for his knowledge of the circumstances, but I do not accept that there is a crisis, although I do accept that there are issues in relation to retention. We are operating in an employment market that is very different from the one in which the forces operated 10 years or more ago, when many young men in my constituency had no alternative but to join the armed forces. We are competing now. Another crucially important point is that the added value of an armed forces training makes it a very valuable commodity. The private sector is competing to attract away from the armed forces people whom we have formed, matured and trained to a level which, in my view, would not be reached in any other walk of life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80110-0013.htm_para19"><a name="08011057000582">Those are the realities, and they face not just our armed forces but armed forces throughout the developed world. All the Defence Ministers to whom I speak face the same challenges and problems. I recognise that we must develop methods, along with a modern response to the armed forces by society which is such that people will not only volunteer or allow themselves to be recruited but, once trained and effective, will stay in the forces and continue to contribute. We have had considerable success in some areas, although there are issues which I do not seek to avoid. The retention incentives need to be developed&#151;and we have been developing them with some success, as is clear from the examples that I have given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="80110-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08011057000583">Obviously, a high percentage of personnel are currently deployed on operations and, because of that, harmony levels have been affected. Harmony levels have, however, improved over the past year by 3 per cent. for the Army, and they have remained steady for the Royal Navy, but they have worsened for the RAF, with 6.7 per cent. breaching harmony compared with 2.9 per cent. a year ago. I am grateful to all our personnel for their efforts, but particularly to those whose harmony guidelines have not been met. We have a duty to recognise such commitment; living up to that duty underpins everything I have set out today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80110-0013.htm_para21"><a name="08011057000584">In recognition of the Government&#146;s commitment to the armed forces, we granted them the best public sector pay deal last year: 3.3 per cent. In particular, we addressed the concerns of the lowest ranks by increasing their pay by more than 9 per cent. In fact, in all but one of the last five years armed forces salary growth has exceeded that of the whole economy.</p>

In the last financial year, we delivered 5,822 modernised bed spaces; this financial year, we expect to deliver approximately 7,000 modernised bed spaces, and in the next financial year we also plan to deliver 7,000 bed spaces. Overall, it is expected that about 60,000 modernised bed spaces will be delivered by April 2013.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80110-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08011057000586">For the last year our public position has been that some &#163;5 billion will be spent on housing and other accommodation over the next decade. That figure was an extrapolation of future spend based, in part, on current spending levels, and was made before the outcome of the comprehensive spending review was known. However, the &#163;5 billion figure did not take into account a number of large private finance initiative projects that include living accommodation. The most notable of them is Project Allenby/Connaught, which will provide modern living and working accommodation for some 18,000 military and civilian personnel in the Salisbury plain and Aldershot garrisons. Maintenance and leasing of service families accommodation and single living accommodation worldwide was also excluded. In addition, the amount we plan to spend on maintenance work is now higher than that included in the &#163;5 billion figure. Accordingly, we have reassessed our likely spend on accommodation for the next 10 years to take account of those elements previously excluded. The total amount will in fact be &#163;8.4 billion. Of that, &#163;3.1 billion will be spent on new-build and upgraded accommodation, &#163;2.3 billion on refurbishment and maintenance and &#163;3 billion on routine costs, including rent, other leasing costs and the equivalent of council tax. Over that same period, we also expect to receive &#163;2.4 billion in rental income from service personnel, leaving a net expenditure of &#163;6 billion.</p>

We already have in place the offer of a personal loan towards a deposit after four years of service, but I think that we can improve on that and, as part of the Command Paper, work is being done to introduce arrangements to make housing more affordable for military families. We have also just extended the key worker status scheme so that all servicemen and women can qualify for the open market homebuy scheme&#151;a scheme that can boost the buying power of a forces family by up to a third. Finally, we have agreed with the Department for Communities and Local Government that those leaving the services will have access to social housing on a par with everyone else in the area in which they will settle; they will no longer go to the bottom of the local authority housing lists as they did before.</p>

 May I fully associate myself and the Conservative party with the praise offered by the Secretary of State for the courage, professionalism and sacrifices of our armed forces? As we all recover from the celebration and, in some cases, the excesses of the Christmas period, it is worth remembering that this time of year brings hardship and sacrifice to the family members of some of our armed forces. Unfortunately, war does not stop for Christmas, and our brave servicemen and women, along with their families, have done an outstanding job 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the holiday season. While the rest of the country enjoyed the Christmas break, they were defending our security every single minute.</p>

That is why spin for political gain is so damaging.</p>

No doubt it made many family members very happy to learn that their loved ones might come home in time for Christmas. But like everything else to do with this Government and the armed forces, one has to take a close look at the small print. We now know that when the Prime Minister made his announcement in early October he had given himself a head start of almost 500 troops. Figures released by the Government show that on 9 September, three weeks before the Prime Minister&#146;s announcement, there were only 5,030 troops in Iraq, not the 5,500 that he mentioned in his announcement.</p>

During the same period, MOD figures show that the total number of British troops deployed in support of the mission in Iraq, but based elsewhere in the Gulf in Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and at sea, has actually increased by 570. Far from being home by Christmas, British personnel were simply deployed to other locations in the Gulf region. Whether one is in Iraq or somewhere else, separation is still separation and there must have been many disappointed households this Christmas.</p>

 They do indeed. I am not complaining about the military decisions or the presence of the personnel: I am complaining about the fact that the Prime Minister purposely gave one impression, knowing that it was at least partly not true even as he said it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80110-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08011057000604">During the last defence policy debate on 16 October, the Secretary of State hinted that he was willing to give personnel diverted from service in Iraq to other bases in the region the operational allowance. Now we know, according to a letter sent from his Department to the three services on 2 November, that some British personnel based in Kuwait, specifically at Camp Beuhring the Kuwait support facility, are now entitled to the operational allowance. The appropriate section from the letter states:</p>
<a name="80110-0014.htm_brev0"><a name="08011057000917"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Following advice from PJHQ, the qualifying locations have been reviewed and personnel deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan are to continue to receive the Allowance. That said, personnel who are soon to relocate from Iraq to Beuhring in Kuwait will continue to be eligible for the Operational Allowance, as they will support coalition operations in Iraq.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80110-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08011057000605">Is that clear? Not really, because by that argument one would have thought that those at Al-Udeid in Qatar or working with Nimrods in Oman, or those elsewhere in Kuwait, were also supporting coalition operations in Iraq. But the letter goes on:</p>
<a name="80110-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="08011057000918"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Other Service personnel deployed to Kuwait will not be eligible for the Allowance.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80110-0014.htm_para14"><a name="08011057000606">The Secretary of State dug a hole for himself during the debate on 16 October and frantic talks were held with the Treasury to do something to get him out of it. But rather than a fair remuneration package that supports all personnel deployed in support of both Operations Telic and Herrick, including those in Kuwait, and the wider Gulf region, the Government have produced an inconsistent, incoherent mish-mash. We now have a shambolic situation whereby some personnel in Kuwait will receive the operational allowance while others will not. Those supporting Nimrod reconnaissance missions in the Gulf, the dangers of which have been highlighted, will not receive it. Does anyone seriously think that that is a fair or satisfactory state of affairs?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80110-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08011057000607">That brings us to a related issue. Troops in Iraq are rightly given some recognition with the award of the Iraq medal. Is that medal now to be given to the personnel serving in Kuwait who also receive the operational allowance? One would think that that would only be logical. How can troops be given the operational allowance based on the personal danger to them and not be given the medal? Will they get it?</p>

 I am grateful for that assurance, but I would have thought that the Secretary of State and his Ministers would want to know about that when making decisions. Such things impact on morale. If those serving get different allowances and if different people who serve together may or may not get a medal, the whole thing is a bit of a dog&#146;s breakfast.</p>

It is a simple question. Either they will or they will not. The Secretary of State seems to be telling us that the Government do not really know who gets medals, whether that is related to the allowance or whether the council tax rebate will be related to the operational allowance. That is not a satisfactory state of affairs. The movement of troops on such a scale was in the planning process for weeks if not months. Surely Ministers have simply forgotten, ignored or not bothered to understand the complexity and interaction of the separate issues.</p>

We are left with a situation where some troops in Kuwait will get the operational allowance while others will not. Troops just across the border in Iraq will get the Operation Telic medal, but those receiving the operational allowance in Kuwait might not. Thousands of British troops across the Gulf region who do important jobs supporting operations in Iraq and Afghanistan might get nothing at all. What sort of message does that send out to our forces? It is no wonder there is a problem with retention and morale.</p>

Is the Department reviewing the affordability of the military pension and, if so, is that as a result of Treasury pressure? If a review is under way, the armed forces and the House will want to know why the work is being undertaken, who is undertaking it and what terms of reference have been issued to the review team.

The Government&#146;s catastrophic decision in 2004 to cut the helicopter budget by &#163;1.4 billion is now biting hard. Even some of the excellent new Mastiff armoured vehicles&#151;I give the Government full credit in that respect&#151;are sitting idle because of a lack of spare parts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80110-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08011057000626">In personnel and manning, the numbers are only getting worse, despite the gloss the Secretary of State tried to put on them. In April last year, the Government&#146;s own agency reported that the British armed forces were 5,790 trained personnel short; in December last year, we learned that, in the span of six months, that figure had increased by 1,240 to more than 7,000. The position is deteriorating&#151;it is reaching crisis point. That is a scandal.</p>

That is a drastic reduction, given that that period covers major operations in Kosovo, Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq, but it reflects where defence comes in this Government&#146;s priorities. The first duty of Government is the defence and security of the British people. In using our armed forces personnel for that purpose, the Government have a responsibility and moral obligation to ensure that they are fully trained and fully equipped and that their families are adequately cared for. To date, this Government have failed&#151;not only part-time, but second rate.</p>

In a strong economy such as ours, the competition for well trained, highly skilled people is fierce in every sector, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said. However, the nature of the work and the dangers that come with being a member of the British armed forces make that problem especially acute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="80110-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08011057000636">Each year, we need about 20,000 new recruits to retain our operational capability, and I am encouraged by the figures that my right hon. Friend gave. In 2006-07, there were 19,790 new recruits, which is an improvement on previous years. That is a positive sign, but we need to do more to keep that level of recruitment, and to maintain the strength of our armed forces. Our success in recruiting personnel and retaining those in service is bound to be affected by how they are treated, and how they seem to be treated. My mission statement when I was a Defence Minister was simply this: we will value our servicemen and women and their families. We will value our reserves, our cadets and their families and employers, and our veterans and their widows and families, and we will do everything in our power to demonstrate that. We can begin to demonstrate that we value them by ensuring that they have the most attractive pay and benefits package in the jobs market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="80110-0015.htm_para14"><a name="08011057000637">We must address the problem of the cultural drift that I sense between society and the armed forces. Fewer and fewer people have any idea of what it is like to serve in the armed forces, because fewer people know someone who is serving in the armed forces, or who has had military experience. That is why we must make sure that young people can have a taste of military life while they are at school. I welcome the pilot scheme to extend combined cadet forces to state schools.</p>

<p><a name="st_o325"><a name="08011057000638"><a name="80110-0015.htm_spnew3"><a name="08011057001308"><b>Tony Baldry (Banbury) (Con):</b>
 The right hon. Gentleman gave great service as a Defence Minister; he was much respected for what he did. There is an unnecessary disconnect. Does he agree that the public response to the &#147;help for heroes&#148; appeal in national newspapers before Christmas was outstanding, but that the fact that the appeal was necessary shows why many people feel that the covenant has been broken? For want of a tiny amount of money, the Ministry of Defence gives itself a very bad public relations image. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to reflect on the fact that, although many people support our armed forces, they often get the impression&#151;perhaps for the wrong reason&#151;that the Government are not doing so in the way that they could.</p>

<p><a name="st_o326"><a name="08011057000639"><a name="80110-0015.htm_spnew4"><a name="08011057001309"><b>Mr. Touhig:</b>
 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. The instinctive reaction of the British people is to support our armed forces. The point that I was trying to make is that there is a growing disconnect, because ever more people do not have knowledge or experience of people who serve in the armed forces, and that is not healthy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="80110-0015.htm_para15"><a name="08011057000640">To return to the issue of combined cadet forces, the pilot scheme that has been rolled out moves us in the right direction. I hope that the scheme will be rolled out across Britain. That would allow us to enhance the education and training of young people in skills and trades that are often in short supply, while giving a head start to those who want to make a career in the armed forces. I should like more to be done; I would like a trust fund to be created specifically to support the development of the cadets services, to which private firms would be asked to contribute. The cadets do a wonderful job, creating all sorts of interesting and exciting developments in young people&#146;s lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="80110-0015.htm_para16"><a name="08011057000641">It is no bad thing to raise funds by helping to fill shopping bags in supermarkets at Christmas, but that is not a certain funding stream, and we should not encourage it to be viewed as such. We need to do more, and as the private sector has a strong interest in developing a skilled work force for the future, I expect that quite a number of companies would be willing to support such a trust fund. There is more that we can do to engage private companies in co-operation that would benefit both them and service personnel. We could set up partnerships with firms to ensure that when someone is coming to the end of their forces career they can contact a company that will guarantee them an interview, provided that they meet the basic requirements. After all, those with military experience bring a wide range of skills and abilities to civilian life that no one else can contribute to a business or organisation. Civil society and the armed forces have many shared interests that are often overlooked, and the Government must do more to strengthen co-operation in respect of those interests, for the benefit of all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="80110-0015.htm_para17"><a name="08011057000642">A major factor in the recruitment and retention of our service personnel is housing. Measures such as the &#163;700 million invested in forces accommodation last year, and the commitment to spend at least &#163;5 billion on housing in the next decade, are certainly encouraging developments. However, our servicemen and women are no different from anyone else in society when it comes to wanting to get a foot on the housing ladder. Given the sacrifices that we expect from them, and the demands that we make of them, we should do all that we can to support servicemen and women in that ambition. We should look at ways of working with financial institutions, with a view to offering discounted mortgages, perhaps at a rate that is fixed at the time when the mortgage is taken out, and which applies for the duration of servicemen and women&#146;s time in the forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80110-0015.htm_para18"><a name="08011057000643">Alternatively, as I have suggested in the past, we could offer service families a lump sum of, say, about &#163;30,000 as a contribution towards a deposit on a mortgage. We could look at ways of developing a savings scheme in which someone could earn above commercial interest rates throughout their time in the forces, and the amount saved could be matched by a lump sum from the MOD when they leave. The money could then be used as a deposit on a house. We could engage financial institutions in exploring that.</p>

 I applaud the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestion. Does he agree that the huge merit of that proposal is that it does not put service people early in their careers in a position where, having bought early because they so badly wanted to get on the housing ladder, they become more likely, according to the huge study that was done in the 1990s, to leave the forces prematurely?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important and valid point. There is evidence that that has happened. I am trying to suggest ways in which we can stem that drift from the forces. Such measures would demonstrate loud and clear to servicemen and women that we value them, and would certainly have a significant impact on recruitment and retention. However, the most basic measure that would surely make the biggest difference to recruitment and retention is pay.</p>

I say to my right hon. and hon.

 I will leave the matter there for today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80110-0015.htm_para25"><a name="08011057000656">My main proposition is that we are asking too much from our armed forces. The strategic defence review in 1998 envisaged one major operation, such as Gulf 1, or a lesser deployment, such as Bosnia, or a small brigade-sized operation elsewhere. But since 2003 we have been operating on two major fronts, and, as we have heard today, that is leading to overstretch. We are breaching the harmony guidelines and have done so for the last seven years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80110-0015.htm_para26"><a name="08011057000657">The Army harmony guidelines clearly state that over a 30-month period people should not be away from their base for more than 415 days, but 10 per cent. of the Army are breaching those guidelines&#151;that is 10,000 personnel. What we do not know from the figures is whether there are repeat offenders&#151;whether people breach the harmony guidelines over a number of years. Therefore, we do not know how many people have been affected in the longer term rather than just in the previous year. The medical services are suffering the worst. Among general surgeons, 21 per cent. are breaching the harmony guidelines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="80110-0015.htm_para27"><a name="08011057000658">We have also seen huge shortages as a result of the breaching of the harmony guidelines. It is a vicious circle. When we ask too much of our armed forces they leave early, which results in shortages, which in turn leads to more overstretch and breaching of the harmony guidelines. We need to get a grip of that, because it results in the disillusionment of huge numbers of armed forces personnel. Ministry of Defence surveys showed that only three in 10 felt valued, and in one in four personnel morale was low or very low. As a result, more are leaving the forces, which results in retention difficulties. During the past year, 5,000 people have left the forces, and among officers the situation is particularly bad. In the last six months of 2007, 1,350 officers left the forces, which is double the figure for the previous 12 months. Since the start of the Iraq war in 2003, 6,000 officers have left the forces. As a result, we are 7,000 below strength in the armed forces as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80110-0015.htm_para28"><a name="08011057000659">Over the Christmas period, I met a long-standing friend who has been in the forces for 10 years. He is a skilled tradesman and over the past few years he has been asked to go to Iraq and Afghanistan. Having just returned from Iraq, he has been asked to go back to Afghanistan, but he has decided that he has had enough, and many of his friends feel exactly the same because we are asking far too much of our forces. Hon. Members have heard me say before that we are now trawling around looking for volunteers, such as storemen from Faslane, bandsmen who are going out to Cyprus, and even politicians, including Members of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

The fleet of submarines there are nuclear powered, and the Liberal Democrats seem to support the presence of naval personnel on those submarines, yet they are not keen to support nuclear energy on the ground.

Just before Christmas, I visited HMS Scotia in Rosyth for its Christmas carol concert; some of the Royal Naval Reserve forces are going out to Basra airbase to man Phalanx guns to protect it. Reserve forces members are now regularly being asked to go to the front line, but that was never envisaged when they first joined. It puts huge strain not only on them but on their employers and families. It is unsustainable to continue to ask the reserves to contribute too much to the front line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08011057000664">The real reason why we are at this state of play is due to the decision in 2003 to invade Iraq. The hon.

 I am testing the hon. Gentleman&#146;s patience, but I am pleased that he has given way because he is now, perhaps inadvertently, misleading the House. Our concern about Iraq relates to what has happened since the initial invasion and the management of the peacekeeping. That should not be confused with the initial invasion. We Conservatives are very concerned that the Army is still there in large numbers because the peacekeeping operation and nation building have been such a failure.</p>

 That is a slight extrapolation from what is the case. We are overstretched because we are in Iraq.

 I am afraid that, with respect, the hon. Gentleman is showing his ignorance about what the military are expected to do. They provide an umbrella of security, but the Department for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and other agencies need to build the governance and infrastructures. That has not happened in Iraq and that is why our military forces have been there for such a long time. I am afraid that they are now receiving the brunt because of the ineptitude of those Departments.</p>

<p><a name="st_o343"><a name="08011057000672"><a name="80110-0016.htm_spnew10"><a name="08011057001326"><b>Willie Rennie:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is fabricating a rather contorted argument. We are in Iraq because the Conservatives and the Government agreed to go there. That is why we are overstretched. Making up some elongated story involving DFID and so on does not reflect the reality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08011057000673">I return to the issue of minimum force protection. When I visited Iraq last year with the rest of the Defence Committee, we were told that the minimum force protection required for the south-east would be 4,500 to 5,000. A month later, the Minister for the Armed Forces came before the Committee and said roughly the same. However, when last year the Prime Minister told the House that he had decided to withdraw 2,500 troops as of the spring, suddenly the minimum force required was 2,500. We have been told that the jobs required in Basra have changed. However, a minimum force is a minimum force, no matter what the jobs are.</p>

<p><a name="st_o344"><a name="08011057000674"><a name="80110-0016.htm_spnew11"><a name="08011057001327"><b>Mr. Adam Holloway (Gravesham) (Con):</b>
 I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is aware of the spate of thefts from Basra airbase and associated issues involving the security of our personnel. I should be interested to hear, perhaps privately, from the Secretary of State what is being done to deal with that and whether it has anything to do with the fact that our force numbers may be too low even to guard the airbase.</p>

<p><a name="st_o345"><a name="08011057000675"><a name="80110-0016.htm_spnew12"><a name="08011057001328"><b>Willie Rennie:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman has made an interesting point, and I hope that the Secretary of State will deal with it, on a private basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08011057000676">Ministers shook their heads when we talked about minimum force protection, but when we visited the airbase last year they were adamant that 4,500 was the minimum that would be required just for protection purposes, not to conduct many more operations beyond that. How has that figure suddenly changed to 2,500? Are we now relying on the Iraqi forces for our protection? If so, the House has a right to know. If not, we need a more detailed explanation as to the reason for the sudden reduction. It is clear that we have been part of the problem in southern Iraq and that we should withdraw from there. It used to be that 90 per cent. of attacks were on our forces in the south, but the number of attacks fell dramatically when we withdrew from Basra palace in the heart of Basra city. It is therefore clear that we should get out of Basra and out of Iraq altogether.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08011057000677">I am grateful for the Secretary of State&#146;s details on some of the progress that has been made on inquests, but it is still embarrassing, and a travesty for the families, that it has taken far too long to conduct them&#151;months, sometimes years. So far, the system has been unable to cope. Will the Minister give a wee bit  <br>

more detail about what further progress he hopes to make in the next year? Have discussions with the Scottish Government led to any results? If some of the inquests or fatal accident inquiries were conducted in Scotland, that would relieve some of the pressure in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08011057000678">On housing, more than half of armed forces single living accommodation has been independently assessed as substandard. That is a significant reason for many officers and soldiers leaving the forces. The Armed Forces Pay Review Body has determined that 14,000 bed spaces have been lost since 2001, yet during that period &#163;2.2 billion worth of asset sales has gone from the MOD to the Treasury. I am grateful to the Secretary of State for providing more details on the &#163;5 billion figure, which has now grown to &#163;8 billion or so. Unfortunately, however, some spinning went on previously as to what that money was. It was presented as new money&#151;extra investment in housing&#151;when in fact much of it was going on rent and maintenance. It would be helpful to have a wee bit more clarity on some of the figures as previously presented. As Ministers have said, the basic problem is that we are relying on the legacy that was left to us by the Conservative party, which sold off MOD housing to Annington Homes&#151;the most disgraceful waste of money and resources that there has ever been. The Conservatives should say less on this subject in future because their record warrants some scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08011057000679">Progress has been made on health, as I have seen for myself through the Defence Committee. Defence Medical Services does a good job. The Selly Oak facility is first class, providing excellent, quality care for our armed forces in a military-led environment. I would like there to be a move further towards a military-only environment; I think the Minister said that more military nurses are being recruited.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is a pity that the additional assistance and changes within Defence Medical Services seem to have come only when there has been a great big hoo-hah in the press, and not to have been driven by the Government? People working internally in this area say that that rather mystifies them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o347"><a name="08011057000681"><a name="80110-0016.htm_spnew14"><a name="08011057001330"><b>Willie Rennie:</b>
 I am sure that the Secretary of State, having gone through the agony of the past year, will be keen to make this investment sustainable, and that we will see long-term benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08011057000682">There are other improvements at Chilwell, Headley Court and the regional rehabilitation centres, but concerns remain about investment in Combat Stress. There has been some, but there needs to be more. There is also concern that the NHS will fund Combat Stress and veterans&#146; health care after this period of investment. There must be improved connections between the NHS and the military, because the NHS does not understand many of the problems that the military face in terms of primary care.</p>

It is neither fish nor fowl. It is neither centralised nor military, but a  <br>

regional, non-military environment. We have heard many times that serving soldiers need a military-only environment, but we need specialisms as well. I would like the Government to look at that area again and consider whether there is a better model that is both military and specialist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08011057000684">Finally, I would like to conclude with some questions for the Minister. If we are serious about recruitment and filling the shortfall of 7,000 personnel in the armed forces, why is there no Government budget line to recruit those personnel? I questioned the permanent under-secretary in the Select Committee on Defence last year, and there was silence when we asked whether there was a budget to recruit those masses of people. There is no serious intention of recruiting. The Department is being realistic; it does not expect to recruit them, and as a result there is no budget line. I would like to hear some response from the Minister on that when he sums up. Finally, will the Minister explain when he believes that the Government will withdraw from Iraq?</p>

 I welcome this opportunity to take part in today&#146;s debate, although it is a brief one. I must say that I think it is too brief. The House should set aside much more time to discuss armed forces personnel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08011057000686">I intend to spend most of my contribution on a crucial aspect of personnel matters, which is the provision of first-class training, and I shall refer to the Government&#146;s radical and courageous policies that will transform the entire phase 2 training programme in the armed forces. I begin by paying tribute to the role of our armed forces personnel. I have the honour and privilege of representing the special forces support unit at MOD St. Athan, and I am fortunate enough to receive frequent updates on the activities of our brave men and women on the front line in Iraq and Afghanistan. Much more time should be spent exposing what our soldiers are doing every day of the week&#151;the sheer courage and bravery of the men and women on the front line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08011057000687">Far from what we hear constantly about bad morale and so on, in the correspondence and e-mails that I receive I hear only positive comments: a commitment to and belief in what they are doing, and a willingness and desire to succeed. I believe that the Government&#146;s record of looking after armed forces personnel is a good one. Do I think more could be done? You bet I do, but we have a reasonable track record. I do not base that on the facts and figures churned out by the Government, but on the comments I receive from my constituents who are serving on the front line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08011057000688">We heard references to medical services. I have an e-mail that points out that in the opinion of one commander, our medical services are second to none in the world. In fact, one of his platoon commanders was shot on the front line in Helmand, and after his condition was stabilised, he was receiving intensive care within 23 hours, not in theatre, but in Selly Oak in Birmingham. There are numerous examples of the sort of treatment that they are receiving&#151;it is the best in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08011057000689">We hear a lot about kit, and it is true that every commander in the field wants more kit. But the people who correspond with me say that the kit they have is the best it has ever been. Yes, they want more helicopters on the front line, but the kit is good, and it is improving. Let us not talk everything down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08011057000690">I want to focus on training, because I believe that it holds the key to many issues that are raised about armed forces personnel, especially recruitment and retention. If we can offer our servicemen and women the best possible phase 2&#151;technical&#151;training in the world, we can recruit more easily and retain our forces better. In the Government&#146;s announcement on 17 January last year on the defence training rationalisation programme, it was decided to do just that and transform the phase 2 training of non-commissioned officers and lower ranks throughout the Army, Navy and Air Force. That modern, state-of-the-art training would use new teaching methodologies and all the technologies that are available to train and educate our forces personnel, and be provided in a purpose-built, new-build project on a 600-acre site in St. Athan in my constituency. Our servicemen and women deserve nothing less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08011057000691">The facilities will be outstanding and the training will be superb. I was pleased when my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary announced on 25 October that package 1&#151;the provision of all aeronautical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical and electronic engineering and computer information and technology&#151;was on course and on time. It was also announced that negotiations would continue about package 2 and would probably be extended because the military were not sure whether they could achieve the savings that they expected by combining the two packages under the Metrix consortium.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08011057000692">I was therefore interested when my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces made a written statement this week about the future of Deepcut barracks and the proposal to place the site in the local borough council&#146;s core planning strategy, with a view to vacating it by 2013. I hope that my right hon. Friend can tell me in his winding-up speech whether that will have any bearing on the decisions, which we know are due in the near future, on package 2 of the defence training rationalisation programme, given the relocation of such a large facility and given that not many places in the country can accommodate it. Of course, St. Athan can. It was&#151;and will be again&#151;the largest military base in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08011057000693">The proposals as they stand will bring thousands of military personnel to my constituency. I was addressing a small community council in St. Athan, which will be directly affected, the other night. That small council is 120 per cent. behind the development and looking forward to welcoming the forces back to the constituency. At the height of activity in the camp, we had 17,000 military personnel at RAF St. Athan in the old days. We could approach such numbers in future if we make the right decision, combine the two packages and base the whole training programme on one site in the United Kingdom, which will offer young men and women a tremendous opportunity and a tremendous welcome to the armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08011057000694">The majority will take up phase 2&#151;non-military training&#151;shortly after being recruited into the forces. It is an old trick that the Americans used much better than us in the past to give recruits the best facilities,  <br>

involvement and quality of life, which they can use to build their career in the services and&#151;just as important&#151;given the new nature of the training, when they leave the forces, because the skills will be used directly in civvy street.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08011057000695">However, we must get the project right. The infrastructure must be right because the project is so vast. Several aspects will be affected, but the most important are housing and transportation&#151;surface access to the site, especially roads. I want to draw the Minister&#146;s attention to a difficulty. The local planning authority in the Vale of Glamorgan is to accommodate the &#163;16 billion project, which will create 5,500 direct new civilian jobs in my constituency. It must work in co-operation with the Ministry of Defence and the company providing the project, Metrix.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para20"><a name="08011057000696">Unfortunately, the planning authority has failed in the draft local development plan that it published in December to recognise the scale of the project and the need to think strategically. The planning authority has not identified enough land banks for the new housing development. The pressure on housing will be enormous. The planning authority has also downgraded Llandow, another 500-acre former second world war airfield&#151;a brownfield site&#151;and failed to identify it as an area for housing that could accommodate the people coming into St. Athan for the new development. I also understand that the planning authority has not safeguarded land for direct access to the military training academy at St. Athan from the M4, which has to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08011057000697">There is now a two-month consultation period, from January to March. I ask the Ministry of Defence to look into the issue&#151;it is the customer in the project, which is a private finance initiative&#151;and to make representations to the local planning authority, to ensure that it recognises the strategic importance of the success of the project.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (John Smith) on two of the comments that he made. First, he said that this debate is too short. The new topical debates, which have turned out to be simple re-launches of the Government&#146;s current initiatives, do not seem to be a good idea, particularly when they take time out of armed forces debates, which tend to take place on Thursday afternoons. The second point on which I should like to congratulate the hon. Gentleman is the fact that his constituency will receive from Bordon in my constituency many people who work in mechanical engineering. He is lucky to have those people coming to his constituency. When they arrive, I hope to be invited to visit and see how they are getting along.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08011057000699">This is a short debate. Last week the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust produced a report suggesting that the Ministry of Defence was glamorising war. I do not think that it is doing that at all. The Minister was absolutely right to suggest that it is not in the Ministry of Defence&#146;s interests to give, in any sense, a false idea of what people are going in for when they join the armed forces. However, it is also right to draw attention to the benefits of a career in the armed forces. In many  <br>

respects, it is a fantastic career. One gets qualifications and finds a camaraderie that cannot be found in any other career. It is therefore right to pay tribute to the type of career that can be had in the armed forces, as well as to the extraordinary and wonderful men and women who take up that career.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08011057000700">It is also right to pay tribute to the families of our armed forces. We often think of the armed forces as they serve in Afghanistan and Iraq, but in many cases the real difficulty is faced by those who are left behind at home doing the worrying, but without the constant adrenalin and local support that the work of the armed forces involves. All that&#151;the men and women of our armed forces, the careers that they provide and the quality that they generally produce&#151;is now a part of what it means to be British and is a matter of national pride.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80110-0016.htm_para24"><a name="08011057000701">I should like to make another tiny point about national pride, part of which derives from military bands and the music that they play. They bring to an emotional head some of the strength of our military. I worry nowadays that our military bands are being reduced in number and that we have taken a financial approach to them, without appreciating the strength that they give to our armed forces. I hope, one of these days, to be able to persuade the Defence Select Committee to carry out an inquiry into our military bands because they are so important.</p>

On the planning assumptions, our armed forces have now been operating above the levels for which they are resourced for seven of the last eight years&#151;for every year since 2002. It is utterly unacceptable that that has gone on for so long. We can manage that sort of problem for a year or two&#151;perhaps for a year or three&#151;but continuing with it for so long is unacceptable. The Chief of the General Staff has said that</p>

Their tours are long, they get little time to rest, and they are flying in the most difficult conditions imaginable. Landing a Chinook in the dust of Afghanistan is a highly skilled task. People cannot see the ground because of the dust blowing up. At night, it is even harder, and people are probably being shot at, after having very little sleep. Luckily, our crews are the best in the business. They manage to cope with all that, but we must never take them for granted. We sent them there; they are doing all this for us. We must treat them right, pay them well, house them well, educate their children well, provide proper medical care and give them the very deep respect that they fully deserve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para9"><a name="08011057000712">I pay tribute to the Defence Select Committee, whose members work extremely hard at what they do. In recent months, we have completed reports on the defence education service, which is doing a good job in circumstances of great turbulence. On housing, we drew attention to our worry that it will take so long to get the standard of all defence housing up to an acceptable level. The Secretary of State made some perfectly fair points about that today. We are just concluding our inquiry on Defence Medical Services. Of course, we have some concerns. For example, there is a severe shortfall in some specific specialties, but we have found much in the Defence Medical Services that is excellent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para10"><a name="08011057000713">My final point concerns visits to our armed forces deployed abroad. The Secretary of State often visits them, as do other Defence Ministers, and I think that as a result they have a good understanding of the experiences that our forces are undergoing. The same cannot be said of the Ministers who make the financial decisions&#151;the Ministers in the Treasury. I welcomed the Prime Minister&#146;s recent visits to our troops, but while he was Chancellor of the Exchequer such visits were rare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08011057000714">I hope that Treasury Ministers will arrange a programme of visits. If they do, they will be impressed. They will see a group of wonderful young men and women upholding the values of Britain, standing up for our interests and putting their lives on the line for us. When those Treasury Ministers see what is really going on, they will have a changed perspective when they return to the United Kingdom to negotiate with the MOD; and the MOD, our armed forces and our country will benefit accordingly.</p>

 I want to touch on three Stafford experiences in my brief speech, and to draw from each of them a point of national significance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08011057000716">Last year, the status of the military base at Stafford as RAF Stafford ended 59 years after it was established, and most of the uniformed personnel were moved to Wittering. In the run-up to those events, it looked very much as though the entire military presence in Stafford could come to an end, but as a result of the great public support for the military in Stafford and the constructive approach taken by me and by the local community in representations to Ministers about that how could be averted, the story today is entirely different. There is a very positive future for an Army-led base at Stafford&#151;now MOD Stafford&#151;and the Beacon barracks for the 22nd Signal Regiment, and the prospect of a secure and growing future as we give further consideration to the super-garrison approach to the basing of our military personnel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08011057000717">That brings me to the first of my points of national significance. I should like to know Ministers&#146; thinking on super-garrisons. As I understand it, their development will coincide with, but is not dependent on, the return home from Germany of large numbers of our personnel, itself a significant event in the coming five years or so. Does the Minister agree that it will give components of our armed forces that will eventually be deployed and fight together an opportunity to train together as well, and to be deployed to the same places at the same times? Does he agree that of wider benefit to our military and their families is the fact that with super-garrisons will come greater stability in their home lives? They will know about the schools that their children will be able to attend, and it will be possible for them to buy homes in the area if they wish to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para14"><a name="08011057000718">This may not be so much a point in favour of super-garrisons, but I think it could be described as a point of national significance. I mentioned the survival and future prosperity of Stafford&#146;s military base. The Minister at the time, my right hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow (Mr. Ingram), was extremely receptive to my arguments and those of a delegation that I took to see him several times. I want to record my grateful thanks to him for listening and for making a difference through the decisions that he made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para15"><a name="08011057000719">Let me give an example. At an early stage in the process, at a meeting at which I put the case to my right hon. Friend with a delegation from the Stafford community, we were faced with the prospect of 800 civilians losing their distribution and storage jobs at Stafford. My right hon. Friend decided to start early, along with the MOD&#146;s human resources personnel and Jobcentre Plus, on the objective of guaranteeing people new jobs or help with finding jobs outside the civil service. If there are people with a low opinion of the MOD&#146;s HR personnel, I ask them to reconsider. My impression was of a dedicated group of people making a very effective job of what was a very difficult exercise, with the result that of the 800 people who were to lose posts at Stafford, only two were made compulsorily redundant. I consider that an impressive performance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para16"><a name="08011057000720">My second experience involved the contribution of the civil servants at Stafford to Operation Telic back in 2003. I attended a very sad occasion in December 2007,  <br>

when we marked the end of their work at Stafford&#146;s base, but back in 2003 I saw with my own eyes the dedication of those people, working seven days a week on a short time scale to make sure that all the equipment the troops needed in Iraq got to Iraq in time for the start of the military action there. Although there were stories about lack of equipment in the right place at the right time&#151;the most tragic event that we can all recall was that of Sergeant Steven Roberts, who gave up his body armour and was then shot and died&#151;the subsequent National Audit Office report gave absolute credit to the people back in Stafford and around the UK for their part in getting the equipment there. The report spoke about twice the material getting to the region in half the time compared with the 1990 Gulf war; so the fault in people not getting equipment such as body armour and the right sized boots at the right time did not lie with people in Stafford. I recall that the NAO drew attention not only to the shortage of time for the whole operation because of the diplomatic efforts at the United Nations&#151;something that might now be a constant pressure given the commitment to a vote in this House before committing troops in future&#151;but to our country&#146;s policy in terms of what we keep in store ready for such an eventuality and what we depend upon quick procurement for. That balance must be got right, and we must have robust procurement arrangements for the equipment that will be procured at short notice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para17"><a name="08011057000721">Another important issue that I want the Minister to say something about is the tracking of equipment in theatre and ensuring it gets to the right place in the battle theatre in time. A lot of work was done immediately after the NAO report on in-theatre tracking, and I wonder whether he can say anything new today about developments in technological solutions as well as in military training and practice.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman and I share, as it were, distribution depots, and it is sometimes forgotten just how many civilian staff work with great credit for the Ministry of Defence and that they have also been going through a period of turmoil. The demands placed on them from managing what are two large operations are phenomenal, and we should never forget the contribution of civilian staff in the MOD.</p>

 I totally agree with the hon. Gentleman, and I pay tribute to those staff for their dedication to their duty and the pride that they feel&#151;it is every bit as much as that of the uniformed armed forces&#151;in serving their country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para18"><a name="08011057000724">The ultimate sacrifice that members of our armed forces make to this country is to give their lives. Back in 2003, we in Stafford had the experience of the death of young, brave Trooper David Clarke. We quickly knew&#151;and this was confirmed at the inquest&#151;that he was killed when his Challenger 2 tank was fired on by another British Challenger 2 tank. The point of national significance that I draw from that incident is the vital question of combat identification, and I have pursued that with Ministers in the years since 2003. Can the Minister say anything new about the work being done on that? As we deploy increasingly often  <br>

with many international partners, it is important that we have approaches and solutions that are compatible with those of our partners. New technologies assist to some extent, but there is always the issue of human factors. Time and again, training and communication are what make the difference. I have talked of the tragic loss for Stafford of the loss of David Clarke&#146;s life, but it is important that we learn the lessons of each individual incident.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para19"><a name="08011057000725">We in this country can be proud that we have some of the best&#151;and sometimes the best&#151;armed forces in the world. That is because of a combination of their personal courage and commitment, the leadership that they have, the training and equipment that they get and the backing of our nation. I want to say how proud I am of our armed forces for what they do so often on our behalf and at our request. They serve the country superbly, and I admire the values that they hold and uphold. As a country, our support for them during their service, for their families, and when they are veterans is growing all the time. Long may that continue.</p>

 The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) made a number of interesting points, particularly those relating to super-garrisons. I hope that the Minister will at least investigate that matter further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para20"><a name="08011057000727">I welcome this debate. It does not take me to suggest that Parliament has a special duty to look after service personnel and to honour the military covenant. That duty is born of the fact that Parliament, on behalf of the nation, has a moral duty to repay the dedication shown by our service personnel. In addition, because politicians ultimately decide on deployment, and as there is an absence of a union or any other representative organisation, Parliament has a direct role to play in the welfare of our service personnel. Despite that special duty, there is mounting evidence to suggest that this Government risk failing our service personnel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para21"><a name="08011057000728">Poor housing is perhaps a key example of that. Various statistics have been bandied about in this short debate. We have heard about the Public Accounts Committee&#146;s suggestion that nearly half of all service accommodation is substandard. I think I am right in saying that a Select Committee on Defence report suggested that some accommodation was appalling. The Army&#146;s own continuous attitude surveys suggest that half our troops believe that the maintenance of their accommodation is not what it should be, and senior figures have added their voice on this matter. General Sir Michael Rose has said:</p>
<a name="80110-0017.htm_brev5"><a name="08011057000925"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The situation has become so extreme that it is driving soldiers out of the Army in increasing numbers.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para22"><a name="08011057000729">It seems to me that the Government have forgotten the old first world war concept of &#147;homes for heroes&#148; when it comes to our troops. In fairness, their single living accommodation modernisation&#151;SLAM&#151;initiative has resulted in some additional funding, but the Public Accounts Committee made it clear that even at the current rate of improvement it would take 20 years for all the accommodation to be removed from the substandard category.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para23"><a name="08011057000730">As if to illustrate the point, I raised the issue of the accommodation at the Hounslow cavalry barracks with the Defence Secretary. The 2nd battalion of my regiment, the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, will be returning there from overseas deployment in the spring. The Minister will be aware that that accommodation was condemned in the 1960s, and that it has a reputation in the armed forces of being probably the worst accommodation. Most of the troops&#146; accommodation will be about 250 ft below the Heathrow flight path. The senior non-commissioned officers&#146; accommodation is the worst of all&#151;the rooms are so narrow and small that one must close one&#146;s door before one can open one&#146;s locker. I welcome the Defence Secretary&#146;s apparent acceptance of an invitation to visit the Hounslow cavalry barracks, because they are worthy of a visit. Although funds are being put into those barracks, by most accounts they are insufficient to deal with the deficiencies.</p>

<p><a name="st_o354"><a name="08011057000731"><a name="80110-0017.htm_spnew4"><a name="08011057001337"><b>Mr. Kevan Jones:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman made reference to the Defence Committee&#146;s report on housing. We visited Hounslow barracks, and I sympathise with some of the points that he is making. Did he also read the report&#146;s recommendations? They clearly state&#151;I also said this earlier&#151;that the answer to the appalling conditions at Hounslow is not just pumping money into that facility. The Ministry of Defence and, in particular, the Army, must take a strategic decision about what is needed in the capital area.</p>

 I do not disagree with that, but part of the problem has been the constraint on finances.</p>

 Yes it has. Spending on the military has fallen from 2.9 to 2.5 per cent. of our gross domestic product<i> &#151;[Interruption.]</i> I am not wrong. It has fallen by that amount during the past 10 years. That may not sound like a big percentage but it represents &#163;5 billion in today&#146;s money, which could put right a lot of what is wrong in the armed forces, certainly when it comes to service accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para24"><a name="08011057000735">That leads me to the point about overstretch. I agree that many terms are used with regard to the concept of overstretch. The bottom line is that the armed forces receive about &#163;5 billion less because of that decrease in spending as a percentage of GDP. That 0.4 per cent. drop in expenditure does not sound a lot, but that money would put right the Army&#146;s 4,000 personnel deficit: it does not sound a lot, but it has a big knock-on effect on deployment. When the Chief of the General Staff visited Parliament and made a presentation&#151;if I remember correctly, the Minister was there&#151;he said that the time spent on deployment was normally around 20 per cent. of total time. At the moment, the Army is running at 37 per cent. and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hampshire (Mr. Arbuthnot) pointed out, that over-deployment has been going on since 2002. The Chief of the General Staff made the point that that cannot continue indefinitely and we are reaching breaking point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para25"><a name="08011057000736">Most recent figures show that most Army units now fail to meet the 24-month average interval between tours. That leaves units and individuals separated from their families for far too long, and training and recuperation inevitably suffer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para28"><a name="08011057000741">I should warn the Minister that the public take those failings very seriously. It is no credit to the Government that the Minister for Defence Equipment and Support announced that he was walking away from politics to drive racing cars on the very day that a coroner ruled that a shortage of kit cost Fusilier Gordon Gentle his life. That is not lost on the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para29"><a name="08011057000742">The Defence Committee has highlighted the shortage of helicopters in Afghanistan, and that is especially important in that region, because it has a knock-on effect in the strain put on crews, especially when they have to land in the conditions there at night. It also has an impact on our successes on the ground. One of my concerns about Afghanistan is that many of the victories that we are accomplishing now could become pyrrhic victories if we do not dominate the ground that we have won. It is no good taking towns if we cannot dominate the ground around them, and helicopters have a vital role to play in achieving that. If we eventually cede that ground to the Taliban, the victories will indeed be pyrrhic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para30"><a name="08011057000743">I welcome the rule changes to compensation claims, and I give the Government credit where it is due for those. It is right that service personnel can now claim for each injury. However, I would ask the Minister to address directly why the limit on compensation remains at &#163;285,000, and will the Government and MOD do any work on that? To put the figure into context, Peterborough borough council spends some &#163;285,000 on awarding compensation to those who trip over paving stones, and that is a useful comparison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="80110-0017.htm_para31"><a name="08011057000744">Given the litany of failings by the Government, I have to say, as an ex-serviceman, that it is bemusing to hear Ministers say that when they are visiting troops, they do not hear them grumble too much, so perhaps Opposition Members and the media exaggerate some of the concerns. That is the wrong approach. Partly because service personnel are taught not to complain, and partly because of their deference to the chain of command, they do not grumble. It is ludicrous to suggest that because nothing is said, all is well. It shows how out of touch Ministers risk appearing.</p>

That is why it is so important that Ministers listen to those at the top when they break silence. Lord Guthrie has talked about the services feeling as though they are being taken for granted. Admiral Lord Boyce accused the Prime Minister of treating the armed forces with contempt and disinterest. The Chief of the General Staff clearly said that the military covenant is out of kilter and that the troops are feeling devalued, angry and fatigued.</p>

They are speaking out for those who do not have a union or a federation to speak out on their behalf and who will not and cannot strike. They are making the Government aware of problems as best they can, because Ministers will not listen in private. In many soldiers&#146; minds, the proof that the Government are not 100 per cent. committed to their interests is the part-time Secretary of State.

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para4"><a name="08011057000754">I am pleased that armed forces personnel, their families and how we treat members of our armed forces are high on the political agenda. The only thing that I ask is that the debate should be based on fact rather than fiction. The trend over the past few months in the media and in the House&#151;an example was provided just now by the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron)&#151;is that if someone says something, it is deemed to be a fact. If someone stands up, for example, and says that there is a shortage of body armour in Iraq or Afghanistan, that is taken as a fact. Some of the problems in our armed forces are seen as having been pickled in aspic and it is believed that somehow nothing ever changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para5"><a name="08011057000755">There has been a tremendous change in the equipment available in Afghanistan and Iraq. I have seen that, as have other members of the Defence Committee. If the hon. Member for Billericay thinks that members of the armed forces do not grumble to us when we go around bases, that could not be further from the truth. To be fair to the Chairman of the Committee, he insists that wherever we go, we should meet members of the armed forces away from senior officers. I can tell the House that they are not short of a range of issues and grumbles to raise. One must be selective, as some grumbles deserve to be taken up while others are the sort of moans expressed by people in any job. It is important to separate what needs to be investigated from ordinary, everyday dissatisfaction.</p>

 I said that I had heard Ministers say at the Dispatch Box that they do not hear grumbling from armed forces personnel, but I was not referring to members of the Defence Committee. Moreover, my remarks were not based on hearsay. I have looked at what the Public Accounts Committee has said about accommodation, for example, and at the Army&#146;s own continuous assessment surveys.</p>

<p><a name="st_o364"><a name="08011057000757"><a name="80110-0018.htm_spnew3"><a name="08011057001350"><b>Mr. Jones:</b>
 I shall come on to accommodation in a moment, but I assure the House that armed forces personnel are not afraid of coming forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para6"><a name="08011057000758">I welcome the commitment given by the Government to the Command Paper, as it is very important that all the threads to do with housing, medical welfare and other matters are drawn together. Another important aspect is how the MOD interacts with other Departments. The Defence Committee has worked on reports dealing with housing, education and medical services, and it is clear that the MOD is something of an island. It does not always work well with other Departments, and the Command Paper will have an important role to play in improving its performance in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para7"><a name="08011057000759">The Command Paper also needs to spell out what should be provided by the MOD, and what by charities. I have great respect for the service charities, which do tremendous work on behalf of both serving and retired members of our armed forces. We need a grown-up debate so that we can decide what they should provide, and what the MOD should.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para8"><a name="08011057000760">On the armed forces medical services, the Chairman of the Defence Committee said that we had been very impressed by what we had seen on our evidence-gathering trips, and I want to emphasise that the care being given to personnel&#151;both in-theatre in Afghanistan and Iraq and at Selly Oak&#151;is the best in this country and among  <br>

the best in the world. That was recognised by the Surgeon General in the evidence that he gave to the Defence Committee, and it also accepted by General Dannett, who is a strong advocate of the Selly Oak facility. People need to look at the facts, and not at the media hype or some of the other, rather disgraceful claims that have been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para9"><a name="08011057000761">I have been impressed by the dedication exhibited by both NHS and military staff in the hospitals that I have visited, but I went to the military-managed facility at Northallerton a few weeks ago. The previous Conservative Government quite rightly began the process of closing military hospitals: six were closed during their time in office, and anyone who suggests that we should return to that regime is talking nonsense. A proper throughput of people and expertise is needed if medical care is to attain the necessary standard.</p>

<p><a name="st_o365"><a name="08011057000762"><a name="80110-0018.htm_spnew4"><a name="08011057001351"><b>Tony Baldry:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman has said that there must be a balance between the work done by charities and the MOD. Does he agree that the MOD could surely have found in its budget the &#163;5 million for a hydrotherapy pool and other facilities needed by the seriously wounded people in therapy and recuperation at Headley Court? That is a tiny amount, and it should have come from the MOD&#146;s budget and not from charities.</p>

<p><a name="st_o366"><a name="08011057000763"><a name="80110-0018.htm_spnew5"><a name="08011057001352"><b>Mr. Jones:</b>
 I am sorry to say that the hon. Gentleman has fallen into a trap. When the Defence Committee visited Headley Court to gather evidence, people told us that the facilities to which he has referred were not the priority. It is fine if charities want to install a hydrotherapy pool as an addition to existing provision, but it is certainly not a priority for patients. We need to be careful about such matters, but that is why we need a debate about what the MOD should provide, and what charities should. Service charities have an important role to play, and they can provide some services for our armed forces far better than the Government can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08011057000764">We cannot ignore the legacy of the previous Conservative Government or the way that they sold off Army houses but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) suggested, we also have a great opportunity in that regard. The replacement of the arms plot and super-garrisons allows us for the first time to talk about letting armed forces personnel get on the housing ladder. I am very pleased that the Government have taken that on board. I am also pleased that they have accepted the amendment to the Housing and Regeneration Bill that provides that people leaving the armed forces and returning to their home area will get priority for council housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08011057000765">The hon. Member for Billericay talked about Hounslow. The problem there is not money; it is that a strategic decision is needed on what accommodation the Army needs in London. As we highlighted in our report, that urgently needs to be assessed. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the facilities in Hounslow are unacceptable, but no one would put money into a facility that might be closed a few years later. That indecision has led to the decline of the barracks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08011057000766">Strides have been made in relation to military inquests, but I put it to my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces that he should urge the Government to introduce the coroners Bill. That would remedy some of the delays and archaic systems operating in the coroners service, which would also help some military inquests. I  <br>

am totally against feeding lawyers and giving them more money to represent families at inquests, because there is no role for the families there, but I would insist on the maximum support being given to families who attend inquests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08011057000767">We have heard about the voice that armed forces personnel can have, which in the new media age is increasingly heard on the internet and in other forums where they can comment. I proposed adding to the Bill that became the Armed Forces Act 2006 a new clause that would have given legal recognition to an armed forces federation. I believe that an armed forces federation is long overdue in this country&#151;not a trade union that would represent armed forces personnel, allow them to go on strike or do anything like that, but a body that would provide a voice for ordinary servicemen and women in the chain of command. I am not for one minute saying that such a body should be able to interfere in the chain of command; however, there is a problem with how far up the chain of command some of the legitimate complaints made by members of the armed forces have gone. Do they reach senior generals and Ministers? Such a federation would be important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para14"><a name="08011057000768">Finally, we should honour the men and women who have been injured or killed in the line of duty in Afghanistan and Iraq and in other conflicts around the world. I pay tribute to the <i> Daily Mirror</i> for its &#147;Honour The Brave&#148; campaign and to Colonel Richard Kemp, who is leading the fight for a medal. The Secretary of State says it is up to the generals to decide on the awarding of medals, but such a medal, which is commonplace in other countries, including the United States, Canada and Australia, is long overdue in this country. A medal should be awarded to men and women who lose their lives or are injured in service of their country. Two hundred and six Members of Parliament have now signed my early-day motion 95, and I urge any who have not to do so. I see that only a minority of Conservative MPs have signed it; again, I urge them to do so. We need some movement on the medal, because those people deserve such recognition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para15"><a name="08011057000769">I finish where I started by saying that we owe a great debt to the servicemen and women who are working on our behalf. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford, I wish to mention the civilian personnel who work for the MOD, some of them in very dangerous parts of the world in support of the armed forces. They, too, should have our thanks for the work that they do on our behalf.</p>

the powers that be to ensure that a Bill is expedited, so that we can remove that quirk in the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08011057000774">In this debate on armed forces personnel we have heard a lot about cuts to the size of our forces and reductions in budgets that have led to overstretch, and to pressures on members of our armed forces across the board. As we have heard, that has certainly led to challenges for recruitment and, more worryingly, for retention. Since 1997, the Army has been reduced by 9,000 people, the Navy by 10,000 and the RAF by 16,000. Those are colossal numbers, considering the expectations and burdens that we put on our armed forces personnel across the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para18"><a name="08011057000775">I shall focus my attention on two issues. The first is the aftercare provided to service personnel once they have left the armed forces. We have rightly covered a range of issues, including welfare, equipment, and frequency of tours. Those are all important, but we have to remember what happens to a soldier when they have picked up their armed forces long service and good conduct medal after 16 years, or when they have taken an honourable decommission, and decided to go to civvy street. I pay tribute to the Royal British Legion and many of the veterans&#146; associations that look after our heroes once they have decided to take a role in civilian life. They play an important role, providing reunion opportunities, support, and the mechanisms and facilities that are needed to ensure that armed forces personnel make a healthy, informed transition from a military to a civilian environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para19"><a name="08011057000776">After the 25th anniversary of the Falklands conflict, it was horrifying to learn that more than 300 veterans of that conflict had committed suicide since returning&#151;a statistic that will shock the House. That is more than were killed in action on the islands. It is an unacceptable figure. One would think that things would have changed, but a recent report in the <i> British Medical Journal</i> highlights some of the psychological disorders and concerns that affect Army personnel, particularly those who are in combat situations for a total of more than 13 months. They include post-traumatic stress disorder, psychological distress, multiple physical symptoms, and symptoms connected with alcohol problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para20"><a name="08011057000777">I appreciate that much has changed since the 1980s and the Falklands conflict, but I was horrified to learn, in response to a written question that I asked the Defence Secretary, that 17 serving soldiers who served either in Iraq or Afghanistan have committed suicide. We are talking about Army personnel who were still in uniform. They had not even left the protection of the military family, but decided to take their own lives. I would hazard a guess that the total number of people who have committed suicide having served in those two areas of conflict is double that figure, because there are those who were not receiving the attention and security that the military environment can offer. I do not know the numbers, and I seriously urge the Minister to investigate and try to find out the number of suicides among those who served in those conflicts but who left and were civilians.</p>

Minister will heed our concerns. We have a duty of care, which I do not believe we are fulfilling. We have a responsibility that goes far beyond the battlefields and parade squares, and we have an obligation to look after our heroes long after they have hung up their uniforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para22"><a name="08011057000779">My second theme is the changing role of our military. We had a little engagement on that subject with the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie), the Liberal Democrat spokesman. It was interesting to hear the Foreign Secretary&#146;s recent comments on the &#147;Today&#148; programme, in which he promised to prioritise the Government&#146;s work on conflict prevention, and to work better with the armed forces. That is the stance of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The Foreign Secretary also pledged greater integration and better co-operation with the Department for International Development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para23"><a name="08011057000780">I agreed with those sentiments, but I shall not hold my breath. I agreed with the comments of Sir Hilary Synnott, who is a respected commentator on Iraq. He has worked in the civil service and written and travelled extensively throughout Afghanistan and Iraq. He said:</p>

The imbalance of effort, of outlay of blood and treasure, between the military and the civilian arms of government has brought shame upon the Government.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para24"><a name="08011057000781">Those are harsh words from somebody so respected and so knowledgeable about such matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para25"><a name="08011057000782">I shall touch on our concerns. We had a statement from the Liberal Democrats pointing out that our military are still in Iraq, and I am sure they would say the same about Afghanistan. We should be more concerned about what happens underneath that umbrella of security. The only reason why our military personnel are in those two operational environments is that we have not been able to achieve the level of infrastructure and improvements to those countries that would allow the military to move from a war fighting capacity to a peacekeeping one. That is because we do not have a proper co-ordinated plan in either of those environments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para26"><a name="08011057000783">I visit Afghanistan frequently and I was in Iraq not long ago. In both cases, we went in not understanding what was expected of DFID and of the FCO. The only expectation was that our military were to go in and somehow kill the bad guys and make the place safe. Let us suppose that that happened, and that in Helmand province we reached an agreement with the Taliban that was put in place. We would then have to start infrastructure-building from scratch. It is not the military who do that. It should be done by a combination of DFID and the FCO with the United Nations and the European Union. That is not happening in any part of Afghanistan on the scale that it should.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para27"><a name="08011057000784">That is the concern, and it applies to Iraq as well. There are conflicts in Basra between the Mahdi army and the other groups, and the only thing that links them is their hatred of the British, who are seen as hostile because we are no longer liberators but occupiers. That is a horrible thing to say about our British forces and the good work that they do&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> I hear barracking from the Government Benches. Does the hon.

 Another bizarre intervention from the hon. Gentleman. Does he not understand that the reason why we are facing pressures on the budget and why people are leaving in droves is the work that they are expected to do? The reason why the work is so tough is that the people who are supposed to be working next door to them&#151;DFID and the FCO&#151;are not able to conclude their jobs in time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80110-0018.htm_para28"><a name="08011057000787">When we go into a country, there is a small window of opportunity to win over hearts and minds, and we are failing miserably to do that.

Any soldier or sailor I spoke to during my visit to Iraq had little to say about the rest of the civil service. They were frustrated in their work.

DFID has passed its sell-by date in its nation-building work. We are doing a disservice to our armed forces and the personnel who operate and wear the uniform with such pride, because we are putting them in harm&#146;s way.

 I listened carefully to what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence had to say about the personnel Command Paper, and it put in my mind the importance of advocacy. My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) referred to his attempt to gain some recognition for the British Armed Forces Federation, an interesting subject that provided food for thought. There is often debate around whether a union is or is not applicable, and most hon. Members on both sides of the House agree that a union in its conventional format would not apply to the armed services. Interestingly, however, the legal position with the armed services as I understand it would be that, although service personnel could join a trade union, they simply could not be represented in the conventional way, and there is no move by the trade unions to take on that role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para0"><a name="08011057000791">Nevertheless, that raises the important issue of who advocates and how that advocacy is done.

I have read much that the British Armed Forces Federation has sent out and I have looked at its website. It seems to have many sensible things to say, and perhaps that is the way in which it can contribute.  <br>

</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08011057000792">There has been some advocacy recently, apparently on the part of service personnel, but I do not particularly agree with the style of what has been said. It has been done from the other House by former Chiefs of the Defence Staff. I have looked through the last 50 interventions and speeches made by Lords Inge, Guthrie and Boyce, but I have not seen a single reference to their own commercial interests&#151;directorships in various companies. They are companies of particular note, for which I have considerable respect. I do not see the need to mention them again here, although I have mentioned the matter to the companies concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para2"><a name="08011057000793">If those senior and experienced former officers want to make their interventions, the least that they can do is have the same standards that are required by this House. Sadly, we are not at liberty to make a complaint to the other place. We can write to the Lords Speaker, but we cannot instigate any kind of inquiry; it must be done there, so they are beyond reproach in that sense. However, it behoves us to put qualifying parameters around what these former senior officers say. They may technically be serving officers; I think that Lord Inge may still be a serving officer on half pay as a retired five-star officer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para3"><a name="08011057000794">It is important when we hear advocacy deployed by people in this House or next door in the other place to understand what other interests they may have&#151;particularly if they have considerable pecuniary interests, as Lord Inge and Lord Boyce especially have in the defence industry, but choose not to declare them. We have heard from the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron) how those Members of the other House choose not to court publicity, but I cannot imagine anything further from the truth. More recently, they have been making intervention after intervention in public debate, courting publicity where they can. That does not serve debate or advocacy on the part of armed services personnel particularly well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para4"><a name="08011057000795">Others wish to speak, so I simply conclude by saying that there is plenty of room for advocacy.

that by saying that the new Merville barracks in Colchester provide the best possible accommodation, and that is the yardstick for which we should strive for all single military accommodation in a much shorter time frame than is currently envisaged, with only 38,000 rooms, apparently, achieving a top rating. I was not so happy to learn that almost 9,000 families remain stuck in grade 4 homes and another 387 are in accommodation so poor that it does not even reach the lowest official grading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para6"><a name="08011057000800">I am bound to observe that the sale by the last Conservative Government of the Ministry of Defence housing stock to Annington Homes must have been the biggest privatisation rip-off of the lot. When he sums up, perhaps the Minister will confirm that since that privatisation the Ministry of Defence has paid Annington Homes more in rent than the Government received when the 55,000 dwellings were sold in 1996. What makes the situation even worse is that if those sales of surplus accommodation&#151;there have been many sales of such accommodation and Army land&#151;had been invested in Ministry of Defence housing, all our Army, Navy and Royal Air Force families would now be living in family accommodation that was second to none.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para7"><a name="08011057000801">I shall cite examples from my constituency of Colchester, and I cannot believe that they are isolated. Annington Homes managed to convince everybody that certain houses were so deplorable that they would have to be pulled down. The site has subsequently been sold off; land prices in Colchester are exceptionally high. Annington Homes made a financial killing, and only a tiny percentage came back to the Government&#151;not even to the Ministry of Defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para8"><a name="08011057000802">I shall give one other example, because the maths involved are easy for me. Some 40 former Ministry of Defence surplus dwellings on a single road had been purchased at an average price of &#163;15,000 at privatisation. They were subsequently sold for &#163;115,000, giving a gross profit of &#163;4 million on just 40 dwellings. That story can be repeated right across the country, wherever Annington Homes has been selling off properties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para9"><a name="08011057000803">I turn to education matters, in particular the &#147;Educating Service Children&#148; report, which has 33 recommendations. It would be interesting to know how many of them have been adopted by the Ministry of Defence. I shall concentrate on recommendation 5:</p>
<a name="80110-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="08011057000927"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The MoD and local education authorities should begin planning for the impact that the creation of Super Garrisons will have on pupil numbers in schools located near Service bases.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para10"><a name="08011057000804">Clearly, that recommendation has not been followed through in Colchester with the Ministry of Defence and Essex education authority; there is a proposal to close the secondary school to which the children go from age 11. That was the subject of my Adjournment debate of 22 October last year. Alderman Blaxill school is the smallest secondary school in Colchester; between a fifth and a quarter of its pupils come from Army families and its closure has clearly not been discussed with the MOD. I ask the Minister to look at that issue. Will he and his officials also look at my Adjournment debate of 25 October 1999 on the education of Army children? Clearly, issues raised then have not been addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para11"><a name="08011057000805">Finally in my short contribution I want to mention three primary schools whose pupils come predominantly from services families, in the context of the closure by Essex county council of the hot school meals service in the county. Some 90 per cent. of children at Montgomery infant school are Army children, as are 70 per cent. of Montgomery junior school pupils. No hot meals are provided for them. I suggest that if the Army can provide meals for our service personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq, there should be a system for providing hot school meals to children back in Colchester. About 60 per cent. of children at another school, St. Michael&#146;s primary, are also from Army families. I urge the Ministry of Defence to consider seriously the whole question of education provision. It should look at what the Defence Committee said and act accordingly.</p>

 I have obviously drawn the short straw, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but I am grateful at least to have been able to draw one, however short.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para12"><a name="08011057000807">One of the gratifying things about this debate is that it will be apparent to anybody who listens in from outside that there is absolute unanimity among everybody who has spoken, and in all parties in this House, about the importance of the military covenant and the commitment of any Government who send our troops abroad to ensure that they are properly supported, trained and equipped, and that they have fair and decent terms and conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para13"><a name="08011057000808">On that latter point, in my 20 years in the House there have never been a Government who have made so much progress in such a short time. Clearly, one never meets all one&#146;s desiderata in life; equally clearly, there will always be public expenditure constraints. However, in the short space of time&#151;18 months&#151;that the Secretary of State has been in his present role, we have had the introduction of the operational allowance, which is tax-free and amounts to about &#163;2,400 at the end of a six-month deployment; that is very significant. We have had an improved deployment welfare package, including 20 additional days&#146; leave at the end of a six-month deployment. We have had new rules and better ceilings for the compensation scheme. We have had the tax-free council tax rebate. We have had the new military wing at Selly Oak hospital in Birmingham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para14"><a name="08011057000809">We have had, very importantly and for the first time ever, a cross-Government strategy for military personnel involving the MOD and the other Departments that are so crucial: the Department for Children, Schools and Families, which is important for reasons that the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) mentioned; the Department of Health, which is important in terms of access to dental care and general practitioners as well as the military wings such as those at Selly Oak hospital; the Ministry of Justice which is important because of the sad matter of coroners&#146; inquests; and the Department for Communities and Local Government, which deals with access to council housing&#151;I think that everyone in the House greatly welcomes the announcement of the legislation on that subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para15"><a name="08011057000810">Last but not least, there is the pay deal, which has been very good, with the lowest ranks achieving 9.2 per cent. I personally express the great hope that this year  <br>

the Government are again generous, because the military deserve to be treated as a very special case in relation to everybody else. That includes even the police, who may once or twice in their careers face a life-threatening situation, whereas the military live for six months at a time, on one deployment, with the prospect of being killed at any time. That is a very different psychological situation and a very different career pattern to adopt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para16"><a name="08011057000811">Apart from the covenant that the Government of the day have with the military&#151; although, as I said, this Government have a wonderful record, taking into account all the obvious realities and constraints&#151;there is a wider public covenant with the military. After all, the people who are in Helmand province and in Basra are risking their lives for our sakes. There is no doubt that if the terrorists who attacked last year in London and Glasgow had had the benefit of a six-month training course in Afghanistan in bomb-making and detonation techniques, the results of their endeavours would have been very different. There is no question but that the young men and women who are defending us in Afghanistan are risking their lives for our sakes. The covenant is not confined to the Government; it is an obligation that we all have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para17"><a name="08011057000812">There is overwhelming support in the country for the armed services in principle, with perhaps a few unfortunate exceptions, to which I shall refer in a moment. People often do not have the opportunities that they would like to express their sense of solidarity with the armed forces. The point has already been well made that there is probably less personal contact with and understanding of the military than there was in previous generations. In the world war two generation, or indeed the national service generation, almost every family had someone in uniform. The situation is very different now, and there are greater opportunities for misunderstandings or simple ignorance. The degree of public support for and understanding of the military is very important, because that is the context in which our armed services operate and recruit. It is also vital for morale, because nothing could be more demoralising than feeling that one is risking one&#146;s life for people who are profoundly indifferent to, ignorant about or ill-informed as to what one is doing. Any sense of misunderstanding or misperception is very unfortunate and one would want to remove it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para18"><a name="08011057000813">Recently, there have been one or two very unfortunate incidents; they were exceptional and egregious, but extremely unattractive incidents. In one case, according to the popular press&#151;I have not yet investigated this directly&#151;a soldier in uniform was refused service on the forecourt of a BP service station. That was widely reported. In another incident, which I have investigated, having written to Mr. al-Fayed about it, a soldier was refused admission to Harrods because he was in uniform. That sort of thing is utterly disgraceful. Not very long ago, a woman was apparently insultingly rude about some wounded or crippled soldiers who were using a swimming bath. These unfortunate incidents are, of course, blown up by the popular press, but the fact that they exist must be a matter of deep concern to us.</p>

what initiatives might be envisaged to enhance public understanding and respect for the armed services. In that, I am well supported by Air Commodore Martin Sharp, and Bill Clark OBE, who is a senior MOD civil servant. I hope that we can make a modest contribution to improvement in that field, as the Government have so laudably done by fulfilling their obligations under their military compact with the armed services.</p>

 I begin by drawing the attention of the House to my entry in the Register of Members&#146; Interests. I would also like to add my expression of admiration for our men and women in uniform, their long-suffering families, veterans and the organisations that look after them and their interests, often unsung. Veterans Aid, an organisation that I visited on Tuesday with my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis), is a drop-in centre near Victoria station, and many such organisations are doing similar work unsung, day in and day out, and we must pay tribute to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para20"><a name="08011057000816">We have had an interesting and varied debate. A total of 11 Back-Bench speakers have all added, in their individual way, to the debate on this important subject. The right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) said that he was concerned about cadets and how people&#146;s exposure to the military may have been reduced in modern times. He might have mentioned the abolition of the Government&#146;s school visits teams, which were doing a great deal to increase the profile of the military in our schools but have been replaced by a compact disc.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para21"><a name="08011057000817">The hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie) talked about mental health problems. I sincerely recommend that he visit the medical assessment programme at St. Thomas&#146; hospital, which I did on Tuesday. I say in all sincerity that if he did so, he might gain a slightly more profound understanding of some of the extremely complex&#151;and in many ways highly technical&#151;issues that relate to mental health, and of the occupational implications of service in the armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para22"><a name="08011057000818">The hon.

However, when we recruit people to our armed forces, it is appropriate that we highlight the positive aspects that represent a truthful reflection of what they are likely to be exposed to. Certainly, things such as sport and adventurous training, which have deteriorated in recent years because of operational commitments and pressures, are not quite as obvious an attraction to our young men and women as they were 20 or 25 years ago when I joined up. It is right that we paint an accurate picture of what the future holds in store for our recruits. My right hon. Friend also echoed Lord Guthrie&#146;s remarks about the now Prime Minister&#146;s apparent disinterest in military matters when he was Chancellor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para30"><a name="08011057000826">It is important to place what we now call the military covenant in a proper historical context. Rudyard Kipling talked about the trials of Tommy Atkins in 1892. He was observed to be the saviour of his country in wartime but at other times was denigrated by an ungrateful and unappreciative public, who misunderstood him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para31"><a name="08011057000827">A hundred years on, it seems as though Tommy is still being slighted in some quarters. We have heard about people being told to remove the Queen&#146;s uniform in British hospitals, airports, even sports facilities and being refused service in retail outlets. The difference between then and now is that our society is less deferential, less civil and arguably less polite. People&#146;s ire today is freely and frankly expressed. Disapproval of the military has been heightened by unpopular conflicts and the Government&#146;s failure to win the British people&#146;s support for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="80110-0019.htm_para32"><a name="08011057000828">The military covenant is a deal that is struck in recognition of our troops&#146; willingness to sacrifice everything. It is a tripartite deal, which involves, in equal measure, our armed forces, the people and the Government. According to ex-service chiefs and charities, two of those parties have reneged on the deal. Understanding the public&#146;s attitude to the military does not necessarily help us fix it. Tommy Atkins may simply have to put up with the cold shoulder of public opinion, but there is no excuse for the third party to the covenant, the Government, to mirror society in disregarding the Army and its veterans.</p>

covenant. Given the unpopularity of their wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, this Government, more than any other, owe it to the armed forces to do the right thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80110-0020.htm_para1"><a name="08011057000830">Who can doubt that overstretch and incompletely funded discretionary commitments lie at the heart of the current sad state of affairs? They run as a thread through everything that relates to the armed forces today. Our troops put up with single accommodation for trained soldiers that first-year college students would laugh at. They put up with a gulf between social housing and homes apparently fit for heroes and with a Government who refuse to adopt even the minimal decent homes standards that apply elsewhere. As the Public Accounts Committee said in November, housing is viewed as low-hanging fruit when savings are required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80110-0020.htm_para2"><a name="08011057000831">Our soldiers put up with inequitable Government funding for Army schoolchildren in counties such as mine. In a letter to me this week, the Minister for Schools and Learners suggested that he would consider a revision to the funding formula to reflect forces children only in the context of people such as migrant workers, whose children also changed schools frequently. No special consideration&#151;so much for the military covenant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80110-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08011057000832">We have seen harmony guidelines routinely breached, with 10 per cent. of the Army&#146;s trained strength currently affected and dire consequences for mental, physical and domestic well-being, as we know from a recent study published in the <i> British Medical Journal</i>. We have seen delayed coroners&#146; inquests, as well as a gross shortage in medical staffing, including a monstrous 55 per cent. shortfall in trained doctors in the Defence Medical Services, and a Government unwilling to say whether increased spending on the NHS has been reflected in full by a commensurate uplift for defence medicine. We see compensation for wounds that looks tawdry when set against settlements for relatively minor industrial injuries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80110-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08011057000833">All those are examples of how a mismatch between commitments and resources and the traditional grudging attitude of Labour Ministers to the military has fractured the covenant between the armed forces and the Government. The result is that people who can leave do leave, hence the Public Accounts Committee&#146;s revelation in July that there are now more than 80 operational pinch points, from medics to aircrew. That is why 1,344 Army officers quit in the final six months of last year, which was twice the comparable six-month figure for 2005-06 and three times the figure for 2004-05.</p>

I am sorry that I will not be able to respond to all the points that have been raised, but I thought that it was more important that the hon. Gentleman and I should both agree to shorten our contributions to enable those who have made the effort to turn up to speak. There is a degree of expertise in the House that is recognised on both sides. I will do my best in the time remaining to respond to the many points that have been made and will write to hon. Members afterwards if I do not manage to cover the issues that they raised.</p>

Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) asked me about super-garrisons and our continued commitment to them. We are indeed still committed to the creation of super-garrisons. He is right that they will offer opportunities for improved individual development and have the potential to give stability to Army families. I know that he is anxious that we should do something in Stafford&#151;he is relentless in his representations on behalf of his constituency&#151;but such issues are complicated and are tied up with the issue of bringing home troops from Germany, as he said. We are looking to travel in the direction that he would want us to travel in, but not necessarily at the speed at which he would want things done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="80110-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08011057000841">My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) welcomed the Command Paper and raised a couple of important points that are worth addressing. First, he asked about the appropriate role for charities  <br>

<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column 624</b><br>
and for the Government? We have a long-established principle in this country that charities should play a role. Is there any hon. Member in any political party who wants to see that diminished, who does not want it continued, who does not acknowledge the fantastic work that many military charities do and have done over many years? It is not for the Government to do everything, but of course the Government have responsibilities and must discharge them. There is no way that we want to disincentivise the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association, the Royal British Legion and all the other organisations that support our military.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="80110-0020.htm_para12"><a name="08011057000842">Secondly, my hon. Friend, along with other Members, raised the issue of inquests. We are making progress on inquests, as we have given additional resources to both the Oxford and the Wiltshire coroners to enable them to do more. As part of the Command Paper, we are looking into whether we should do more to support service families in their bereavement. I accept my hon. Friend&#146;s point that changing this may not necessarily be my top priority, but I ask other hon. Members who call for a change to think very seriously about what they want us to do with the coroner service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="80110-0020.htm_para13"><a name="08011057000843">The Ministry of Defence is represented by lawyers at only a minority&#151;a small minority&#151;of coroners&#146; inquests. If we want to give families legal aid in order for them to be represented at such inquests, we are effectively saying that lawyers should have a role in them, which fundamentally changes the nature of coroners&#146; courts. I do not know whether Members really want that fundamental change and I am not at all sure that that is the best use of the money we have to support families, particularly bereaved families. There is a lot more that we could and should do, so we are looking into that as part of the Command Paper.</p>

Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) felt that other Government Departments were falling down and not necessarily doing the business, leaving the military to hold the baby, as it were, in areas of operations such as Iraq and Afghanistan. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was present when the Prime Minister announced the &#147;next steps&#148; for Afghanistan, recognising the need for a comprehensive approach. We acknowledge the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that the military can do only so much and that other organisations&#151;not just our own Government organisations&#151;have a role to play. The politics of Iraq underpins some of these issues and it is the politicians of Iraq who can and should pick them up and take them forward. They have the ability, the wherewithal and the finances to do so. Our military cannot be blamed if everything has not been put in place at the appropriate time, when they have done a good job in providing the stability that has allowed progress to be made in the first place.</p>

 One subject that I have discussed with the Secretary of State is the introduction of a co-ordinator or a lead figure in Afghanistan to join together the work of all the key bodies&#151;the EU, the Department for International Development, the United States Agency for International Development and so forth. There has been a great deal of talk about that, including from the former Prime Minister and our current Prime Minister, so can the Minister update the House on what is happening about this appointment?

He is right: we still live with the consequences of that contract. As he said, we have paid more in rent than we have received. However, the contract was entered into and we must honour it. The company had the good fortune to buy property at the bottom of the market at a time when it was impossible to lose.</p>

As the Secretary of State said in his opening speech, we recognise what still needs to be done to improve accommodation, but let us stop this nonsense about half our accommodation being substandard by any measure. The standards that we use to measure our service accommodation are higher than the standards applied in civilian life&#151;and rightly so&#151;and we have aspirations to ensure that our people live in the best grade of accommodation. The fact that we are not prepared to lower our aspirations should not allow people to exaggerate the situation. There are people who must put up with bad accommodation, and I accept that it is 100 per cent. bad for them, but huge progress is being made. Money is being spent and has been spent over a long period, and we have plans for continued spending which the Secretary of State set out.</p>

I remind him that a month or so ago his party presented the House with a paper describing its commitment to the armed forces, and a disclaimer: &#147;By the way, we have not put any budget into this&#148;. That was a rather bigger commitment than the commitment to recruitment. We have recruitment capability the length and breadth of the country, and it is budgeted for. I hope that the hon. Gentleman did not mean that. I think he was saying that we needed additional resources for recruitment, but if his party cannot include any commitment in a strategic paper, claiming that we are letting our armed forces down and then saying that there is no money attached to its proposals, he hardly has a case for saying that we have no money for recruitment.</p>

 I thank the Speaker for selecting this topic for this evening&#146;s debate, as it gives me a chance to air an appalling case involving the Child Support Agency, which raises important points of principle that require debate and resolution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="80110-0020.htm_para22"><a name="08011057000859">I need to start by outlining the basic details of the case, which started on 5 February 2007 when a constituent of mine, Ryan Kennedy, was contacted by the CSA to inform him that he had been named as the father of a six-year-old child. He did not think that he was the father of the child, but he wanted things to be sorted out as quickly as possible so he co-operated with the agency in having the DNA testing carried out immediately&#151;within the two-week required period. He conformed entirely with CSA regulations; indeed, he did so partly because he was told that if he refused to co-operate he would automatically be declared the father of the child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="80110-0020.htm_para23"><a name="08011057000860">Mr. Kennedy spent the &#163;200 on the test, and then heard nothing. Bearing in mind that that was in February 2007, he repeatedly contacted the CSA, was passed on from individual to individual and had telephone calls ignored, and in the end, in desperation, he came to my office to see if I could move things forward for him. Indeed, it took me some time to get some clarification from the CSA, but it emerged that the mother of the child had refused to have the DNA test done either on herself or on the child involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="80110-0020.htm_para24"><a name="08011057000861">I would like to read a statement made by my constituent, which exhibits the burning sense of injustice felt by him at this point in the proceedings:</p>

On telling me that he was getting married this year&#151;2008&#151;he immediately impressed upon me the critical nature of the situation he was in. He was getting married and at the stage when the arrangements were being made&#151;he was buying a house&#151;suddenly there was a child on the horizon whom nobody knew about.</p>

It does not take a mathematician to work out that someone on an average salary, which is approximately &#163;20,000 a year in Sheffield, would face a substantial backdated claim over a period of years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08011057000871">Something had to be done. I wrote to the Minister on 20 September asking for amendments to the law, especially given that we had the opportunity to do that easily because legislation was going through Parliament. That approach led to an ongoing correspondence with Ministers in the other place and the CSA, and in turn to two outcomes. First, on 21 December, my constituent&#146;s case was resolved, but only because the parent with care ceased to claim benefits. The case was thus closed and we were informed of that fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para2"><a name="08011057000872">Secondly, on 7 December, we received a letter from the Department&#146;s Minister in the other place, which made it clear that there could be a way forward in terms of the general principle applying in this case. It stated:</p>
<a name="80110-0021.htm_brev1"><a name="08011057000935"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill...includes a clause which repeals section 6 of the Child Support Act 1991. If section 6 is repealed it will mean that parents with care claiming benefits will no longer be required to apply for child maintenance through the state system. Therefore, where the mother refuses to comply with Agency regulations the case will be closed.&#148;</p>

First, I want to draw attention to the inadequacy of the responses that we have received, in the context of the lack of awareness demonstrated to an individual caught up in a situation clearly not of his own making. Secondly, I want to discuss the discrimination and the human rights implications of the case. I then wish to ask three questions of the Minister.</p>

<a name="80110-0021.htm_brev2"><a name="08011057000936"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Although Mr. Kennedy was unhappy with this response the Agency can confirm that it has followed all the appropriate guidelines and legislation in addressing the issue of establishing if he is the father&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para5"><a name="08011057000875">To say that he was unhappy with the response was an understatement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para6"><a name="08011057000876">No sense of understanding of my constituent&#146;s position was given in that final paragraph. The CSA did not seem to be bothered about trying to understand the perspective of my constituent and how he might feel about the situation; it only seemed to be bothered about the fact that it was in the clear legally and that it had not done anything wrong. That seemed to be all the CSA was going to say about the matter. Its attitude was, &#147;He can live with it. We are okay. We have not done anything wrong. We are just applying the law as it stands.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para7"><a name="08011057000877">In further discussions that I had with CSA staff, rather unusually, a different attitude was demonstrated. When I discussed the matter on the phone and when the position became clear, a degree of sympathy was shown, and that was more than welcome. That was the first time that I experienced that kind of personalised response to a case in my conversations with the CSA.</p>

I got my first response on 23 October, which advised me that if my constituent was unhappy with the situation, he should go to court to try to obtain a declaration of non-parentage under the Family Law Act 1986. The response made it clear that the Department for Work and Pensions did not think that the law needed to be changed, but what kind of response was that? After all, my constituent was not in a situation of his own making. He could not afford to go to court to resolve the issue and he had complied at every stage with the CSA regulations. Why should citizens of this country have to take drastic legal action to resolve a situation when they have done nothing wrong, have not broken any law and do not have to defend any action against them? It is down to Parliament to resolve such difficulties&#151;such legal complications&#151;to ensure that the situation does not arise again with the CSA or any body that replaces it.</p>

That is clearly discriminatory, although it looks as though it will be resolved through changes to the legislation. My constituent suffered the knock-on effect of that discrimination. Because the woman who had named him as the father of the child was claiming benefit, he was liable to be held on the CSA&#146;s books for 13 years. If she had not been on benefit and had made a private claim, that would not have happened. That is clearly discriminatory. The problem was compounded in this case because the individual had done nothing wrong, and certainly nothing to deserve such discrimination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para10"><a name="08011057000880">The case also has human rights implications. If someone is kept on the books of an organisation for up to 13 years&#151;up to 19 years in some cases&#151;they will face huge costs over the period, and not just financial. There are the psychological costs, as well as the possible impact on any marriage and the decision on whether to start a family. The threat posed by the CSA to keep the claim on the books for that period had a huge impact on the life of Mr. Kennedy. I repeat the point that I made in a letter to the Department:</p>
<a name="80110-0021.htm_brev3"><a name="08011057000937"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If this Government is about anything, it is about equality and individual rights. I think in these circumstances the Government is falling short of these exemplary aspirations.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para11"><a name="08011057000881">I look to the Minister today for answers, in the hope that we can resolve the discrimination and human rights issues raised by this case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para12"><a name="08011057000882">I would also like clarification of some points of principle from the Minister. If section 6 of the Child Support Act 1991 is to be repealed by Parliament, can the Minister confirm that that will release individuals such as my constituent from the threat that is held over them? In other words, can the Minister confirm that it will not happen again?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para13"><a name="08011057000883">When the legislation has gone through Parliament, will it be applied retrospectively? Can the Minister confirm that individuals currently caught in similar situations with the CSA will be able to resolve their cases under the provisions of the new legislation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para14"><a name="08011057000884">Finally, there is the important issue of the DNA. I do not believe that individuals who are arrested and never charged should have their DNA samples held by the state. In this case, Mr. Kennedy was not arrested, he did nothing wrong and he was not charged with any crime. In the end, he was not even charged money for giving the sample. Surely it is only right that the DNA sample should be destroyed. Will the Minister confirm that DNA samples that are proved to be redundant to CSA claims and processes are destroyed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para15"><a name="08011057000885">This is the by far the worst case involving the CSA with which I have ever had to deal, and that is saying something. I think that most hon. Members will agree that the CSA is a difficult agency to deal with. My constituent wanted the matter raised even though his case has now been resolved because he does not want the same to happen to anyone else. He has compromised his confidentiality to allow me to put the case on the record. That shows how strongly he feels about the year of hell that he has been through. How many others are in the same situation? It would be interesting to know. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith) on bringing up the case, as she has the right to do, and on the way in which she has done so. I have looked at the file and the case history and can only agree that it is an appalling case.

what he has, he might have wished to preserve his anonymity. However, despite having endured what he has as a result of the mistakes made, he is acting on behalf of others by allowing my hon. Friend to mention his case to ensure that such things do not happen to other people. That is a noble action, in the circumstances, given what he has had to endure as a result of the agency&#146;s mistakes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para17"><a name="08011057000888">I heard what my hon. Friend said about the inadequacy of the responses that she received from the agency in the early stages of her inquiry&#151;both from the hotline and in written correspondence. From what she has said, it sounds as though some information provided by the agency in written correspondence was not correct. That should not happen, either. I reassure her that we have been aware for some time of issues about the hotline and the speediness and accuracy of written responses. Action has been taken to improve both and I am sure that both have been considerably improved since she took up the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para18"><a name="08011057000889">Mr. Kennedy will, I am sure, be grateful to have an MP who has pursued his case with such assiduousness when bringing the issues to the attention of the Government in order, we hope, to resolve matters. As my hon. Friend has said, many matters have been resolved in the case but the bigger issues that have emerged still need to be dealt with. I shall direct most of my comments at them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para19"><a name="08011057000890">I want first to apologise to Mr. Kennedy for the distress and frustration that he has experienced since February 2007. As my hon. Friend outlined, the issues are difficult and sensitive, and the agency should clearly have handled the case far better than it did. As she said, the case was closed on 20 December, at the request of the parent with care when she moved off benefit and became a private client. However, despite that positive outcome for Mr Kennedy, we must not lose sight of the difficult issues at the heart of the case. I should like to run through the facts of the case to aid our understanding of the issues highlighted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para20"><a name="08011057000891">In response to my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns, the Child Support Agency carried out an investigation into the circumstances that led it to contact her constituent. That investigation has concluded that the information that the agency had received from the mother of the child in question was insufficient to justify contacting Mr. Kennedy in the first place. The agency should not have approached Mr. Kennedy at all, and I very much regret that it did so. Given the impact that the agency&#146;s involvement has had on Mr. Kennedy, I am pleased to advise my hon. Friend that it intends to award him a significant consolatory payment, to reflect the gross inconvenience that has been caused to him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para21"><a name="08011057000892">That leaves us with the three issues that my hon. Friend raised: how it came about that the agency contacted Mr. Kennedy in the first place, what it could have done to resolve his paternity dispute, and what action it will take in the future to prevent similar problems arising.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para22"><a name="08011057000893">On the first point, the facts are that the mother of the child in question applied to the CSA for maintenance for her child in September 2005. She was obliged to do so, because she had claimed a prescribed benefit. The information that she gave about the father of the child consisted solely of a name and a past but not very specific address. The agency&#146;s internal procedures in  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 Jan 2008">

<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column 632</b><br>
such cases require staff to gather sufficient information to make a positive match&#151;for example full name, date of birth, address, and/or place of employment. I am sorry to say that the agency did not do that in the case of Mr. Kennedy. Instead of returning to the child&#146;s mother for any further information that she might have had, it made the incorrect assumption that my hon. Friend&#146;s constituent was the same Mr. Kennedy named by the child&#146;s mother. Of course, he was not&#151;as the agency would have realised if it had followed procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para23"><a name="08011057000894">In response to the agency&#146;s contact in February 2007, Mr. Kennedy denied that he was the father of the child. He agreed to take a DNA test to resolve the matter, and by early March 2007 had done so. The child&#146;s mother, however, did not. In such instances, the usual action for the agency is to ask the benefit-paying authority&#151;in this case, Jobcentre Plus&#151;to reduce the benefit of the parent with care to encourage her to consent to a DNA test. The agency eventually did that in June 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para24"><a name="08011057000895">I turn now to the second point. In cases such as this, where paternity cannot be resolved, the CSA is unable to force a parent with care to comply with DNA testing. The mother remained non-compliant, and the agency did not make any further progress with the case. On the assumption that it had contacted the right Mr. Kennedy in the first place, it could have resolved the matter by obtaining a declaration of non-parentage from the courts. Dealing with the matter in that way almost certainly would have resulted in the courts directing that a DNA test be carried out. Had the mother refused to comply with the court&#146;s direction, the court would have been able to draw inferences from that in deciding whether or not the alleged non-resident parent was indeed the father.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para25"><a name="08011057000896">Taking that action would have prevented Mr. Kennedy from facing months of uncertainty as to whether he was the father of the child and therefore liable to pay maintenance for that child. The agency did not take that action, but it should have done. Once more, I apologise for that on its behalf. I thank my hon. Friend for her involvement, as it was helpful in bringing this matter to the agency's attention and thus helping us to resolve it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para26"><a name="08011057000897">My hon. Friend has rightly pointed out that had the case been a private one, the agency would have been able to close the case as soon as the DNA test was refused, thus preventing the situation from occurring in the first place. However, as the mother was included in a claim for income support, the agency was obliged to keep the case open. Child support legislation does not currently allow the Secretary of State the discretion to close cases of that type&#151;commonly called section 6 cases&#151;and it does not allow the agency to close down the potential liability created by its initial contact with Mr. Kennedy. In other words, had the parent with care later co-operated and had Mr. Kennedy been found to be the child's father, he would have been liable for maintenance back to the date on which we first contacted him. In any case, closing the case would not have resolved the paternity dispute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para27"><a name="08011057000898">On 20 December 2007, the agency learned that the parent with care was no longer in receipt of benefit and contacted her to see whether she wished to continue using the agency. She advised that she did not and the case was closed, effective from the date on which she first applied. However, as I have already said, that  <br>

<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column 633</b><br>
positive outcome does not excuse the frustration and difficulties experienced by Mr. Kennedy, and I shall now outline what we are doing to ensure that such cases are handled better in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para28"><a name="08011057000899">The principal failure in Mr. Kennedy's case was the agency's decision to contact him without taking reasonable steps to assure itself that he was the Mr. Kennedy named by the mother. That was due to staff not following internal procedures as they should have done. That is quite unacceptable. In the light of this, the agency has plans in place to write to all its staff reminding them of the need to gather sufficient information to make a positive match before contacting an alleged non-resident parent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para29"><a name="08011057000900">The repeal of section 6 of the Child Support Act 1991 by the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill, which is now going through Parliament, will also mean that parents with care claiming benefit are no longer automatically treated as making a claim for child support, allowing for cases such as this to be closed in the same way as they are for private clients. That will deal with my hon. Friend&#146;s point about inconsistency of treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para30"><a name="08011057000901">My hon. Friend asked whether our contractor has destroyed Mr. Kennedy's DNA sample. I can confirm that it has been destroyed. DNA samples are held by the agency's contracted supplier of DNA testing and access is restricted to laboratory staff. The contactor  <br>

destroys samples after three months and all case records are destroyed one year after the case has been resolved. If it is not resolved, the sample will be destroyed on the agency's request.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para31"><a name="08011057000902">My hon. Friend also asked whether the section 6 repeal will allow this issue to be raised in relation to existing cases. I confirm that it will, so not only future cases but current ones will be with the maintenance commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para32"><a name="08011057000903">I hope that my response has provided my hon. Friend with some reassurance that the flaws in the child support system uncovered by that very bad case are being dealt with, both through the measures in the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill and through operational policy changes within the agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="80110-0021.htm_para33"><a name="08011057000904">Once again, I apologise for the distress caused to Mr. Kennedy by the way in which the agency handled the case, which was inexcusable. In addition to the measures that I have outlined this evening, I shall write to him myself, on behalf of my Department, to express my regret about the way in which the agency mishandled the case and the consequent distress caused to him. I think that I owe him that, on the agency&#146;s behalf. I again thank my hon. Friend for bringing the case to the attention of the House and for giving me the opportunity to respond in full to the points that she has raised.</p>
