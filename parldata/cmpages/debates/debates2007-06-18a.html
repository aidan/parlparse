The fact that hundreds are likely to contract those disorders after coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan has been described as a ticking time-bomb. This is not about NHS or private treatment. However, surely dedicated specialist help needs to be easily accessible to the ex-military with post-traumatic stress disorders? Will the Minister take responsibility for setting that up?</p>

 The NHS has always had responsibility for the treatment of veterans. We have worked closely with Combat Stress, which provides a good service and support. We have funded it to the tune of about &#163;2.9 million and will significantly increase its funding this year. I announced last Monday the extension of the medical assessment programme, through which former service personnel who served from 1982 onwards, which includes those involved in the Falklands campaign, will be able to go to St. Thomas&#146; hospital for a medical assessment that will be carried out by Dr. Ian Palmer, an expert in military psychiatry. I believe that that has been widely welcomed as a positive step forward. We are working with Combat Stress and the health service to determine how we can develop pilot schemes that will enable the NHS to draw on expertise and help as it treats former personnel who might have developed a mental illness as a result of their time in the services.</p>

 I am quite convinced that our armed forces personnel who have been injured and wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq are getting world-class treatment and care at Selly Oak. That is provided by our military medical personnel, who include 26 nurses&#151;the number will rise to 39 in the summer&#151;welfare support and liaison officers, and military clinicians. However, the fantastic NHS clinicians and nurses also do an absolutely wonderful job of supporting and working with our injured personnel. We are just about to finish work on a partition to bring about a greater military ethos in the ward. Our personnel are getting world-class treatment, although we can always learn from events and any complaints will be investigated.

 Will the Minister review the way in which the mental health charity Combat Stress is financed? He is right to say that it has a wonderful record, but the charity can receive money from the Ministry of Defence only for those who are in receipt of a war pension, and many servicemen and women do not show symptoms of stress until up to14 years after they have been discharged from the services. The problem is therefore going to grow, and a brilliantly cost-effective way of dealing with it would be through that well established charity, which he visited in December and I visited with the Defence Committee last Thursday.</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman says, the charity Combat Stress does excellent work and I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to see exactly what itdoes. As I said, we fund the charity to the tune of&#163;2.9 million and we are going to give it a significant increase in funding. Perhaps I did not make this clear in my previous answer, but we are considering setting up pilot schemes around the country to enable the NHS, Combat Stress and the MOD to see how we can improve the support for former service personnel who suffer mental illness as a result of their service, and part of that work will cover commissioning. That has been welcomed by Combat Stress, but there is more work to be done. I hope that we will be able to make an announcement on those pilot schemes in the not-too-distant future.</p>

 I thank my right hon. Friend for that question. A study by King&#146;s college London showed that there were more reservists than regulars suffering from mental health problems. Although the difference was not significant, it was large enough for us to examine the issue to see what more we could do. Often, such people do not go back as formed units or to friends back at a barracks or base; they go back to communities around the country.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. My hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins) made a similar point about transfer and the importance of making sure that there are links between the military medical services and the NHS. Of course we speak to our colleagues at the Department for Health&#151;for example, my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Health and for Defence had a meeting a few months ago to discuss how to continue to co-ordinate and improve medical support for armed forces or ex-armed forces personnel. The pilot schemes I mentioned earlier are important in providing the NHS with expert help to determine the best way to care for and treat those who have developed a mental health condition as a result of their time in the armed forces.</p>

from the military medical point of view. We are increasing his hours from one day a week to five days a week. That is a significant increase in the resources that we are making available, and we will make further resources available if that is needed. I might just make the point that in the end we did not have to use all the resources that we provided for the reservist mental health scheme. As I am sure the hon. Gentleman will accept, we are not sure about the numbers of people who will use the service. The key thing is to get it off the ground, and to ensure that our veterans know that it is available and that they can use it to get their mental health assessment and medical assessment.

The Navy is doing more across the world than it ever did before, and as we will no doubt hear in response to questions if we come to them during this Question Time, it can look forward to being equipped over the next 10 or 20 years with the best modern ships that the world has seen.</p>

 Last Monday I visited Iraq and discussed the coalition&#146;s counter-insurgency operations with General Petraeus and others. The military part of the counter-insurgency strategy has a number of strands, including targeted operations and restriction of freedom of movement. The political and economic regeneration efforts are key components, and it is the Iraqi Government who must deliver for the people. If they do not, the insurgents will seek to fill the gap. When I met the Iraqi Prime Minister and the presidency council with the Chancellor, we pressed this point.</p>

That is exactly the message that my right hon. Friend gave the Iraqi Government, and which I gave to those whom I met when I was in Washington recently myself.

 My hon.

That is why we have UK forces deployed along the border in Maysanand why we continue to train and mentor the Iraqi Department of Border Enforcement, which has ultimate responsibility for border issues.

fortnightly to ensure that it is current, because there were complaints when we were updating it monthly that it was being held back for too long. We are able to update it fortnightly, so there is no question of the information being kept secret. From my point of view as Secretary of State, I agree with the hon. Gentleman. Just as yesterday and over the past week the knowledge of the sacrifice that our services made in relation to the Falklands was part of the country&#146;s appreciation of their contribution, the people of this country should know exactly the sacrifices that our young men and women are making for our freedoms when they are in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am very conscious of the level of casualties and our need to do everything we can to reduce that casualty rate to a minimum. I am pleased to say that through our counter-insurgency strategy we have seen some progress in that regard, in relation to how we deal with indirect fire in southern Iraq.</p>

 To return to the Iranian influence mentioned by the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay), I am sure that the Secretary of State would like to welcome the talks between the United States and Iran on the general security situation in Iraq. However, given that, as he says, it is British forces in southern Iraq who are facing the insurgency, as are British forces on the border with Iran, what involvement did the UK have in those discussions? Was a British general present at that meeting between the United States and Iran, and if not, why not? As our armed forces are involved, surely we should be part of those discussions.</p>

 The reason why there was no British general present at the meeting between the US ambassador to Iraq and the Iranian ambassador to Iraq is that no military people were present at that meeting at all. It was a meeting between the ambassadors of those respective countries. We should of course welcome that development in terms of the engagement between these two countries, which have not had such a level of engagement for some decades. The hon. Gentleman and all Members of the House can rest assured that we take every opportunity that we can to impress on the Iranians the need for them to counter the flow of weaponry, support and training that we believe is coming into southern Iraq and other parts of Iraq. It is not in the interests of Iran, which will continue to have close relations with Iraq in the future, to destabilise that part of Iraq. We make that very clear to them and take every opportunity we can to do so.</p>

On a recent trip to the Gulf states, I made it perfectly clear to those who regularly engage with the Iranian Government that they should give that Government the clear message that they are potentially destabilising southern Iraq and that, in the long term, they are undermining their own interests by their behaviour&#151;not to mention the view that we take of their supported attacks by proxies on our own soldiers.</p>

 I know that the hon. Gentleman has significant knowledge of what is happening in Afghanistan and, in particular, in Helmand province. He will know that there are NGOs operating there, but not in the numbers that we should hope and expect. In my view, the most important development would be getting the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan to open an office in Helmand province. If the United Nations were present that would indicate to NGOs across the world that Helmand province was a place where they could do their business. When I was at the United Nations recently in New York, I spoke about this with the Secretary-General and, indeed, with the person responsible for the security of its people, and I hope that we shall soon be able to make some progress in that regard.</p>

It is clear that without the co-operation of the NGOs, who will not operate there because it is too dangerous, very little construction can continue. Is it not time to re-examine the purpose of the Helmand mission so that we can concentrate on attainable objectives that will reduce the number of casualties among civilian Afghans and British soldiers?</p>

 The loss of any life is a tragedy and British forces take exceptional care to avoid such incidents as generate civilian casualties.

This week, of course, showed that the Taliban had no such concerns when they exploded a bomb in the centre of Kabul. That is part of the problem. I know precisely what my hon.

 Counter-narcotics is, of course, a significant challenge. Although progress has been made in some parts of Afghanistan where security has been improved to a particular level, the production of opium has increased in other parts, including the province of Helmand where we have responsibility. The answer is to develop infrastructure and, in particular, alternative livelihoods for peasant farmers so that we can encourage them to move away from growing poppy, which they are often pressurised into doing by insurgents&#151;and, increasingly, by the Taliban themselves. We are constantly working to improve governance across Helmand province and the south of Afghanistan and to improve the opportunities for local people to generate their livelihoods in an alternative manner.</p>

 In my view, we should measure our success by continuing to make progress. We have made significant progress since last year when we faced a difficult challenge in the response from the Taliban as we deployed in Afghanistan. Those who look carefully at such issues and take into account the degree of propaganda generated by the Taliban will know that the Taliban have not met their propaganda about a spring offensive this year. We have had a much better year in terms of our ability to extend security across the province. There are still significant challenges, but we are making progress.</p>

 Members on both sides of the House will have been alarmed at reports that shortages of helicopters in Afghanistan have been responsible for delays in removing the wounded to hospital and that increased numbers of road journeys have to be undertaken because of insufficient transport helicopters, thus making troops more vulnerable to roadside bombs. How are the Government delivering on their pledge that our troops in Afghanistan will have enough attack and transport helicopters for the purposes for which they are needed?</p>

 In answer to the first part of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question, the surgeon general, who has responsibility for the area, made it clear that he believes we provide a service that is second to none in Afghanistan for those wounded in action. There is no evidence to suggest that anybody has lost their life, or has not been properly treated, because of a lack of helicopter support. Indeed, given the distances involved in Afghanistan, we now deploy consultant-led teams on helicopters to ensure that people have appropriate support when the helicopter reaches them.</p>

What opportunities have our service chiefs had to take up directly with the American strategists their concerns that pursuing a policy of poppy eradication is counter-productive and works against the principles of counter-insurgency, which must be to divide the insurgents from as much of the population as is humanly possible?</p>

It is much more complicated, and it does not serve either those who fly helicopters to support those on the ground or those who were undertaking that dangerous mission on the ground for it to be used in the way in which the hon.

The sight on our television screens of people being summarily executed&#151;being thrown from windows and buildings&#151;merely reinforces the reports that we have heard. They point to a coup d&#146;etat. It probably was planned, and some judge that Gaza is now an Islamic statelet that will be used as a safe zone from which to launch attacks elsewhere, if and when Hamas decides to do so. The situation is dangerous.</p>

The international community is looking into ways of ensuring that the money that was available under the temporary international mechanism gets into Gaza, but does not fall into the hands of Hamas. We are discussing with UNRWA&#151;the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East&#151;and all others involved how best to secure the welfare of the 1.5 million people who live in Gaza, most of whom had nothing to do with this coup d&#146;etat, which was performed by a political party that has its own agenda.</p>

 Three months ago, and after considerable effort, the Saudi Government managed to negotiate the national unity Government. Clearly, recent events tear that up. What can Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the other &#147;Arab Quartet&#148; nations, and other neighbouring countries, do to return to a position in which the Palestinians are united in one entity that, we hope, can then become a Palestinian state alongside Israel?</p>

 It is certainly important that the Arab League continues its work and that the Saudi and Egyptian authorities continue at every opportunity to try to influence events, and to influence reconciliation and discussion. They could have much more influence than us in this area. Therefore, I agree with my hon. Friend. The Egyptians, in particular, must be very worried about having a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood in control right on their border.</p>

 We all despair about the events in Gaza last week, which are merely the latest terrible twist in a depressing downward spiral in the occupied territories. We must be clear that the power struggle between Fatah and Hamas has been the cause of the bloodletting, but does the Minister accept that the desperate economic situation in the occupied territories, exacerbated by Israeli, American and European sanctions against the Palestinian Authority, is another of the root causes? Given that the formation of the national unity Government has resulted in little international return for Hamas or Fatah, does the Minister accept that the international community will have to find ways of ending the economic and political marginalisation of the political wing of Hamas if we are not simply to double the number of Palestinian problems and solve none?</p>

 One person has been caught up in this problem in Gaza for three months now: the British BBC correspondent, Alan Johnston.

 The hon. Gentleman is quite right to raise the issue of Alan Johnston. We have been trying hard to ensure that he is returned safely; indeed, we have been working with the Palestinian authorities and anyone else who will work with us to try to ensure his safe return. A disturbing report is just in regarding the Dagmoush clan, which these days calls itself something else. The Army of Islam is, I think, the latest term it is using, but basically it is guns for hire&#151;thugs who have a nice sideline in kidnapping. According to the report, Hamas has given the Dagmoush clan an ultimatum to release Alan Johnston by the end of the day, or Hamas will use force to ensure his release. Hamas has stated that it will not allow the kidnap to drag on any further. This situation has to be handled with great delicacy. Hamas knows very well that delicate negotiations have been going on, and we hope that it is not using this as a publicity stunt to try to win favour with some elements in the west.</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend that there was no justification for last week&#146;s events in Gaza. He says that he has seen no evidence of any change in Hamas&#146;s direction of travel, but has he seen the 10-point proposal from the national unity Government, including Hamas, that was published only two weeks ago, for a long-term ceasefire with Israel; and, if so, what is his response to it? He says that he wants the boycott to be lifted, and that it must be accompanied by an easing of checkpoints, and so on. I agree, but what will we do in practical terms at this week&#146;s EU summit to say to Israel that those elements are essential prerequisites to a lasting peace? Moreover, is there a role for saying to Israel that if it wishes to have trade preferences for its products, it is about time it started allowing Palestinians to trade out of their own territory, and that there could be consequences for the EU-Israel association agreement in that regard?</p>

 My hon. Friend has tremendous knowledge of the area, and he makes a fair point. We have to make Israel understand that it has to do what it can to relieve the humanitarian crisis on the west bank and in Gaza and that it needs to lift the blockades where it feels able to do so, because they are having a dreadful effect. I do not want to discuss boycotts or trade preferences at the moment, because we should be discussing the immediate crisis and how we can try to alleviate it.</p>

associated with those 10 points. Perhaps it felt that its credibility on the mythical Arab street was now under threat and it mounted the coup d&#146;etat to show that it was different from Fatah and that its heart was not in the rapprochement with Israel. I cannot give my hon. Friend a reason why Hamas decided to rat on those principles and start killing people in Gaza and taking military control.

 I am sure that many hon. Members on both sides of the House would agree that the rise of Hamas in recent years has been a consequence of the situation in the middle east rather than the cause of it. One of the things that has made the tension and stresses in the occupied Palestinian territories worse over the past couple of years has been the Israeli decision to withhold customs and tax revenues. That money must be released, for reasons of natural justice and because it is urgently needed, although there might be no mechanism for getting it to where it can do most good. Most of the people in most need of the money are in the Gaza strip, so will my hon.

Will the Minister tell us what more, if anything, can be done by the UK or the international community to bolster and help establish the authority of that new independent force? Perhaps that could be done through more aid, as aid already seems to have bolstered it.</p>

 The international community&#146;s expressions of support for President Abbas and his new Government have been great. The Hamas coup d&#146;&#233;tat has come as a shock to everyone, and they want to be sure that Hamas does not have the opportunity to try to repeat its military action in the west bank. I very much hope that everybody understands the need to get behind the Palestinian Authority and ensure that the new Government have the wherewithal to start giving people in the west bank some hope of a decent and viable future.</p>

 This whole incident of the past week has been one more disaster for the long-suffering Palestinian people. I hope that, at least in the west bank, they can now enjoy some amelioration in their position. Will the Minister find a way of getting two messages through to the Hamas regime in Gaza? One is that there is no substitute for accepting the Quartet&#146;s three conditions, because that essentially amounts to accepting reality. The second is that we simply cannot accept a situation in which it goes on spending enormous sums of money on arms while expecting the whole international community to provide its people with food and medical and other essential services.</p>

 Those are two very blunt messages, but I think that they are pertinent ones, and there will be no backing off on the Quartet&#146;s three principles by this Government. All too often, the huge amounts of aid money going into such areas somehow end up in the arms bazaar, and we have to make that point clear, too.</p>

 Does the Minister agree that although we hope and pray for the release of Alan Johnston, we do not forget that it is coming up to the anniversary of Corporal Shalit&#146;s being taken hostage? We do not forget other hostages who have been taken by Hezbollah, and we call for the release of all of them. Hamas should take note if it does not want everyone to believe what it has now made clear&#151;namely that it is, and always has been, a terrorist organisation, not a political party.</p>

 The United States is already the biggest funder of aid to the Palestinians. Perhaps it is not quite as big a funder as the combined EU, but it almost certainly provides the most aid of any individual state. Just a few nights ago, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary spoke to Secretary Rice and urged her to accept that the United States must now get behind President Abbas unequivocally and give him the support that he requires. I am confident that that has been taken very seriously, and it will be interesting to hear what the United States says during the Security Council debate on Wednesday.</p>

 Although the one glimmer of light in this dreadful situation is the opportunity to create a new relationship between the Palestinian Authority, Israel and the Quartet countries, the Minister is surely right to warn Fatah against a repetition of the corruption that did it so much damage in Gaza in the past. Will he take the chance, too, to warn it against other activities such as the ill-judged adventure just 10 days ago by its military wing, which sought to seize another Israeli soldier in Gaza, this time by using the mechanism of a vehicle that had been decorated with TV insignia&#151;an action condemned by the Palestinian journalists union? Will he tell Fatah that it is time for those adventures to come to an unequivocal end?</p>

That means that he must get hold of those factions within Fatah and ensure that they are not allowed to act in that renegade way, which risks, once again, escalating an already difficult situation.</p>

 I heard that statement, but I think that Jan Egeland talked very generally. The coup d&#146;&#233;tat, as I have called it, took everyone by surprise in its totality. Hamas has seized power, it has murdered its opponents in the most brutal fashion, and it has celebrated being entirely in control of Gaza. That is a traitorous act to the cause of the Palestinian people, and it will not benefit the notion of a viable Palestinian state. With hindsight, we can all say, &#147;Yes, there were signs thatit might happen, and there were elements and developments pointed in that direction.&#148; However, I doubt if anyone&#151;and the hon. Gentleman knows a great deal about the area and takes enormous interest in it&#151;really believed that there was going to be a coup d&#146;&#233;tat that was as total in its effect as the one that we have seen in the past few days.</p>

 Ona point of order, Mr. Speaker. I am grateful forthe opportunity to raise the fact that, on 6 June in the House, I asked my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House whether we could have a ministerial statement if the Government changed the rules for restraining young people in secure training centres. He was very helpful but, last week, the Government introduced a statutory instrument that proposed wide-ranging changes without making a statement. Is it sensible, Mr. Speaker, or in order for the Ministry of Justiceto make wide-ranging proposals that affect many individuals on the rules for restraining young people in secure training centres without making a statement when one was clearly requested in the House?</p>

for black and minority ethnic patients, child patients and patients with learning disabilities. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) spoke in Committee of the great benefit of specialist advocacy for patients for whom English is not their first language. The need for specialist advocacy is the reason that we have included a regulation-making power that will allow us to make different provisions for cases when it comes to the training requirements for advocates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70618-0006.htm_para11"><a name="0706182000226">As was pointed out in Committee, patients must know that they have a right to advocacy.

Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning)&#151;Government amendments Nos. 52 and 61 amend the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and give the person deprived of liberty or their representative the statutory right of access to an independent mental capacity advocate to explain to them the authorisation for the deprivation of liberty and to provide support with a review or with an application to the Court of Protection. Again, these Government amendments, which reflect representations made to us, also ensure that both the person and their representative are told about the IMCA service.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to raise that important issue. We believe that there is scope for advocates, if they wish, to receive training in both areas. Naturally, some people will perhaps wish to specialise. He is probably aware that the pilot training for IMCAs is already under way, but there would not necessarily be any problem with people being able to specialise in both areas.</p>

 I apologise for coming late to the subject. I was not a member of the Public Bill Committee, so this matter may have been discussed already, but will the advocates be funded from the Minister&#146;s budget or from the Ministry of Justice&#146;s budget, or will they be paid for by the people for whom they will provide representation?

 I can assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that they certainly will not be paid for merely by the people who need to use them. They will be paid for by the supervisory body&#151;whether that is the local authority or health authority will depend on the IMCAs and, in a sense, those for whom they are to be used.

advocacy service. One of the things that it welcomed was this provision and this change on the part of the Government. In particular, it has written to say that it is an important change, which it welcomes, but that it is having difficulty in getting the local trust and the local authority to fund its community advocacy service. Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is important that the voluntary sector is approached in providing such services, as it gives confidence to many users of mental health services that advocacy is independent and works in their best interests?</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. During debates on the Mental Capacity Bill, we were able to give assurances that we saw an important role for the voluntary sector in such instances because that sector often has such expertise. One thing that we hoped would flow from our taking statutory powers in this sense would be the ability to ensure that a number of voluntary organisations would have access to some of those streams of funding, particularly because such organisations are often seen as independent and as having quite a lot of expertise already. There is no point in reinventing the wheel in some of these cases, but we need to ensure that the organisations have proper training.

It is right to say that we should think about ensuring that privacy is provided wherever possible. Perhaps we could take the subject away and consider it in respect of such issues as the code of practice in both instances, as well as the importance of training in that area.</p>

 That is something that the hon. Gentleman will need to take up with the National Assembly for Wales. Obviously, some of those matters will be devolved. The Bill enables powers to be taken, but some of the implementation, particularly with regard to specialist advocacy, may well be covered by the Assembly.</p>

Government new clause 5 and Government amendments Nos. 62 to 64 and 68 would limit the exceptions under section 40. Where someone has been appointed for matters related to property and affairs, the appointment will no longer preclude an IMCA from being instructed for health and social care matters.</p>

I completely understand her concerns, but we need to target resources at the most vulnerable. We do not agree that it is necessarily either appropriate or workable to provide advocates to people who have not yet become subject to an application for detention, or who are not being treated under the Mental Health Act 1983, except in the specific and limited circumstances that we have set out. We must prioritise, and we believe that we have identified the priority group.</p>

The aim of new clause 17 and amendments Nos. 104 and 105, tabled by my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="70618-0007.htm_para0"><a name="07061815000008">In some of the earlier discussions on this Bill,and on previous Bills, we talked about nominated representatives, but carers groups expressed concerns particularly about the displacement of a nearest relative, which could have an effect on carers that many of us know all too well. When a person becomes extremely ill and feels that the nearest relative has the power to block detention or to discharge, it becomes too easy for that person to think that that is precisely what they should be doing. That can put many people in a difficult position. We need to realise that this is a sensitive issue.</p>

 I hope that the Minister realises that the issue is also very sensitive in the other direction. Many &#147;revolving-door&#148; patients of mental health institutions&#151;that is not a very nice term, but it is one that we grew used to in Committee&#151;sometimes feel that they want to change their nearest relative without having to go to the court and give lengthy and complex arguments why they should be able to do so. I hope that the Minister understands that, too.</p>

 Of course I understand that, and I know that my hon. Friend is concerned about this particular issue. As I said, I examined it very closely and asked my officials to see whether there was a way of trying to accommodate that development. Let me set out some of the reasons why we decided that there was a real difficulty with such a provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="70618-0007.htm_para1"><a name="07061815000011">If we allowed an automatic right to appoint the nearest relative in advance, to comply with the European convention on human rights it would be necessary to set up a system by which nominations could be ratified by an independent process with a suitable mechanism for appealing decisions. There is no existing body that could do that; we would have to set up a new body, whereas at the moment we take such issues to the county courts. We would still need a process by which to make that happen. For example, we would need to be able to allow a nearest relative who was being displaced to appeal if they felt that it was the wrong approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="70618-0007.htm_para2"><a name="07061815000012">I understand the argument that it would be possible for someone to nominate a person in advance when they were not subject to the legislation&#151;that is, when they were not in a detained situation&#151;in anticipation of being detained, but for ECHR compliance it would be difficult to have one system for people who were not detained and a completely different system, under which people had no access to that right, when they were being detained. Restricting the provisions to carers alone would also have particular problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="70618-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07061815000013">Amendment No. 105 would add another ground on which applications could be made to displace the nearest relative&#151;</p>

provision would cover situations where patients have no real relationship with their nearest relative. Although it is important that the courts look at each case on its merits, we intend the idea of unsuitability to cover situations where there is no effective relationship between the patient and their nearest relative, or where the relationship has broken down irretrievably.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="70618-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07061815000015">Given the other changes that we are making, we believe that our proposals cover some of the problems highlighted by my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="70618-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07061815000018">The changes we are making to the Bill give patients a new right to apply to the court for displacement. They will then be free to nominate anyone they want as their replacement nearest relative. As long as the court finds that person suitable and they are willing to act, they will be appointed. As well as that new right, we have provided that the involvement of carers and others with the patient must be addressed as part of the fundamental principles. That meets the fear that people might be excluded. Based on the principles, the code will make it absolutely clear that the nearest relative is not meant to replace the patient&#146;s next of kin, so their appointment does not prevent other people nominated by the patient from being contacted or appropriately involved in decisions about care and treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="70618-0007.htm_para7"><a name="07061815000019">The Mental Health Act 1983 provides that hospital managers have a duty to advise patients of their rights, including providing all patients with information about how to apply to the county court. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak, and some members of the Committee, were concerned that people would have to go through a cumbersome process, so we shall ensure that patients are advised of their rights and training is given to ensure that those who inform and advise patients understand the new rights properly. In our meetings with the new mental health coalition, concerns were raised about the provisions, so we have looked at matters closely and considered production of a user-friendly guide to applying to the county court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="70618-0007.htm_para8"><a name="07061815000020">New clause 15 relates to the three-month rule under section 58 of the Mental Health Act 1983, and would reduce to two months the period after which the section applies. The section requires that if a patient refuses consent, or cannot give consent, a SOAD&#151;second opinion appointed doctor&#151;should certify that the treatment is appropriate and should be given. My noble friend Lord Hunt said in the other place, and I reiterated in Committee, that we continue to believe that the three-month period remains appropriate. The 1983 Act contains a power, in section 58(2), to reduce the period by order, so we can already go forward on that basis. However, we feel it would be more appropriate to do so after consultation, so that we can proceed based on evidence, and at a manageable and sustainable pace. At this stage, we do not think it right  <br>

 To pre-empt the new clause that I shall propose in a minute, may I ask the Minister: has not the power to vary the term been in the Act since 1983?

 There is no evidence to support the proposition that the period is too long. Of course, I am aware of comments made by the Mental Health Act Commission and the Joint Committee on Human Rights, but those opinions do not constitute evidence that three months is not the most appropriate period for the SOAD to assess a patient&#146;s medication for the first time and, with the approved clinician in charge of treatment, to identify whether changes should be made to the ongoing treatment plan. As I said in Committee, the High Court has recently refused leave for a judicial review of the compatibility of the three-month period with the European convention on human rights, so it is not outside the ECHR. We do not believe that there is evidence for changing the period, and that is why we do not accept the need to do so.</p>

That was very much welcomed by the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee, which raised practical questions with the Minister about it.

to make patients aware of that right, which the Minister has touched on; and to ensure, as my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) pointed out, that patients have a right to meet their advocate in private. Those are fundamental human rights that should be made available as part of the service.</p>

That service should be provided, particularly for the most vulnerable patients, and prioritised at the point of crisis. The issue of the availability of culturally competent advocacy has also been raised.

It also touches on how the advocates should be overseen and quality-controlled. Again, the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee suggested that the Mental Health Act Commission should be engaged to set the standard for the advocates. If we are to have advocates, we need to ensure that they know what they are doing, and are of a sufficient standard to do what can be a technical job dealing with technical parts of the law, as all of us who have been involved with the Bill for some years, and on the Committee for the past few weeks, know.</p>

we raised the subject in Committee. This is important because it is all about respecting the wishes of vulnerable patients and considering the effect of treatment on them, giving them an opportunity to engage in their treatment, and ensuring that there are thorough checks and balances so that people with serious medical conditions get the right medical treatment. Given the serious effects of medication and the possibility of patients being given too high a dose without their consent, even despite their active opposition to medication, we must ensure that we getit right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="70618-0007.htm_para19"><a name="07061815000042">As the Minister said, the new clause would amend section 58 of the Mental Health Act 1983 by reducing from three months to two the time before a second medical opinion is required for medication. The Joint Committee on Human Rights&#151;its Chairman is not in the Chamber, but I am sure that he will be joiningour deliberations because he has tabled later amendments&#151;proposed that the time should be reduced from three months to one. We are proposing a compromise, as we did in Committee, to reduce it from three months to two months in stages. The Joint Committee had serious concerns, which again the Minister has not allayed.</p>

We are talking about powerful chemical cocktails. They have the capacity to bring about serious side effects, such as obesity, diabetes, impotence and movement disorders. It is essential that we take the patient&#146;s feelings into account and ensure that we have good practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="70618-0007.htm_para21"><a name="07061815000044">We also made the case in Committee that patients in that condition should be subject to more regular physical health checks for their own benefit, simply because of the physical effects that many of the powerful drugs have on them. We are joined in that request by the Mental Health Act Commission, which has raised on several occasions, and in at least two of its reports, its concerns about how the period of three months works in practice. In its last biennial report, for 2003-05, it said:</p>
<a name="70618-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="07061815000162"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Too many patients feel that they are excluded from decision making and the exercise of choice in their hospital treatment and unable to discuss their subjective experiences of therapeutic effect or adverse side-effects. This is likely to exacerbate the likelihood of non-compliance after discharge and may contribute to the problems of revolving-door readmissions&#148;.</p>

This is nothing to do with cost-effectiveness, or with our practical complaints that people were not available to man the tribunals. The principle was that the conditions should be examined after 28 days. Our complaint was that the mechanics would not be practicable. If the principle was right then, why are the Government reverting to a three-month period? That is the question that the Minister has not answered.</p>

We have been given permission to quote from it. Mr. Kinton conducted a survey of the 14,574 patients detained at 31 March 2006, just over a year ago. He was able to examine just over 81 per cent. of them in detail. Working on the Government&#146;s figures, he established that if the three-month rule had been a two-month rule, 3,598 patients, or 30.5 per cent. of the total number admitted to hospital under Mental Health Act powers, could have received a second opinion.

She gave an assurance in Committee that she would bring this matter back to the House and she has done so; that is welcome. I said in Committee that it was untenable for us not to have a system of advocacy for mental health patients when we have now accepted advocacy for mental capacity cases. The wording of the new clause closely follows the wording on advocates in the Mental Capacity Act 2005, which shows that synergy. My earlier intervention on the Minister was intended to be helpful. I said that there might be common standards, training and systems of maintaining advocates in order to keep the costs of both systems at a reasonable level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="70618-0008.htm_para5"><a name="07061815000057">Advocacy is to be welcomed because patients can find it disempowering enough to have to face the panoply of the mental health system when in need of help, but when faced with professionals such as a consultant psychiatrist or a range of people with other mental health expertise&#151;perhaps social workers, too&#151;it can also seem that the balance of power is wrong. The beauty of the advocacy system is that it enables someone to stand shoulder to shoulder with the patient in putting their case. It can enable the patients themselves to say exactly what they want, and if they are unable to do so it enables the advocate to speak up on their behalf and to make sure that their voice is heard in deliberations and planning.</p>

 I agree, but as we found in debating and amending Acts such as the original 1983 Act, legal issues can be difficult and complex. The advocates we are talking about are citizens&#146; advocates rather than lawyers, who are advocates who understand the law. Sometimes, an important part of an advocate&#146;s role is to make sure that the legal interests of a patient are presented and studied by an independent lawyer.</p>

 Indeed, and as I explained on Second Reading, a hospital in my constituency specialises in eating disorder cases, and some of the children who attend it are extremely young.

There is one issue that I would like to bring to the head of my wish list: I want the Minister at least to look again at the definition of a carer. At the moment, we are reliant on the 1983 Act, which says that a carer is somebody who has been caring for five years, which then gets them on to the nearest relative list. If they are living with the patient at the time that such services are required, they can go to the top of that list. However, the position of carers has moved on a long way since 1983. Since then, there has been a Labour Government&#151;since 1997&#151;and we have the country&#146;s first ever national strategy for carers andthe first dedicated funding for carers, rather thanfor the people whom they care for. We have also established for the first time an entitlement for a carer to have an assessment of their needs, rather than of the person whom they care for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="70618-0008.htm_para11"><a name="07061815000067">So the definition of a carer today is very different from simply being someone who has lived with a person for five years. Of course, many carers do not live with the person whom they care for, even though they are their full-time carer, so I would argue that we still need to look at the definition of carer. I understand why my right hon. Friend the Minister is not attracted to new clause 17, but it does at least bring up to date the definition of a carer, in line with the legislation introduced in 2000, which is the latest to deal with carers.</p>

Here, I should declare another interest as a non-practising solicitor. If the person in question could nominate from a closed list, rather than an open one, would that get round the problems associated with the European convention on human rights that my right hon. Friend mentioned? If the closed list could simply be the nearest relative list with an updated definition of a carer included, could not the person in question&#151;when they are not subject to the powers under the 1983 Act&#151;at least nominate somebody from that list in order to bring them to the top of it, rather than somebody who is completely outside that list?

 It would be churlish of me not to welcome the Government new clauses and amendments. As the Minister suspected, amendments (a) to (c) to new clause 3 are an attempt to see whether she can be pushed just a little further. I take on board the points made about resources. Indeed, a briefing from the NHS Confederation, which most Members present today will have received, raises concerns about the resourcing of this service, and points out that patients have to know about its availability. So I take on board the point that we should see how things progress and then potentially go further.</p>

I am sure that the Minister is aware that a disproportionate number of black and minority ethnic people are sectioned. It is a particular problem for the Afro-Caribbean community, which experiences more instances of over-medication, misdiagnosis and control and restraint. They are more likely to be detained as long-term patients, which increases the need for access to advocates before sectioning. That is the driver behind amendments (a) and (c).</p>

people, resulting in the death of several Afro-Caribbean service users under the care of the mental health system. The most famous case is that of David &#147;Rocky&#148; Bennett, which was the subject of an independent inquiry by Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire health authority. The inquiry&#146;s report made 22 recommendations. The key underpinning theme of those recommendations was that there should be ministerial acknowledgement of the presence of institutional racism in the mental health services and a commitment to eliminate it. It is never pleasant to have to admit something like that, but the figures speak for themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="70618-0008.htm_para16"><a name="07061815000073">A study has also found that there are circles of fear that stop black people from engaging with services. They do not access help early because they are concerned about what will happen to them. The study found that Afro-Caribbeans were often not treated with respect and the services were not accessible, welcoming, relevant or well integrated with the community. The way in which Afro-Caribbean people enter mental health services is problematic and influences the nature and outcomes of treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="70618-0008.htm_para17"><a name="07061815000074">Most importantly, different models of description of mental illness and other people&#146;s philosophies or world views are not understood or even acknowledged. That is a double-edged sword, because the flipside is that the concept of culture has been used to attempt to address some of those issues, but it can also divert professionals from looking at the patient as an individual, with their own characteristics, history and needs. Assumptions can be made on the basis of race, and that is wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="70618-0008.htm_para18"><a name="07061815000075">Those and other findings were supported by the &#147;Inside Outside&#148; report and the &#147;Breaking the Circles of Fear&#148; report. A recent Mental Health Act Commission census also backed them up. The amendments attempt to address some of the problems, because if advocacy is available at the beginning of the process, an appropriate advocate could be found who could ensure fairer treatment.</p>

The numbers are not high, yet we should provide an extra safeguard for those children. It must be terrifying for a child to be admitted to an in-patient unit, especially, as is frequently the case, if their relationship with their parents has broken down.

 Like everyone who has spoken, I warmly welcome the Government new clauses and amendments and the increased safeguards for vulnerable people that will be introduced through the arrangements for advocacy. The new clause and amendments that I have tabled would improve the arrangements by which the nearest relative could be displaced, if necessary. The Bill contains a measure that allows for that, but it is problematic because it requires a patient to go to court and due to the grounds set out on which a nearest relative may be displaced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="70618-0008.htm_para23"><a name="07061815000083">New clause 17 is based on an amendment tabled in Committee by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney). It would avoid court proceedings by allowing a patient to give an advance directive of the name of the nearest relative. As my right hon. Friend the Minister said, the appointment of the nearest relative is extremely important. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford pointed out in Committee, there is all too often no nearest relative who is willing to perform that role. If someone suitable is available, it is thus important that it is as easy as possible for a patient to appoint that person as the nearest relative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="70618-0008.htm_para24"><a name="07061815000084">My new clause differs somewhat from the original measure tabled by my hon. Friend because I have attempted to address several concerns expressed by the Government. I realise that it would not be appropriate to allow frivolous changes or appointments of the nearest relative, so my amendment would confine the appointment or changed appointment as the nearest relative to the carer.

I am disappointed that the Government cannot find a way to make provision that enables the nearest relative to be changed without going to court, although I am pleased by the Minister&#146;s assurance that she intends to make the system as user friendly as possible. Of course, it is not necessary for the patient to take the action themselves; they can be supported in doing so, or the process can be carried out on their behalf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="70618-0008.htm_para26"><a name="07061815000086">Amendments Nos. 104 and 105 are designed to make it possible to seek displacement on broader grounds than the Bill allows. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has criticised the provisions of the Bill and the associated code of practice, saying that they are too narrow to enable the nearest relative to be displaced unless there is some undercurrent of abuse. That important point must be addressed, and I am grateful that the Minister is willing to consider the code of practice and to discuss further whether those concerns can be properly dealt with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="70618-0008.htm_para27"><a name="07061815000087">As the relative of someone who has been very ill and undergone the process of sectioning, I am well aware of the concern of nearest relatives that they should not easily be set aside. I know that, at times of crisis, patients can turn against family members&#151;the people who are most concerned about them. I therefore understand the Government&#146;s concerns, but I hope that they will do all they can to address the worry that lies behind new clause 17 and amendments Nos. 104and 105.</p>

At such points, it is important that they have access to advocacy.</p>

 I appreciate that, but I felt that the Minister was praying in aid the code of practice in her response to me, and I just wanted some clarification on that issue. Finally, I want to pick up on a point made by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones): when we consider the nearest relative and carer, we should remember that they are often one and the same person, and that is quite a difficult situation, not least in the situation that she identified. Sometimes, if the patient lives with their nearest relative, or their nearest relative is also their primary carer, a situation develops in which that relative becomes personally involved in assisting the medical profession to section someone close to them. That can trigger a reaction on the part of the patient. I hope that the Minister will consider those situations and willbe flexible enough to identify them on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="70618-0009.htm_para1"><a name="07061815000096">However, the Minister faces a dilemma, because it is not an easy issue to resolve. In the Bournewood case, the nearest relative of HL&#151;an autistic adult who was detained&#151;did not have day-to-day knowledge of HL&#146;s condition. It was actually the paid professional carer who had that knowledge, and it would have been much more helpful if the carer had been involved at a much earlier stage. I appreciate that it is a difficult point for the Minister, but I hope that the system will be robust, yet flexible enough to allow difficult circumstances to be built into the changes that she is introducing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="70618-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07061815000100">I cannot end without touching on the issue of resources, because under the Mental Capacity Act 2005, the whole of Hackney&#151;not just my constituency, but that of my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), too&#151;received &#163;40,000 for support for those who are unbefriended. I hope that in our debates on that subject we realistically consider the issue of resources. It is worth reminding Members that 12 of the top 20 users of accident and emergency services at my local hospital, Homerton University hospital, were known to mental health trusts; they were the most frequent users of those accident and emergency services, so the advocacy issues are important for a number of reasons. I have highlighted some of the issues that I have already discussed in Committee, so I will not detain the House any further.</p>

 I, too, welcome the proposals on advocacy, but I am concerned to ensure that advocacy services in Wales are widely available in both Welsh and English. The reason why I intervened on the Minister earlier and asked whether advocates would be assumed to be working for a public authority is that public bodies in Wales are subject to the Welsh Language Act 1993, and must produce language schemes. That might ensure that help was available in Welsh or English, as required. My second point is that if advocates are employed by a public authority, the system shouldbe set up on an entirely bilingual basis. I refer the Minister to the way in which the post of Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales was set up by Peter Clarke. That started out properly on a bilingual footing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="70618-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07061815000102">I refer the Minister to the recent speculation in Wales that the new Welsh Assembly Government might seek a legislative competency in mental health. One of the reasons for that would be to ensure that the service was available in Welsh. Commenting on that, the First Minister, Rhodri Morgan, said that although he was sympathetic to the proposal, he was concerned about whether undevolved aspects of legislation could be disentangled. Some subjects are properly the concern of Parliament, but some are properly the concern of the Assembly. That may be resolved by new clause 3(2), which states:</p>
<a name="70618-0009.htm_brev1"><a name="07061815000168"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The appropriate national authority shall make such arrangements as it considers reasonable&#148;</p>

Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) made about privacy, proposed new section 130B already includes provisions for an advocate to meet the patient in private, and I assure the hon. Lady that we will expand on that in the code of practice. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) for his comments, as I know that he is concerned about the issue, particularly the question of advocacy and the nearest relative. I can assure him that proper information about rights will be made available. We always keep those issues under consideration. As for the position of the nearest relative, anyone living with the patient for five years will be placed on the list, as he knows, and anyone living with, or caring for, a patient will be moved to the top of the list. We have therefore tried to make sure that carers are properly defined and treated in the same way that they are treated under other legislation.</p>

As I have set out, we have taken a series of actions under &#147;Delivering race equality in mental health care&#148; but, as I tried to stress at the outset, we are considering specialist advocacy for people from BME communities. I reiterate that it is important to confine advocacy to the groups that have been set out. I very much welcome the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones) about the fact that we need to make sure that, when we look at the issue of the nearest relative, we involve the relevant people to ensure that the code of practice is right. I thank her for her understanding of the issues that we have tried to tackle. As I have said, I wanted to see whether there was anything further that we can do, but I am convinced that with the exception of the question of looking at the code of practice and so on&#151;I will keep in touch with her on that&#151;we have found the right way forward. I will write to the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams) about the issue of the Welsh language. As I have said before, essentially, this is a question about devolving the issue to the Welsh Assembly. As he said, it is about the Welsh language, too, but I will make sure that Ministers in Wales are aware of his comments.</p>

Of course I will look at the evidence from MHAC, but we would have to be clear that the proposal was properly evidence based. For that reason I ask the House not to support the new clause if the hon.

other place and in Committee. ECT is an invasive procedure and some patients are fearful of it. Although it is an established psychiatric treatment, it is a controversial one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="70618-0009.htm_para12"><a name="07061815000115">We have already introduced amendments in the other place under which the refusal of a detained patient, with capacity to consent, to consent to ECT should be respected, except in an emergency. Following further debate in which other concerns were raised,the amendments before us provide even stronger safeguards in the very rare circumstances where young persons are treated with ECT. In Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) was particularly concerned about the provisions for giving ECT in emergencies. I hope he welcomes the changes that we have made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="70618-0009.htm_para13"><a name="07061815000116">The amendments also clarify the position for community patients. Government amendment No. 12 ensures that, for patients under 18 who agree to treatment with ECT, a second opinion appointed doctor must first certify that it is appropriate for the ECT to be given. Even where a young patient consents to treatment, we want a second opinion. We have also considered the needs of patients under 18 who arenot detained under the legislation or subject to a community treatment order. Government amendments Nos. 16, 21, 25 and 27 require that, where such patients can lawfully be treated with ECT or any other treatment made subject to section 58A, a second opinion appointed doctor must certify that it is appropriate. This is an important new safeguard for voluntary patients under 18.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="70618-0009.htm_para14"><a name="07061815000117">The Mental Health Act 1983 provides for a limited number of circumstances where the patient can be urgently treated without the need for a statutory second opinion. We have reconsidered those circumstances in the light of requests to do so in the other place and in Committee. As a result, we have concluded that ECT may be given as an urgent treatment in only two circumstances: where it is immediately necessary to save the patient&#146;s life, or to prevent a serious deterioration in the patient&#146;s condition. Amendment No. 19 achieves that, and we have made similar amendments&#151;amendments Nos. 36, 37, 41 and 42&#151;to the urgent procedures for community patients. Obviously, ECT is rarely administered to patients who are not hospital in-patients. The Bill does not afford community patients the same safeguards, and to rectify that we have tabled amendments Nos. 29 to 34, 39, 43 and 46.</p>

Amendment No. 28 makes it clear that the certificates for adult community patients and child community patients apply when a patient is recalled to hospital, or when their community treatment order is revoked.

 We discovered in Committee that two Committee members had helped to administer this treatment at one time or another. We all understand that ECT is highly invasive, involves sedation, inflicts fits, leads to amnesia and can involve physical restraint, the removal of false teeth and so on. Like acupuncture, it is a treatment that is hard to explain. In a letter, the Minister explained that it is used in a rather strange diversity of cases. For under-18s, it has been used for anorexia, depression, bipolar disease, schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder. It works in some of those cases, albeit temporarily, and although it is addictive its long-term effects do not seem to be conclusively bad. As it is so invasive, it needs to be used with exceptional care. Some consultantswill not use it at all, and for others it is a last resort.Its appropriate use therefore needs to be heavily circumscribed for all, not only for under-18s.</p>

 The Minister is correct to predict that Members on both sides of the House are likely to support the amendments, although that is no surprise given that the Bill has been 10 years in gestation. Throughout that time concerns about ECT have been raised, not only in pre-legislative scrutiny, but in the other place and in amendments tabled in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="70618-0009.htm_para19"><a name="07061815000124">The Minister correctly said that ECT is a controversial and quite invasive procedure. In Committee, I probed her about cases involving those under 18. On 12 June, she kindly wrote to me with a sample of the number of people under 18 who were subject to the procedure during a three-month period in 2002. She said that only four people under 18 had been administered ECT, and that none of those was under 16. Perhaps she could look again at those figures, because I note that the Mental Health Alliance briefing contradicts her letter and says that one individual under 16 was included. I am concerned about those under 18 because in the early adolescent periods the brain develops in ways that we do not understand. We are forcing a treatment that we do not fully understand on the bodies of young, vulnerable individuals at a time when the other major organs of the body are still developing. A number of people die following ECT, and I am concerned about those under 16, whose organs are still developing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="70618-0009.htm_para20"><a name="07061815000125">I welcome the amendments, particularly those introducing the requirement for SOADs and extending safeguards to those under 18 who admit themselves voluntarily. I have a question for the Minister about when parents do not agree on what should happen to their child. If they do not feel able to respond by going ahead with ECT, they can go to the High Court; but what happens if the parents are in dispute? Would the case go automatically to the High Court?</p>

the rights of victims in such tragic circumstances. Ialso pay tribute to the work of my hon. Friends the Members for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart), who has been very involved in the issue, and for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon), who raised it in Committee. I am glad to say that I think that the provisions will have cross-party support, showing the importance that Parliament attaches to treating victims with respect and dignity. Those issues were debated in Committee and the other place, and we introduced amending provisions in response to those debates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07061815000139">The amending provisions relate to persons with a mental disorder who have been convicted of a criminal offence of a sexual or violent nature, but who are not made subject to restrictions. Unlike the victims of offenders given restricted orders, these victims are not told when the offender is discharged from detention in hospital. In responding to the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee report on the 2004 draft Bill, we saidthat we would consider how victims&#146; rights might be extended to cover victims of serious offences whereno restrictions had been imposed. The amending provisions also help to deliver that commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07061815000140">The Government believe that the key ways of helping victims of crime are through support services, allowing victims&#146; voices to be heard in court and providing information, which can take several forms. For example, there is information on where to seek help and advice; on the progress of a case from the point of report through to the end of the criminal case; andon when the offender is released. Much of that was included in the code of practice for victims of crime, which set out for the first time the obligations of the criminal justice system towards victims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07061815000141">It is also important to recognise that we looked into how to extend victims&#146; rights further. We shall table amendments that reflect discussions on the importance of information about what has happened to restricted patients, but we are also extending provisions to include circumstances where patients are not restricted. Many victims&#146; organisations have stressed to us the importance of sharing information between agencies, and we must recognise that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07061815000142">The draft illustrative code of practice, at chapter 34A, deals with public bodies&#146; sharing of information in order to address risk. It is important to acknowledge that some considerations need to be taken into account where confidentiality is crucial, and patients are entitled to know that their rights will be respected to that extent, but it is also important to recognise that many victims&#146; organisations made it very clear to us that information about risk should be shared between different agencies&#151;even when the information is about someone detained under the Mental Health Act. We will consult further on the draft code of practice and information sharing so that we can consider bolstering our guidance. As I said, patients have a right to confidentiality, but the public have a right to know that systems and services are in place to support people with a mental disorder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07061815000144">Under that Act, victims are entitled to receive information where the following apply: first, where a person is convicted of a violent or sexual offence; secondly, when he receives a hospital order or a hospital direction, or is transferred from prison to hospital under a transfer direction; and, thirdly, where he is made subject to special restrictions, respectively a restriction order, a limitation direction or a restriction direction. If those circumstances apply, the victim has the right to elect to receive information about the patient&#146;s discharge from hospital; to make representations about whether the patient should be subject to any conditions in the event of his discharge; and to receive information about the discharge and any conditions imposed for the victim&#146;s protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07061815000145">The amending provisions extend those very important rights to victims of mentally disordered offenders who are convicted of violent or sexual offences, but not made subject to special restrictions. The process will be similar to the current one for offenders who receive restricted hospital orders. The local probation board must take reasonable steps to establish whether a victim wishes to make representations about whether the patient should be subject to any conditions in the event of his discharge from hospital. It must also establish whether the victim wishes to receive information about any conditions to which the patient is subject in the event of his discharge from hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07061815000146">Where the victim so wishes, the probation board must notify the relevant hospital managers of the victim&#146;s wish and their name and address, so that they may be contacted. Should the victim wish to rescind their request for information or notify the board of any change in their contact details, the board must notify him of the contact details for the hospital manager. A victim who initially declines to make representations or receive information, but changes their mind, may contact the local probation board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07061815000147">To facilitate the making of representations, the responsible clinician is required to inform hospital managers whether he is considering discharging a patient, making a community treatment order or varying the conditions of an order. There is a duty to inform hospital managers when any other person is considering discharging the patient under section 23(3), and when an application is made to the mental health review tribunal. On receipt of such information, hospital managers must notify the victim that discharge is being considered, giving the victim the opportunity to make representations if they wish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para15"><a name="07061815000148">Hospital managers must forward representations to those who have the power to consider the patient&#146;s discharge from detention, or discharge on a community treatment order. The responsible clinician must inform hospital managers whether a patient is to be discharged or a community treatment order is to be made.

The clinician must also notify them of whether any conditions relating to the victim or their family are to be altered or added. Finally, he must notify them if a  <br>

community treatment order is to cease to be in force, and the date on which it is to cease, and if the conditions for a patient&#146;s authority for detention are no longer met.</p>

When hospital managers receive this information, they must take all reasonable steps to pass it to the victim. They may also provide such other information as they consider appropriate. The same notification requirements will apply when a victim has elected to make representations, or to receive information about a person subject to a hospital order with restrictions, and the restriction order is lifted while the hospital order remains in force. Those rights will also apply to the victims of persons made subject to a hospital and limitation direction where the direction ceases to have effect, and in cases where convicted persons are transferred to hospital under a transfer direction without a restriction direction, or where the restriction direction is removed.</p>

 The term &#147;public health&#148; might have a different connotation, too, and could be slightly confusing. It is important to recognise that we can talk about public protection in relation to such cases and we should not be embarrassed to do so. Victims, and those who have suffered in some tragic cases, expect us not to be mealy-mouthed, which is why the proposals are important.

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para19"><a name="07061815000155">We hear much about some of the horrendous cases, but they need to be put into perspective, as I am sure the Minister agrees. We need balance, but we need to make sure that the victims of those crimes are properly respected and that the horrendous blow they have suffered is dealt with as sensitively as possible and the situation is not exacerbated in the future. They have to go on living with the injuries&#151;or, in extreme cases, the fatalities&#151;that may have occurred. We need to think about victims, and the proposals are a good, if belated, way of adding the same safeguards as those in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act and for other victims of crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para20"><a name="07061815000156">The biggest tribute we can pay to victims and, we hope, to avoid there being more of them in future, is to make sure we do everything possible to stop perpetrators before they commit such ghastly acts. That is what the Bill and mental health services are all about&#151;making sure that people who are a danger to themselves and others are picked up at an early stage and given the treatment they need and deserve for their medical condition. We need to get that balance right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07061815000157">Such crimes have an impact on families, too. I have spoken to the victims of patients and of others suffering from mental illness. For innocent families who have had no connection with the mental health services, it can be hard to come to terms with sucha most shocking blow. In extreme circumstances, professional staff and others working in mental health services can also be the victims of patients when their condition gets out of control. We need to think about those sets of victims and their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para22"><a name="07061815000158">As the Minister said, we have a duty to offer victims support services. Some of the organisations in my constituency do an excellent job in that regard and we should give them every support to do more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para23"><a name="07061815000159">Victims need a voice in court. I agree with the Minister: too often, that is an unheard and forgotten part of the equation. Most importantly, victims need information about the progress of the case, and the whereabouts of the perpetrator and their likely release date&#151;in a safe situation, we hope, so that they donot commit other atrocities in the future. Sharing information between agencies is absolutely essential, so I hope that in drawing up powers on victims&#146; rights, the Minister is equally mindful of the structures necessary to implement them. There should be constant monitoring to ensure that information is shared. Victims need to know when offenders are released so that they can take due care for their security and peace of mind if there is an outstanding problem. They have suffered one tragic blow; it would be unreasonable to expect them to suffer a second by not giving them the information that a perpetrator may be at large&#151;albeit, we hope, after appropriate treatment, so that their condition does not recur.</p>

They talked to me of their ongoing distress about not knowing what had happened to the perpetrator of an incident involving their family. New clause 7 will alleviate their concerns and recognise their desire to have their voices heard and their continuing need for information.</p>

We need to remember that victims can be left with trauma and distress and that they sometimes have ongoing mental issues that may not warrant hospital admission but are none the less distressing and painful. There may be constant concern that a decision could be made to allow the perpetrator back into the community where there is a chance that the victim might have to meet them again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para27"><a name="07061835000039">I am particularly glad that victims have a choice. Not everyone will want to know what is happening, but the most important thing about the new clause is that it allows the victim the choice to know or not to know, depending on where they are and how they feel at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para28"><a name="07061835000040">I am pleased that professionals will have a responsibility to trace the victim and check whether their view has changed. There will not be a once and for all situation: victims will have the possibility of changing their mind about whether to be given information. That is welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para29"><a name="07061835000041">We must realise that it is not only people who are strangers to the patient and their families who are at risk, because professionals can be victims, too. That recognition is important and it is provided by the new clause.</p>

<p><a name="st_o202"><a name="07061835000042"><a name="70618-0010.htm_spnew8"><a name="07061835000950"><b>Dr. Pugh:</b>
 I join in the praise for the Zito Trust and all the campaigning organisations that will have helped put this provision into statute. We all feel the plight of those people who have been let down as much by services as by legislation. It is probably worth emphasising that such sad events are no more common now than hitherto, which is surprising in some ways, given the dispersal from the old hospitals, although perhaps we might have expected that with modern medicine they would be lower still.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para30"><a name="07061835000043">As I understand it, a victim has rights if they are threatened by a non-mentally ill released prisoner or a mentally ill person convicted of an offence, but not if the mentally ill person is unfit to plead, is not convicted, or is detained and then released. Additional rights are not usually necessary, because the patient may be cured and come out with no intent of doing any malicious act, but occasionally it is a wise precaution to know and to tell, and to allow access to information, especially if the patient&#146;s mental disturbance is focused on an individual or a family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="70618-0010.htm_para31"><a name="07061835000044">I accept that the matter is complex, but it is well worth the Minister and the Government pursuing the matter in legislation, and we welcome the change.</p>

<p><a name="70618-0011.htm_amdt0">&#145;(1) The 1983 Act is amended as follows.</p>

<p><a name="70618-0011.htm_amdt1">(2) In section 47 (Removal to hospital of persons serving sentences of imprisonment, etc.) in subsection (1) after &#147;may&#148;, insert &#147;within 14 days beginning with the date he received the reports.&#148;.&#146;.&#151;<i> [Dr. Pugh.]</i></p>

<p><a name="st_o204"><a name="07061835000049"><a name="70618-0011.htm_spnew1"><a name="07061835000952"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b>
 With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 26</p>

<p><a name="st_o205"><a name="07061835000050"><a name="70618-0011.htm_spnew2"><a name="07061835000953"><b>Dr. Pugh:</b>
 It is estimated that a large number of prisoners have mental illness, which is to be expected because prison is not an enjoyable experience. Some are treatable in prison, but some are beyond its competence to treat them, as would be the case if they had severe physical problems, so transfer may be necessary. That may be problematic because of security problems, the effect on autonomy and rehabilitation, and the prisoner&#146;s understanding of his position. However, when the situation is severe, there is no option but to transfer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70618-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07061835000051">The purpose of the new clause is to sharpen that process by giving 14 days for a reaction to the responsible clinician&#146;s report. Any delay or trouble indicates an under-provision in NHS secure units, which should be addressed, and a strain on the prison service. The new clause would set a sensible service standard. Many cases now wait three months or more, and the waiting is becoming worse. I accept that there are technical problems, but leaving the default situation as it is at the moment means leaving people who are very ill, very dangerous and very disruptive in the prison system.</p>

<p><a name="st_o206"><a name="07061835000052"><a name="70618-0011.htm_spnew3"><a name="07061835000954"><b>Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry) (Con):</b>
 I shall be brief. I endorse the comments that have been made on this matter. I have three penal establishments all lined up in a row in my constituency. One is a secure training centre, and I recently discussed the matter with the rector there. The staff go to immense trouble to assess young people&#146;s mental health on admission, and it is frustrating, if their condition deteriorates and it is necessary to refer them away for treatment, if there is a long, difficult and worrying delay before than can happen.</p>

<p><a name="st_o207"><a name="07061835000053"><a name="70618-0011.htm_spnew4"><a name="07061835000955"><b>Ms Rosie Winterton:</b>
 We cannot accept new clause 9, but I urge the House to accept Government amendment No. 26, which is a technical amendment to correct a small gap in the 1983 Act. The effect of that gap is on offenders given a hospital direction by the court and who are detained in a place of safety. At present, they cannot benefit from the second opinion safeguards in part 4 of the Act against being treated without consent while they are detained in a place of safety.

been so central to the debate that the new clause should be called the Williamson amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="70618-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07061835000609">Let me remind hon. Members about the background. The Children&#146;s Commissioner for England&#146;s powerful report &#147;Pushed into the Shadows&#148; was extremely timely in highlighting the bad experiences that some young people have had on adult psychiatric wards. Professor Aynsley-Green and his staff have been most helpful and constructive in discussions on how to tackle the problem. The children&#146;s organisation YoungMinds researched that report for the children&#146;s commissioner. It has also been a vigorous campaigner on the issue. It has always been willing to engage in constructive discussion to resolve the problem in a way that is acceptable to all and will be effective. Hon. Members who served on the Committee will know that I had reservations about implementing some of the changes that were requested, but following discussions with the organisations, and with Kathryn Pugh from YoungMinds, who has been a powerful and persuasive advocate for children, in particular, and with the realistic attitude that is being adopted, I think that we have found a way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="70618-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07061835000610">I am also aware that the Joint Committee on Human Rights, led by my hon.

I hope that following my remarks he will be reassured that new clause 4 and amendment No. 50 make it possible for him not to press his new clause to a Division.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="70618-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07061835000611">New clause 4 will ensure that patients aged under 18 are detained in a hospital environment that is suitable for their age, subject to their needs. We have used the word &#147;environment&#148; because what matters to a childor young person goes well beyond mere physical segregation from older people, as I am sure right hon. and hon. Members appreciate. By using the word &#147;environment&#148; we can ensure not only that children and young people have separate facilities, but that they are appropriate physical facilities, with staff who have the right training to understand and address their specific needs as children, and a hospital routine that will allow their personal, social and educational development to continue as normally as possible. We do that by using the word &#147;environment&#148;, and by giving hospital managers a duty to ensure that that is the case.</p>

 One of the other changes that we are making will provide for a duty to ensure that people know what accommodation is available. As the hon. Gentleman acknowledged in Committee, when their needs are taken into account it is clear that some under-18s are better placed in adult psychiatric wards. Patients in CAMHS&#151;child and adolescent mental health services&#151;wards can also benefit from that. Our aim is to allow the necessary flexibility for such patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="70618-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07061835000614">The duty to ensure that the patient&#146;s environment is suitable lies with hospital managers, but the new clause requires them to consult a person whom they consider to have the necessary knowledge and experience of cases involving patients under 18. We have made the description fairly wide to allow for future changes in the qualifications of professionals, but for now we will make clear in the codes of practice for England and Wales that we expect such people to be tier 3 or tier 4 CAMHS specialists. I think that that covers some of the points raised in the House of Lords about the need to ensure that cases were dealt with by specialist CAMHS people rather than by people who did not understand the changes. We want to ensure that those who make the initial decision on whether to detain someone in hospital have the correct information about the availability of and arrangements for specialist beds, so that children are sent to appropriate hospitals.</p>

 If the hon. Lady is asking what would happen if a tier 3 or tier 4 specialist was not available, I can tell her that the new clause provides for a duty to ensure that a suitable person is available in such circumstances. I know from my meetings with YoungMinds, the children&#146;s commissioner and Lord Williamson&#151; who has reflected the views of peers&#151;that they support the new clause. However, they want an assurance that we have a performance management framework, and I assure the House that we intend to provide one. All along, it has been argued that merely legislating for something to happen does not necessarily make it happen. We could sit here patting ourselves on the back for having introduced legislation, but unless the services are there it will not be possible for us to deliver for people as we would wish.</p>

 Has the model not been set in cancer services, where charities such as the Teenage Cancer Trust have fought for young people to be placed in separate wards?

 My hon. Friend is right. We know that we can achieve such changes when people put their minds to it. The issue is legislation. It has been made clear to me that because some of the issues involve compulsory detention, it is right for us to make an exception. I suspect that the cancer provisions are not in legislation, whereas we are using legislation that constitutes something of a step change&#151;but, as my hon.

and adolescents in England to allow performance management of that aspect of the service. We are making capital available to the NHS to increase the availability of in-patient facilities for adolescents, and to reduce reliance on adult wards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70618-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07061835000620">In November last year the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), who is responsible for care services, made a commitment that within two years no child under 16 in England would be placed in an adult ward while being treated for a mental disorder. To ensure that that commitment is fulfilled, the director general of commissioning in the Department of Health has written to the chief executives of strategic health authorities setting out new reporting requirements on the use of adult psychiatric wards by children aged 16 and under.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70618-0014.htm_para13"><a name="07061835000621">Any exceptional case of a child of 16 or under being placed in an adult psychiatric ward must be reported to the strategic health authority as a serious untoward incident, and the SHA must in turn notify the Department. We would expect the child not to stay in the ward for more than 48 hours. The ward would be specially equipped to deal with the child, and staff dealing with the child would be appropriately qualified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70618-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07061835000622">I can reassure the House that the Government are working to develop performance measures for 2008-11 public service agreements and a health and social care outcomes framework. As part of that work we are considering a range of indicators, including a CAMHS indicator. Regulators have an ongoing responsibility to assess performance, which includes the commissioning of age-appropriate services. We need to ensure that they are being commissioned properly. To help that, the Care Services Improvement Partnership is developing a commissioning framework specifically for CAMHS. We will have continuing discussions with the Healthcare Commission to ensure that the monitoring of age-appropriate services is one of its priorities. We have also agreed to keep YoungMinds and the children&#146;s commissioner informed of our progress on performance management.</p>

We would probably have to err on the side of caution, and we think we can probably achieve some of the changes soon. I want that to happen; I do not want to specify a date that kicks the matter into the future and sends a mixed message to the NHS. However, I emphasise the Government&#146;s clear and firm intention to invest resources so that we can implement the provision as soon as possible. Our aim is to implement it fully in England by around April 2010. Amendment No. 50 gives us the flexibility to allow, for example, new section 131A to be implemented in relation to part 2 and informal patients in England as soon as resources allow, rather than our having to wait until it can be implemented for part 2, informal and part 3 patients in England. I am sure that YoungMinds, the Children&#146;s Commissioners for England and Wales and Members of this House and the other place will track progress on this issue.</p>

I said in Committee that I was sympathetic to the intentions behind the amendment but that I wanted to look further into some of its financial and operational implications. My officials recently came back to me on that. They reassured me that the impact would be operationally manageable for both hospitals and the mental health review tribunal, so at this stage I am supportive of my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment. I look forward to hearing her speech, and any other contributions on her proposal.</p>

That raises complex issues, and an amendment to the Bill is not the right way to address them. Most 16 and 17-year-olds will be able to understand, and make an informed decision about, being admitted to hospital except where they lack capacity, but that is not the case for under-16s. Each case needs careful consideration. The Government consider that the position of under-16s&#151;both those who are Gillick-competent, and those who are not&#151;can best be set out in guidance in the code of practice. Guidance can go into this difficult area in much greater detail and can be updated more easily in line with developments in case law. Therefore, I ask the hon.

 I find myself for the second time this evening congratulating the Minister on having listened&#151;at long last, and despite having thrown a bit of a strop in Committee on this subject&#151;and on having returned with worthwhile amendments. Although they do not go explicitly as far as some of us asked, their spirit is very much in keeping with what we hoped for. I join her in paying tribute to the excellent work of Lord Williamson in another place, who to a great extent kicked off the consideration of this issue by introducing a measure under which three conditions were to be met: admission to age-appropriate settings, and medical assessments by a CAMHS specialist and by a clinical supervisor specialist. That provided a good starting point to lay out the importance of this subject; many Members of this House and of the other place, and many people in YoungMinds and other mental health organisations, feel strongly about it, as do many young people suffering from mental illness.</p>

In a variety of witness evidence that Members of both Houses received, we heard some brave and devastating testimonies, particularly from teenage girls, about such experiences in adult acute mental health wards. They told us about having to use mixed-sex bathrooms and about being in wards with older men who had committed violent acts, and they also told us that no education facilities were provided for them. At important stages in their educational career they found themselves in a mental health institution with no way of getting back to some degree of normality by furthering their education. One of our witnesses said that eating was the only recreation. We also heard about problems to do with siblings aged under 18 not being able to visit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para5"><a name="07061835000630">The testimony of one witness, Antonia, was especially stark, and it might be helpful if I repeat some of it. She said that in order to be in an adolescent service,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07061835000631">That serves to emphasise how important it is to have age-appropriate treatment. Even if she had to go a long way to get it, that was preferable to being placed more conveniently closer to home in an inappropriate setting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para7"><a name="07061835000632">I am pleased that the Government have taken on board the comments that have been made, and that the amendments cover all those aged under 18. There was a big argument about how we address 16 and 17-year-olds&#151;it is completely inappropriate for many in that age group to be placed in adult wards, but for some of them it is more appropriate. In our amendments in Committee we were at pains to retain the flexibility that 16 or 17-year-olds could be admitted to adult wards if appropriate. However, that must be decided on the basis of its appropriateness to their therapeutic benefit and recovery. I welcome the fact that all under-18s and voluntary and detained patients will be covered and that reference is made to the fact that a suitably qualified practitioner should be consulted at the assessment prior to admission.</p>

promised to look at this issue and come back with something more definitive, which she has now done. I realise that some perverse incentives are potentially built in, in that areas that are more advanced in their provision of CAMHS facilities might take their foot off the gas if they are told that everything has to come in by a certain date; we need to prompt the less advanced areas to make sure that they provide those facilities. I know that there is a particular problem in Wales, for example, and the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams) might wish to refer to it in a little while.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para10"><a name="07061835000635">All of us will feel let down and disappointed if we find ourselves coming back to this place in three years time to consider this issue and not a lot has changed. We need some strong assurances from the Minister that it will be a real priority for her Department, andwe perhaps need some explanation of a strong performance-management framework to complement the legislation, so that we can judge whether progress is being made and how fast, and judge what extra support or attention might need to be given in the meantime. There is a possibility, as YoungMinds pointed out, that some adult hospitals might interpret the provision in such a way that it will lead them to refuse all under-18-year-old patients. The Friday night scenario of clinicians phoning unit after unit to find one that will accept an under-18-year-old would then get worse, particularly if PCTs or health boards did not have to ensure adequate provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07061835000636">We need a performance management framework or targets, although we are not great fans of the latter, to make sure that local partners understand their duty to commission sufficient capacity to ensure that age-appropriate facilities are available, and that local providers act in a manner that reflects the duty to co-operate to meet the needs of the child or young person, as enshrined in the Children Act 2004. This has got to be a joint effort and as the Minister rightly said, that is not going to happen if the services are not in place. This legislation should not be a substitute for services; rather, it should be a serious spur to the providers to make sure that services are available and appropriate and are being used properly, and that as many of our children and young people as possible are being picked up and given the appropriate treatment that they need and deserve.</p>

I shall be interested to hear what the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) has to say about his new clause 8, with which I have a deal of sympathy because it places greater duties specifically on commissioners and PCTs, and not just on hospital managers. As I said, this is a team effort in which a joined-up approach involving everyone will be absolutely essential.</p>

being seriously called into question. We are delighted that the Government have tabled these new clauses and we will certainly support them, but that support will not be given without a deal of assurances about how they are going to work in practice, and an assurance that the Minister is going to keep on the case of those responsible for ensuring that the measures become a reality.</p>

 New clause 8, which is in my name, is designed to give effect to the recommendations in paragraphs 1.16 and 1.17 of the 15th report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Before I get to the meat of what I have to say, perhaps I might compliment my right hon. Friend the Minister on engaging very constructively with the Committee. Indeed, she gave lengthy and detailed responses to our two reports. Unusually, we reported twice on this Bill, which is very complex and raises some fundamental issues of freedom and liberty; that is why we felt it necessary to go into such detail. I am very grateful to my right hon. Friend for engaging so constructively with us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para14"><a name="07061835000640">In considering new clause 8, we need to look at the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, which the UK has ratified, and to recognise that the Bill impacts on and engages a number of the convention&#146;s articles: article 3, on the need to recognise the best interests of the child when acting concerning children; article 12, which requires consideration of children&#146;s views in decisions on issues affecting them; and article 19, which is designed to protect children from all forms of violence, injury, abuse, neglect, maltreatment or exploitation. Of course, the article 19 right also engages article 3 of the European convention on human rights.</p>

We recommended the adoption of an amendment to ensure that young people receive age-appropriate assessment and placement, while at the same time not rendering illegal the placement of a child on an adult ward if that is the only way that their needs can be met. When we tabled the new clause, we had not seen the Government&#146;s proposals, and I am delighted that they have tabled new clause 4, which represents a very satisfactory way forward as far as my Committee is concerned. In the circumstances, I do not propose to press new clause 8 any further, as my right hon. Friend the Minister has gone far enough to satisfy the concerns raised in our report.</p>

 The Minister was clear, in as much as she is not going to accept my amendment No. 83 and asked me to withdraw it. However, I thought it worth clarifying why I tabled it. It is an attempt to make it clear that children under 16 who are competent to make decisions can either consent to or refuse to agree to their admission to hospital for treatment of mental disorder. If such a child does not agree to being admitted to hospital, this refusal cannot be overridden by a person with parental responsibility. The amendment achieves this by extending the remit of section 131 of  <br>

the 1983 Act, which relates to informal admission, to cover children under 16 who are considered competent to make such decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para16"><a name="07061835000643">If the amendment is accepted, a person with parental responsibility would not be able to agree to the child&#146;s being informally admitted to hospital if the child is deemed competent to make this decision and is refusing to be admitted. Where a competent child refuses to agree to admission to hospital for treatment for mental disorder, the mental health professionals involved would need to consider whether the criteria for admission to hospital under the 1983 Act are met, and in a small number of cases the powers under the Children Act 1989 may be appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para17"><a name="07061835000644">As the Minister said, clause 40 of the Bill will amend section 131 of the 1983 Act. This was a Government amendment introduced in the other place, and it makes it clear that a 16 or 17-year-old who is capable of making such decisions may decide whether or not to be admitted to hospital for treatment for mental disorder, and that that decision cannot be overridden by a person with parental responsibility. That amendment was welcome and clarifies the position of 16 and 17-year-olds, but it is also important to clarify the position of Gillick-competent children. A child is generally considered Gillick-competent if they have sufficient understanding and intelligence to understand fully what is being proposed, and to be capable of making up their own mind on the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para18"><a name="07061835000645">The Minister said that this issue is complex, and I agree; indeed, that is partly the motivation behind tabling this amendment. There is great uncertainty in the law, and this is an attempt to clarify it. There is a certain amount of confusion among practitioners responsible for the care and treatment of children and young people with mental health problems. It has commonly been accepted that the refusal of a Gillick-competent child or young person to accept medical treatment can be overridden by a person with parental responsibility for them. There is case law to that effect. In the area of mental health, that has led to great uncertainty among professionals. If the young people have complex mental health care needs, the professionals have to rely on parental consent in the face of disagreement from the young person. In some cases, that uncertainty has caused delay in making the appropriate arrangements for the treatment and care of the young child or person. I am sure that we would all wish to avoid that happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para19"><a name="07061835000646">If a parental decision overrules a child under 16, it can cause longstanding tensions between the child and parent. It is usually a stressful time for them and it seems unfair to place the weight of responsibility for that decision on the parent. There is also the question of respecting the rights of the child. If he or she is competent to make the decision, for example, to refuse admission to hospital, relying on parental consent to authorise the admission could breach the child&#146;s right to liberty under article 5 of the European convention on human rights. That is acknowledged in the draft code of practice. Richard Jones, an expert in mental health law, states:</p>
<a name="70618-0015.htm_brev1"><a name="07061835000906"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is likely that the Court would hold that a parental consent to the admission of a mentally competent child to a psychiatric hospital violates Art. 5 if the child objects to the admission.&#148;</p>

The Department has previously indicated that case law has developed to give greater autonomy to children and young people and it is no longer the case that a person with parental responsibility can override the refusal of a child or young person, of whatever age, who has the capacity to make such decisions for him or herself. The indication was therefore that it was not necessary to include this issue because the case law is clear. For example, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath has said that</p>
<a name="70618-0015.htm_brev2"><a name="07061835000907"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;more recent cases demonstrate the trend towards greater autonomy for young people.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 15 January 2007; Vol. 688, c. 545.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para21"><a name="07061835000648">The Government&#146;s reasons for taking that approach are outlined in Lord Hunt&#146;s letter to Baroness Walmsley of 16 January 2007. But the case cited by Lord Hunt&#151;R <i> v.</i> Secretary of State for Health (Axon)&#151;relatesto consent to advice and treatment and the dutyof confidentiality. It considered how medical professionals should deal with young people who are Gillick-competent and want advice on sexual matters, but who cannot be persuaded to inform their parents or to permit the medical professionals to do so. It does not address the issue of a competent child&#146;s refusal of medical treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para22"><a name="07061835000649">The Minister mentioned guidance, and the most important point is that the draft illustrative code of practice to the Mental Health Act 1983, which has been published to help people to understand the Bill, removes references to the refusal of a Gillick-competent child or capable 16 or 17-year-old being overridden by a person with parental responsibility. However, it cites no case law to support that view nor does it provide any explanation for the change in approach. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify when the guidance will be produced and what form it will take, because another publication, &#147;The Reference Guide to Consent for Examination and Treatment&#148;, issued by the Department in 2001, claims that it</p>
<a name="70618-0015.htm_brev3"><a name="07061835000908"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;sets out in detail the current English law on consent&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para23"><a name="07061835000650">That document refers to parental consent overriding the refusal of a competent child or young person. Although it suggests that that power should be used rarely, it also highlights the lack of clarity on the issue by acknowledging that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para25"><a name="07061835000654">Without amendment of the law, there will continue to be great uncertainty in this important area. It is an issue that affects relatively few children and young people, but for those whom it does affect it can have long-lasting effects on their lives. I hope that the Minister will explain how she will provide greater clarity for practitioners dealing with those sensitive issues.</p>

<p><a name="st_o226"><a name="07061835000655"><a name="70618-0015.htm_spnew5"><a name="07061835001454"><b>Mrs. Moon:</b>
 A significant number of changes have been made to the Bill, many of which will greatly improve mental health services, especially for young people. The initial criticism was that the Bill would not make enough changes, but no one could claim now that Ministers have not listened. Our debates in Committee have borne fruit and changes are being made, especially to age-appropriate services, settings and specialists for those under 18.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para26"><a name="07061835000656">Some of the evidence that we heard, which hon. Members have described, was about the lack of education for young people, the difficulty in accessing family members and the anxiety and fear that they experienced on adult wards. Those points have been recognised and the changes that will be in place by 2010 will address all the issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para27"><a name="07061835000657">Amendment No. 4 would ensure that services for 16 and 17-year-olds came into line with the services proposed for under-16s in new clause 4, so that those who do not request a review will get one annually rather than every three years, as at present. That seems only right. Life at 16 and 17 can be distressing. Young people of that age change fast, their emotions are changeable, difficult and contradictory. Physical changes and emotional turmoil can be extreme. It is also a time when people are trying to find their voices, put their own ideas and find their own competency. If we are to help young people of 16, 17 and 18 who are struggling to find mental stability and competency, it is only right that they have the opportunity to request a review every year, so that they can look again at their lives, the decisions they have made and the mental health troubles they are experiencing. Services can then be reviewed and their decisions challenged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para28"><a name="07061835000658">I welcome the Minister&#146;s generosity in saying that she will consider amendment No. 4, because it will give 16 and 17-year-olds access to the services in new clause 4. I hope that it will ensure that they will have the annual reviews necessary at that vulnerable time in their lives. As they enter adult life, they should still have the rights of a child to have their lives examined and questioned and their voices heard.</p>

<p><a name="st_o227"><a name="07061835000659"><a name="70618-0015.htm_spnew6"><a name="07061835001455"><b>Ms Rosie Winterton:</b>
 Will my hon. Friend clarify whether organisations such as YoungMinds and the children&#146;s commissioner would support us if we were to adopt her proposal?</p>

<p><a name="st_o228"><a name="07061835000660"><a name="70618-0015.htm_spnew7"><a name="07061835001456"><b>Mrs. Moon:</b>
 That was where I was going next.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="70618-0015.htm_para29"><a name="07061835000661">YoungMinds and the children&#146;s commissioner&#151;a children&#146;s commissioner service was first established in Wales, so yet again Wales has led the way&#151;have welcomed the proposal. It is only right that justice is available for young people. YoungMinds strongly advocates the acceptance of amendment No. 4, which stands in my name and those of my fellow Committee members.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for calling me to speak in this good-natured debate. I assure you and the Minister that there will not be any strops from this Member of Parliament. There have been strops in the past, but he is in a very good mood and has had supper, so he is well balanced and his sugar levels are where they should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="70618-0016.htm_para0"><a name="07061835000663">I welcomed the Minister&#146;s statement on new clause 4, which represents a great step forward, but I must express my concerns, although I will do so less eloquently than my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton). Adult wards are accommodating children, which suggests that there is a shortage of appropriate facilities in this country for young people with mental health problems. My hon. Friend said that people would rather go to appropriate facilities in Scotland than an adult mental health ward near their home. I hope that young people will not have to make such a choice and that appropriate facilities will be available near their homes. It is important that young people have their family and friends nearby at a difficult and traumatic time in their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="70618-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07061835000664">Will the Minister clarify where the resources will come from to fund the creation of additional suitable environments? She will be aware that Hertfordshire&#146;s mental health trust is having to make significant cuts to its budget to contribute towards addressing the PCT deficit. I hope that the money for the creation of appropriate facilities will not be taken from another part of the mental health budget through a process of robbing Peter to pay Paul. The money should be additional to that already in the system and overall budgets should expand to ensure that young people are given suitable accommodation so that we can make them well as quickly as possible and return them to their families and friends in good time.</p>

 I thank the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) for his support. He talked about perverse incentives, which have been mentioned before. We did not want the Bill to lead to people being turned away from treatment, which is why we have adopted our approach. I assure him that we will engage with YoungMinds and the children&#146;s commissioner. For the purpose of the debate, I will not use the title &#147;11 Million&#148; in case that gives the impression that we will consult 11 million people, given that that would probably be slightly beyond what we could achieve. I am sure that the Opposition will continue to hold us to account until 2010 and beyond.</p>

That is a real risk. I know that there are other legal views, but the Joint Committee has a good track record in offering opinions on such matters.

<p><a name="st_o240"><a name="07061835000708"><a name="70618-0017.htm_spnew0"><a name="07061835001468"><b>Ms Rosie Winterton:</b>
 I ask the House to support Government amendments Nos. 6 to 9, 35, 38, 40, 44, 47 and 48, which deal with some small inconsistencies in parts 4 and 4A of the Mental Health Act 1983 that would otherwise result from the introduction of the role of the approved and responsible clinician.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70618-0017.htm_para0"><a name="07061835000709">Let me set out the background to why we believe that the responsible clinician role that we have set out in the Bill is extremely important. We spent some 10 years considering how to expand the team that takes care of people who have mental health problems. We have considered a multidisciplinary approach and giving new roles and responsibilities to others in the team, and we want to put that into practice by introducing the role of the responsible clinician. Some fears have been expressed about the introduction of that new role, because people wonder whether they will be experienced enough to take on new responsibilities. I appreciate the work that my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) has put into this issue. Perhaps we can give some reassurance by giving his Committee more information on the competences that we expect people who take on the role of responsible clinician to have. In those cases, we are talking about experienced psychiatric nurses, who may be nurse consultants, and about clinical psychologists. They have had years of training to get to the positions that they occupy. Beyond that, we are talking about new competences that we will discuss with the professions and others to make sure that when people get that new responsibility, they are perfectly able to deal with the medical issues that come before them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70618-0017.htm_para1"><a name="07061835000710">The other issue that has arisen is whether what is known as the Winterwerp judgment dictated that medical expertise could be provided only by a doctor. I understand that there is an independent Queen&#146;s counsel report from the Royal College of Psychologists on that judgment, and it has shown that medical expertise does not always have to be provided by a doctor. We are talking about others in the team, trained to a very high standard, who would be able to give medical expertise to patients who have been under their care for a long time. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon may know, 85 per cent. of those who work in mental health services have broken away from the Mental Health Alliance because they are very concerned. They include members of Unison and Amicus, the Royal College of Nursing, and the British Psychological Society, and occupational therapists, who all feel strongly that to undermine the role of the responsible clinician by accepting amendments that would limit that role is not an acceptable way forward.</p>

<p><a name="st_o241"><a name="07061835000711"><a name="70618-0017.htm_spnew1"><a name="07061835001469"><b>Tim Loughton:</b>
 I hear the point that the Minister makes; it was inevitable that she would make it. The five groups that she mentioned broke away from the alliance on a specific point. Does she accept that many members of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the British Medical Association feel that the Government&#146;s stance could undermine the position of psychiatrists and their highly trained, highly skilled role? However, our amendments in no way try to undermine the role of other vital professionals involved in multi-agency working, so it is not an either/or situation.</p>

 I certainly accept that some psychiatrists are worried about other people taking on the responsibilities that we have defined. I also accept  <br>

that the hon. Gentleman has moved some way from his previous position, but his amendment No. 93 makes it very likely that a person who does not even know the patient could override the decision of the patient&#146;s responsible clinician. The vast majority of approved clinicians will be psychiatrists, at least initially. Under his amendment, it would probably be necessary to go outside the team, or even the hospital, to find an approved clinician who belonged to a different profession from the responsible clinician. That may not be the intention of his amendment, but it is certainly a result of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70618-0017.htm_para2"><a name="07061835000713">Amendment No. 73, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, is unnecessary because the tribunal is an independent judicial body that can seek evidence from whomever it chooses. AmendmentsNos. 70 and 73 assume that only a doctor or a clinical psychologist can provide objective medical expertise, but I assure my hon. Friend that the statutory competence requirements will ensure that all responsible clinicians can provide objective medical expertise. Again, amendment No. 70 would allow a doctor or clinical psychologist who might not even know the patient to override the decision of the responsible clinician. We do not think that that is a desirable approach. It could lead to inappropriate discharge, which I am sure is not what my hon. Friend would want, and that would put the patient, their family or even the general public at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="70618-0017.htm_para3"><a name="07061835000714">I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw his amendment, and I hope that the Opposition will withdraw theirs, but I also hope that my hon. Friend and the Opposition will continue to work with us, and that we will be able to convince them on the subject of competences, which will ensure very high standards, in terms of the responsibilities that we want to give to the responsible clinician.</p>

 I should particularly like to speak to new clause 13, but I shall also discuss new clause 14 and amendments Nos. 96, 92 and 98, which basically address the question of consent to treatment, particularly on the part of community patients. New clause 13 would provide simpler but safer provision for community patients who are not recalled to hospital, particularly when it comes to providing for a second opinion authorising doctor to examine a community patient in the same set of circumstances as a patient who is detained. In other words, we would like parity, because there are clear parallels between the two sets of patients. New clause 14 seeks a second opinion in respect of those who may be covered by the Mental Capacity Act 2005, but who none the less require treatment. The effect of the amendments is to require a SOAD to examine a community patient. The question is one of considering what happens to patients who are detained in a hospital, and of trying to implement legislation that will give parity to those outside hospital&#151;and, in the context of this group of amendments, to those who are on community treatment orders.</p>

If the patient has capacity to consent to the medication, and does consent, as confirmed by the responsible clinician, the responsible clinician specifies the medication on statutory form 2. If patients lack capacity to consent to medication or if they retain capacity but refuse it while they are in-patients, the responsible clinician must require a SOAD. The SOAD reads the patient&#146;s medical records, examines them, interviews a nurse and another professional who is neither a doctor nor nurse but is involved with the patient&#146;s care, discusses the case with the responsible clinician, then authorises what medication may be given, including details about whether or not it may be given by injection or only by mouth, assuming that an injectable form of medication is made. Details are given on the statutory certificate  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="70618-0018.htm_para22"><a name="07061835000763">The SOAD assesses the patient&#146;s mental state, decides if they retain capacity, listens to their objections, if any, to any of the medication, takes note of the patient&#146;s past history and response to medication, including adverse effects, notes the patient&#146;s physical health&#151;something that we have discussed a great deal in our debates on the legislation&#151;and explores, particularly with the other professionals, whether there are other non-medication interventions that are more appropriate or whether there is a reasonable alternative. All patients on a community treatment order, after the relevant time of three or four months, see a SOAD, who undertakes the same assessments, examinations and interviews as those for in-patients, but because the patient agrees to the treatment, it is self-evident that the SOAD cannot explore the reason why the patient is refusing and whether that is reasonable. The SOAD will issue a certificate authorising both the medication that can be given only with the patient&#146;s capacitous consent and medication that can be given should the patient lose capacity or refuse the original medication in future. We raised that problem in Committee. The Minister rejected our proposal, but there was quite of a lot of discussion of the need to write the certificate and what might follow under a certain set of circumstances several weeks or even months down the track.</p>

One must assume that patients on a community treatment order, as opposed to those who remain, or are detained as, in-patients, at the point at which the CTO is discussed, will agree to the treatment and suggested programme of intervention, which would be conditional on their having a CTO. All too often, however, things go wrong, so when something significant changes it is important to have a professional judgment by a clinician that is based on the facts, and that is what is at the heart of our proposals.</p>

Patients who are capacitous and consenting would have their treatment authorised by the responsible clinician. Patients who lack capacity, or who refuse treatment, would have the safeguard of the requirement for a SOAD authorisation based on an examination and assessments at the time the decision needed to be made, not based on a piece of certification ordered previously, which could be many months out of date. Safeguards for necessary and emergency treatments are included by amending section 62 of the Mental Health Act 1983 to ensure that patients do not suffer as a result of having to wait for a SOAD assessment. The Minister should consider that seriously. In Committee, we did not have enough time to go into the disparity between the appropriate treatment for in-patients compared with the treatment for people on a CTO. The CTO is proposed as an alternative for patients who hitherto  <br>

would have been considered for in-patient treatment, so it is right that there should be parity in the way in which their conditions are clinically addressed, particularly after a significant change of circumstances or after a given period after the CTO is made, and there is a need for reassessment by a clinician. I therefore hope that the Minister will look favourably at the proposal, as she often does when such cases are put to her, perhaps with a little more detail and time than we had in Committee. She has generously tabled amendments on Report&#151;not, I accept, across the board, and I would have preferred many more to be tabled&#151;on issues where she believes that fairness and parity should prevail for patients, as they should be treated equitably. That is what is at the heart of our proposals in this group of amendments.</p>

 I have tabled amendment No. 74, and amendments Nos. 75 to 78, which relate to child patients in the community. I have also tabled amendment No. 79, which deals with appeal rights. The amendments seek to give effect to paragraphs 1.18 to 1.25 in the recommendations of the 15th report by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Clause 32 governs the treatment of CTO patients in the community, without recalling the person to hospital. The basic principle is that a patient with capacity, or competence in the case of a child under 16, may be given treatment in the form of medicine for mental disorder only if they consent and if there is a certificate authorising the treatment from a SOAD. If the patient is capable but refuses treatment, that treatment may only be given without consent by recalling the person to hospital.</p>

The principal broad criticisms were that the provisions provide insufficient safeguards in relation to treatment without consent, that they are complex, cumbersome and confusing, and that there is insufficient guidance in the draft code on how they are intended to work. More specifically, a child patient may be given medicine for mental disorder without consent in the community if they lack &#147;competence&#148;. The same applies to an adult patient if they lack &#147;capacity&#148;. The Bill specifically provides that decisions about capacity are to be made in accordance with the test in the Mental Capacity Act 2005, but there is no guidance as to how the competence of a child community patient is to be determined.</p>

Equally, for adults, but not for children, the treatment may not be given if it conflicts with a decision of a donee, of a deputy, or of the Court of Protection. The Children&#146;s Commissioner and the Royal College of Psychiatrists argue that that should be addressed by giving those with parental responsibility the right to be consulted over the treatment of a child who lacks competence. The European Court of Human Rights, in the case of Glass <i> v.</i> the United Kingdom, recognised the rights of the mother of an incapacitated child patient as his treatment proxy when he lacked competence.

JCHR therefore recommends that provision should be made for the involvement of those with parental rights in decision making about the community treatment of child patients who lack competence. It recommends that individuals with parental rights should have the same rights as donees with lasting powers of attorney or deputies to refuse non-emergency treatment on behalf of an incompetent child patient.</p>

They insist that guidance on the circumstances in which emergency treatment and the use of force are authorised should be clarified, and they say that further guidance is essential. We share those concerns. Treatment given without consent engages article 8 of the European convention on human rights, especially if there is an objection, and in order for such interferences to be in accordance with law, a person&#146;s position should be more clearly ascertainable than is currently the case, given the lack of specific guidance on competence.</p>

Friend the Minister helpfully wrote to the Committee about the matter, but I am a little concerned about her approach. The position that the Government seem to be adopting, as set out in paragraph 26 of her letter, is that the effect of allowing a parent to refuse treatment would be to veto community treatment for that child, which may not be in the child&#146;s best interests, but she goes on to say that without the co-operation of the parent, supervised community treatment will not work. The Government seem to want to have their cake and eat it, saying that the parent should not have rights in these circumstances, yet expecting them to co-operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="70618-0018.htm_para29"><a name="07061835000771">Without parental co-operation, it is unlikely that a treatment order in the community would be made in the first place. There is some inconsistency in the Government&#146;s position on the matter. When she replies to the debate, perhaps my right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="70618-0018.htm_para30"><a name="07061835000772">Amendment No. 79 relates to paragraphs 52 to 56 of our fourth report. A patient subject to a community treatment order can appeal to a mental health review tribunal against the order as a whole, but not against specific conditions of the order. We think that that risks interference with articles 5, 8 and 13 of the European convention. The Government&#146;s response was that the need to obtain the agreement of an authorised medical health professional as to the making of the CTO and as to the nature of the conditions to be imposed provides protection against arbitrariness. We do not think that that offers much of a safeguard. Will my right hon. Friend be more specific?</p>

It makes the valid point that the responsible clinician and the approved mental health professional may not have met the patient before their crisis, and may not have in-depth knowledge about the patient&#146;s home life or the needs of their carers. That could lead to assumptions about the patient and unreasonable expectations of their carers as to supervision of the patient, transportation for treatment, police conditions and even housing for the patient.</p>

A person could be required to live in a certain place where they might experience abuse or stigmatisation from neighbours. A person under a curfew might find that too restrictive if they find a job requiring them to work after specified curfew time. Although the supervising clinician may be sympathetic, the right to challenge such restrictions would hinge upon the good will of the clinician. That goes to the heart of the European convention. I hope my right hon. Friend will read our report on the matter in detail. It is not good enough to be able to challenge the order as a whole. It should be possible to challenge the conditions if they are specifically unreasonable. I urge her to consider the human rights implications of not providing such a right of appeal.</p>

It seeks to address what I still believe is a gap in the Bill&#151;a gap in the details of consultation with patient, family and carers before a community treatment order is made.</p>

 I shall speak broadly in favour of the Government position and against the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) and her allies, largely because I have been going out and talking to people in Hackney&#151;practitioners, users and residents who live alongside mental health patients in the community who are not always receiving the treatment that they need. I mentioned that on Second Reading and subsequently, but it has not been voiced enough in the debate. Some of those patients will be bounced back into hospital because their needs are severe. Some do not necessarily need to be in hospital, but they need an element of compulsion to deliver their treatment.</p>

I have come to my own conclusion that treatment on the basis of need should be what drives our treatment of people in need of mental health services. That principle pervades the national health service in other areas. The difficulty with mental health is that not everyone can identify their needs, and even if they can, they are sometimes unable, for various reasons, to adhere to treatment voluntarily.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="70618-0019.htm_para11"><a name="07061835000787">I have spoken to users about this on a couple of occasions. I heard mixed views from them, but they did not rule out compulsory community treatment orders completely. Some said that they would rather have one as an alternative to hospital treatment because it would allow them to continue their family life and their work. Moreover, crucially, it is less stigmatising than removal to hospital, whereby someone is suddenly taken away from their home environment and family, and perhaps away from their workplace if they are able to hold down a job, for a period of time. That identifies them as a mental health patient, whereas in other circumstances they could say that they were in hospital for an operation, without having to go into specifics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="70618-0019.htm_para12"><a name="07061835000788">There was a common and clear view from the mental health service users to whom I spoke, thanks to Hackney Mind and its user group, that compulsion was entirely acceptable if the behaviour of somebody with a mental health problem led to police involvement. That was a universal view, admittedly not from a scientifically representative group of people, but from a group of mental health service users to whom I spoke in preparation for the Committee stage of the Bill. Interestingly&#151;I hope that the Minister has heard this from users too&#151;they were more concerned about consistency, quality and communications in relation to community care in general. The compulsion element was obviously part of our debate, but it was mainly about the quality of community services. If we are to have CTOs, we should also have better community services alongside them, so that someone does not have to have a CTO in order to get the services that they need, but can pick up services in the community as well.</p>

 Does the hon. Lady agree that if people are in the community under CTOs, there should be some parity with the level of service given to in-patients in hospitals?

 I agree that everybody should be able to see their care plan and have some input into it. Perhaps there are some gaps in services. Certainly the crisis team that I spoke to in Hackney, which includes medical professionals and social workers, does a very good job in intervening at the stage of pre-admission to hospital. I applaud the work done by them, by my local mental health trust and by Mind locally in giving users a voice, but that process is sometimes underdeveloped because there is not a great deal of funding for it. However, much as I would love to have endless discussions about types of treatment and services&#151;issues that are vital to my constituents&#151;this measure is about the narrow area of compulsion and treatment.

As he rightly pointed out, adaptations through case history over the years since then mean that a patient does not need to be in hospital day and night. If one replaced the words &#147;in hospital&#148; with, say, &#147;requires treatment&#148;, one would in effect allow for CTOs under current case law&#151;and professionals have told me that in many cases they are already, in effect, in operation, in Hackney and elsewhere.</p>

Under section 2, detention for 28 days is allowed, as well as special orders for people who have committed crimes and are released because it was an episodic crime. Section 41 deals with court restriction orders, whereby the person has to report to a psychiatrist every three months. That is far more  <br>

restrictive than a CTO&#151;although it does deal with far more severe cases. It can outline where someone lives, who they see and when to take medicine. I would be concerned if some of those matters were covered by CTOs. The Home Office enforces those restriction orders, and usually people placed under them have been in Broadmoor before the order was applied.</p>

Unfortunately, in constituencies such as mine we have a far higher incidence of mental health problems than we should, but we need to ensure that we are dealing with the situation in the most appropriate way.

It is sometimes more appropriate for somebody to be readmitted to hospital, but it is often better for them to be in the community. However, it is not fair on people in the community who are living with somebody who is not taking their treatment to have to put up with such difficulties when they know, perhaps better than the patient themselves, that something needs to be done that may not be being picked up by the crisis teams.</p>

I hope that some of the points that he raised will be addressed by that, although I have a lot of sympathy with the views that he expressed.</p>

By happily agreeing to the advocacy amendment&#151;I am delighted that the Government introduced that&#151;we can put in safeguards to ensure that patients in any sort of compulsory treatment, be it in hospital or in the community, have somebody to help them to argue their case for them.

Through the safeguards on advocacy, among other things, we will ensure that patients get many benefits.</p>

 I agree with much of what my hon. Friend says, but one factor affecting the disproportionate number of black and ethnic minority people who are detained is reluctance to come forward early and access services. I take the point that we must tackle discrimination, but one problem is the culture within a society that does not trust the system. The Bill is relevant to that. We have heard many scare stories about the contents of the Bill, so we must tell the truth about that, but it is also important to have regard to the impact of the Bill on the stigmatising effect on people with mental health problems.</p>

 I agree that there have been many scare stories about the Bill, which have not helped the general debate in the wider community&#151;or, indeed, in parts of the House. Conversation with several different groups in my constituency, including Derman, which represents Turkish and Kurdish groups, and the Chinese Mental Health Association, shows that there are many complex reasons for people not presenting with mental health problems. Sometimes it is to do with the culture of the community, and I admit that it is also sometimes to do with the way in which the system deals with people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="70618-0019.htm_para24"><a name="07061835000808">However, the Bill, with its narrow focus, will not solve those problems, whatever we do to it. If it were amended to the point of dealing with the way in which we provide services, it would be a different animal. It would be about provision of services, whereas it is about the legal rights of detention and compulsion. It appears that there is some consensus in the House about examining more deeply and radically the way in which we ensure that our mental health services provide treatment on the basis of need, and by ethnically blind means so that gross inequalities no longer exist. Black men in Hackney are three times more likely to suffer from mental health problems than anywhere else in the country&#151;I forget my exact facts, but the instance is higher than average.</p>

medicine, they pose some genuine dangers. Throughout the process, the Government have been unable to guarantee that the range of coercive treatment would not be increased. The object of critics is to ensure that the threshold of coercive medicine is not lowered unduly. Amendment No. 96 would do that.</p>

Amendment No. 96 would introduce a set of eminently reasonable criteria, including impaired judgment, a record of refusal, and evidence of the medical efficacy of the treatment offered. The individual would have to be sectionable, and at risk to himself or the public. There would have to be evidence that treatment was available and the individual would, in theory, have to be recallable to hospital if he defaulted on his course of treatment.</p>

The only genuinely crucial distinction between the Government&#146;s proposal and amendment No. 96 is that the amendment would require evidence that the voluntary route was unlikely to work, but that the compulsory route would work. That is a reasonable expectation. It could be argued that the threshold is higher than the current threshold in Scotland. The Scottish legislation has been much admired throughout our discussions, including by many critics of the Bill. Perhaps the amendment would provide for a higher threshold than exists throughout the world, wherever CTOs are used. However, it is not much higher than that that the Government have already set, and it is necessary to allay fears.</p>

There is a real danger of decrying this legislation because it does not achieve everything. However, I would like to repeat, as an addendum to what I have said previously, that there are many people out there who are rattling around in society with very little insight into their condition, but they are not sufficiently dangerous or troublesome ever to meet the criteria to become eligible for compulsory treatment. My point is that we simply have no solution for those people at the moment. At one stage, they would gradually have drifted towards the institutionalised route, but now they exist in various forms and are by and large untreated.</p>

 I share the view of the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch that there is no evidence for that. There is a great deal of worldwide evidence of using community treatment orders, which we can look at to establish whether it does drive people away from ordinary means and mechanisms to secure treatment. I do not believe that the evidence is there, so although the point exists as an allegation, it remains largely just a fear at the moment.</p>

From the piles of briefing that we have read over the past couple of months, it seems that there are currently about 32,000 people a year receiving some form of in-patient hospital care. With the introduction of CTOs, it is estimated that the numbers involved could be in the region of 25,000 a year. The figure is disputed, but a number of organisations that submitted evidence as part of the consultation process and then as part of Public Bill Committee scrutiny believe that the threshold for CTOs in this country will be set at a far lower level than that in many of the other 70 jurisdictions. It is anticipated that about 50 people per 100,000&#151;a significant number&#151;will be eligible to be placed under CTOs in this country. I am well aware that the Minister disagrees with the figure and will probably come back with a counter-bid, but if we could work on the basis of 25,000 people for the next few minutes, I would be grateful.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. We are perhaps in danger of commanding mental health armies that do not exist&#151;or do not yet exist. We need to be aware that huge resource issues are involved&#151;we are talking about 25,000 people in England, which is about 500 for each county, and many will require additional support to what is already being provided by the existing excellent mental health service professionals. We thus need to explore the mechanism for delivery at greater length. Perhaps the noble Lords in the other place will do so when the Bill returns to them.</p>

Unlike the Scottish system, this proposed system is more &#147;liberal&#148; in that people have to be detained in hospital before they can be subject to a CTO, so has it occurred to him that some patients might think that a CTO would guarantee them services they cannot receive because they have been discharged and will be forgotten until the next time they exhibit difficult symptoms?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman talks about a whole new system, but in my comments I highlighted the fact that there are already cases of people who are, in effect, on community treatment orders. They are admitted to hospital under a section and when they are released they have to undertake certain treatment or they will have to go back to hospital.

A psychiatrist told us, quite flippantly, that the powers were rarely implemented because the police do not want to co-operate.

good, and in theory was extremely good, but when people got back into the community insufficient care was delivered. Perhaps&#151;I am not an expert on this&#151;we would not need to go down the road of CTOs if we had the proper resources in place to ensure that people with mental illness receive the care and the contact that they need.</p>

Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham coming to the House&#151;to tell us how they are working.

We talked earlier about advocacy services, but if we are applying community treatment orders liberally around the country to people who do not want to be subject to them, I imagine that the demand for advocacy will be high. We must consider how we will meet that demand and who will meet it.</p>

They aim to make sure that those who are involved or likely to be involved in supporting or caring for patients in the community&#151;but not as professionals&#151;are included in the consultation process. That is particularly important for children, as it  <br>

will ensure that they benefit both from the skill of professionals and the informed support of those closest to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70618-0021.htm_para1"><a name="07061835000855">It is best practice to involve carers, but, over the years, many have complained that they are excluded from the care plan process, which means that the care plan often does not take into account the knowledge and skills of those closest to the patient. Imposing some types of condition on a patient may also have an impact on others living in the same household. From the point of view of the long-term success of the treatment, the provision seems particularly important. In addition, the rights of parents or carers could be affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="70618-0021.htm_para2"><a name="07061835000856">In many cases, patient confidentiality is cited as the reason for not sharing information. That is a strange argument for a blanket refusal to consult, however, as the people denied information are often the very ones who will assist and support the patient. If part of a care plan is to treat a young person at home, it is important that the other people in the household, and possibly the patient, have some understanding of the condition. They do not necessarily have to know all the medical evidence, but there ought to be a process by which their needs can be taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="70618-0021.htm_para3"><a name="07061835000857">Amendment No. 86 provides a similar provision for consultation when non-emergency treatment is proposed for a child community patient&#151;a child under 16 who has been assessed as lacking competence to consent to treatment. If a person over 16 lacks capacity, or a person under 16 lacks competence, treatment can be given if certain conditions are met. The amendment provides greater safeguards for child community patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="70618-0021.htm_para4"><a name="07061835000858">The Minister has suggested that for all practical purposes a CTO cannot be put in place for a child under 16 if parents do not consent to the treatment plan and its conditions. The amendment would ensure, however, that the rights of the parents are also enshrined in law, so that there is no ambiguity whatever when a CTO is set up. Parents of a hospitalised child for whom a CTO has been suggested need to understand what their rights are, with regard to saying yes or no to conditions that may be set to allow a young person home after treatment. A CTO for a child under 16, with conditions, places the whole family within the framework of those conditions. Parents should be consulted fully in that respect.</p>

and Honiton (Angela Browning) skilfully expounded the virtues of new clauses 13 and 14, which we tabled. The amendment goes to the heart of objections about how CTOs have been placed in the Bill. We intend to put the amendment to a vote at the appropriate time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70618-0021.htm_para7"><a name="07061835000862">We welcome the Government&#146;s climbdown on some of the most objectionable aspects of CTOs, especially on proposed new section 17B(3)(e), which contains the criteria whereby those under a CTO could be directed to &#147;abstain from particular conduct.&#148; That would have been one of the most coercive pieces of mental health legislation in any jurisdiction. It would also have been wholly counterproductive and unworkable. I am glad that the Minister has seen that and withdrawn that part of the clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="70618-0021.htm_para8"><a name="07061835000863">I am also pleased, to an extent, that the Minister has sought to rewrite the conditions of CTOs so that they must have a medical treatment benefit. That is welcome, but it does not go far enough, so we have tabled amendment No. 96, which is a reworking of the amendment that received overwhelming support across all parties in another place. We have listened to the debate and to some of the objections that the Minister and her colleagues made, and have adapted the amendment, we think, to make it more acceptable in dealing with the problems that she flagged up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="70618-0021.htm_para9"><a name="07061835000864">We do not want to dismiss CTOs out of hand, because they have a place. I was a member of the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee, which considered CTOs in great detail. It said that they have a place, but that they should be used for a closely defined set of &#147;revolving door patients&#148;, as they are called, in closely defined circumstances. We have taken that line all along. However, the definitions that the Government have left in the clause are still far too broad, will capture too many people, leave too many unanswered questions, and are too open-ended. The amendment defines the criteria for CTOs in limited circumstances, which are not to include criminal proceedings, that are deemed to be necessary to protect the public, which we all agree with, and to protect the person, him or herself. That meets the Minister&#146;s concern that we were ignoring the plight of those with suicidal tendencies. That was never the intention. In any case, they are covered by other parts of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="70618-0021.htm_para10"><a name="07061835000865">A concern was also expressed in another place that we could end up issuing a lot more CTOs to people who could be deemed to be suicidal.

South Wales Mental Health Act 1990. Australia is one of the countries that operate a form of CTOs. There has recently been an extensive review of the Act, focusing particularly on CTOs, and there was no push to change the wording in the new Bill published last week. What we are suggesting has not been conjured up out of the air; it has precedents in parts of the world with experience of CTOs that are very different from the coercive variety that the Government are trying to introduce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70618-0021.htm_para14"><a name="07061835000869">Our second criterion is that a medical treatment order should be permissible when refusal of medical treatment has led to a significant relapse justifying a compulsory admission, whether or not an admission subsequently took place. The Minister suggested that someone might not have been admitted despite qualifying for admission, and that in such circumstances there would not be grounds for a CTO. Our view is that if compulsory admission was justified, that should count towards a CTO. The final criterion is for subsequent medical treatment to have alleviated the patient&#146;s condition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70618-0021.htm_para15"><a name="07061835000870">We have thought a great deal about how CTO criteria can be honed to ensure that they affect a closely defined set of people in a closely defined set of circumstances and take account of many of the potential loopholes identified by the Minister, although I believe that most of her suggestions were unjustified. There is no empirical evidence for the efficacy ofCTOs where they exist overseas. They exist in some52 jurisdictions in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Scotland and Israel. In 51 of those jurisdictions the scope is narrower than that of our own law: the definitions are narrower&#151;as is the case in New South Wales&#151;the criteria are narrower, or both. In North America, for example, the scope is substantially narrower. Typically in the United States, imminent serious harm to self or others is required before the powers can be used.</p>

On that basis, it is surely incumbent on them to make the merits of their case categorically and without doubt. We believe that they have failed to do that, which is why we have been keen to ensure that if CTOs are to be used, the circumstances are defined very narrowly. We need to know exactly who will be affected by them, and exactly how people get into and out of them. I shall say more about that when dealing with another amendment in this group. We support the principle of CTOs, but want them to work justifiably in practice. We want a restricted regime.</p>

A section 17 patient can be recalled any time a clinician wishes, without the need for formal re-sectioning and the imposition of compulsory treatment. The provision is widely used. As the King&#146;s Fund said, this raises the question of whether a better understanding of section 17 powers might negate the need for supervised community treatment. So the point is that many existing powers are not being used.

Surely we need to find out why the existing powers for professionals are not being used properly and are not working as they should, before the Government introduce new proposals for which there is no empirical evidence that they would be any better, let alone that they would work at all.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for being generous in giving way again. On speaking to consultant psychiatrists about the powers of release under compulsion, they made it clear that that point was reached through successive instances of case law and through pushing at the edges of what is possible within the current law. The two main psychiatrists to whom I spoke, and others, expressed the view that putting such a provision in the new Bill will make it clearer and make it easier for clinicians to use it; it would also make the situation for patients, including their rights, clearer. Perhaps that goes some way toward answering the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question.</p>

By definition, those on CTOs cannot be detained in hospital&#151;they are a different group. The Government assume that in the first year, 2 per cent. of detained section 3 patients in England and Wales might be discharged as CTOs. However, if the experience of Scotland is replicated&#151;the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton may have been getting at&#151;whereby in the first six months, 23 per cent. of all hospital-based orders were varied upon patient discharge to a CTO, this will be a significant underestimate.</p>

They are being pushed to their limits, and many psychiatrists&#151;I have discussed this issue on more than one occasion with psychiatrists&#151;know that they are not really intended for the purpose that they are using them for.

 It is unfortunate that the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) raised the current powers, because she has been hoist by her own petard on this issue. I have a letter from Professor Sarawan Singh, one of the psychiatrists who came to the meeting. I have talked to him, and he quotes a survey published in the <i> British Journal of Psychiatry</i> in 2000, which showed that 46 per cent.of psychiatrists responding were in favour of CTOs,35 per cent. were not in favour and 19 per cent. were unsure. I do not know whether there have been any subsequent surveys, but it would appear that claiming that the majority of psychiatrists are against CTOs is not necessarily true.</p>

 Well, he was flown back at Government expense. I do not have a copy of the Minister&#146;s admission, but Dr. Swartz, from Duke university, North Carolina, was shipped in to speak alongside several other so-called professionals to tell us how wonderful CTOs were in North Carolina, but the CTOs there are rather different and he did not even know what sort of CTOs the Government are trying to promote in this country. For that, the Minister has admitted that we had to pay part of his airfare and his other travelling expenses, and that was a poor deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="70618-0022.htm_para0"><a name="07061835000899">There are two other important issues. Amendment No. 103, which is coupled with amendment No. 90, provides the right for patients to apply to the mental health review tribunal to vary or suspend the conditions of their CTO or the period for which it is in force. The tribunal can therefore recommend that those conditions should be varied or suspended and can follow up the issue if the responsible commission does not make the changes that it recommends. That is important, because if we are to have some form of CTOs, we need flexibility so that they are sensitive to individual patient&#146;s needs, especially given the great powers to impose all sorts of conditions even within the diluted form of CTOs that we will now have. In the interests of balance and fairness, patients must be able to challenge the conditions of the CTO imposed on them.</p>

or year, in perpetuity. If a CTO is still going after three years, it has clearly failed and is not the solution for the patient concerned, so we need to go back to the drawing board and review the best form of treatment for them. It is also natural justice that if we are to impose criteria that restrict the liberty of an individual, he or she needs to know how they can avoid getting into the lobster pot and, equally, how they can get out of it when their condition improves and they no longer need to be subject to the same strict criteria.</p>

That must be in the best interests of those people for whom a therapeutic benefit is intended and who need to trust the clinicians treating them.</p>

 We have had a thorough debate. I hope that I will be able to address all the concerns that hon. Members have raised and to explain why we reject several of the amendments that have been tabled. I also hope that I will be able to indicate that we have examined the matter carefully, which is why we have tabled specific amendments on the conditions of supervised community treatment.

We want to reflect what takes place in other countries and the fact that more services arenow delivered in the community. We want services to support patients effectively so that they can live safely and successfully in the community in the least restrictive environment that be achieved under compulsory treatment. Such an approach means that patients will spend less time in a hospital environment and more time with their families and loved ones. If we can achieve that without bringing any harm to patients and while protecting others from harm, we should certainly do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="70618-0022.htm_para4"><a name="0706195000011">When we began this debate many years ago, we intended to allow patients who had not been detained in hospital at all to be on supervised community treatment, which is what happens in Scotland. Legislation was recently introduced in Scotland to provide that people can be detained if a clinician thinks that that is right and to allow people to undergo compulsory treatment in the community, irrespective of whether they have already been detained in a hospital setting. We accepted that there was a great deal of concern about that and listened to the views of the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee. We thus brought forward measures to provide that patients would have to undergo a period of detention in a hospital setting before they could be subject to a supervised community treatment order. Several clinicians criticised us for moving too far and said that we should not restrict clinicians&#146; ability to allow patients to benefit from supervised community treatment if they felt that that was the right thing for the patient. However, we recognised that there was concern about the proposals.</p>

Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) said that our CTO proposals went wider than those in any of the 52 jurisdictions that he cited. I think that that figure was produced by the Mental Health Alliance, but we have no idea of how its conclusion was reached. It is only in Canada that it is necessary for a patient to be detained in hospital before going on to a CTO. Even in those circumstances, the detention need not take place immediately beforehand, as it must under our proposals. I am thus at a loss as to where that information comes from.</p>

 In a number of jurisdictions where conditions are set, they can extend to specifying certain activities. We are talking about requiring someone to abstain from a particular conduct. If using illegal drugs exacerbates a person&#146;s condition, or if consuming large amounts of alcohol contributes to their mental health deterioration, such matters are set out in conditions.

 The Minister will have heard my earlier intervention on the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh). Does she concede that it could be argued that there is a danger that people will be deterred from seeking any kind of help, support or treatment because they will feel that there is an element of compulsion? That could cause a negative reaction in the community. Additionally, there is the problem, which I am sure that she will address in her speech, of the disproportionate numbers of black and minority ethnic patients who end up with a degree of compulsion in their treatment.</p>

 My hon. Friend raises an important point about people being deterred from seeking treatment, but one reason why they are deterred is that they feel that they will have to spend a long time in a hospital setting. In actual fact, supervised community treatment is about providing the least restrictive setting that we can, if it is appropriate for a patient. It is about sending a clear message that when we talk about compulsory treatment, it does not always mean having to keep people in a hospital setting; we will allow them to return to their families, if that is appropriate. That is a different message, and it is less stigmatising and less discriminatory than saying that anything to do with compulsion has to involve a hospital setting. I think that the measures will not have the effect that my hon. Friend is talking about.</p>

There are delays in people coming forward, because they do not access community services. Some of them take a different route into compulsion&#151;for example, through greater contact with the criminal justice system. Very often, their relatives contact the police, but not health professionals. There is therefore a series of complicated reasons for that disproportionate number, which is why we have introduced the &#147;Delivering race equality&#148; programme, and why&#151;I am afraid to use the phrase, but it is what they are called&#151;we have focused implementation sites around the country, including several in London, which are looking particularly at the reasons why people do not come forward for treatment, and why a greater proportion of BME patients receive compulsory treatment. It is not as easy as saying that there are greater numbers because people are frightened to come forward&#151;the position is much more complex.</p>

 I am not sure that I can be helpful, but I will not try deliberately to be unhelpful. I met an outstanding consultant psychiatrist near Bristol called David Thurston who, for years, has gone out to meet his patients in pubs, at home and in places where they feel comfortable. He is concerned about CTOs which, he believes, may well drive a wedge between him and his patients. He has a method of working that works for him and his patients: will he be obliged to use CTOs, or will that be left to his discretion?</p>

 I have made it clear over and over again&#151;I hope that the hon. Gentleman acknowledges that, because this is exactly the debate that we had in Committee&#151;that the power is available to clinicians if they think that it is the right thing to do. There is no compulsion on them to use compulsion&#151;it is for them to make the decision, based on a range of issues, and if they think that that is appropriate. May I return to the reason why we believe that supervised community treatment can help to get treatment to people? There are 1,300 suicides every year, and 50 homicides by people who have been in contact with mental health services. We believe that supervised community treatment is vital to helping patients continue to take treatment when they leave hospital and to enable clinicians to take rapid action if relapse is on the horizon.</p>

That person&#146;s condition deteriorates and they end up back in a hospital setting or worse, perhaps committing suicide or doing harm to others.

 If CTOs are so vital to prevent suicides or to prevent homicides, can the Minister citea study anywhere in the world where CTOs have led to a reduction in suicides, a reduction in homicides or a reduction in hospital readmissions when people fail to take medication? I would be fascinated if she can, as no evidence exists.</p>

 As we have always said, it is difficult to prove a negative. We do not know what the outcome would have been if the circumstances had been different. The recent report on avoidable deaths looked at homicides and suicides by mental health patients. As I noted, there are about 1,300 suicides a year by people who have been in touch with mental health services. The confidential inquiry into suicides examines all those suicides individually.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="70618-0023.htm_para1"><a name="0706195000044">We know, therefore, that in the first two weeks after discharge from hospital, if a patient is not taking medication, the medication is still in their body and is still effective. In the second two weeks, if somebody has stopped taking medication, the effect is felt. We know that 56 suicides took place during that time after discharge from hospital because the person had stopped taking their medication. Nobody is saying that all those suicides could have been prevented, but we know very well that that is a point at which not taking medication will have an effect, and there has been a direct effect on people who commit suicide duringthat time.</p>

What is the Government&#146;s objection to the amendment, which is about there having been one occasion on which a patient has refused to accept treatment and has subsequently deteriorated? We will have the discussion about impaired decision making tomorrow, so I will not go into that now.</p>

 Essentially, we do not believe that the amendment is necessary, given that we have moved so far in terms of supervised community treatment by saying that it must be preceded by one period of detention in hospital. That is completely different from what happens in many other jurisdictions, including Scotland. There have been suggestions about restricting that, which is what the amendment would do. Asthe House will know, in Committee we reversed the amendments introduced in another place on the criteria for SCT, which would have meant that it was not available to patients at risk of suicide, and would have limited it to patients who had had two previous compulsory admissions to hospital. I am glad that the Opposition have conceded that SCT can be helpful in preventing suicide, and that their amendment reflects that. However, I still strongly believe that the suggested restrictions would go too far and are unworkable in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="70618-0023.htm_para4"><a name="0706195000049">The Opposition are in effect trying to limit the availability of SCT. Amendment No. 96 would restrict health professionals&#146; ability to make the decision,and make the scheme impossible to operate. It would demand an assessment of a previous relapse, including, crucially, whether compulsory admission to hospital would have been necessary, regardless of whether that admission had taken place. How is it possible fora clinician to look back over a five-year period and decide whether an admission would have been preferable irrespective of whether it took place? Are we asking them to say that the previous professional was wrong in not having admitted the person for compulsory treatment? How do they make an assessment about something that occurred as long beforehand as five years ago, without knowing anything about the precise circumstances?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="70618-0023.htm_para5"><a name="0706195000050">That is complete nonsense. Moreover, what relevance would it have to the person&#146;s current circumstances? Under SCT, the clinician considers the patient&#146;s current circumstances and asks whether they would benefit from it. It is completely ridiculous to ask them to look back five years. That goes back to the issue of having compulsory admission twice. If we, as the House of Commons, were to try to restrict clinicians&#146; ability to do what they think is right for a patient in any other circumstances, we would be wrong and the profession would be up in arms about it. The Opposition are trying to restrict the clinician&#146;s ability to make the decision. In effect, we would be saying to people, &#147;Until you become ill again you cannot have supervised community treatment. Please go away, get ill again, and then come back and we can talk about it.&#148; It is almost impossible to imagine saying that to patients, or to relatives of somebody in these very limited circumstances.</p>

 The Minister is trying to caricature the amendment, which responds to matters that she raised in the first place. There are such things as medical records. She is giving powers to somebody who has never previously met a patient to place that patient under a CTO. She is also trying to claim that the amendment provides that the patient must have two previous compulsory admissions. That is not the case. The amendment refers to the second compulsory admission.

That is a far more sensible method of tackling the matter than imposing another arbitrary time limit. Under the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal, whether or not a supervised CTO remains the right action in the clinician&#146;s opinion, we would say no. That is wrong.

 Is the Minister genuinely saying that she would be happy if a patient were on a CTO after three years? Does not she believe that those orders are for the shorter term? She admitted to an average of nine months. If they remain in force after three years, serious questions should be asked about whether they are the right basis for treating the patient and we should reassess the matter. That is all we propose. We are not trying to restrain the clinician; we simply say that if orders are in force after all that time, they cannot be working.</p>

Clause 30 requires the responsible clinician to consider supervised community treatment whenever longer-term leave is in view for a patient. If leave of absence for longer than seven days is givento a patient, the clinician should consider whether supervised community treatment is the most appropriate way forward. Anxieties have been expressed about the use of leave of absence when people remain under compulsion but are in the community. We want to ensure that clinicians consider whether supervised community treatment is appropriate so that such supervision exists in the community. Opposition Members would obviously prefer patients to go on leave in the community for long periods without the structure and safeguards of supervised community treatment to support them. That is not the best means of managing patients&#146; care and treatment. It is therefore unacceptable to try to limit the discretion that we are giving clinicians to determine what they do. That is the point: the powers give clinicians discretion; that does not mean that they have to act.</p>

Members to the statement of matters that should be considered when we are talking about principles in the code of practice&#151;and that includes the involvement of patients in planning, developing and delivering careand the treatment appropriate to them.

These are matters for the code of practice, and I am quite prepared to look further into it and see whether it needs to be strengthened by pointing out that we want consultation.

 I am very grateful to you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to secure this debate on an issue that is affecting many of my constituents, and which is hindering Hartlepool&#146;s ability to achieve its potential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para8"><a name="0706195001090">Over the past six to 12 months, housing-related matters have become the No. 1 issue in my constituency workload, eclipsing even antisocial behaviour as the main concern. I carry out weekly advice and street surgeries throughout the town, and a large proportion of work arising from them stems from an imbalance in housing supply and demand, resulting in people being unable to secure suitable and appropriate housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para9"><a name="0706195001091">There are a number of different strands to the housing case load that I receive. The majority of cases involve families who are unable to find an affordable or suitable property. A family with just two children, let alone any more kids, finds it increasingly difficult to secure social housing. An increasing number of elderly or disabled constituents also contact me to request my help in securing adaptations to their homes such as stair lifts and walk-in showers. The disabled facilities grant has helped in this regard, but the demand for such services and for that grant far outstrips the available resources. Some elderly or disabled people wish to move from their homes altogether. They are getting older and becoming more infirm, their children may have grown up and left the family home, and their current house may no longer be suitable; they would much prefer to live in a properly adapted bungalow. That would also have the advantage of freeing up family homes, but the number of appropriate bungalows in Hartlepool is extremely low.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para10"><a name="0706195001092">I also detect a growing number of homeless people who are priced out of the social and private rented markets altogether. In an extreme example, a constituent who came to see me&#151;she was pregnant, quite heavily so&#151;and her boyfriend were living on an allotment, waiting to be allocated suitable social housing. Such instances are mercifully rare, but they demonstrate vividly the imbalance between the demand for property and the available supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para11"><a name="0706195001093">On the face of it, Hartlepool does not have the same issues of affordability as other parts of the country. Stockton-on-Tees has the highest average house prices in the Tees valley, while my constituency vies with Middlesbrough in the sub-region for the cheapest house prices. Moreover, average earnings of full-time employees in Hartlepool are among the highest in the Tees valley. That means that, on a crude price/earnings ratio, Hartlepool is one of the most affordable parts of the country in terms of buying a house.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para12"><a name="0706195001094">It is true that in recent years, thanks to a relatively buoyant local and regional employment market and historically low interest rates, housing development in my constituency has been extremely healthy. We have seen the rise of new housing developments, such as Bishop Cuthbert and Middle Warren, with a high proportion of three, four and even five-bedroom homes being built. We have an exciting development at  <br>

Hartlepool Quays, where modern homes are being targeted at young and prosperous professionals, keen to enjoy the marina&#146;s leisure facilities and the high quality bars and restaurants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para13"><a name="0706195001095">A Hartlepool couple who are both in work are more likely today to be able to afford and choose to live in a four-bedroom detached house or a modern apartment on the marina, than an equivalent couple some 20 or30 years ago, when higher interest rates and other factors may have meant that they started their journey of property ownership in a two-bedroom terraced house. But the blunt ratio of affordability masks a great deal in terms of the experience of people in my constituency. The borough is the 14th most deprivedin the country and more than half of the town&#146;s population lives in areas that are classified by the index of multiple deprivation as being in the 10 per cent. most disadvantaged in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para14"><a name="0706195001096">There are fewer people in professional or managerial jobs and more with lower skills than the national average. The number of those unemployed or classed as economically inactive remains relatively high, although the number in work is now at a record level and the unemployment rate has come down dramatically over the past decade. There are also fewer people classed as owner-occupiers and more in rented accommodation than the average for England and Wales. That means that for a far too large proportion of my constituents, being able to secure a foot on the property ladder is simply unachievable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para15"><a name="0706195001097">Hartlepool is often referred to as the largest village in the world, with everybody knowing everybody else. In some respects that may be true, although I do not necessarily see it that way: I view Hartlepool more as a close collection of very distinct neighbourhoods and communities, with areas such as Headland, Dyke House and West View, Owton Manor and Rossmere, each with their own identities and each with their own specific housing issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para16"><a name="0706195001098">For the centre of Hartlepool, for example, there is a need to regenerate and halt the symptoms associated with inner-city decline. In that part of my constituency, there is an over-abundance of small Victorian terraced properties. Some 41 per cent. of the town&#146;s entire housing stock is classed as two-bedroom terraced property, compared with 26 per cent. nationally, and that tenure is located almost exclusively in the centre of town, with boundaries that align closely with the new deal for communities regeneration project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para17"><a name="0706195001099">In the late 1940s, Max Lock, who undertook a major planning review of Hartlepool, classified much of that area as blighted housing, with a recommendation that the terraced housing should be cleared. It has taken 60 years, and another Labour Government, before any real progress has been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para18"><a name="0706195001100">Today, four of the weakest nine neighbourhoods across the whole of the Tees valley in terms of the so-called vitality index are in central Hartlepool, namely Dyke House, Grange, Belle Vue and Stranton. There has been acute and long-term market failurein that area, with properties being snapped up by developers a couple of years ago for as little as &#163;10,000 or &#163;12,000. As I mentioned earlier, for those in work, historically low and stable interest rates have meant that people have often been able to aspire to and buy larger houses as their starter home, as opposed to the  <br>

traditional two-up, two-down. That has produced a doughnut effect, which sees a trend of people moving out of the centre of Hartlepool and into the suburbs. The ownership ratio has also flipped over in those areas in the last decade, with private landlords taking over the majority of that type of property. That has accelerated and exacerbated the problems in thearea, because landlords, often with no knowledge of the patch&#151;or even with no knowledge of where Hartlepool or the north-east is at all&#151;have frequently moved tenants with antisocial and criminal tendencies into the properties. That has undermined the sense of community and made long-standing residents resort to moving out, often selling to private landlords and accelerating the decline, or remaining and living in fear and subject to intimidation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para19"><a name="0706195001101">The housing problems are different in other parts of the town. Areas such as the Raby gardens and Easington road parts of Dyke House, and, to a lesser extent, Belle Vue in Stranton, are suffering from uncertainty and delay due to the lack of a firm commitment on their future. As part of the north-central Hartlepool master plan, Tees Valley Living, Housing Hartlepool and Hartlepool borough council are examining closely whether properties in those areas should be modernised or demolished. However, the process is being delayed, largely due to uncertainty about future flows of money to undertake regeneration work. That is causing residents to put their lives and hopes on hold. One resident in the area told me that she would like to put a new kitchen in her home, but was reluctant to do so because of the uncertainty in her area. The residents are willing to invest, but although that resident owns her own house, she does not know whether it will stay up or be pulled down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para20"><a name="0706195001102">Other areas of the town have different problems. In the 1940s and 1950s, large council housing estates were built, such as West View, Owton Manor and Rossmere, where both sides of my family were brought up. The right to buy has meant that there has been a gradual, yet marked, reduction in the supply of social housing over the past 20 years. Alongside that trend, council housing stock has been transferred to Housing Hartlepool, a newly-established registered social landlord. Under the socially committed leadership of Cath Purdy, its chief executive, it has ensured in three short years that two thirds of its 7,000 properties have met the decent homes standard. It is well on track to exceed the Government&#146;s target. It has improved the thermal efficiency of homes and put an emphasis on renewable sources of energy and insulation. It is extremely proactive in the community. I chair the local strategic partnership, so I am aware of Housing Hartlepool&#146;s contribution to the town&#146;s respect, neighbourhood renewal, social enterprise and financial inclusion agendas, which is all to the betterment of Hartlepool.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para21"><a name="0706195001103">Therein lies the problem, however. While, to put it bluntly, demand for council homes was not high five years ago, which reflected a long-term failure to invest in housing stock, the success of Housing Hartlepool&#146;s modernisation programme means that people want to live in such homes, which symbolises the regeneration and reinvigoration of our neighbourhoods to which the organisation is contributing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para22"><a name="0706195001104">Those neighbourhoods have deep roots. I knowfrom my surgery of many examples of three or four  <br>

generations of the same family living in Owton Manor or West View, for example. That was what I meant when I said that Hartlepool was a collection of communities or villages. Younger people rightly want to stay close to their parents or grandparents. Such a situation might ease child care problems and thus help people to get jobs or embark on training and education and thus improve their standard of living. We should therefore encourage that trend as much as possible. However, the demand for Housing Hartlepool&#146;s properties greatly exceeds the available supply. The void rate for its 7,000 properties is just above 1 per cent., while 0.8 per cent. of properties are ready to let imminently. That trend is mirrored by the situation for other RSLs throughout the town.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para23"><a name="0706195001105">The right to buy policy of the past 20 years has not been matched by a corresponding increase in the building of social housing, either generally across the town, or in areas identified as those with acute need. In Rossmere, for example, where both my parents grew up, the extent of the use of the right to buy has been astronomical. The former council estate has an owner-occupier rate of over 90 per cent., and the demand for social housing in the area is completely unmet. Much more needs to be done to match supply with demand in parts of the town such as Rossmere, West View and Owton Manor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para24"><a name="0706195001106">In addition to the past and current issues, Hartlepool has further requirements if the needs and aspirations of my constituents are to be met in the years to come. Itis forecast that in the next 15 years, the number of households in the borough will rise by 13 per cent., which is on a par with the highest increases in the entire Tees valley. Moreover, the number of people older than 75 will increase by a massive 25 per cent., which will mean that a quarter of the borough&#146;s residents will be in their late 70s by 2021. That will have enormous repercussions for public services and the availabilityof appropriate housing. We are struggling to meet housing need at the moment. Future social and demographic trends show that we will be deluged in the next decade or so by an even larger excess of demand over supply of housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para25"><a name="0706195001107">One of the frustrating things is that all the relevant partners already identify the need for action. In many cases, real progress has already been made, which shows that Hartlepool can progress and deliver when permitted. In the centre of town, where housing market renewal is necessary, the process of demolishing older properties is taking place as we speak, and new bungalows and other properties are being built. In other parts of the country, such clearance has aroused strong anger among communities, but not in Hartlepool. I can do no better than to quote an extract from an Audit Commission report published earlier this year:</p>
<a name="70618-0025.htm_brev4"><a name="0706195001282"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Ambitions and plans which have been developed with local people are communicated clearly to them. This approach has been particularly beneficial in the Housing Market Renewal area of the town, where the quality of communication and involvement, the clarity of vision and objectives, and the close partnership working of all stakeholders, including developers, has engendered local enthusiasm for radical changes to the area and very few objections to the Compulsory Purchase Orders&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para26"><a name="0706195001108">In small ways, Housing Hartlepool and other RSLs are building properties that are designed to tackle the problems of the supply of social housing. Housing Hartlepool, is building new properties in Nicolson way,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 Jun 2007">

for example, and to address the issue of an older population, the local authority, the health service and the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust are building an innovative retirement village comprising 200 flats and bungalows&#151;a scheme that won &#163;9.8 million fromthe Government&#146;s extra care housing fund. Those initiatives show that Hartlepool can and does deliver on housing market renewal and development. I am therefore confident that achievements would be madeif the Government provided additional resourcesand, perhaps just as importantly, allowed additional flexibilities to enable more to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para27"><a name="0706195001109">The comprehensive spending review hints at a flatline settlement for housing market renewal. For Tees Valley Living, that means about &#163;45 million over the period 2008 to 2011 shared between four local authorities. Although Hartlepool is classed as a priority area for Tees Valley Living and HMR, largely because of its acute need and record on delivery, that means that my constituency will receive only about &#163;3.75 million per year. Sites have now been identified and local communities consulted and enthused about what needs to be done, but progress will simply not happen at that level of funding. That further blights the area and hinders development. I therefore support Tees Valley Living's submission to the Government calling for &#163;30 million per annum over the next five years, which would provide certainty across the sub-region and allow truly sustainable, prosperous and aspirational communities to be developed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para28"><a name="0706195001110">Perhaps of equal importance to additional resources is the need for greater flexibility for councils and RSLs to build homes. We need to redress the imbalance between demand and supply. We need more appropriate social housing in areas where properties are in demand. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will outline how means such as donation of council land to RSLs at nil cost, prudential borrowing for the local authority to build homes, and joint venture arrangements between the council, RSLs and other partners to build more housing stock could be used to resolve the problems and to increase the supply of social and affordable housing in Hartlepool. The local authority, RSLs and other partners are coming together to consider an agreed way forward in terms of land use planning, land disposal and funding, but we are at an extremely early stage in this process and I would welcome anything that the Minister can do both to facilitate and to accelerate that co-ordination and to meet the need for flexibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para29"><a name="0706195001111">I am increasingly coming to the view that housing, particularly social housing, should be on a par in terms of a Labour Government's priorities with education and the national health service. Good-quality housing in sustainable communities raises people's hopes. A failure to meet housing needs runs the risk of consigning a generation of my constituents to low aspirations and a poor quality of life. Indeed, we need something similar to building schools for the future to secure additional social housing to help my constituents to achieve a better standard of living and realise their potential.</p>

tonight I have been able to demonstrate that social housing is not an issue that is confined to London and the south-east, but one that can be&#151;indeed, is&#151;very relevant to areas that are considered to be more affordable, such as the north-east and my constituency.

Friend said, the housing markethas undergone dramatic changes in recent times, particularly in Hartlepool, where the rate of increase in house prices was, for a period, the highest in England, albeit that prices started from a low base. I appreciate that increasing property values and rents, and shortages of affordable homes, have made things difficult for everyone, especially those setting out to buy a house for the first time. The Government are working with their partners in the public and private sectors to increase the number, range and quality of homes available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o513"><a name="70618-0025.htm_para33"><a name="0706195001116">We are making significant progress towards meeting the decent homes targets in the public and private sectors. We have invested more than &#163;20 billion of public money in improving council housing since 1997, and more than &#163;40 billion will have been invested by 2010. Since 1997, an additional &#163;7.4 billion has been provided through borrowing by housing associations. We have increased the number of decent social homes by more than 1 million, and increased the proportion of vulnerable households in the private sector that have a decent home to 66 per cent.</p>

Friend mentioned, Housing Hartlepool took over ownership of Hartlepool&#146;s 7,500 council houses in 2004, and since then it has been working to achieve the decent homes standard. He is correct to say that it is more than two thirds of the way to achieving 100 per cent. by 2010, and the Audit Commission considers it to be &#147;performing well&#148;. In addition to improvements to the existing stock, we want the creation of more affordable housing and new homes to be built at an increased rate. We are streamlining the planning system to ensure that a regular and reliable supply of land for new housing is available. The recently released planning policy statement on housing, commonly known as PPS3, enables local authorities to deal with the planning system more strategically to create places where communities can thrive.</p>

in the area and the annual build rates in Hartlepool between 1995 and 2003 were steady, at around 370 new dwellings a year. Hartlepool borough council is increasingly focusing on the issue of affordable housing. A housing needs survey will soon be published; it will reflect the most up-to-date guidance on issues of affordability. After that, the council will meet the Housing Corporation and registered social landlords to discuss appropriate action. The council is preparing a framework to increase housing supply, and it is currently updating its planning policies and land sales policies. It continues to negotiate with developers to ensure the inclusion of social housing in areas such as Victoria harbour, to which my hon. Friend referred. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o516"><a name="70618-0026.htm_para1"><a name="0706195001119">The council has also been considering the supply side of the issue, although it does not own a great deal of land. It needs to take into account the fact that planning permissions for several thousand homes were granted in the 1980s, and those permissions predatethe most recent dramatic price increases. As the permissions were granted some time ago, they did not include section 106 agreements for affordable homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o517"><a name="70618-0026.htm_para2"><a name="0706195001120">As my hon. Friend said, Hartlepool is the 14th most deprived of the 354 English boroughs, and more than half of the borough&#146;s residents live in areas that are among the 10 per cent. most disadvantaged in the country. Until recently, issues of affordability were not significant in the area, but price rises, particularly of better quality homes, has led to difficulty for first-time buyers. Despite those problems, Hartlepool borough council is well placed to develop the strategic approach to housing that is necessary for the borough and the rest of the Tees valley area.</p>

by replacing obsolete housing, improving existing properties, and helping to create mixed and sustained communities where people want to live and work. Authorities in the Tees valley area have combined to form Tees Valley Living, and are in the process of finalising a costed, prioritised sub-regional housing strategy for submission to the North East Housing Board in July. That is a key document for the determination of the next round of the single housing investment pot. Over the period 2006 to 2008, Tees Valley Living has been allocated more than &#163;13 million from single housing investment pot funding for projects across the sub-region, of which 21 per cent. was spent in Hartlepool. Authorities in the Tees valley area have shown a strong lead in developing a strategic approach to housing, which is commendable and in line with the Government&#146;s vision for the future of housing policy.</p>

The changing circumstances that he outlined bring new demands, so there is a need for new ways of working. Housing providers and local authorities need to increase house building rates; address the vexed issues of stock renewal; improve and maintain the quality of existing stock by achieving and going beyond the decent homes target; and meet specific community and social needs, particularly among vulnerable groups. It is essential to ensure that a suitable range of types and sizes of property is provided, based on a clear understanding of local needs and aspirations&#151;hence the Government's emphasis on the importance of robust and up-to-date housing market assessments in the preparation of housing strategies. New building has a major role to play, but, at best, new homes represent a minor proportion of the total stock. We need, too, to maintain and improve existing homes and, where appropriate, redevelop outdated property.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o521"><a name="70618-0026.htm_para6"><a name="0706195001124">My hon. Friend asked about future funding. Like any other Minister, I do not know the outcome of the comprehensive spending review. He has made his case well, and he articulated his constituents&#146; needs, and that is now on the record. I thank him for giving me the opportunity to set out the work that is under way. We are living at a time when a great deal is changing, and the Government recognise the need to respond to increased and changing housing need.</p>
