 The right hon. Gentleman is of course right in recognising that input costs&#151;principally as a consequence of rising energy prices and the consequential effects on fertiliser prices&#151;are having an impact on the current planting season in Africa. That is why we continue to work closely, not simply with the World Food Programme on emergency food supplies, but with the World Bank, which is establishing a trust fund, and other international agencies to ensure that supplies are provided during the narrow window available for the next growing season. When in Rome, I took the opportunity to make clear our commitment to social protection and cash transfer schemes, which can make a difference in ensuring that smallholders are able to sustain their livelihoods even in these challenging times.</p>

As a Department, we have already committed &#163;5 million to the first flash appeal for Ethiopia by the World Food Programme.

 A significant portion of the money that was announced is going into agricultural research. I arrived in Rome with a clear sense that we face three fundamental challenges&#151;short, medium and long term. The short-term challenge is to make sure that we get immediate humanitarian relief to the up to 850 million people around the world who are vulnerable to hunger as a consequence of rising food prices. That is why we are working both with the World Bank and, in particular, to support the World Food Programme initiatives. Secondly, in the medium term, we need a successful conclusion to the Doha development round and we continue to champion that cause in international venues. Thirdly, we need a significant uplift in agricultural productivity, principally in sub-Saharan Africa, which is why we, as a Department, have committed up to &#163;400 million to agricultural research over the coming years.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend accept that market mechanisms will fail farmers in Africa and other parts of the world? Although it is right and proper that we pursue the Doha round and advances in agricultural technology, there should nevertheless be recognition of the need for proper protection for smaller and more marginal farmers if we are to guarantee local food security in marginal parts of the world.</p>

 Of course we want protection and adequate supplies to be provided to those in need of either food or finance for subsistence, but three factors accounted for India&#146;s success in its agrarian revolution, to draw once again on that example. The first factor was improved infrastructure, the second was improved irrigation and the third was improved seed technology. That seems to hold powerful lessons for Africa, where there has been a decline rather than a rise in the rate of agricultural productivity in recent years. That is why we have placed such an emphasis on agricultural research for the years ahead.</p>

 As the Chairman of the International Development Committee made clear, shipping food to stress areas can often distort markets and undermine local production. Should not the key lesson for us from the Rome conference be that cash transfers and prioritising local, or at least regional, food purchases help to protect the most vulnerable from the dramatic price hikes taking place around the world?</p>

 We often talk about consensus across the House on development issues; this would seem to be an example of an issue on which there is such consensus. We have been strongly encouraging the World Food Programme, in particular, to move towards local sourcing of food supplies instead of using its more traditional mechanism, which is to bring in wheat, often from America, or other supplies from around the globe. I do not think that the choice is between seeing an improvement in the functioning of the international agriculture market&#151;that is why we want progress on the Doha round&#151;and making sure that immediate emergency assistance is provided in the way that most supports the development of the local economies where food aid is provided.</p>

Is he aware of the World Bank&#146;s latest research, which shows the link between biofuels and the land-use change that is causing the rise in food prices?

 The role of biofuels was of course an issue of some dispute at the Rome summit. A speech was made by President Lula, for example, who offered a strong defence of what he called the right type of biofuels. Much of the debate about biofuels, which needs to be better understood, is long on anecdote and short on fact. That is why the British Government have initiated the Gallagher review and I assure my hon. Friend that we are in discussions with the Department  <br>

The Chancellor of the Exchequer has urged the World Bank to take forward work on understanding the impact of biofuels on land use and, more widely, on social sustainability. We are also in dialogue with the European Commission to see whether we can establish a European position on the issue.</p>

That is why we have already supplemented the long-term support that we are offering to the people of Ethiopia with &#163;5 million for humanitarian supplies that are partly in recognition of the significant rise in food prices that has taken place.</p>

 Trade unions are a vital part of any democracy. That is why my hon.

This programme came to a natural end in 2007, which coincided with a spike in violence preventing us from renewing the programme. Since then we have successfully focused on supporting the Iraqi Government to provide essential services to their own people and stimulating private sector investment. In April, I met Governor al-Waili, the governor of Basra, who expressed his optimism about the future of Iraq. I assure my hon.

I hope that the fact that we now have airlift capability within the country will lead to a significant improvement in the effectiveness of the delivery of aid within the country.</p>

 It is morally indefensible to use the threat of hunger as a political weapon, and that is exactly what Robert Mugabe has shown himself to be willing to do in recent days.

to the House a statement showing that there is an exceptional and grave terrorist threat and that the need for action is urgent, and she must ask the House to support the action that she has taken. The legislation does not require discussion of the individual detainees; that would be wrong.

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="80611-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08061189000847"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require the removal from the DNA Database of DNA samples taken from individuals who are not charged or are acquitted; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80611-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08061189000164">Everyone accepts that DNA has been a massive breakthrough in crime detection, helping to solve the crimes of today and also some of the cold cases from 20 to 30 years ago. However, the Government have pursued this breakthrough in a disproportionate way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80611-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08061189000165">The UK has by far the largest DNA database in the world, with 4.5 million people registered. Proportionally, five times more people are on our database than is the case with the next closest country. We think of the US as having a punitive criminal justice system, but less than 1 per cent. of its population is on the US database, whereas we have around 6 per cent. Moreover, it has been estimated that under current laws, the database will expand to include one in four of our adult male population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80611-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08061189000166">The number of children on the database is particularly worrying. At the moment, it is estimated that it contains entries for more than 700,000 people who were under 18 when they were arrested and their DNA was taken. In case hon. Members think that some of them might have deserved what they got, I should add that there are estimated to be more than 100,000 children under 18 on the database who have never been convicted, cautioned or charged with any offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80611-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08061189000167">I am sure all hon. Members will have seen various crazy cases across the country. There are examples from every constituency. A quick trawl of press clippings threw up the case of three children who were hauled into a police station because they climbed a cherry tree to build a tree house. They were arrested for criminal damage and had their DNA taken, but the case was never taken any further. Another example is the 14-year-old boy who was a victim of mistaken identity when teachers at his school gave police the wrong name after a brawl between pupils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80611-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08061189000168">Even after admitting they had arrested the wrong boy, the police refused to remove his DNA. Whereas in the past schoolboy fights, high jinks and lads climbing trees would have resulted in a stern word and them being taken home, children are now getting criminal records and their DNA is being held on the database for ever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80611-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08061189000169">We should also be worried about the sheer number of ethnic minorities on the database and the racial imbalance. Almost 40 per cent. of black men have their DNA profile held, compared with 13 per cent. of Asian men and 9 per cent. of white men, despite the fact that there is no evidence that black men disproportionately commit crime. In fact, evidence suggests that white men are more likely to offend than black men. This over-representation of black men creates mistrust and continues to fuel problems that are much larger, such as the disproportionate representation of black men in our criminal justice system. Also, problems of race relations, community cohesion and discrimination, either perceived or real, are made worse. Moreover, the situation is getting worse. At the current rate, more than half of all black men will be on the database within two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80611-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08061189000170">This highlights one of the main objections to holding the DNA of those who are not charged or who are acquitted. One of the fundamental tenets of British justice is &#147;innocent until proven guilty&#148;. Refusing to destroy samples taken from those who are never charged or who are later acquitted completely blurs that principle. The DNA database assumes that people will be guilty of something in the future; that is why the samples are kept. This is very Big Brother; George Orwell must be spinning in his grave.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="80611-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08061189000171">When the national DNA database was created in 1995, only the DNA of convicted offenders could be held, and samples had to be destroyed if the suspect was acquitted or charges were dropped. Because by 2001 the Government were breaking their own law&#151;presumably as a result of incompetence rather than design&#151;the law was changed to allow the profiles of those acquitted of certain crimes to be kept. That was expanded even more in 2004, when samples could be taken from anyone arrested for a recordable offence. By the end of 2005, 200,000 samples which would have been destroyed before 2001 had been retained, and that number has since soared. There are now estimated to be more than 1 million people who have not been charged or convicted on the database&#151;three times the population of a city the size of Cardiff, where I live. Those are 1 million people considered innocent under British law, but considered potentially guilty by the Home Office. By retaining that DNA, the state is saying, &#147;Well, you might not have been convicted, but we think you may commit an offence in future and we want to make sure we can catch you when you do.&#148; That is not acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80611-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08061189000172">It is almost impossible, however, for someone to remove their sample from the database. Since the changes in 2004, fewer than 700 people have managed to remove their profiles&#151;700 out of the 1 million innocent people on the database. The police control which samples are removed. People have to apply to the chief constable of the force that took the sample in the first place, who is hardly an independent arbiter. The Government may be forced to change this shortly, as there is a case before the European Court of Human Rights, brought by two men from Sheffield&#151;one of whom was under 18 at the time&#151;who have applied to have their DNA removed on the grounds that they were both cleared and neither has a criminal record. The ECHR is expected to rule this summer, and a finding against the Government could open the floodgates on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80611-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08061189000173">Even if some people might not agree with the civil liberties case for removing the DNA of innocent people, there is a very strong practical case. The Government have already said that they believe that the DNA of the majority of the active criminal population is now recorded, so why the mad rush to take samples from so many other people? The DNA database is not without cost. The costs of sampling increasing numbers, maintaining an expanding database and storing millions of samples will continue to grow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80611-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08061189000174">However, there is very little evidence that these increasing costs will have much of an impact on crime detection. Despite the massive expansion in the number of individuals on the database, the percentage of recorded crimes solved as a result of a DNA match has remained fairly constant; the figures I have seen show it to be below 0.4 per cent. A bigger difference has been made at the other end of DNA matching: at the crime scene. At present,  <br>

less than 20 per cent. of crime scenes are forensically examined, and only a small proportion of them yield any biological material that is then tested. Clear-up rates are much higher when DNA is found at a crime scene, so should we not be putting resources into that end of things, rather than into collecting individuals&#146; samples?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="80611-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08061189000175">One argument often used to justify the keeping of DNA is that it will help to solve cold cases, but that is fallacious. When someone is arrested and their DNA is taken, that should be tested against unidentified crime scene DNA, as is done. That will identify whether they have committed any unsolved crimes, and that is fine, but if they have not, holding their DNA after that point is irrelevant. In addition, the massive cost of holding the samples is borne by police forces. I am sure that I am not alone in thinking that the money might be better spent on front-line policing, to ensure that fewer crimes are committed and our communities are kept safe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="80611-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08061189000176">Following the European case, the Government may have to change their policy anyway, but I would like to propose a solution. Some countries, such as Scotland, France and Canada, have legislated against retaining DNA samples from those who are acquitted. I believe we should follow their lead, and remove innocent people&#146;s DNA from the database. Samples and profiles should be destroyed if the individual is not convicted or cautioned, although there should be an exception for those accused of a violent or sexual offence. Their samples should be kept&#151;not indefinitely, but for a specified time. In addition, all children under 16, unless guilty of a violent or sexual offence, should have their DNA removed from the database. If we treat them like criminals at such an early age, they may well go on to fulfil our expectations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="80611-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08061189000177">We are talking about a huge number of people&#151;1 million of them&#151;whose deeply private information is being held by the Government when they have not been found to have done any wrong. That goes against fundamental British principles, as well as being a massive drain on public resources for little gain, and this Bill would rectify that injustice.</p>

A detainee will need to be brought before the court after 48 hours of detention and then at least every seven days after that.

 We would bring forward the order that requires a parliamentary debate at times&#151;I believe that they would be wholly exceptional times&#151;when there was a grave and exceptional terrorist threat and it had become clear to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the chief constable that the barrier of 28 days was likely to be met before they finished an investigation. As I have said on many occasions, I believe that that would be wholly exceptional, but when we need the power, it will be extremely important that it is in place.</p>

That is why the legislation ensures that there can be no extension of pre-charge detention until and unless the evidence supports it&#151;until there is a &#147;grave exceptional terrorist threat&#148; that might require a longer investigation time.</p>

 No. Some have said that we should use the Civil Contingencies Act if we want to detain suspects beyond the current limit. We do not believe that the Civil Contingencies Act, which is designed to deal with events such as floods and pandemics, could legally be used for the purposes of criminal detention, and we certainly need to ask whether the use of that legislation, which would effectively mean the declaration of an emergency, would give a propaganda victory to terrorists; that is the point that the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) made. Incidentally, the use of that Act would also mean that people could be held in detention not for up to 42 days, but potentially for up to 58 days. That is the basis of my contention that that would be a more draconian approach to dealing with the challenge than the approach that the Government have taken.</p>

 I am grateful to the Home Secretary for giving way; she has been very generous. Will she bear in mind the fact that when the Director of Public Prosecutions gave evidence to the Home Affairs Committee he made the point that if someone was held for 24 or 25 days without at least being charged on reasonable suspicion, it would make the prosecution unsuccessful in many instances? Is that not a factor in deciding whether to go beyond the 28 days? I must say that I am by no means persuaded that there is any justification for what is being proposed.</p>

 I am coming to the detail about the amendments, to show that we have been willing to go further to provide the reassurance that colleagues in all parts of the House have sought. In response to my hon. Friend, first, we are clearer in the Bill about the trigger for any use of the power. The power could be brought into force only where it is needed for investigating serious terrorist offences arising out of a grave and exceptional terrorist threat. People have asked what that means. We know that people have plotted to devastate our transport system, to blow up Bluewater shopping centre and, as I said, to use a dirty bomb. We have also seen plots to ensure multiple atrocities. We have seen plots on an international scale that would have brought death on a considerable scale to British people.</p>

Any application for an extension beyond 28 days would require the approval of the Director of Public Prosecutions.

 My right hon.

I am willing to discuss this at further length with my hon. Friend and others, and I have no doubt that it will be scrutinised in detail when the Bill arrives in the House of Lords, but our intention in proposing the definition was precisely to limit the circumstances in which it will be possible to use the power. I hope that my hon. Friend accepts that that was the intention. It was also the reason why, in a spirit of developing consensus, we looked extremely closely at the wording in the Civil Contingencies Act, and built our definition on that.

It is the scale of the threat that we face that is at the heart of the proposals that we are bringing forward and the way in which we seek to address them. If the hon.

But we cannot allow ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security that might lead us to put at risk the liberty of all in Britain to live lives free from the threat of terrorist outrage and atrocity. In opposing terrorism, we must not lose sight of our values. For me, getting the balance right between individual freedom and collective security must always be at the heart of what we do.

It is the job of Government, police and prosecutors to protect the public from terrorist attack, and thereby to defend everybody&#146;s right to life, but today it is the job of Parliament to give them the tools to do that.

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="80611-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08061189000318">The issue of how long we incarcerate those on whom we have insufficient evidence to charge with any crime has become one of the defining debates of the last decade in this country. Notably, this week marks the anniversary of the signing of Magna Carta. For almost 800 years, we have built on the right of habeas corpus, founded in that ancient document: the fundamental freedom from arbitrary detention by the state. The liberty of the person is in our blood, part of our history, part of our way of life; Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Democratic Unionists&#151;all parties. Liberty is the common strand that binds us together, and we have shed blood to protect it, both abroad and at home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="80611-0007.htm_para7"><a name="08061189000319">Today the Government ask us to sacrifice some of that liberty. The Home Secretary offers a Faustian bargain: to trade a fundamental liberty for a little extra security. Yet, as the debate has gone on, the case for 42 days has first crumbled and then collapsed. So, after months of debate, what are the basic facts? The right hon. Lady said in her speech that the Home Secretary properly takes advice from the police but that that is not enough and we need to examine the evidence that they present. I think that that is what she said, so let us do so: let us look at the evidence that was presented by the Home Secretary&#146;s own witnesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="80611-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08061189000320">Let us start with Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. In his evidence to Parliament, the commissioner said explicitly:</p>
<a name="80611-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="08061189000852"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We have never put forward a case that there is evidence of a need for an extension&#148;.<i> &#151;&#151;[Official Report, Counter-Terrorism Public Bill Committee, </i>22 April 2008; c. 11, Q3.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="80611-0007.htm_para9"><a name="08061189000321">He based his support for 42 days on &#147;a pragmatic inference&#148; based on trends in a number of plots and on those plots&#146; complexity. In support of that, he and his counter-terrorism chief initially claimed that 15 terrorist plots had been thwarted since the 7/7 bombings. It was on that basis that he presented his evidence to the Bill Committee. But then it transpired that there had been a mistake. The corrected evidence revealed the true picture, which is that between 2003 and 2005, there were nine plots, three a year, and there have been four since the beginning of 2006, two a year. So, the number of plots, far from increasing, has actually decreased over the past three years. That is a good thing, but it is not an argument for extra powers, and although we should not underestimate the threat, we should not overstate it either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="80611-0007.htm_para10"><a name="08061189000322">The second witness who the Home Secretary brought before us was Mr. Peter Clarke. He argued exactly what was argued in the debate about 90 days, and he told us how complex and technical anti-terror cases were becoming. His example of a technically challenging case was that of Dhiren Barot. There is no doubt that it was a technically challenging case, but it was a case in which charges were successfully brought within 14 days&#151;not 28 days, but 14&#151;which is hardly evidence that we need three times as long. Mr. Clarke offered the observation that in the Barot case, police officers had occasion to sleep at the office. Frankly, I should prefer that police officers sleep at the office for two weeks than risk putting innocent people in a cell for six weeks.</p>

That is the claim being made: not that we might be, but that we are up against the buffers. He based his judgment on the most complex counter-terrorism investigation in our history, Operation Overt, in respect of the alleged plot to blow 10 airliners out of the sky at Heathrow in August 2006. In that case, five people were held for 27 or 28 days. One can see why that superficial analysis leads us to the idea that we are up against the buffers, but it is only a superficial analysis. I asked Mr. Jones yesterday whether he had examined the detailed evidence in Operation Overt. He told me that he had not had the opportunity. I did look at the evidence. Three of the five suspects were held for the maximum period. More than half were innocent.</p>

I asked whether they were sufficiently concerned to put them under overt or covert surveillance? &#147;No,&#148; they said.

 The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s latter point is very important, because in some of the cases that he cites, a lesser charge could have been offered. From all parts of the House, a case has been put that in respect of post-charge questioning, there is an opportunity for the police to continue doing what today&#146;s proposal of a 14-day extension allows in the most serious cases and for the most serious charge. Is it not either muddled thinking or, at its very best, a paradox, that those who are against the extension&#151;with all the safeguards&#151;to 42 days are happy for people to be charged with a lesser offence and then to be held in prison while questioning continues?</p>

Incidentally, of the six cases that John Stevens cited as taking us to the brink&#151;they are, I think, the words that he used&#151;half were proved innocent. There is a danger intrinsic in the extension when it involves cases in which there is no apparent evidence or not sufficient evidence in that there is more of a risk of detaining people who are innocent than of detaining those who are guilty.</p>

They are implicitly held up as the illustration that, due to the complexity of investigations, 28 days is proving inadequate. Is that really what those cases show? The key question is, when was the evidence available on which the charges were based? Ministers and officials have been asked a number of times&#151;the Home Secretary has been asked a number of times&#151;to answer that question, and they have implied that the evidence was obtained very late in the 28-day period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="80611-0008.htm_para3"><a name="08061189000345">During our numerous meetings, when we were trying to reach a consensus, I asked the Home Secretary three times to show me the facts that demonstrated that evidence gathering had delayed the decision to charge in Operation Overt. But she failed to explain&#151;even in the most general terms, or on a Privy Council basis, which I would have been perfectly happy to accept&#151;what the evidence was or when it was acquired. I was forced to establish the facts myself and then to check them with the investigating team at Scotland Yard. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), the shadow Attorney-General, checked them with the Crown Prosecution Service. The facts are as follows: in neither of the two cases was the evidential basis of the charge encrypted data, evidence requiring complex forensic analysis or intelligence from overseas. In one case, it comprised telephone records, handwritten and printed literature, an unencrypted CD and a receipt, all of which were available within four days of arrest. The second case was based on witness statements, mobile phone text messages and a single unencrypted computer file, all of which were available within 12 days of arrest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="80611-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08061189000346">That does not mean that the police should be criticised&#151;far from it. They should be commended for their handling of that operation, as I have said on several occasions. Nor does it mean that the CPS acted improperly&#151;it rightly looked to gather as much evidence as possible under the rules that it is given by this House within the time frame that Parliament sets it. However, it does show that in the most complex terrorism investigation in our history, all the evidence on the only two suspects charged after 21 days was in the possession of the police within four and 12 days respectively. I suspect that that is why the Director of Public Prosecutions does not believe that the extension is at all necessary or foresee circumstances in which it will be necessary in future.</p>

She is right to stress that. A Home Secretary must take advice from all members of the law enforcement agencies, but she must check and ask questions; she must establish the facts, as we have been doing this afternoon. That is her responsibility. As the evidence in favour of extending pre-charge detention has evaporated under scrutiny, it has been replaced with growing evidence that the pre-charge detention proposals risk making us less, not more safe. The former chief inspector of constabulary has described the proposal on 42 days as a &#147;propaganda coup&#148; for al-Qaeda. They are a gift to &#147;propagandists&#148; that will drive the brainwashed to &#147;acts of martyrdom&#148;, according to one former Metropolitan police commissioner. They are a threat to local community intelligence, according to the Government&#146;s own impact assessment on the Bill. The proposal is wrong in principle and dangerous in practice.</p>

I have said that the CPS did not act recklessly. There are issues that police forces and prosecutors have to decide on in every case. If they have 20 or more suspects to deal with, a prioritisation process inevitably takes place, as we saw in the Overt case. All those charged with the most serious charge of conspiracy to murder were charged before 21 days, and the massive majority of them were charged before 14 days. It is entirely understandable that the prosecutors and the police focus on that area first. That is why I am concerned&#151;it is not an accusation but a concern&#151;that  <br>

one of the effects of this will be to leave until the end of the process the people who are innocent, or against whom there may be a suspicion although they are innocent. There is a serious danger that extending it any further will mean more innocent people being put in a cell for six weeks.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that the problem of extending the 28-day period is that it will have the opposite effect to that which the hon.

 I understand my right hon. Friend&#146;s point, although I do not agree with it, in truth. However, there is a subtle related point. The CPS will seek to obtain a so-called full code charge&#151;one with a 51 per cent. plus chance of conviction&#151;because that is its guidance. If it is unable to obtain it, it may well want to use all the time available to try to do so instead of using the lower so-called threshold charge. The two people I mentioned were charged under the threshold charge arrangements. It is entirely possible&#151;I do not know; it is pure surmise&#151;that there was an attempt to obtain a full code charge. That is entirely legitimate and entirely the proper way for the CPS to act. The situation is not its fault, but our fault, because it arises directly out of the rules system that we created for it.</p>

 My right hon. Friend referred to people being released right up against the buffers, as it were. The Government are saying that the nightmare scenario is that someone would be released after 28 days and then go on to commit some heinous offence. They are also saying that the numbers of people involved in the exercise of 42 days&#146; detention would be very small and in circumstances of grave threat. Surely it is hard to imagine any circumstances where if someone had to be released after 28 days, they would not be under the most intense surveillance thereafter. It is hard to see how even if they were released under those circumstances, they could then precipitate an atrocity on the scale that the Government anticipate.</p>

This is where the Home Secretary differs from me in wanting the scope to act. It is entirely possible that the security agencies and the police could put a small number of people under close surveillance&#151;through a control order, I suppose, if one believes that they work. It could be overt surveillance&#151;there is no reason why a police car could not be put outside a house&#151;or covert surveillance. All those things are possible.</p>

Implicit in some of the arguments made is that the people in question are a threat or danger to the public. The image conjured up is one of some sort of dangerous terrorist who will go out to bomb the nearest station or plane. Indeed, the Home Secretary implied that when she spoke of 28 days&#146; detention putting the public at risk.</p>

They were not the ones charged with conspiracy to murder. In fact, in the two cases that we are talking about, they were subsequently released on bail. If they were released on bail, the courts clearly did not think that they posed an ongoing threat to the public. I am afraid that that argument falls in tatters, too.</p>

 Can I gently suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that there is a big contradiction at the heart of his position? On the one hand, he cloaks himself in the principles of ancient civil liberties, going back to Magna Carta and so on, but on the other, he goes on to advocate alternative devices to get round those very civil liberties. For example, he advocates the use of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, post-charge questioning and intercept evidence, and he advocates the charging of someone with a lesser offence and holding them while a potentially greater offence is investigated. That is a contradiction in his position. Is it principled or is it practical?</p>

<p><a name="st_o215"><a name="08061189000366"><a name="80611-0008.htm_spnew26"><a name="08061189001144"><b>David Davis:</b>
 Earlier, I did not pull up the former Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), when he attributed that view to me. It is not my view, and has never been my view. However, let us take one of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s cases of an incursion on our civil liberties. He says that the use of intercept evidence in court is such an incursion. No, the incursion on our civil liberties occurs when the intercept is made. That is why there are warrant arrangements and controls on intercepts. Not using such evidence in court has nothing to do with civil liberties&#151;it is to do with a judicial decision and an intelligence decision. He should have got his case a bit straighter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="80611-0008.htm_para8"><a name="08061189000367">Some weeks ago, the Government were clearly at risk of losing this aspect of the Bill, so they conjured up a series of so-called safeguards. Interestingly, given what was just said to me, they are an attempt to import&#151;almost in the words of the Home Secretary&#151;a diluted version of the Civil Contingencies Act into the Bill. Again, this comes as something of a surprise. The House will recall that Ministers spurned the Civil Contingencies Act model for months and said that it was inappropriate, fundamentally flawed and a draconian response. I begin to wonder who wrote the Act&#151;I thought that it was this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="80611-0008.htm_para9"><a name="08061189000368">If the Civil Contingencies Act is draconian, it is hard to understand why, in her proposals, the Home Secretary&#146;s deliberately diluted the safeguards that are supposedly based on the Act. The Home Secretary says that the 42-day power of detention could be invoked only if there were a grave, exceptional terrorist threat. The point was made by the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) earlier that that is not a condition for invoking an extension beyond 28 days; it is merely a notification requirement. Even then the notification requirement will not refer to that, but to an operational necessity. It is merely a notification requirement, entirely irrelevant to the unfettered discretion that the Home Secretary will retain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80611-0008.htm_para11"><a name="08061189000370">I am being charitable on this. Those definitions are so broad&#151;a massive expansion of the criteria in the Civil Contingencies Act&#151;that virtually any terrorist plot would satisfy them. The Dhiren Barot plot in 2004 to set off a dirty bomb would easily meet those conditions, but the charging was concluded in 14 days. The Operation Crevice fertiliser bomb plot in 2004 would also meet the definition, but all the charges were brought within 14 days. The 21/7 attacks would certainly qualify, but again all the charges were brought within 14 days. The definition of grave, exceptional threat is not only irrelevant to the power of the Home Secretary to order 42 days&#146; detention, it simply does not matter at all.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman has given a set of examples, but I am not sure that they are germane to his original question. I put this question to him: if he does not think that the definitions in the Bill constitute an adequate definition of a grave and serious threat, what criteria would he present to the House?</p>

<p><a name="st_o217"><a name="08061189000372"><a name="80611-0008.htm_spnew28"><a name="08061189001146"><b>David Davis:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman raises an important point, and I will try to give him the most serious answer I can&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> &#151;</i>the one that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question deserves, namely, yes. There are two categories of circumstance with regard to a threat to the state that the Government might face. One is a situation that obviously worries the Home Secretary, where perhaps 25 people are arrested and we are left with one, two or three at the end for whom we do not quite have enough evidence. We can deal with that, as was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis), by a variety of other mechanisms, including&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Surveillance, I say to the security Minister&#151;I think that is who he is. It certainly can be dealt with that way, but it can also be dealt with by the threshold test for prosecution&#151;the reasonable suspicion test.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="80611-0008.htm_para12"><a name="08061189000373">The other circumstance is where there are a vast number of attacks on the state at the same time. The security Minister&#151;the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing&#151;referred to it as the three 9/11s test. Under those circumstances, we would be overwhelmed, and we would need a definition of a state of emergency. This is what the Government object to. The matter is important because full judicial review can apply a test as to whether a state of emergency applies, in a way we cannot as individuals discussing the matter in the House of Commons. That is the point of distinction, which is why we offered the Home Secretary very early on in the process a modification to get &#147;CCA plus&#148;, as it was known in the jargon at the time, if she wanted it. We were willing to do that.</p>

It follows, therefore, that one trigger is already present, and if the Government seek to activate the procedure, the only thing that the House of Commons can profitably discuss is whether the police have in detention persons whom it is necessary to hold for a period longer than 28 days.

Friend the now Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills&#151;some of the members who contributed to the 2006 report are still serving on the Committee&#151;that the current limit of 28 days might prove inadequate in the future. Both the Home Secretary and, more particularly, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner told us that they foresaw circumstances in which an extension would be necessary. The right hon.

I pay tribute to Shami Chakrabarti and Liberty for the way in which they have engaged not just with the Select Committee, but with hon. Members and the Government. It is common knowledge that Liberty met the Home Secretary, the Prime Minister and others to discuss the legislation. It is right to engage with organisations such as Liberty, which has a wealth of knowledge and experience that can be put to great use. We felt that the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 was not the right vehicle, however, because we did not believe that the best way to deal with a situation of this kind was to have a state of emergency.

Of course they should. That is the nature of government. How dreadful it would be if the Government decided on a particular course of action and then never consulted anybody else. I hope that Home Secretary will not mind my having a slight dig at her&#151;I am, after all, supporting her tonight: if only the Government had done the same thing over police pay, there would have been a different scenario. That aside, this engagement is extraordinarily important and has helped to bring a better proposal before the House; it has certainly moved a long way since the original proposals were made in July last year.</p>

Members for Newark (Patrick Mercer), for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies), for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) and for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)&#151;and a Liberal Democrat, the hon.

 The right hon. Gentleman does an excellent job of chairing the Committee and of encouraging consensus there, which is very important for Select Committees. Does he agree, however, that great concern was expressed by some members of the Committee about 42 days and that, in the end, the report was almost unanimously signed off because we wanted to make it clear that if there were to be an extension beyond 42 days, safeguards had to be in place. That did not necessarily imply full support for an extension beyond that period.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right; of course there was controversy about this issue in the Committee, as there is in the House more widely. The fact remains that by 11 votes to one, the Committee decided that there was a possibility of exceptional circumstances arising in the future and we set out carefully the wording, referring to &#147;grave&#148; and &#147;exceptional&#148; circumstances in which an extension might be sought. The only member of the Committee to vote against was my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick), for whom I have the highest regard. He has been absolutely consistent on this matter from the time that he put forward the 28-day rule. I have huge respect for him and I recall his saying to the Committee that he felt that this was opening a window that we would, in his words, regret. He feared that the Government would use the provision in future to claim that exceptional circumstances demanded a further extension.</p>

about this matter? It has come to pass in a very few weeks that the Government want 42 days, and I suspect that in a couple of years&#146; time, another Home Secretary will want even more. That is the nature of proposals that endlessly give politicians more powers over the process of detention.</p>

 I have known my hon. Friend for many years. He was the first Member to support me when I was selected to stand in Leicester, East, so I have a high regard for him and for the way in which he defends the civil liberties of his constituents, but he is wrong. That is not what is being proposed today, and I am glad to be able to clarify that for him. We have made it very clear that this is not a permanent extension and I would not vote for a permanent extension beyond 28 days&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>No, I would not. This is a specific extension on an emergency basis. The Select Committee said in 2006, before I was even a member of it, that there would be circumstances in the future in which the period should be extended. In December, the Committee, which I now chair, decided by 11 votes to one that there would be grave and exceptional circumstances, and the Government have merely adopted our language.</p>

 I am most grateful to the right hon. Gentleman.

However, does he agree that if we look at new clause 20, we find that the definition of a &#147;grave exceptional terrorist threat&#148; is extremely wide&#151;much wider than that of a state of emergency? Does he also agree that the bizarre aspect of the Government&#146;s proposals is that the basis will not be a grave exceptional terrorist threat, which Parliament will be asked to decide on in any case, as we will be asked to vote on an order that is simply a report on an operational need for a further extension of the maximum period of detention?

Of course, if we could all have our lives again, it would be much better if the Civil Contingencies Act had been amended so that these proposals were not brought forward, but we are not there at the moment, and I am satisfied that Government&#146;s changes will deal with that situation&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

It is clearly important for us to bring communities with us; we cannot win the war on terrorism unless we do that. Only last week, the Home Secretary announced the provision of &#163;12.5 million that she hopes will be spent on preventive work in the community&#151;</p>

 I think that the money will be of great benefit to the people of Islington and Hackney, and to those all over the country, as they seek to work and engage with the Government on this issue. I do not think it right for us to feel that we cannot carry communities with us, although I am keen to ensure that the resources that the Government are allocating are allocated fairly and do the job that they were intended to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="80611-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08061189000476">Finally, let me say something about references to the director general of MI5 and the police. I have not heard the director general of MI5 say&#151;to me or to the Committee&#151;that he wants the period to be extended from 28 days to 42, and the Government are not maintaining that he has said it to them, because that is not his job. The job of the director general of MI5 is to advise the Government about the threat. In his speech, which was presumably on the record&#151;if he did not want it to be reported, he should not have made it to the Society of Editors&#151;the director general, Jonathan Evans, was very clear indeed. Some of the facts have already been given by the Home Secretary. At least 2,000 individuals who are believed to be a direct threat to the safety of our citizens are currently in the United Kingdom, there have been 20 known plots, and 200 suspect groups are being monitored. There have been 15 attempted terrorist attacks in Britain. It is a matter of record, because it is in our report, that the Committee met the director general of MI5. We were not prepared, quite rightly, to discuss what he said to us, but he has said publicly that those threats exist, and are real and growing. That is the advice that he can give.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="80611-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08061189000477">In their evidence, the police&#151;Sir Ian Blair, Peter Clarke and others&#151;made it clear to us that they wanted the current period to be extended. I think that Sir Ian Blair talked about &#147;up to 60 days&#148;. The police have made the case, and it is not for the security services to do so; nor is it for the Director of Public Prosecutions to do so. I have enormous respect for Ken Macdonald, and we readily agreed that he should appear before the Committee because he had not given evidence for its 2006 report. He made it clear that he did not consider the current period sufficient, but he also said that it was not up to him to decide whether it should be extended. That judgment can be made only by Parliament, and he will deal with whatever Parliament decides.</p>

 I am pleased to follow the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz). In my speech, I shall first explain why an extension of detention without charge matters to ordinary people and their freedoms, then I shall examine the weakness of the Government&#146;s case for such an extension and the feeble parliamentary safeguards offered by Ministers, and finally I shall argue that such excessive powers may be seen as illegitimate in substantial sections of our nation, and may act as a recruiting sergeant for the extremists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="80611-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08061189000486">Let me begin by trying to explain why the powers of executive detention contained in the Bill and the amendments are so serious. They are not powers that apply just to other people; they are powers that could apply to any one of us here today. We could be arrested on our way home, in a case of mistaken identity, and locked up&#151;if the Government have their way&#151;not for one day or seven days, but for six weeks. What would a person&#146;s employer think? What would their family think? Surely, they might say, the police could not really detain someone without some pretty clear evidence, using powers under a terrorism Act. As every street gossip will tell you, there is no smoke without fire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="80611-0010.htm_para15"><a name="08061189000487">We know, however, that of the six people who have come close to being detained for close to the existing limit of 28 days, half have been released without charge or any subsequent proceedings. Indeed, as was pointed out by the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), who is no longer in the Chamber, it is inevitable that if these powers go on to the statute book they will be used for lower-priority cases, because the easier cases will have been dealt with first. The number of innocent people who are detained under the new powers is therefore likely to be particularly high.</p>

 The point, surely, is that if the Home Secretary had evidence that the most serious offences had been committed, there would be no need to extend the period without charge, because she would be able to go ahead and charge the people. My fundamental point stands: on the basis of the existing track record, this will affect people who may well be found to be entirely innocent. We know that three of those six people spent a month of their lives not even knowing what offence they had been accused of committing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="80611-0011.htm_para0"><a name="08061189000490">We could all name cases in which great injustices have already been perpetrated. One such case is that of the Algerian pilot Lotfi Raissi; an even more tragic case is that of the young Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes. Most recently, there is the case of the students who were arrested for having terrorist materials, when they were writing a research report on Islamic extremism. The police do a commendable job in difficult circumstances, but they are human and therefore fallible. That is why we have a system of justice, and why checks and balances are crucial. It is also why we should not lightly concede yet another rise in the period of detention without charge.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that holding people for six weeks when they do not know what they are being held for is in itself coercive? From the big miscarriages of justice in the 1980s, we know what innocent people will sign even when they have been held for far less than six weeks.</p>

The Home Secretary argues that the Government need to extend the period of detention for terrorist suspects from 28 to 42 days because of the increased complexity of terror cases, citing the recent increase in the number of computer files and comparing the alleged airline bombing case in 2006 with the Dhiren Barot case of 2004.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="80611-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08061189000494">However, that argument rebounds on the Government in a very simple way.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and she is of course absolutely right, but I want to make another point. It has been said that it might be necessary to read material equivalent to one third of the contents of the US Library of Congress within the proposed legal limit of 42 days.

the Government do not seem to take the problem too seriously: they legislated in 2000 to make it an offence to withhold data encryption keys, but that offence did not come into force until 2007. So much for the sense of urgency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="80611-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08061189000498">We have also heard that an inability to sift through data, whether encrypted or not, was not the cause even in those few cases that went close to the 28-day limit. In fact, the essential data issues were sorted out relatively quickly, as the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) showed very effectively. Liberty has pointed out that in two of the three cases in which people were subsequently charged, the evidence relied on to bring those charges was obtained within not 27 days, or 26 days, but within four and 12 days, respectively.</p>

 I am grateful for that intervention, but I specifically did not make a comparison with inquisitorial systems such as the French one. If the hon. Lady had been listening to me, she would have heard me say that Canada retains a traditional 24-hour period of detention without charge. In the US, the period is two days. Australia has extended the period to 12 days, in part because of the special cooling-off periods between interrogations. There are no provisions in the Bill to put in place the equivalent cooling-off periods that might justify an extension of detention along the lines introduced in Australia.</p>

That is significant precisely because, if it is possible to secure a 92 per cent. conviction rate in cases brought after terrorist events have happened, as has been the case over the past two years, Sir Ken has the flexibility to achieve even more success should he decide to bring charges before a terrorist event occurs.</p>

The sad truth is that Ministers are using this simple number as a proxy to persuade the public that the Government are tough on terror.

 I wanted to ask the Home Secretary this earlier. Have we seen one shred of evidence that the figure of 42 days&#151;or any other number above 28 days&#151;has been justified? The figure appears to have been plucked out of the air speculatively to reassure people, yet it has not one shred of evidence to support it.</p>

 The hon. Lady makes her point, and I shall not demur from it. We are told that the reserve power is needed for a &#147;grave, exceptional terrorist threat&#148;. On 23 January, in the <i> Daily Mirror</i>, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing asked us to imagine two or three 9/11s. On the &#147;Today&#148; programme on 2 June he said that there was a</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08061189000555">He also mentioned the &#147;nightmare&#148; and the &#147;doomsday scenario&#148;. If that is so, the powers are already in place. I am talking about the power to derogate from article 5&#151;the right to liberty&#151;and to disapply a fundamental right that goes back to the Magna Carta of 1215.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08061189000556">My amendment (a) provides a system to enable that derogation to take place. If there is a public emergency threatening the life of the nation, article 15 permits derogation from&#151;that is, disapplication of&#151;the right to liberty. A co-ordinated, large-scale attack on the nation&#146;s political, military and financial institutions, such as 9/11 in the US, would meet that test, never mind two or three 9/11s at the same time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08061189000557">Under derogation, the Government are entitled to take the measures that are strictly required for the exigencies of the situation. Derogation is not a new solution. The Belmarsh detainees were held under a derogation power, and the case failed on discrimination grounds. The control order powers in the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 provided for derogating control orders, but they have not been used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08061189000558">My amendment sets out a process to enable the Secretary of State to make a designated derogation order in anticipation of any future need of such a terrorist attack. It incorporates safeguards such as judicial review and parliamentary approval, and this proposal would give the Government everything that they profess to need&#151;an emergency reserve power for the truly exceptional cases, with appropriate safeguards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08061189000559">Why will not the Government accept my amendment? As has begun to emerge, the Government want the reserve power not for the extreme cases, but for far less than their public statements suggest. They want that power not for two 9/11s or for a substantial threat against the nation. The letter from the Minister to the Human Rights Committee on 6 June states:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08061189000560">The July 2005 bombings were dealt with under the 14-day regime. The shopping centre example would not be a multiple plot. Atrocities overseas may be nothing to do with us. Today we had another letter from the Home Secretary that said that the attempted airline plot would have been a case in point, but that was dealt with under the 28-day procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08061189000561">The implication from the briefing sent to the parliamentary Labour party is that all the cases listed, which were dealt with under 14 or 28 days, would in future be subject to the 42-day maximum. The power is not meant for exceptional cases but for the sort of cases that have been dealt with adequately so far under existing powers.</p>

<p><a name="st_o339"><a name="08061189000562"><a name="80611-0012.htm_spnew7"><a name="08061189001268"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman makes a case exclusively based on the application of the European convention on human rights and the Human Rights Act 1998, and the derogation in article 5. Why does he insist on that route, rather than that of habeas corpus, under which the court would have the right to make a proper inquiry if given that power in statute by this House?</p>

<p><a name="st_o340"><a name="08061189000563"><a name="80611-0012.htm_spnew8"><a name="08061189001269"><b>Mr. Dismore:</b>
 First, I will come on to habeas corpus, as I promised the hon. Gentleman earlier. Secondly, we are subscribers to the European convention on human rights&#151;and rightly so&#151;and I propose a way in which we can lawfully do what the Government wish us to do in cases of major emergency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08061189000564">We have now had experience of the 28-day limit. I remind the House that 28 days was to be an exception, with the norm being 14 days and the issue subject to annual review. The DPP tells us that he has managed reasonably comfortably. Sue Hemming, the chief prosecutor, says that 28 days has proved to be &#147;sufficient&#148;. We have already heard the figures for the alleged airline plot. Six were held beyond 14 days, with two charged just before 28 days and three released just before. The latter were not re-arrested or subject to control orders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08061189000565">The 28-day limit has been used only in two other cases. Up to now we have had no quantitative analysis of those cases, although the Opposition Front-Bench team produced some yesterday, which showed that there was little questioning of the suspects during that period. We have heard today that in fact the evidence to support a threshold charge was probably in place by 14 days for the two who were held up to the 28-day limit. However, until we receive the detail, we cannot be certain that that was the case. We must also take into account the possible urgency of the investigation. If we had had a 42-day limit, would those three people have been held for that time in the hope that some evidence might turn up, rather than for 28 days?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08061189000566">The judicial safeguards proposed in the Bill are effectively the same as those for 28 days, save that the DPP and the chief constable have to authorise the application for the extension. The existing process is not fully judicial in accordance with article 5. The Government say that it involves a proper judicial hearing, but the case of Garcia Alva <i> v.</i> Germany in the European Court of Human Rights makes it clear that the criteria that the Government operate do not match those that the court expects.</p>

of detention, the more stringent the procedural safeguards need to be. The Government say that there has been no challenge to the extension process in court on the grounds of incompatibility, but there was: the case of Naseel Hussain, which was one of the first 28-day cases. It failed on a Catch-22: the High Court said that it could not review the decision of the High Court judge to extend the period of detention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08061189000568">That ruling would also, in effect, exclude habeas corpus. That court case decided that the warrant of further detention was a judicial hearing for the purposes of article 5.4. If that is so, that is the judicial hearing that would be required by habeas corpus, so any application for habeas corpus would be struck out by the court as an abuse of process. New clause 35 is very important because it would overcome that particular problem.</p>

 That still does not resolve the problem of why the hon. Gentleman prefers to go down the route of the European convention on human rights and judicial review, when habeas corpus would be available.</p>

 I support the hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause and I see it as a matter not of either/or, but of both.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para21"><a name="08061189000571">We hear that there will be an ex gratia compensation scheme. We can infer therefore that the Government accept that the provisions do not comply with article 5, because article 5.5 provides for compensation for someone held in breach of article 5. As the compensation scheme is to be confined solely to cases under these arrangements, and not applied generally to people held on charge and released, one can only assume that that is the case. We must also consider the impact that that would have on other suspects&#151;for example, those who may have been held on bail for a long time and then acquitted. They will say, &#147;Well, the Muslims are getting money, why aren&#146;t we?&#148; That could have an impact on community relations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para22"><a name="08061189000572">New clause 1, which I tabled, suggests improvements to the judicial process including entitlement to judicial process; a statement of the basis for arrest; the gist of the material forming the grounds for suspicion to be given to the suspect; a special advocate for the closed part of the hearing; and entitlement for the judge to look at whether there are reasonable grounds for the belief that the suspect is involved in terrorism and, in other words, to check whether the arrest was justified in the first place. At the moment, judges are entitled only to consider whether the investigation was necessary and has been conducted diligently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para23"><a name="08061189000573">New clause 37 would provide for judicial review of the Home Secretary&#146;s decision, if the existing arrangements stay in place, on whether there is a grave threat, whether a reserve power is needed and whether it is needed urgently. I am not sure whether the Government agree that those should be subject to judicial review; I suspect not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para24"><a name="08061189000574">New clause 36 would provide that similar provisions to those in the Civil Contingencies Act should apply to the Human Rights Act and the emergency regulations, so that the courts could intervene and quash them if they were considered to be unlawful. I think that the Government agree with the point and it would be appropriate to include it in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para25"><a name="08061189000575">On the question of parliamentary safeguards, the independent legal advice to the Home Secretary as to whether the reserve power is needed would ask the same questions as a court, essentially considering whether an individual&#146;s detention would be appropriate. That will be passed on to the Select Committee Chairs, including me if I am still in office&#151;I suspect that I probably will not be, considering the way that I am going. If I were still in office, on Privy Council terms, it is not quite clear what I would be able to do with that information. I would not be able to check whether it was accurate or to get advice on it. I would not be entitled to share it with members of my Committee. I would be entitled only to read it and to think, &#147;Mm, interesting.&#148; I would not even be entitled to refer to it in a debate on extension before the House. Although the fact that it would be shared is welcome&#151;I am a prurient, nosey chap who likes to know what is going on&#151;it would not achieve a great deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80611-0012.htm_para26"><a name="08061189000576">The safeguard allowing us to have debates within seven rather than 30 days is welcome, as is the fact that Parliament would be recalled. However, the debate will be even more circumscribed than we originally thought, not just for the reasons advanced by the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) but because the questions will be the same all the way through. The DPP and police report to the Secretary of State will be in similar terms to the application that they will have to make in an individual case. Independent legal advice to the Secretary of State will again raise the same issues. The advice to Parliament would be redacted to prevent any prejudice to the trial. The same issues will arise with the Secretary of State&#146;s order as arise with individual cases, as she will have to be satisfied about them when she comes to make the order. When Parliament comes to approve the order, it will consider the same issues again. Therefore, because we cannot risk prejudicing a trial, the debate may only be very general. It will consider the sort of things that we debated in the previous cases on the back of the statement, which is hardly sufficient to justify the possible deprivation of liberty not only of the suspect in custody but of any other suspects arrested over the next 30 days. Inevitably, too, it would be a whipped vote.</p>

<p><a name="st_o343"><a name="08061189000577"><a name="80611-0012.htm_spnew11"><a name="08061189001272"><b>Mr. Grieve:</b>
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that although it is absolutely right that the order would also cover the arrest of anybody else in the following 30 days, the trigger mechanism clearly implies that it will be precipitated by one case? That is the most likely outcome. Those circumstances will make it even more difficult to debate the issues surrounding the making of the order in this House, because the generality probably will not be there. The debate will be entirely dependent on the report, which will be made to the Secretary of State in the first place, on the operational need for an extension, relating probably to individuals.</p>

 The hon. and learned Gentleman is correct. The same argument will continue in the debate on the reviewer&#146;s report six months later. Of course, we do not know when that will happen, because if the period of extension is repeated&#151;if it is set for 30 days, then for another 30 days, then for another 30&#151;will that six-month review take place after the expiry of the first 30 days or of the subsequent 30-day periods?

 The hon. Gentleman is making a very powerful case. Does he accept that the point made by the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) is strengthened if one looks at the detail of what the Government are proposing in new clause 22? New clause 22(5) states that the report on which the whole thing is based</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80611-0013.htm_para0"><a name="08061189000580">That means that there will have to be an individual case. If there is no individual case, there cannot be an extension.</p>

That is an improvement on what we had originally, but it can be renewed back to back indefinitely by the repetition of the same process. It could go on to 30, 60, 90 or 120 days. Who knows?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80611-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08061189000583">There are alternatives. The Joint Committee on Human Rights first proposed a package of alternatives in 2006 that offers a coherent, human rights-compliant alternative. For the big emergency cases&#151;the 9/11s&#151;we have the derogation process. For all the others, there are alternatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80611-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08061189000584">The most important alternative is threshold charging. Many Members, I suspect, do not understand what threshold charging involves. It means that the individual is charged on the basis of reasonable suspicion of the commission of the offence based on admissible evidence, as opposed to arrest, which can be based on inadmissible evidence. It is predicated on how the investigation is anticipated to proceed. We can compare that test with the normal full code test of &#147;more likely than not&#148;. Some 50 per cent. of terror cases so far have been charged on that basis. It has proved very effective in practice, with a conviction rate of more than 90 per cent. In my view, it is important that that process is made statutory with appropriate safeguards, and my new clause 2 will do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="80611-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08061189000585">Incidentally, if we use the threshold test as our international comparator rather than the full code test, we see that the threshold test in some of the other common law countries, such as America and some of the continental countries, is not that dissimilar from some of the questions that investigatory magistrates have to pose. Both sides of the debate have probably overstated their case for and against international comparators, but if the threshold test is used, the position is perhaps a little clearer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80611-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08061189000586">The second alternative is the new offence of acts preparatory to terrorism. It is a broad offence, and when charged on the threshold basis and in combination with that threshold test it provides a broad and easy process for the prosecution service to follow. As we have heard, two of the alleged airline plotters were charged within 28 days with acts preparatory to terrorism on the threshold test. If, within 28 days, a reasonable suspicion cannot be established on the threshold basis that the accused has committed an act preparatory to terrorism&#151;a very broad offence&#151;the chances of our getting them for anything are probably negligible.</p>

 I am listening with great interest to my hon. Friend. Given the research he has done, can he explain to me and the House what is wrong with a holding charge? A holding charge is used in criminal jurisprudence in every other aspect of crime, so why should it not be entirely available in terrorism cases?</p>

Alternative No. 4 is my new clause 3, which proposes police bail with conditions similar to control orders for people on the fringe of plots, such as the inciters and funders&#151;the sort of people we were talking about earlier. They could be closed down entirely while their computers were analysed. They could be prevented from communicating and from going where they want to go.

Alternative No. 6 is more specialisation in the CPS, as is already happening. Alternative No. 7 would be more active case management by judges. Why are judges not tougher on some of the unjustified delaying tactics and obstruction deployed by defence teams? Alternative No. 8 involves a suggestion put to us by the Director of Public Prosecutions and relates to incentives for those on the periphery to give evidence&#151;for example, lower sentences and witness protection, although obviously with appropriate safeguards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80611-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08061189000593">The Government response to that package is that they do not look at it as a package. They accept that such proposals would reduce pressure to go beyond 28 days, but say that they would not entirely eliminate the risk of running out of time. However, for that matter, 42 days or 90 days would not entirely eliminate that risk. As the DPP said to the Public Bill Committee, it is always possible to posit hypothetical scenarios; the question is whether they are &#147;remotely likely&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80611-0013.htm_para9"><a name="08061189000594">When the Joint Committee made its recommendation about putting threshold charging on a statutory basis, the Government response, in terms of the impact on affected communities, was:</p>

It turns out that there was not any such problem in either of those cases, which are the two largest cases that the Security Service and the police have ever undertaken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="80611-0013.htm_para15"><a name="08061189000603">One of the difficulties today has been that the Prime Minister said a few hours ago in Question Time that it was the Security Service that wanted the measures introduced; his words were very clear. The Home Secretary said exactly the same in her opening remarks today. I have known that that was not the case for some time, but until yesterday I felt myself unable to say why I knew that. Yesterday, on the Security Service website, Jonathan Evans, the director general of the Security Service, made it absolutely clear that that is the Security Service&#146;s position, saying:</p>

My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), the shadow Attorney-General, suggested&#151;inadvertently, I think&#151;that the Prime Minister misled the House. I do not say that, but the Prime Minister was wrong to say that the Security Service had wanted an increase in the time, and I am sorry to say that the Home Secretary was wrong to say exactly the same thing a couple of hours ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="80611-0013.htm_para18"><a name="08061189000606">I do not believe that the case has been made. I do not have a problem with the principle of detaining someone for longer if there is cause for it. Neither do I object in principle to someone saying, &#147;We do not want to do it when or if there is a major terrorist incident.&#148; I am not happy about the Executive taking more powers for themselves, no matter what safeguards they write into a Bill. I am not making a party point; I would say exactly the same if our party was in government. The Government may want to plan ahead, but God forbid there should be an incident in which all the measures that we are discussing are necessary. This is the time to say, &#147;The Executive have quite enough power. We must turn to the judiciary to decide the matter.&#148;</p>

I say that because I believe that the British public trust the judiciary. I am sorry to say that they do not trust an overweening Executive. Again, that is not a party point. I am afraid that when Governments say, &#147;This has to happen, otherwise something dreadful will take place,&#148; the public view it rather cynically. If a High Court judge were to say the same thing, that would be largely acceptable to the British people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80611-0013.htm_para25"><a name="08061189000624">The evidence spanned that from the secretary of the Coroners Society, the Home Office terrorism specialist, Lord Carlile, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, the Association of Chief Police Officers, Justice and Liberty. A vast range of excellent evidence was presented and carefully scrutinised by the Committee. We wanted to understand all opinions on terrorism, whether about intercept, pre-charge detention or reserve powers, so that we could ensure that we carefully walked the line that we have to walk between supporting and determinedly enabling individual civil liberties, while at the same time delivering a secure society for everyone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80611-0013.htm_para26"><a name="08061189000625">I probably found the evidence of ACPO, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner and Lord Carlile to be the most convincing, but all of it was very valuable. The evidence of ACPO and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, which was added to by a letter that I understand was placed in the Library, outlined the extreme and exceptional nature of potential and actual terrorist activity. Clearly, the argument made by both was to say: put on the shelf a power that we could need. We have taken cases to 27 and a half days&#151;only two, that is right; maybe six&#151;but when that power of detention is required, it should be to hand.

evidence or information that I have now. I have seriously taken time to garner the information that is available, and perhaps I should have done so previously, but the evidence presented by ACPO was clear. In the interval between November 2006 and 2007, it saw a rise in the number of people identified as causing concern, possibly involved in terrorist activity, from 1,600 to 2,000. During the same period, we have had 15 terrorist attempts. I had not previously understood the quantity and capabilities of the terrorist group, but I think I understand them better now, and I hope that the House will respect this information.</p>

We are looking at a situation in which many more people are potentially highly problematic to us. Added to that was the complexity of the situation. We have all spoken about the global nature of terrorism and its investigation and about an informal network that is working within communities. In addition, there is the use of mobile phones, internet communications and the rest, which makes the issue very complex.</p>

Was it true, for example, that we really would become the most anti-libertarian country in the world if we did so? Again, I shall use Lord Carlile as my textbook, but there were others whom I could have used. He said no, that each and every legal system is different, and that comparisons are very difficult to make. In the USA, the detention period is not two days at all.

checked, including the statement that we are not the most anti-libertarian country at all. We compare very favourably with others. The other statement that I would make quite determinedly is that many of the countries that we compare ourselves with, such as Canada or Australia, most certainly have not faced the hideousness of 15 very serious terrorist attempts, and most certainly have not seen 52 of their citizens die and 800 be seriously affected as a result of terrorism.

It is a clear, well-executed book, called &#147;Celsius 7/7&#148; by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove).

 I rise to support Government amendments Nos. 4 and 5, which seek to delete the 42-day requirement from the Bill. Amnesty International published a report entitled &#147;2007: The State of the World&#146;s Human Rights&#148;, in which Amnesty&#146;s general secretary, Irene Khan, says that fear of immigrants, fear of crime and fear of terrorism are used by states to suppress basic human rights. She develops that argument by saying that giving one group of people security at the expense of other people&#146;s rights is bound to fail, and that many anti-terrorist measures and laws have failed because they do not give that point enough consideration. They have</p>
<a name="80611-0014.htm_brev4"><a name="08061189000879"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;done little to reduce the threat of violence...and much to damage human rights and the rule of law&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80611-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08061189000657">I regret to say that that those words are a reflection of what has been happening under this Government in this Parliament for some years now. Although the Government have decided that Ministers will no longer use the term &#147;the war against terrorism&#148;, the need remains to ensure that we continue to feel under threat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="80611-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08061189000658">We must remember that each and every one of us has a right to freedom, and yet the Government are prepared to weaken it&#151;a task that is far easier against the background of terrorist and violent threats. Everyone knows that Government policies&#151;whichever Government they might be&#151;tend to be created in the tabloid press, and it is difficult to have a meaningful discussion on security and penal policy without sinking deeply into the quagmire of superficial politics.</p>

No one here would demur from the view that one of the prime duties of any Government is to ensure the security of their citizens. However, that raises the question of the balance to be struck between that obligation and the rights of the state. That balance is key to this whole debate.

our debate. However, many people believe that the scales have tipped far too heavily towards the state&#146;s interests, at the expense of guaranteed rights that we have recognised for a century and more&#151;rights and freedoms that meant that we stood out as an example of a civilised system that provided for the interests of the individual, alongside the interests of the society or state. That used to be the situation, at any rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80611-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08061189000662">We saw that keeping individuals under lock and key without going to court was inflammatory in Ireland and that it led to an intensification of the problems there in the 1970s and 1980s. I am not saying that the proposal for 42 days equates to internment, but clearly the same tensions come into play, negating rights that were guaranteed and increasing the number of those who turn to violence. It appears that the Government have simply not learnt the lessons of history. I regret to say that that failure could be very expensive, although I hope that I am wrong about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80611-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08061189000663">To be fair, the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing has attempted to create a consensus on the issue over the past few months, and his office has been open to Opposition Members. The Bill contains some things that are helpful and acceptable, and they will be supported alongside certain safeguards. However, I am afraid that those on both sides of the Public Bill Committee came to the conclusion that there were misgivings about the Bill and about the mistakes made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80611-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08061189000664">The Minister of State did his best to build a consensus, so it is surprising to think that a consensus had been built up over the past two years on the 28-day limit. Many of us who were vehemently opposed to 90 days were eventually persuaded, pragmatically, to fall in line with 28 days. Now, a mere two years later, that consensus has sadly disappeared. One must ask whether there is now a compelling and urgent reason to revisit that decision&#151;a decision of the whole House that was arrived at by consensus. Sadly, I do not think that such a case has been made at all, and I say that with respect to the Minister of State and the Home Secretary. In all the discussions that we have had in the past seven or eight months, we have not seen any evidence whatever to justify the move, let alone any compelling and/or urgent evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80611-0014.htm_para18"><a name="08061189000665">Several people have been quoted in this debate and several Committees and non-governmental organisations have been referred to. I shall avoid all that, as it can be taken as read. However, it is telling that both the Home Secretary and Sir Ian Blair say that there have been no cases in which the full 28 days were necessary. I have no desire to reel off all the quotations&#151;I am sure that they are on the record&#151;but hon. Members should think of the perfectly innocent people who are brought in and arrested. There seems to be an awful presumption among some people in the House that everybody who is arrested is, by definition, guilty. Good God, we have not reached that stage yet, and I hope that we never do.</p>

It is a complete fig leaf and a waste of time, for two main reasons. If we are given merely an outline of the case and the need for an extension on the view of the Secretary of State, Parliament will nod it through and vote yes.

Similarly, like so many others here, at the time of both 7/7 and 9/11 I had friends and associates in the eye of the storm.

This is not some macho or self-righteous exercise. Equally, however, I do not want the Bill to become a victim of mission creep, as has happened in other contexts recently. Two or three years ago, for instance, we passed legislation relating to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 which, in my view, is potentially going down that road.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="80611-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08061189000701">That is why I want to concentrate on new clause 20. It is because we prize liberty so much that the nature and scale of the threat, and the triggers to it, are so important. They are important not merely to the making of a case to convince us here today or the House of Lords tomorrow, but because they must convince, and appear appropriate to, the broader communities in the country&#151;not just ethnic communities, but others&#151;who must be kept on board in any democracy and in any legislation that we pass. Public scepticism about politics and politicians will always be prevalent, and is arguably more prevalent now than for many years. That is why we need to go the extra mile to convince people, and to spell out why the Government want this reserve power.</p>

As for the broader issue of the sort of incident that would cause the reserve power to kick in, the Home Secretary has given a number of further details, both in response to an interesting and useful intervention from the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) and in the letter to the Joint Committee on Human Rights.</p>

I heard what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore); I have also spent some time trying to follow the twists and turns of the various reports from the Joint Committee and the most recent letter that he has received from the Home Secretary. I agree with him that our discussion has featured many red herrings, many misleading comparisons between inappropriate jurisdictions, and the bandying of many not very robust and, frankly, intellectually dishonest arguments by Members on both sides of the debate. However, I must say, with all respect to my hon. Friend and his Committee&#146;s report, that just as I do not want the Bill to lead to mission creep, I do not want to see it result in judicial creep. One of the issues that we must address this afternoon is the oxygen of publicity, and how it will affect any reserve powers given to the House.</p>

In approaching this matter, we all have a responsibility to show independent judgment, and we must exercise that judgment in striking a balance between the competing interests of security and individual freedom. If I have a criticism of the debate so far, it is that the second of these interests has formed a smaller part of our proceedings than I would have wished.</p>

In 1987, after I was elected, I participated in the votes on that. In those days, Labour voted against, but then, lo, there came out of the north-east a new young shadow Home Secretary from the constituency of Sedgefield, and he persuaded his party that instead of voting against, abstention would be sufficient. My point is that Labour Members did all that through exercising their independent judgment, and we too must exercise that when the matter currently under discussion goes to the vote. My objection to the Government position has been echoed by many Members in our debate: they have simply failed to prove the case at this time for the extension of the period of detention that they seek.</p>

That duty transcends all our other responsibilities; it is our primary duty. It is the constitutional reason why we are sent to this place, and, if I may be excused sounding somewhat flippant, I should say that it has nothing to do with the communications allowance, nothing to do with how many prepaid envelopes we use, and nothing to do with seeking to be regarded as the constituency MP of the year.

If we make a judgment that it is necessary to introduce the reserve power, and if that judgment is based on the circumstances surrounding an individual case, we inevitably become engaged in the administration of justice. The inferences that may be drawn from either a willingness or an unwillingness to accept the Government&#146;s case could be substantial in the subsequent disposal of the case against that person. I have searched my memory, and searched elsewhere, but I can think of no other instance when the House of the Commons has been called on to pass legislation based on individual circumstances after criminal proceedings have been commenced against an individual.

We believed that by voting for 28 days the debate would be finished for this Parliament and an upper limit would be established. Some of us were unwilling to go as far as 28 days. That is why we are so upset that the Government have come back with this proposal, reneging&#151;as far as we are concerned&#151;on a tacit understanding that voting for 28 days would finish the debate on this issue for this Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="80611-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08061189000731">Why have the Government come back with this proposal? Speculation has raged on the Labour Benches as to what has moved the Prime Minister to take this dangerous course. Some people say that he wants to try to do something that Tony Blair could not do. Some people say that he is driven by the polls. Some people say that last year he saw an article in <i> The Sun</i> that said that he was soft on terrorism and he has been heading down this path ever since.</p>

The arguments that they used then about computers and complications are the arguments that they are using now. I ask Ministers to spare the House those arguments about decrypting computers. The law exists to deal with people who wilfully refuse to decrypt computer evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80611-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08061189000733">The Government came back with a proposal that the House rejected two years ago. Interestingly, when they did so it then took them several months to come up with a time limit. Was it to be 29 days, or 30, or 40? At one point, some of us offered to put our hands in a hat and to draw out a number for the Home Secretary. They did not have a number of days because this is not an objective, evidence-driven Bill. It is the purest politics. It is about the polls and about positioning. It is about putting the Conservative party in the wrong place on terrorism. I put it to colleagues that we should not play ducks and drakes with our civil liberties in order to get a few months&#146; advantage in the opinion polls. We have got here through a process that involved the wrong practical politics and was wrongly motivated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="80611-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08061189000734">Let me remind the House of what is problematic about the proposal. The security services have unusually gone public and said that they are not calling for the change. The Director of Public Prosecutions, unusually, has gone public and said that he is not calling for it. I remind the House that he is the prosecuting authority. We will hear from Ministers about the police, but the police are split on the subject. We have heard about Sir Ian Blair&#151;whose days might be numbered under the former Member for Henley; hey, that&#146;s life&#151;but the most senior Muslim policeman in the Metropolitan police force, Tarique Ghaffur, has said privately and emphatically that he believes that the risk to community cohesion of the proposal is not worth any marginal  <br>

I come at the matter from a slightly different angle. It seems to me that, if someone is in detention for six weeks without knowing why, and they therefore have no notion of whether they will be able to get out without being charged, that detention is coercive in itself.

Some of my colleagues whom one might expect to be opposed to the change because of its effect on their communities have been seduced by the compensation package, but I have read the letter. It talks about going away and considering the subject, and says that the compensation might be implemented. How will it be sustainable to compensate Muslims for being held for more than 28 days when the police have held them completely lawfully and not to compensate others of whatever religion or ethnicity who have been held for seven, eight or nine days and have not been charged? The compensation package will not survive scrutiny by the courts.</p>

Any rebel Back Bencher with a cause is confident&#151;if they vote the right way of course&#151;that the Prime Minister will make the statement, give the money or make the special visit. That is humorous, but is it right that our civil liberties should be traded in such a bazaar? Is it appropriate or right that we should trade votes at the United Nations on the basis of such political pandering?</p>

I came into politics because of my concern about the relationship of the state to communities that are marginalised and suspected. It is easy to stand up for the civil liberties of our friends or of people in our trade union, but it is not easy to stand up for the civil liberties of people who are unpopular, suspected and look suspicious&#151;people the tabloids print a horror story about every day.

Everybody knows that the provisions will impact disproportionately on the Muslim and ethnic minority communities. Everybody knows that we shall not be detaining the Saudi paymasters of terror for 42 days; just as happened under internment, we shall be scraping up the flotsam and jetsam of communities. Ministers are talking about people such as my constituents, so when Muslim boys and black converts are in prison and their mothers, some of whom may not even be able to speak English properly, come to me and say, &#147;They have had my son for five weeks and nobody will tell me why&#148;, what do Ministers suggest I tell them about a measure that has been brought in only for short-term political convenience?</p>

 I have the near impossible task of following one of the finest speeches I have heard since being elected to the House of Commons. The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) need not fret: we will not be on the same side on many issues, although we are on this one. In the Home Affairs Committee and in the Public Bill Committee, I approached the subject with a very open mind. I have not been shy about expressing my view in the House that we need more people locked up in prisons; I have even argued with my Front-Bench colleagues on the subject. We need prisoners to serve longer sentences, and we need a lot more prisons to be built to house them all. I add one important caveat: people should not be locked up in prisons or police cells unless they have been charged and convicted of an offence. That is absolutely fundamental to the liberties of people in  this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80611-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08061189000747">When the Home Affairs Committee took evidence, and in the Public Bill Committee, it became obvious that the Government have not properly thought out their case. They were setting all sorts of constitutional precedents that some people have not considered. For example, I think it important that if a public servant, whether they be a police officer or in the security services, believes that a certain measure will be required, it should be up to them to make a case to a Minister, and up to the Minister to make the case to colleagues on both sides of the House. Too many times in the Select Committee and the Public Bill Committee we saw that the Government were not prepared to make the case for themselves; they expected public servants to come to the House of Commons and make the case for them. That is absolutely unacceptable. If the Government cannot make the case themselves, there is no case to consider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80611-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08061189000748">We have seen the selective way in which the Government have used the evidence that was put before them, and their selective quoting of the Home Affairs Committee report on the 42-day limit. There was not unanimous support for an extension beyond 42 days. The Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members on the Committee did not support it. Essentially, we said that if there was to be an extension beyond 42 days, there would, of course, have to be safeguards. We went along with that, rather unwillingly, so that there could be some form of consensus, and so that we did not have to divide the whole Committee on the issue. We said that although it would have to be amended, the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 could be used in some form instead of the so-called safeguards that the Government came up with, to which I shall turn in a minute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80611-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08061189000749">I was not in Parliament when the decision was taken to invade Iraq. I suspect that I would probably have gone along with the consensus, had I been there, because I have always thought that those bright people of all parties in Parliament must know more than me, even though my gut instinct told me that the invasion was wrong. I even trusted Tony Blair when he said, &#147;Trust in me.&#148; I have learned the hard way that we should never trust Ministers or assume that people in positions of power are any better than us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="80611-0016.htm_para20"><a name="08061189000750">I did not appreciate the way in which the evidence that the Home Affairs Committee heard was twisted and turned by Ministers.

Committee, he made it absolutely clear that he was against an extension beyond 42 days, yet his words were twisted and turned. We met the director general of MI5, and I met a senior member of one of the security services. They spoke to us in confidence, but now that a statement on pre-charge detention has been published on MI5&#146;s website, it is fair to say that we knew months ago that MI5 was not calling for the measure, yet we had to listen while Ministers gave a different impression. We have heard lots of quotes from Sir Ian Blair, and that is reasonable enough, but we did not hear about all the other senior police officers, such as Sir Paul Condon, who did not believe that any sort of extension was justified. Throughout the process, the Government have quoted selectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="80611-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08061189000751">The fact is that the issue comes down to something very simple: if the police have enough evidence to arrest somebody, they must have something tangible to go on. I can say that as a serving police officer. A police officer cannot simply go around arresting people without any evidence that they have done something wrong, and rightly so. Of course, it might take a little while to get together enough evidence for a charge. I am sure that in the past there was a temptation to get as much evidence as one possibly could, so that the strongest possible charge could be bought, but in some ways, the case for doing that has been removed, because we are to implement post-charge questioning&#151;a measure that all my colleagues and I fully supported. That part of the Government&#146;s case no longer arises. As Sir Ken Macdonald said to us, if within 28 days enough evidence cannot be found to bring some charge against someone, any prosecution is likely to be very unsafe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80611-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08061189000752">Many colleagues have spoken about the Civil Contingencies Act and the fact that we would have the longest detention in the western world. I shall not add to that, as I want to allow others an opportunity to speak.</p>

Somebody who has been held for 42 days or longer without charge would have done the equivalent of a prison sentence of more than three months. What is the latest proposal that the Government have come up with today to try to make those people feel better? &#147;Okay, we arrested you at 5 o&#146;clock in the morning, quite possibly at gunpoint, took you off, kept you there for 42 days, didn&#146;t even tell you why we had you in there, but here&#146;s some money. Don&#146;t worry about it. You were innocent, but have some money&#148;&#151;as if that will make anything better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="80611-0016.htm_para24"><a name="08061189000754">I challenge the Minister. If he is serious about the Government&#146;s proposal, perhaps he will say a word about Lotfi Raissi. He was the trainee pilot who was held in detention in Belmarsh for about five months, and was released in 2002, his career in ruins. He has been fighting ever since for compensation. If the Government are serious about compensating people and they have a compensation package, perhaps the Minister will tell us what he will do for that gentleman, who was held for five months without any charges being brought against him.</p>

the Government Benches by saying that if they wanted to do something about terrorism, they have had plenty of opportunity. They could, as my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) said, have done away with the Human Rights Act, which has given so much succour to terrorists. It has allowed people who we know have been involved in terrorism to come into this country. The Government have then found that they are prevented from deporting them, prevented from putting them in prison until they go back, and prevented even from keeping them in their own homes while tagged&#151;all because of the Human Rights Act.</p>

They could get rid of the Human Rights Act in a matter of weeks, if they wanted to. They could insist that people who come to this country learn our language and start to integrate, instead of allowing them to set up their own communities and maintain practices that are unacceptable in this country, such as forced marriage, polygamy and female genital mutilation, to which a blind eye is being turned by the Government. They should insist on integration, getting people to learn our language and getting them to fit in with our culture and traditions, rather than passing legislation that will do away with the liberties that British subjects and citizens have enjoyed for hundreds of years.</p>

Whatever it is, when we try to legislate in a hurry, particularly in the face of a tabloid outcry over bodies being pulled out of the latest terrorist outrage, we tend not to make the right decisions.</p>

There is absolutely no doubt that terrorist networks have become more sophisticated and adept at using information technology and the latest techniques available, first to avoid surveillance, secondly to communicate with each other and thirdly to commit atrocities. We have to be cognisant of that fact. It is a matter of public record that in 1997 the UK security services seized just 19 mobile phones, one computer  <br>

We know that there have been a substantial number of plots. We know that about 200 groups and 2,000 individuals give the security services cause for concern. Those numbers are going up, not down. I find it ironic that the shadow Home Secretary is happy to praise the professionalism of the police and the security services in foiling those plots, and we join across the Floor of the House in praising them for that, but when it comes to questioning their professional judgment, somehow we are not so keen to praise their professionalism and to take their advice. That led the Home Affairs Committee, in two separate reports, to a series of conclusions. In June 2006, before I and the hon. Gentleman who just intervened joined the Committee, it, under the excellent chairmanship&#151;it is excellently chaired now&#151;of my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), now the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, came to the following conclusion. Looking at the Government&#146;s case for 90-day detention, which was not particularly strong in my view, the Committee concluded:</p>

I am very happy to put that on the record, but the Committee accepted that there was a case for exceptional circumstances, as did Liberty and, I have to say, the Conservative Front-Bench team when it suggested that amending the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 could deal with exceptional circumstances.</p>

precautionary proposal for temporary powers. It is dependent on the Director of Public Prosecutions, himself a sceptic, coming forward, together with the relevant chief constable, with a certificate to say that there is a need for those powers in the first place. We are now to get a vote after seven days. What meaningful debate could we have after seven days? During my time here, we debated the Prevention of Terrorism Acts in this House for a number of years. When we were deciding whether to extend the exceptional powers in the PTA, we did not discuss individual republican or loyalist terrorist atrocities&#151;we discussed the state of the security situation and whether the state required those powers in order to keep people safe. After the Glasgow and Haymarket bombings, we had a perfectly good debate in this House on a statement by the Home Secretary. We had people arrested; we did not fall foul of the sub judice rules; and we were intelligent enough to have a debate without compromising the subsequent criminal prosecutions. That is exactly the debate that we would have in this regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80611-0017.htm_para17"><a name="08061189000789">Let me end with two points. First, it is true that the current proposal could have an impact on community relations, but I have been around my multicultural community for long enough to know that the greatest and most detrimental impact on community relations occurs if a bomber gets through&#151;that is when the damage is done. Secondly, if the police and the expert witnesses that we have heard before the Home Affairs Committee are right, a bomber may get through at some point in the future. I do not want hon. Members&#146; fingerprints on a vote that might mean that at some point in the future we release out on to the streets someone who will go on to do us and our communities harm.</p>

My greatest fear is that if we pass the measure on 42 days, we are in effect doing the terrorists&#146; job for them. Let us be clear about this. We all accept that terrorism is a threat to this country and to our liberties&#151;that cannot be disputed. However, this proposal assaults our hard-won civil liberties and the common law of this land. We have already heard many excellent arguments against it. The lack of evidence is one such argument. It is telling that the Government cannot produce one piece of concrete evidence to substantiate their claim that 42 days are required. The intelligence services took the unprecedented step of making a statement saying that they had not called for an extension to 42 days. The Director of Public Prosecutions has already said that he cannot support it either. There is no evidence whatever in support of the proposal.</p>

were still picking up the pieces from that disastrous policy. I want to impress on the House just what a disastrous policy it was. It was completely counter-productive. It turned whole communities against us, and the recruitment of terrorists was made so much easier when people in those communities had suffered because of the policy of internment. I know that there are differences between the two circumstances, but the differences are not so great that parallels cannot be drawn for the purposes of today&#146;s debate. The bottom line is that people were taken off the streets, put away and not charged because it was thought that they might be a threat. That created a great deal of resentment, which in the end, caused even more bloodshed and loss of life. I ask the House to think very carefully before we go down that road. If we want to engage communities, and to counter terrorism and the threat of terrorism, taking someone off the streets and putting them away for 42 days without charging them is not the way to do it.</p>

 If my hon. Friend reads the Government&#146;s new clause 20&#151;one of the apparent concessions&#151;he will see that the new power that they seek could be applied abroad. It does not merely apply to the United Kingdom, but to threats of terrorism to property abroad. That does not sound much like grave and exceptional circumstances to me.</p>

<p><a name="st_o435"><a name="08061189000794"><a name="80611-0017.htm_spnew12"><a name="08061189001364"><b>Mr. Baron:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes a valid point. The provision is far-reaching in its consequences and we have to take that point on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="80611-0017.htm_para20"><a name="08061189000795">We have heard about international comparisons, but, as ever, the Government have failed to address the fundamental point that other common law countries across the globe do not need more then one week for pre-charge detention. Why do we need six in this country? Why are our police forces so incompetent&#151;that is the only conclusion one can draw from the Government&#146;s measures&#151;that they need six times longer than most other police forces in other common law countries? Again, no case has been made by the Government. Their argument against Liberty&#146;s figures is even weaker when one considers that the Government have admitted, at the Dispatch Box and in written parliamentary answers, that they have not undertaken a similar comparison. They have done no research of real worth on the matter. The force of their argument that such comparisons are not valid does not stand up to the test of scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="80611-0017.htm_para21"><a name="08061189000796">Another of my concerns is the suppressed premise in the background to the debate that, deep down, many people are afraid that a suspect released too soon might use their freedom to commit an atrocity. Supposedly, 42 days&#146; detention is needed to prevent another 7/7. But that argument is completely misguided. The purpose of the 42-day proposal is to prolong an investigation after a plot has been discovered or is suspected. It is not to prevent it. The police, the authorities and the security services already have enough powers to deal with an imminent terrorist strike. They do not need those powers; prevention is not the purpose of the 42 days. For one thing, the police could charge a suspect with acts preparatory to terrorism. Meanwhile, surveillance and intelligence gathering could and would continue if a suspect was released back into the community. So let us scotch once and for all the idea that 42 days&#146; detention is needed to prevent another terrorist outrage. That is not its sole function.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="80611-0017.htm_para22"><a name="08061189000797">Briefly, I also take exception to the argument that, because the police have come close to the existing limit on a number of occasions, it is incumbent on the House to allow more time for holding suspects without charge. It might be that sufficient information was obtained earlier and that the police were holding a person for the sake of further questioning, given that post-charge questioning is not generally possible. However, simply because time is used does not mean that it is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="80611-0017.htm_para23"><a name="08061189000798">As for the safeguards, they are weak to the point of being meaningless. Let us take the judicial safeguards first. The hearing before a judge cannot be a meaningful adversarial process. The range of issues that a judge can consider is limited to whether the investigation is proceeding at a reasonable rate and the likelihood of new evidence being brought forward. That is a very low threshold to cross. A judge will not be asked to consider a suspect&#146;s likely guilt or innocence in relation to any specific offence, so the individual in question will not have the opportunity to defend himself. Indeed, he might not even be there. The role of the courts is to judge evidence in relation to an offence, not to supervise a police investigation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80611-0017.htm_para24"><a name="08061189000799">As for the parliamentary safeguards, the mechanism proposed is both illogical and inappropriate. It is illogical when triggered in response to an individual case, because the higher pre-charge detention applies to all suspects held under anti-terrorism legislation, even if their case does not justify such an extension. The mechanism is also inappropriate, because it is not the role of Parliament to assess whether an individual should be deprived of their liberty, as has been mentioned on a number of occasions. Hon. Members should not be asked to instigate procedures to try to fulfil that function.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80611-0017.htm_para25"><a name="08061189000800">Would we allow, for example, an accused person to come to the Bar of the House and put his side of the story? The last time that occurred was in the 1950s. Are we going to instigate such a procedure again? I do not think so. Would we have secret sessions, to allow the security services or a Minister to present their case freely? That has not happened since the second world war, and I see no proposals on the Table for it to happen again. The proposed safeguard is almost worthless and meaningless.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="80611-0017.htm_para26"><a name="08061189000801">In truth, no concession or safeguard is likely to be adequate, because to detain someone on the basis of suspicion alone is a fundamental breach of liberty. It is, effectively, to reverse the presumption of innocence in English common law. We have to ask ourselves why it is that we need 42 days. My concern is that, for the reasons set out in what has, overall, been an informed and intelligent debate this afternoon, we risk doing the terrorists&#146; job for them. There is no evidence to suggest that the measure is needed. The international comparisons would suggest that we are making a big mistake if we extend from 28 days. We also risk making the mistake of producing a Bill that would be counter-productive in trying to solicit information from the communities from which we need help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="80611-0017.htm_para27"><a name="08061189000802">For all those reasons, I urge the House not to extend to 42 days&#151;to dig in deep and realise that our hard-won civil liberties cannot be traded in on the back of Government misinformation and evidence that is simply not there. I urge the House to give that great thought indeed.</p>

It does not provide that she should be properly satisfied, referring only to &#147;whether&#148; she is. The Home Secretary is not obliged to follow that legal advice.

This power will end up, in practice, taking on all sorts of gross and ugly proportions that its supporters underestimate.

the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing did a good job in Committee&#151;I served on it&#151;in trying to bring the various parties together on the vast majority of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80611-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08061189000816">There is a great deal of consensus in the House on how we fight terrorism. Sometimes when we have this highly charged debate, we forget that. Is there a threat from terrorism? Yes, of course there is. I was on Capitol hill in Washington DC on 9/11. I was in Aldgate on 7/7. I do not need persuading that there is a threat from terrorists. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I tell hon. Members on the other side of the House that I understand their concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80611-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08061189000817">However, is there a need for further powers to fight terrorism effectively? Yes, there is. We have agreed the things that need to be done&#151;the lower-order offences, the offence of acts preparatory to terrorism, the lowering of the threshold for prosecution, the post-charge questioning that forms part of the Bill and intercept evidence, which the Chilcot review is, I hope, providing is admissible evidence&#151;and the legislation to require the provision of a key to encrypted material ought to be the answer to the question of how we deal with encrypted material within the period required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80611-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08061189000818">Is there an increase in the number of complex cases? I am persuaded that yes, there is. My answer to that is something that was decried earlier: we must provide more resources. I know that more resources have already been applied to the problem, but if there is a need for more interpreters, let us pay for more interpreters, pay for more police officers and have sufficient resources to do the job quickly. However, when I come to the question whether there is a case for this extension to six weeks&#146; detention without a charge being placed, I do not agree and there is no consensus because it is unjustified, unfair, unworkable and profoundly unhelpful to our fight against terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80611-0018.htm_para14"><a name="08061189000819">I heard the Home Secretary ask earlier, &#147;How would we feel if somebody was released after 28 days and they then committed an offence on the 29th, 30th or 31st day?&#148; I ask how she would feel if, under her proposals, that happened on the 43rd, 44th or 45th day. There will be no limit to this auction of time for detention without charge if that argument is sustained.</p>

It is a most extraordinary proposition that this House should be empanelled as a sort of grand jury. Some say that it will not be dealing with the specifics of a case, but it will, because of the way in which the new clauses and amendments are worded. They require evidence to be put before the Secretary of State in relation to the progress of a specific case, and they require her to present it to the House in as far as she can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80611-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08061189000822">The proposition is extraordinary because it defies jurisprudence, constitutionality and any concept of the illusory separation of powers, which we could debate at  <br>

length. The House would be required to adjudicate on whether the Home Secretary was right in her assertion, but to do so either on the basis of evidence that would render the security services inoperable in the future or, more probably, without that evidence&#151;perhaps on the basis of a dossier, and we all know what happens when the House decides matters on the basis of a dossier. We would thus be doing nothing more than rubber-stamp, or decide whether we liked the sound of the Home Secretary on the day when she presented the evidence to the House.</p>

I want us to have consensus on the fight against terrorism, and I think we established a sort of consensus on 28 days, although it was not my choice; I saw it very much as a temporary expedient to avoid the adoption of 90 days. It worries me that all the noddy heads that supported 90 days are the same noddy heads that now support 42 days. There is a strong contention to be made that those noddy heads would support any number put before them by the Home Secretary.</p>

Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) &#147;David, why do you go winnicking on about 28 days?&#148; He thought it rather unkind at the time, but I think he has since found the courage to accept my feeble attempt at humour.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. My constituency of Sedgefield is adjacent to his constituency of Stockton, North, and our constituents are very similar to each other.

The claim that there was sufficient evidence to charge suspects after four and 12 days but the charging decision was somehow delayed is a slur on the Crown Prosecution Service and on those who investigated that case. The CPS must charge a person at the earliest possible point, and that happened in this case. The Director of Public Prosecutions has said:</p>

The judge would not agree to continued detention unless it was needed and he was satisfied that the investigation was being carried out diligently and expeditiously. So, alongside a scandalous slur on the police officers carrying out that investigation and on the prosecutors who worked day in, day out to bring a charge, there is also a suggestion that the judges themselves made the wrong decision.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) made no slur on the police or the Crown Prosecution Service. He made a statement of a number of facts about when the evidence was available, and I note that the Home Secretary has not challenged those in any way. Those were the only points that he made and he went out of his way to say that he was not suggesting that the overall period of detention was in some way wrong, merely that on the fourth and 12th day that evidence had been available. If the Home Secretary disagrees with that, perhaps she will tell the House that my right hon. Friend is wrong.</p>

 The clear implication of what the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) said was that people could have been charged earlier. That is fundamentally wrong, and what is more, he has had personal assurances from senior police officers that that was not the case.</p>

People have claimed that detainees would not be able to see their families, or that they would not have cooling-off periods. That is wrong. Anybody detained will be told on arrest the grounds for that arrest. Any hearings for extended detention would include specific details of the investigation. Those detained may receive visits from friends, family and others likely to take an interest in their welfare. In any 24-hour period, the detainee must be allowed at least eight hours for rest, free from questioning, thus providing the cooling-off period that the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) suggested did not exist. Detainees should be offered exercise, and cells must be cleaned, heated and ventilated. To suggest that those things would not happen, as some have done, is also wrong.</p>

process. I have understandably been challenged about what Parliament will be able to debate in such circumstances. First, contrary to the contention advanced by the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews), the statement made by the Home Secretary to Parliament will need to be clear that a grave and exceptional terrorist threat has occurred or is occurring. New clause 32 makes it clear that legal advice with which the Home Secretary can properly be satisfied will need to be made available to Parliament in order to support that debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80611-0019.htm_para9"><a name="080611121000056">Parliament will be able to debate the general security threat; the progress of the investigation; the police numbers involved; the number of suspects detained; the outline of the plot; the what, why and when; the number of countries involved; whether the Home Secretary&#146;s decision was properly founded; and whether she had indeed received reports from the police and the DPP. That would be a full debate. I believe in the role of Parliament, and we have embedded that safeguard in our proposals.</p>

<p><a name="st_o447"><a name="080611121000057"><a name="80611-0019.htm_spnew3"><a name="080611121001837"><b>Mr. Grieve:</b>
 Will the Home Secretary answer the point that was made so properly by the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) that the use of the term &#147;grave and exceptional terrorist threat&#148; is defined in a way that means that it is nothing of the kind? It is not akin to the definition in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, or an emergency; it could be any terrorist matter brought to the notice of the Home Secretary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80611-0019.htm_para10"><a name="080611121000059">I hope that hon. Members will agree that in this House we should always rely on force of argument and the rule of law to counter terror. Today hon. Members have heard the arguments, and we have all now to make a decision on the protections that we need to ensure that the rule of law continues to run. The British people place their trust in us to take the right decisions to protect them. I cannot and will not wish away the threat from those whose aim and sole intent is to blow up our citizens, of all races and religions, on our streets. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80611-0019.htm_para11"><a name="080611121000060">When it comes to dealing with terrorism, my view is straightforward. We cannot simply hope for the best. We must have plans in place that mean that we can cope with the worst. The question that everybody needs to answer is whether they are confident that no police investigation would ever need to hold somebody for longer than 28 days. I greatly prize consensus. It has motivated me in bringing these proposals. However, important as consensus is, I prize the interests of Britain&#146;s security above it. We should do the right thing to protect our people, and that is what I am asking the House to support me in this evening.</p>

 A Government ready to rely on those friends of liberty, the Democratic Unionist party, to shred the liberties of our own people are almost by definition unembarrassable, but I hope this evening to add to the issues ventilated in a recent Channel 4 &#147;Dispatches&#148; programme to adumbrate the extent to which the tragedy in Somalia, which so many people are now becoming aware of, is another of our Government&#146;s dirty little secrets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80611-0022.htm_para10"><a name="080611121001745">We must start the story in Ethiopia, where 4 million people, according to the United Nations, are facing starvation and 120,000 Ethiopian children have just one month to live, according to last week&#146;s media reports. Television viewers were shocked to see the pictures last week of the widespread suffering redolent of 1984 and the great famine of that year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="80611-0022.htm_para11"><a name="080611121001746">The US and Britain immediately pledged $90 million in famine relief. Just one week after its appeal to the international community for famine relief, the Ethiopian Government increased their military budget by $50 million to $400 million. The regime in Addis Ababa&#151;when I knew them in the 1980s, they were pro-Albanian Maoists&#151;are the most militarised and heavily armed in Africa. They are in a state of perpetual war or preparation for war with one neighbour, Eritrea, and they are supporting anti-Government rebels in Sudan, many believe with western connivance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80611-0022.htm_para12"><a name="080611121001747">Most astonishingly of all, the Government of Ethiopia&#151;that starving country whose little children are fly infested, kwashiorkor swollen, famished and famine stricken&#151;have been encouraged, armed, trained, financed and otherwise facilitated to invade and occupy their neighbour, Somalia, and create a reign of terror in that land, which is testified to by this voluminous Amnesty International report, which, if I had time, I would extensively quote from.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80611-0022.htm_para13"><a name="080611121001748">Somalia has lost thousands of dead as a result of the Ethiopian invasion. Millions have been displaced. Somalia, under Ethiopian occupation, is the grimmest prison state in Africa&#151;far worse than Mugabe&#146;s Zimbabwe. Who has done the encouraging, the arming, the training, the financing and the facilitating? The same US and British Governments who donated the $90 million to the same Ethiopian Government who are burning their money and burning the villages, the neighbourhoods and the people of occupied Somalia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="80611-0022.htm_para14"><a name="080611121001749">This Government are never done talking about the shortcomings of African leaders. Just last week in Rome, the Secretary of State for International Development was roaring at Robert Mugabe, yet there has not been a squeak out of him, or any other Minister, about the much bigger crime in which we are ourselves deeply complicit. Is it any wonder that African opinion considers so much of what we have to say about misgovernance in Africa to be the deepest, most cynical hypocrisy?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="80611-0022.htm_para15"><a name="080611121001750">Two weeks ago, Channel 4&#146;s &#147;Dispatches&#148; team took terrifying risks to bring us the latest from occupied Mogadishu. That was undoubtedly an award-winning  <br>

documentary. It was memorable for many reasons, not least the scene in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office when the Minister of State, Lord Malloch-Brown, his face frozen in horror, was confronted by Aidan Hartley with the central case of the documentary makers. For the benefit of Members who did not see the programme&#151;the Minister will certainly have seen it; she would hardly be sent out to bat on this wicket without being shown it&#151;that central case was that, in the grim prison state of occupied Somalia, the fingerprints of our country and our Government were all over the scene of the crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80611-0022.htm_para16"><a name="080611121001751">The President of the puppet regime imposed by the Ethiopian army in Somalia turns out to be British. He spends much of his time here&#151;well, it is dangerous in Somalia, after all&#151;and has property and family here. After presiding over a gang of torturers, murderers, grand larceners and extortionists, he flies back to England. Then there is the police chief whose officers kidnap people for ransom, which they extort from people living in our own country&#151;in Leicester, in Birmingham, in London. They torture people, make them disappear, and kill them if their families will not pay. He too is British. As for the former Interior Minister who presides over an interior of mass refugee camps, starvation and misery, and who stands accused of stealing international aid and diverting food for political purposes&#151;why, he is British as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80611-0022.htm_para17"><a name="080611121001752">Guess who is paying the wages of the murdering, kidnapping, torturing, quisling police force in Ethiopian-occupied Somalia? That&#146;s right: we are. The public dictatorship in Somalia is a very British crime, especially as our own Government&#151;in particular, that pocket-sized Palmerston to whom I referred earlier, the Secretary of State for International Development&#151;are so voluble on the subject of other problems in Africa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80611-0022.htm_para18"><a name="080611121001753">So how did we get here? How did we get into bed with the former pro-Albanian Maoists of the Government in Addis Ababa? I am afraid that the answer is our old friend, our old acquaintance, the policy of &#147;my enemy&#146;s enemy is my friend&#148;. The policy that has got us into so much trouble, from Afghanistan to Iraq and many other parts of the world, is what lies behind this obscene paradox.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80611-0022.htm_para19"><a name="080611121001754">We are supporting the Ethiopian Government&#146;s occupation of Somalia because George Bush told us to: because Somalia is a front line in George Bush&#146;s ill-conceived, counter-productive, utterly discredited, &#147;about to be booted out in the United States&#148; so-called war on terror. We were against the former Government of Somalia because they were an Islamic Government, just as we are against the Government in Sudan because they are an Islamic Government, and just as Ethiopia, on our behalf, opposed the Government in Eritrea because they are an Islamic Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="80611-0022.htm_para20"><a name="080611121001755">This policy, having been such a disaster around the world, is now in full force in Somalia, and but for Channel 4&#146;s &#147;Dispatches&#148; hardly anyone in Britain would know anything about it. No British Minister has come to the Dispatch Box to explain why British taxpayers&#146; money is being paid to a police force in Mogadishu that is accused of kidnapping people and extorting ransom money from British citizens. No British Minister has come to explain&#151;unless we interpret Lord Malloch-Brown&#146;s frozen face as an explanation&#151;why we are so heavily involved with a puppet regime that is bereft of political and public support in Somalia.</p>

Why are we allowing the Interior Minister of Somalia to travel back and forth into our country unmolested when he is accused by aid agencies of purloining international aid&#151;desperately needed emergency aid for hungry people&#151;for himself and for political purposes for his political clan? Why are the Government not stopping him at the border and questioning him about where the money went that was put into Somalia and has disappeared?</p>

When will the Government at least condemn the human rights abuses in Somalia? Amnesty has voluminously recorded them, but not a squeak has come from the Government, which has never done roaring at Sudan or Zimbabwe. Why? Because we are deeply complicit in that.

Will he also join me in encouraging the United Nations, the African Union Mission in Somalia&#151;AMISOM&#151;and the African Union to ensure that troops are put back into Somalia in order to give Somalis that security, which they need?

support. They are having a beano in the Ethiopian embassy next week. Perhaps the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) will go to it; he will certainly get an invitation in the post following his intervention. The Ethiopian Government are having a beano  in the Ethiopian embassy in London to celebrate the 17th anniversary of their coming to power, and it is going to be a very grand event.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="80611-0023.htm_para16"><a name="080611121001779">That event comes at a time when the Ethiopian Government&#146;s own people are starving to death.

In fact, far from saying boo, people are saying, &#147;Here&#146;s some more military and financial aid to do it.&#148; That is because the Government of President Bush, who are utterly discredited and on their way out, with virtually nowhere to go except Downing street on Sunday for one last photo call, regard the defeat of the former Islamic Government in Somalia as part of their war on terror.</p>

The puppet regime of British citizens imposed on Somalia by the Ethiopian invasion would not last five minutes if the Ethiopian forces withdrew&#151;that regime would have to withdraw with them. So, any Government who come to power in Somalia in the future will be filled with hatred of Britain and the United States.</p>

We wonder why so many young people in the Muslim world are so bitter and angry about us that they want to hurt us. Is it any wonder? Can it be any wonder to any sane person? I beg the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to believe me when I say that it is because of the kinds of policies that I have described. I talk to Somalis all the time, and I know that the rage the Somali community both in Britain and around the world feels about Britain and America&#146;s role in their country generates terrorists. As the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev.

 While the Government of Ethiopia are not perfect&#151;indeed, there are Governments closer to home who are not perfect&#151;it is right that human rights abuses by the Somali security services are fully investigated.

 I do not know if they were shot by Somalis or Ethiopians. The point is that the country has been plunged into utter lawlessness, and to pretend that the Ethiopian Government are providing security is completely ridiculous. The words Somalia and security should not even be mentioned in the same sentence.</p>

This conflict will go on and I hope that the Minister will not claim that the deal reached this week is any kind of solution to the problem. The people who are doing the fighting are not involved in the deal. It is like a peace process in the north of Ireland that excluded the people who were doing the fighting. That is what has happened in relation to Somalia in the past few days.</p>

 I welcome the opportunity to reply to the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Galloway) in this debate. I see this as an excellent chance to highlight how the Foreign and Commonwealth Office seeks to address a number of issues relating to Somalia.</p>

That agreement was signed by both parties in Djibouti on Monday and witnessed by members of the international community. I wish to thank the UN Secretary-General&#146;s special representative, Ahmedou Ould Abdallah, on his continued efforts to mediate in the talks between the parties which resulted in the agreement. This is a positive step and we look forward to all parties fulfilling their commitment to cease armed confrontation. We are committed to working with the UN to support this process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="80611-0023.htm_para23"><a name="080611121001791">Human rights issues in Somalia are longstanding and complex. They cannot be attributed to any one cause, and there are no easy or obvious solutions. Somalia is not like other countries. Serious violence, lack of governance structures and the deteriorating humanitarian situation have been ongoing for 17 years. Many in Somali society have been brutalised by years of violence. It is therefore often individuals, not answerable to any particular group or commander, who carry out abuses on their own initiative. That makes it even more difficult to prevent further abuses and to bring those responsible to justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="80611-0023.htm_para24"><a name="080611121001792">Given that complexity and the insecurity in Somalia, there is little opportunity to monitor the situation reliably or gather and verify facts or allegations. Reporting is often biased and may be exaggerated to exert influence on the international community. The only sustainable way to address human rights in the long term is to engage in effective state building, concentrating on developing institutions, parliamentary accountability, an inclusive security sector and delivery of basic services. Short-term fixes that do not focus on state building will mean we return to the issue year after year, prolonging the suffering of the Somali people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="80611-0023.htm_para25"><a name="080611121001793">Reports of incidents and accusations of human rights abuses by Ethiopian troops are difficult to corroborate and have been categorically denied by the Ethiopian Government. Ethiopian troops in Somalia are carrying out a role that security providers in Somalia do not have the capacity for. Many critics forget that fighting between militias went on for 15 years before Ethiopia intervened, at the invitation of Somalia&#146;s transitional federal Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="80611-0023.htm_para26"><a name="080611121001794">African Union member nations have not yet committed to contributing sufficient troops to allow for full deployment of the African Union mission in Somalia, which currently has only 2,400 of the 8,000 troops mandated. Further planning for a possible UN mission was called for by UN Security Council resolution 1814, although that is unlikely to be mandated soon. Evidence from other Ethiopian peacekeeping deployments indicates that they make a positive contribution to missions. Ethiopian troops are likely to form the largest contingent of the UN-African Union mission in Darfur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="80611-0023.htm_para27"><a name="080611121001795">We regularly engage with human rights organisations, listen to their views and appreciate their efforts to gather information and evidence on human rights. We and they fully acknowledge that allegations of abuse are made against all parties to the conflict in Somalia. We sponsored an Arria meeting at the United Nations in New York on 31 March to enable Governments and the non-governmental organisation community freely to discuss human rights and humanitarian issues and to exchange views on how to achieve progress in Somalia.</p>

Office officials in London and at the UN have also raised the issue with their Ethiopian counterparts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="80611-0023.htm_para30"><a name="080611121001798">Ethiopia has told us that it intends to withdraw from Somalia and that it has reduced force numbers by more than half since late February 2007. The Ethiopian Government are extremely positive about the newly signed peace agreement, which includes a strategy for their withdrawal from Somalia. Until Ethiopia withdraws its troops completely, we urge them to use only appropriate force, adhere to international humanitarian law and respect human rights. However, for Ethiopia to withdraw from Somalia before an effective alternative force has been established would risk creating a dangerous security vacuum. Somalis would suffer the most from such a development.</p>
