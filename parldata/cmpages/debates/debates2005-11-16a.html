 (Lab): What assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the homelessness innovation fund.  [28524]
</p>


<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51116-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Yvette Cooper): </b> 
 The &#163;2.2 million homelessness innovation fund    is funding 19 projects to help more than 6,000 households and is part of a strategy to prevent homelessness under which homelessness acceptances have fallen by 17 per cent. over the past 12 months.
</p>





<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51116-01_spnew0"><b> Barbara Follett: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that reply and welcome the fall in the number of homeless people, but does she agree that the best way to help 228 families who are currently homeless in Stevenage would be to build the 900 affordable homes in the proposed development to the west of the town? Will she do all that she can to ensure that that goes ahead?
</p>





<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51116-01_spnew1"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is aware that I cannot comment on cases that are going through the planning process, but I can say that I think she is right: we need to build more homes across the board. We have an ageing and a growing population. We need the new homes and both social housing and shared equity schemes to support not only key workers, but the economy. That is why Shelter, the CBI and Unison are all supporting the campaign for more homes.
</p>





<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51116-01_spnew2"><b> Sammy Wilson  (East Antrim)</b> 
 (DUP): A trawl through the regional papers this week has indicated that housing waiting lists have increased in the north-east by 22 per cent., in parts of the south of England by over 2,000 per cent. and in the midlands by over 100 per cent. Will the Minister outline some of the initiatives that the Government have taken to deal with homelessness in the United Kingdom? After eight years, why are we still finding waiting lists rising, rather than falling, despite the initiatives undertaken so far?
</p>





<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51116-01_spnew3"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right that demand for social housing is growing, just as demand 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 952</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>for housing is growing across the board. That is why we have made it clear that we need to build new homes. We are funding a 50 per cent. increase in the number of new social houses over the next three years. We have already doubled new investment in social housing and doubled investment in repairs and refurbishment as well. We must recognise that we had to deal with a disgraceful situation: the previous Government left us a &#163;19 billion backlog in repairs and maintenance, which meant that 2 million families were deprived of decent homes to live in.
</p>





<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51116-01_spnew4"><b> Margaret Moran  (Luton, South)</b> 
 (Lab): While welcoming the homelessness innovation fund, I am sure that my hon. Friend agrees that the prevention of homelessness is very important. Does she share my concern that only about three local authorities have used the housing benefit emergency fund, which is intended to prevent homelessness? What does she intend to do to restore that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51116-01_spnew5"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 I will certainly look further into the points that my hon. Friend makes because councils need to work hard to prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place. We have made important progress. I referred earlier to the fact that homelessness acceptances have dropped by 17 per cent. over the past 12 months. That has happened because of the &#163;200 million programme to prevent homelessness and because of some innovative work that is being done by local authorities, often to do things as simple as providing people with help to get a rent deposit for a new home to prevent them from becoming homeless in the first place.
</p>





<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51116-01_spnew6"><b> Angela Watkinson  (Upminster)</b> 
 (Con): The problem with homelessness innovation funding is that, like so many of the Government&#039;s eye-catching initiatives, it is time-limited. What hope can the Minister offer for the future of projects such as Tomorrow&#039;s People in Southwark, which is successfully helping people out of the &quot;no home, no job-no job, no home&quot; trap that they fall into? Its funding ends in March.
</p>





<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51116-01_spnew7"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is right to suggest that we need to continue to support programmes to prevent homelessness. That is why we have set out &#163;200 million of investment in preventing homelessness; but, in the longer term, we must recognise the need to build new homes across the board. The Conservative party needs to realise that one of its leadership contenders is calling for a 500,000 cut in the building of new homes. That will not help to prevent homelessness; it will not help first-time buyers; and it will not help key workers either.
</p>





<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51116-01_spnew8"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): I note from the Minister&#039;s announcement on 2 November the welcome grant to three adjacent authorities&#151;Broxtowe, Gedling and Rushcliffe&#151;in the adjoining county of Nottinghamshire. Will she consider a similar approach in the county of Leicestershire, where the number of homeless people is not necessarily large, but any initiative in adjacent areas needs to be a minimum size to make it worth while, so North-West Leicestershire, Charnwood, Hinckley and Bosworth come to mind. Will she look at that because North-West Leicestershire has a successful homelessness project, but it would benefit from working with adjacent authorities?

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51116-01_spnew9"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 I will certainly examine my hon. Friend&#039;s proposal. It is helpful if local authorities work together across boundaries because that can make an important difference. It has helped to cut the number of families in bed and breakfast in the long term and the extent of rough sleeping.

</p>


<p><a name="st_11"><a name="51116-01_spmin1"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister  (Mr. John Prescott): </b> 
 I have received representations to strengthen and clarify the present guidance, to extend the statutory role of the Environment Agency and to introduce call-in powers for planning applications in flood-risk areas. I intend to consult shortly on proposals for a new PPG25, which will include extending the agency&#039;s role and making a flood direction.
</p>





<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51116-01_spnew10"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 I welcome warmly the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s answer. He will be aware that under the present law it is home owners who are responsible for knowing whether their homes are prone to flooding. Will he include in the revised planning guidance the requirement that it should be for developers to pass that knowledge on to home owners so that they can qualify for full insurance cover?
</p>





<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51116-01_spmin2"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 That seems to be a reasonable and sensible suggestion and I shall certainly consider it as we produce the draft. We intend to publish the draft shortly and hope to have the statement by summer 2006. That will make an important improvement by giving the Environment Agency greater influence on such directions. Indeed, I will also take extra powers to direct to deal with cases in which there is a dispute regarding the planning application going through a local authority and the Environment Agency.
</p>





<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51116-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Mark Todd  (South Derbyshire)</b> 
 (Lab): May I draw to the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s attention the representations that I made on the last occasion that we considered PPG25? I urged the Environment Agency to have call-in powers then, so I hope that the proposal will meet with his approval on this occasion. May I urge him to take that step?
</p>





<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51116-01_spmin3"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 In the draft that we will publish shortly, I intend to introduce a statutory responsibility to consult the Environment Agency, not to avoid it. I think that it is involved in considering 50 per cent. of applications, but I need to make it a requirement that it considers all applications. However, I do not want to give the agency the sole power to have call-in rights because that should remain with local, democratically-accountable planning committees. However, if there is a dispute involving the Environment Agency, I can call the matter in myself through the appropriate Government office.

 (Con): The Deputy Prime Minister will be well aware that flooding has been an emotive issue in Essex going right back to the great flood of 1953 when more than 100 Essex people were killed? Will he thus assure the House, and especially Essex Members, that the Government will not try to cram excessive numbers of houses into flood-plain areas in the Thames Gateway if the Environment Agency specifically recommends against that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51116-01_spmin4"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 The proposals that I have mentioned will give the Environment Agency greater influence on matters involving flood-risk areas&#151;we will certainly consider that. As I said, it will be the right of local authorities to make a decision on these matters. The Environment Agency can give advice and there will be a statutory requirement to consult it. However, I reserve the right to make a judgment at the end of the day.

<a name="stpa_0">The hon. Gentleman is right that there are difficulties with the resources available. We have doubled them, but as he will know from a reply that I gave the last time that the House considered the matter, the Conservative party&#039;s proposal at the last election was to cut the money available for flood defences. In the election that is underway, perhaps he should ask the candidates whether they will continue with that policy, or change it.

Will my right hon. Friend ensure that the Environment Agency takes an interest in the planning application and, indeed, puts forward any objections that it might have?

Is the Minister not aware that, irrespective of what happens to the South West regional assembly, the fact that the police, fire and ambulance services are, in effect, being regionalised and that planning is now being done not by local authorities but by those self-appointed people in Exeter means that we are facing the regionalisation of the south-west and the abolition of the 1,000-year-old county of Wiltshire?

 I was in Cornwall only the day before yesterday talking to the county council about how it uses its planning powers and works with the district councils, which also have planning powers.

 (Lab/Co-op): What progress is being made towards his targets for the construction of new (a) shared ownership and (b) affordable rented homes.  [28527]
</p>


<p><a name="st_31"><a name="51116-02_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Jim Fitzpatrick): </b> 
 Our policy &quot;Sustainable Communities: Homes for All&quot; sets out the Government&#039;s plans to deliver more affordable housing over the next five years. Measures include delivery of 75,000 social rented homes by 2008 and assisting more than 80,000 first-time buyers and key workers to achieve home ownership by 2010. Those targets include both new build and acquisition; there are no separate targets for the construction of new shared ownership or affordable rented homes.
</p>





<p><a name="st_32"><a name="51116-02_spnew10"><b> Mr. Love: </b> 
 I congratulate the Government on their action on shared ownership. My concern is about affordable rented accommodation, especially in the capital. That is partly to do with construction cost inflation and the need for larger homes, but mainly it relates to the needs of the large number of people who are homeless or living in overcrowded accommodation. What action is my hon. Friend taking to deliver more resources for social rented homes in the capital?
</p>





<p><a name="st_33"><a name="51116-02_spnew11"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 I can assure my hon. Friend that the Government&#039;s success so far demonstrates that we will be successful with the capital as well. On homelessness targets, for example, we have ended the scandal of families in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. We have taken two thirds of rough sleepers off the streets and between now and 2010 we will deal with the 2 million homes that were below the decency threshold, which were left to us in 1997. We have spent &#163;5 billion over the past three years on socially affordable homes. We intend to spend &#163;3.9 billion over the next three years. The share of London and the south-east in that capital project is considerable.

 The hon. Gentleman says that he and his constituents are fed up with the setting of targets. The Government&#039;s programme in dealing with the 2 million homes that were below the decency threshold is clearly on track. I have quoted statistics relating to our dealing with the scandals of families in bed-and-breakfast accommodation and homelessness, and we are clearly on track. We issued new planning policy guidance earlier this year, which will help local authorities. We have consulted on one of the Kate Barker recommendations. The new planning policy statement will be responded to before the end of the year. That will help not only Shipley but the whole of the United Kingdom.

We have been working closely both with the Mayor and London local authorities. I have mentioned the fact that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has allocated money for housing, and considerable elements of it are going towards London; it will get its fair share. The arrangements between ourselves, the Mayor and London local authorities can only demonstrate that this approach will be successful for the capital.

 We have doubled the investment in socially affordable homes since 1997, as I have mentioned. We are working as hard as we can.

We are working with the Housing Corporation to ensure that those in need of homes get them as soon as possible.

 The Government set out our commitment to the Thames Gateway in our strategy document earlier this year.

Both the London and Thurrock urban development corporations received planning powers in October 2005.

 If I look irritated and disappointed it is not synthetic. We have had the Thurrock Urban Development Corporation for two years but there is very little to show for it. A different Minister answers questions about it every time, and I want to know when we will have housing units and tangible assets to show for our manifesto commitment to create that UDC. It has a lifespan of seven years&#151;two years in, there is very little to show for it, so I want some movement now.

 Between 1997 and 2004 the number of whole-time firefighters in England has fallen from 32,033 to 31,856. During this period the number of whole-time firefighters in Northamptonshire has risen from 286 to 311.

 The regional incident response unit which would be deployed in the case of a terrorist attack is based at a fire station in my constituency.

</p>





<p><a name="st_56"><a name="51116-03_spnew13"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 If I may answer on behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister, what he thinks is a good idea is that the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 placed a responsibility for deployment, the number of fire appliances, resources and staff in the hands of local fire and rescue authorities and the chief fire officer, in consultation with colleagues and with local communities. That Act is clearly having an impact. The public service agreement targets set for the number of deaths and injuries in the UK indicate a successful reduction in 2003 and 2004 in England and in Northamptonshire. The fire service is modernising itself. It is becoming more resilient and repositioning itself to do more by way of prevention, not just responding to 999 calls. That is working.

Action is necessary to cure the situation where, under the previous Government, of whom he was a member&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Oh yes, this is why we have the problem.

 The right hon. Gentleman is right that the amount of money that the Child Support Agency gets in is not substantially greater than the amount of money that it costs to administer it. That is different from the situation in 1997, when it was the other way round. However, I make no defence of the current situation. The CSA is in an extremely difficult position for a very simple reason, and it is as well that we are absolutely frank about that. It is the investigating agency, then it is the adjudicating agency, and then it is the enforcement agency. That is an extremely difficult situation, and the staff who have to work in the present system do so in conditions of very great difficulty. The right hon. Gentleman should remember why the CSA&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Incidentally, the Conservatives created it, and when we took over its administrative costs outweighed the amount of money that it got in.

<p><a name="st_83"><a name="51116-03_spnew27"><b> Mr. Charles Kennedy: </b> 
 The Prime Minister tells the House that he is looking urgently at the situation. However, he was looking urgently at it as Prime Minister seven years ago. What has happened in the intervening period? In the past four years, there have been 35,000 cases of maladministration, and there is now a backlog of 350,000 cases. Unpaid maintenance now stands at &#163;1.7 billion. What on earth can the Prime Minister mean by &quot;urgently&quot; in the light of such a disgraceful record?

<p><a name="st_84"><a name="51116-03_spmin16"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 We legislated on this before, to simplify the procedure involved, and that has reduced the costs quite considerably. However, the basic problem remains. I am not disputing the difficulties; indeed, I agree that they exist. Let me make a point that emphasises those difficulties. As the figures to which the right hon. Gentleman referred show, the vast majority of the compensation payments&#151;33,000 of the 35,000&#151;were for amounts less than &#163;1,000&#151;

<p><a name="st_86"><a name="51116-03_spmin17"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Of course it is, but it is extremely difficult to make this operation cost-effective when the agency is the investigating, adjudicating and enforcing authority. Furthermore, in the majority of cases that the agency deals with, the child concerned is the product neither of a married relationship nor of a stable partnership. All I am saying is that the task that we are asking the agency to perform is an extremely difficult one&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;What are you going to do about it?&quot;] I was about to say that we cannot discuss sensibly the Child Support Agency unless we are prepared to look urgently at the fundamental nature of the task that it performs, and at the reasons why it was set up in the first place. For reasons that I understand, the previous Conservative Government established the agency to ensure that parents carried out their obligations to their children. The truth is that the agency is not properly suited to carry out that task.

As to the reason we are initiating this, obviously many people believe that such mergers will help operational efficiency, but that has to be tested in the consultation that is conducted in my hon. Friend&#039;s area as in others. We will obviously look carefully at the results of that consultation.
</p>





<p><a name="qn_10">Q4.  [28542]<a name="51116-03_wqn6"><b> Mr. Edward Vaizey  (Wantage)</b> 
 (Con): We have excellent doctors and nurses working in the national health service in Oxfordshire, but they are facing ward closures and redundancies. Everyone in our county agrees that the &#163;35 million deficit has been caused by demonstrably unfair funding for Oxfordshire, health inflation and bureaucratic reorganisation. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 967</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>As <i>The Oxford Times&#151;</i>a newspaper I know the Prime Minister read avidly as a student&#151;has said, &quot;Ministers should not be&quot;&#151;

 Order. The Prime Minister can read <i>The Oxford Times</i> at his leisure.
</p>





<p><a name="st_96"><a name="51116-03_spmin23"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It is not only that the nurses and doctors are excellent in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s area; there are many more of them under this Government. In fact, to be precise, there are 2,700 more nurses, 390 more consultants and 516 more doctors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-03_para7">
<a name="stpa_10">Also, the South West Oxfordshire primary care trust has &#163;166 million of funding, which is an increase of 6.5 per cent. on the previous year. It is true that there is a deficit in the South West Oxfordshire PCT. Last year, three organisations, of which it was one, were responsible for the &#163;11.5 million deficit in that area, which was offset against surpluses in the remaining seven organisations. However much money is put into the NHS, there must be proper financial control. With the massive additional sums of money going into our health service, it is important that that money is properly used. I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman agreed with that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_97"><a name="51116-03_spnew33"><b> Mr. Clive Betts  (Sheffield, Attercliffe)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend might not be aware that Firstbus in South Yorkshire has recently increased fares by more than 15 per cent. in some cases. That is the fourth fare increase in 12 months. Fare increases, together with regular cuts in services, have reduced passenger numbers in South Yorkshire by 30 per cent. over the past 10 years. Does he now agree that it is time to end the deregulation introduced by the Conservative party, and to move to the sort of regulatory regime for public transport that has been so successful in increasing passenger numbers in London?
</p>





<p><a name="st_98"><a name="51116-03_spmin24"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 As my hon. Friend will know, we keep the matter under review. As I said earlier, however, whatever system of regulation there is, there will obviously be a limit on the resources available.
</p>





<p><a name="qn_11">Q5.  [28543]<a name="51116-03_wqn7"><b> Mr. Jeremy Browne  (Taunton)</b> 
 (LD): Is the Prime Minister aware that in Somerset the Government are amalgamating our four NHS primary care trusts, regionalising our fire control centre and creating a huge new merged police force? Is not the inescapable conclusion that both in the overall direction of policy and their overall character traits, the Government are now increasingly centralised, less accountable, more remote and more and more out of touch?
</p>


<p><a name="st_99"><a name="51116-03_spmin25"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I think that the hon. Gentleman could have rehearsed that one a bit longer. There will be, and always have been, reorganisations of services to achieve the best operational efficiency. I cannot comment on the reorganisations in his area, although I am happy to write to him and do so. It is not something that this Government alone have introduced&#151;all Governments attempt to achieve the greatest efficiency in the way that services are configured. We should never say that the configuration at one particular time must exist for all time.

 (Lab):Can I tell the Prime Minister that coal health compensation payments to ex-miners in former coalfields such as north Staffordshire are making a real difference to their quality of life? There is growing anger and impatience, however, because miners who worked for small mines, which were licensed by the Coal Board, are not getting their pay-outs. Will he look into that, and if need be, will he change the rules?
</p>


<p><a name="st_100"><a name="51116-03_spmin26"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I pay tribute to the work that my hon. Friend has done on this matter. I agree that there has been positive progress on the coal health schemes. About &#163;1.8 million a day is being paid out, and in her constituency, for example, payments have amounted to almost &#163;12 million. I understand, however, that of the nearly 600,000 lung disease claims, about 2,600 involve small mines, and the Department of Trade and Industry has now agreed with the representatives of both the former British Coal miners and the independent small mines how those claims will be processed. They are now trying to increase the number of offers, which, I think, will run at about 50 a month. Some 760 have already been settled, and I will certainly look into how they can be processed faster.

Our ambassador to Baghdad suggests that those devices have come from Iran. Our major-general in the Basra area has asked for extra troops to seal the border and save British lives. The Government have refused that request. Given the Prime Minister&#039;s earlier comments about supporting our servicemen to the nth degree, how can he make that stand up?
</p>


<p><a name="st_101"><a name="51116-03_spmin27"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Obviously, we want to do, and must do, everything that is necessary to protect our troops in Basra. In our regular discussions with the armed forces about the numbers of troops that we have in Iraq, this issue arises, but it is not one that has led us or, as far as I am aware, the armed forces to believe that we need to increase the numbers of troops there. Of course we keep that constantly under review, but the most important way of protecting people down south and elsewhere is to build up the capability of the Iraqi forces themselves. In many parts of the south they are now in control of the policing of some areas, and ensuring that the security concerns of the local population and our own forces are dealt with.

<a name="51116-04_head0"><h3 align=center>Income Tax (Earnings Exemption for Persons Living in Poverty) (No. 2)</h3>
<a name="time_0">
<a name="51116-04_time0"><h5>12.32 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51116-04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown  (Cotswold) (Con):</b> 
 I beg to move,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide that income tax be not chargeable on the earnings of persons living in poverty.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-04_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The Bill is designed to alleviate poverty for some of the lowest-paid in our society. Those who earn less that 45 per cent. of the median of annual earnings, as defined by the Office for National Statistics, are struggling to survive on the equivalent of less than the minimum wage for working a 40-hour week. That group includes far too many of our youngest employees and elderly pensioners with a small amount of savings. I believe that there is a moral injustice in charging those people income tax on their meagre wages.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-04_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">I propose to abolish income tax permanently for that group, which, on the basis of current figures, includes all whose income is &#163;10,000 a year or less. Their income tax bills would be reduced by about &#163;872 per year, which would offer a considerable fillip to their wages, and, above all, provide an incentive to work and improve their standard of living.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-04_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">To enhance those proposals, I also suggest the adoption of a system whereby those earning between &#163;10,000 and &#163;15,000 a year can be phased into the existing tax system through a &#163;1 decrease in their new tax allowance for every additional &#163;1 that they earn. Those earning between &#163;10,000 and &#163;15,000 would pay half the income tax that they pay now, while those earning more than &#163;15,000 would be taxed according to the existing system. Although the means of introducing that method of easing low earners back into the existing income tax system would fall beyond the remit of my Bill, I believe that it would facilitate the implementation of my proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-04_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The Conservative party has a proud record of helping those who are most disadvantaged in society. We are the only political party in Britain that has always offered the poorest in society the opportunity to pull themselves out of poverty and make a better life for themselves, their families and their communities. Indeed, the Conservative who was Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1993 and 1997 is the only current Member of this House who has made a real reduction in income tax&#151;a reduction of 2p in the pound&#151;that has not been accompanied by an increase in national insurance contributions, more than compensating for the reduction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-04_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">Moreover, when the Conservative party was in office between 1990 and 1997, we helped 8.2 million of the poorest people on the basic rate of income tax by removing them from the system. That trend has, sadly, been reversed and, since 1997, 6.2 million of our poorest people have been dragged back into the system&#151;a striking contradiction to the principle of the Rooker-Wise amendment introduced by the Labour party in 1977. Together, we must all foster a tax system that offers opportunity rather than entrapment. We must not construct a system that dictates that the poor are to be permanently trapped at the bottom of the income league.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 972</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-04_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">We all know about the difficulties that have been faced by hard-working families. The failing tax credit system has led to wrongful payments to 1.9 million of our poorest families and to thousands of people being financially crippled because of administrative error&#151;and all at a cost of &#163;475 million a year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-04_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">My Bill aims to help to reverse that trend by taking 6.6 million of our lowest paid workers out of the income tax system altogether, and reducing the income tax burden for a further 6.1 million, thus helping a total of nearly 13 million people. That would result in more than &#163;5 billion being redirected from the Government coffers to the pockets of our lowest paid workers. I believe that, because of the balancing increases in public revenues, which I will set out in a moment, it should be possible to achieve that without serious reductions in funding for our public services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-04_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">Office for National Statistics figures show that we have an economy with only three quarters of those of working age actually in work. Moreover, there are some 625,000 employment vacancies, and there are more than 2 million people out of work who say that they would like to be in work. By allowing people to keep more of their own earnings, we will reduce welfare costs. Depending on the number of people who are encouraged back into work, that saving could be as much as &#163;2.5 billion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-04_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">My proposals would make tax avoidance less profitable and so help the Government to tackle the black market and to improve the health and safety issues facing unregistered workers. Hopefully, a tragedy of the kind we saw at Morecambe bay would never occur again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-04_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">Even Whitehall would make savings, as the Inland Revenue would not have to deal with the complex tax affairs of the low paid, who often change jobs, do a lot of casual work and drop in and out of employment. Sometimes, they work in the black economy. Those macro-economic benefits are of course important, but my Bill is designed, first and foremost, to help the poorest members of our work force, who will, for example, be able to choose to save more of their own earnings to counter the looming pensions crisis that so many of my constituents are having to struggle with, or to keep more of their wages so that they can start to pay off personal debts: unsecured debt has spiralled to a terrifying average of &#163;7,650 per household.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-04_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">Moreover, we will be able to reverse some of the disgraceful structural trends that have occurred in the past few years. Personal income tax allowances for the lower paid have failed to increase in line with inflation, contrary to the Rooker-Wise amendment. The poorest 10 per cent. of people in Britain have to give some 90 per cent. of their income to the Government, before credits, benefits and other allowances are provided. Above all, as the Department for Work and Pensions recently stated, the incomes of the poorest 10 per cent. of households after tax and benefits have fallen in each year since 2001.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-04_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">It is vital to remember that, by giving the poorest workers the opportunity to keep more of their hard-won income, we would be allowing them to spend their wages as they wish, resulting in increased indirect revenues that will help us to balance the loss of income tax revenues. There is a strong case that my reforms could be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 973</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>undertaken without significant reductions in Government revenue, due to the increase in indirect revenues, the decrease in welfare costs as people move into work, the increase in national insurance revenues, the savings in Government bureaucracy, and the tackling of tax-avoidance problems. Fundamentally, the reforms should result in increased growth and vibrancy of the economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-04_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">The Bill is designed to take people living in poverty permanently out of the income tax system. It should be supported by hon. Members on both sides of the House. Helping our lowest-paid workers is not a party political issue&#151;it is a moral good. This is a practicable proposal and a modern manifestation of the proud Conservative tradition of offering opportunity to all.

<p><a name="st_52">Amendment No. 6, in page 2, line 36, leave out Clause 4.</p>





<p><a name="st_53">Government amendments Nos. 27 to 29.</p>





<p><a name="st_54"><a name="51116-05_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I preface my remarks to this group of amending provisions by alluding to what happened in Committee. We had a very fruitful and productive series of sittings, with engaging debate and useful points being made by Members on both sides. On the many occasions, although, I think, not all, when I said that I would look further into particular matters, I have sought to do so and have tabled amending provisions, where appropriate. New clause 1 is the first example.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-05_para2">
<a name="stpa_15">Much disquiet and concern was expressed in Committee about the gap between the notification of someone&#039;s leave coming to an end or being curtailed for whatever reason and the one and only time permitted under the Bill to appeal against removal initially and then all the other elements leading up to the removal. Members of the Committee were concerned, as I said, because they did not want people to be committing an immigration offence if they stayed in the UK while bringing an in-time appeal against a removal decision. That was an entirely fair point and new clause 1 was tabled in the light of those genuine concerns expressed by Opposition Members in Committee. As I said, that was characteristic of the sensible and constructive manner in which the Committee&#039;s work was conducted. I am pleased to move new clause 1 in response.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_16">It is entirely a matter for the House authorities, but, under the broad heading of appeals, a significant number of amending provisions and amendments to them are appended that embrace a number of concerns. It is my intention&#151;I believe that it is in order, Mr. Speaker&#151;formally to speak to new clause 1 and then, in the fullness of time, to listen to all the concerns expressed in the debate, including the other amendments, and to respond appropriately to them. I prefer to do that, rather than pre-empt discussion by giving my view on every aspect of every other amendment in the group at this stage of our deliberations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-05_para4">
<a name="stpa_17">To finish speaking to new clause 1, where a person has no leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, a decision can be made that they should be removed from the country. By virtue of section 82(2)(g) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, that is an immigration decision, which gives rise to a right of appeal to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-05_para5">
<a name="stpa_18">If the appellant has made an asylum or human rights claim while in the UK, or argues that removal would result in a breach of their rights under EU law, that appeal can be brought prior to their removal from the UK. In all other cases, any right of appeal against a decision to remove can be exercised only once the appellant has left the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-05_para6">
<a name="stpa_19">The purpose of the new clause is to ensure that a person who has complied with the term of their leave&#151;that is, who has made an unsuccessful application for further leave in time, or who has existing leave curtailed&#151;is not liable to prosecution under section 24(1)(b)(i) of the Immigration Act 1971 as an overstayer during any period in which they can bring an in-country appeal against a decision to remove them from the UK, or in which such an appeal was pending.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 977</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-05_para7">
<a name="stpa_20">As I said in Committee, it is not our intention to force people who have observed the conditions of their leave to risk criminal sanction during their appeal. The new clause fits with principle that there should be a &quot;soft-touch, light-touch&quot; compliance regime for those who comply with our system of immigration control, but far stricter enforcement for those who abuse it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-05_para8">
<a name="stpa_21">The new clause fills a gap in the original Bill about which legitimate concerns were expressed. In Committee, I undertook to explore whether we needed to introduce further proposals and, if so, whether existing rules would provide a suitable vehicle or could be modified to do so. I also undertook to consider whether new legislation was needed. After much thought and reflection, we believe that it is on balance right and appropriate to include these provisions on the face of the Bill. That is the intention behind Government new clause 1.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-05_para9">
<a name="stpa_22">I repeat that I shall return to the Dispatch Box when other hon. Members have had a chance to state their case in respect of the new clause and the other amendments that are grouped with it, quite fairly, under the broad heading of &quot;Appeals&quot;.

 First, I appreciate the spirit in which the Minister has introduced the debate on the new clause. We had extremely valuable discussions in Committee, and we have few disputes about large portions of the Bill, but the Minister knows that some matters remain contentious, both in the House and among a wider audience.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_23">Secondly, this group of new clauses and amendments covers the whole of the first part of the Bill. That amounts to 13 clauses, so I have a lot of ground to cover in my speech. I hope that colleagues will forgive me for boring them to death over a period of time&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_56"><a name="51116-06_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Surely not.
</p>





<p><a name="st_57"><a name="51116-06_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 The Minister says, &quot;Surely not,&quot; but I look forward to hearing his views on the other amendments. I feel that he has an open mind on these matters, and that he may be moved to accept some of the proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_24">As we know, this part of the Bill removes the right of in-country appeal for leave to remain or for variation of leave from all applicants, other than those in the categories covered by clause 1(4). That means, for example, that international students applying for leave to remain or to vary their leave will have no right of appeal against refusal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_25">The Government intend that such applicants should have one right of appeal against a subsequent decision to remove them from the UK, but that appeal will be exercisable only outside the UK. Another problem noted in Committee is that applicants whose leave expires while they are awaiting a decision on a leave-to-remain application will become illegal overstayers, once they are told that their application has been unsuccessful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_26">All hon. Members will know that the consequences of overstaying illegally are serious. People in that position lose the right to work or study, and their access to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 978</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>benefits such as primary health care. On their way out of the UK, their passports are likely to be stamped with a record of the fact that they had no legal right to be in the UK. That would affect the likelihood of those people getting visas in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_27">One feature of the Bill&#039;s passage through the House so far has been that a wide range of bodies have raised grave concerns about the Government&#039;s intention to remove people&#039;s rights of appeal in respect of refused entry clearance or leave-to-remain applications. Universities UK, the Association of Colleges, the National Union of Students and the Council for International Education have expressed concern about the impact of the measures on international students. I regret that their fears were not allayed by the Minister in Committee. In addition, as the Minister is aware, we have received excellent advice from the Immigration Law Practitioners Association, which has briefed Members on both sides of the House. The association has raised serious concerns over this part of the Bill, which I hope to reflect in some of my remarks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_28">To set my remarks in context, I remind the House of       some basic statistics. In 2004, about 228,035 applications were made for leave to remain, of which 149,250&#151;about 66 per cent.&#151;were from international students. About 30 per cent., which is a large number, had to apply for a variation or extension of their leave to remain during their time in the UK. A significant number of people could be affected by the provisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_29">The net effect of the first 11 clauses is to make anyone who is refused an extension of leave with right of appeal under the amended section 88(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 an overstayer. In fact, it is a double blow, as the applicant is not only refused further leave but precipitately finds themselves categorised as an overstayer. As the Minister admitted in Committee, the individual is, in effect, criminalised and can be prosecuted and charged with the criminal offence of breaching immigration control. To be fair, I concur that that is a rare occurrence but, although I appreciate the spirit in which the Minister introduced new clause 1, there are other problems for the overstayer, which the Minister appeared to acknowledge in Committee and that are not rare. For example, an overstayer is immediately denied the right to work and their employer could be liable to prosecution, too. The overstayer is denied the right to access benefits and the right to study, and some rights of access to the health service. They could also be liable to detention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_30">The new clause does not cover those points at all. Far from clarifying the situation, as we expected after Committee, it merely addresses the question of the criminal offence and does so in a way that offers only a fairly loose promise that the Government will not prosecute in the future. It certainly does not address the range of difficulties facing the overstayer, or the issues we raised in Committee. The Minister must forgive me, but I feel that he has led us&#151;or certainly me&#151;down the garden path a little. I was heartened by what I thought was his real intention to amend the Bill&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> He protests, but he certainly gave a greater impression that he would be more flexible than has proved to be the reality.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-06_para13">
<a name="stpa_36">The Immigration Law Practitioners Association looked at the issue and has set out one element of our disappointment. The association believes that new clause 1 does not even rectify the problem in the limited context of the criminal offence. The Minister acknowledged that there is a long time between refusal of leave and the making of removal decisions. The effect of the new clause is to suspend the chance of prosecution until the appeal is finally determined. However, subsection (3) means that during the time between refusal of leave and the removal decision there is no protection from criminal prosecution&#151;certainly as I read it. The Minister&#039;s defence could be that it is not usual to prosecute, but if that is his line the provision looks more like window dressing than real movement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-06_para14">
<a name="stpa_37">There is further confusion. People with out-of-country appeals, even if they rapidly leave the UK, could have applications prejudiced by risk of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 980</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>endorsement as an overstayer. Under the immigration rules, leave to enter would normally be refused if the time limits on previous entries had failed to be observed, yet that person has no control over whether he overstays; he is simply in the hands of the Home Office and the timing of its decisions, with no redress. I hope that the Minister will deal with the issues raised by new clause 1 on the position of overstayers, which is still confusing, especially in respect of their entitlements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-06_para15">
<a name="stpa_38">I want to move on to some of the amendments tabled by my hon. Friends and me. As I pointed out earlier, about 30 per cent. of international students&#151;about 45,000&#151;apply for variation or extension to their leave. Common reasons for those applications, as I am sure the Minister is well aware, are to complete PhD studies, to   transfer courses from one university or college to another, to attend graduation ceremonies or even to attend vivas. With the amendments, I am trying to probe the Government to find out whether they will consider the position of students in those catch-22 situations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-06_para16">
<a name="stpa_39">The educational world is seriously concerned, and so am I. I hope that the Minister agrees that, over several years, there has been broad cross-party support for the principle that where a subjective decision-making process could lead to mistakes there should be a right of appeal. That is really not an excessive request in the United Kingdom. However, under the legislation, thousands of individuals could be left on the wrong side of the law through no fault of their own, by becoming illegal overstayers the moment that the decision to refuse their application has been made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-06_para17">
<a name="stpa_40">Concern in the education sector has been driven by an awareness of the reputational damage that such a change could have on the UK as a study destination. Already, as we discussed in Committee, a raft of recent measures, which includes substantial increases in fees for leave-to-remain applications and initial visas, has had an impact&#151;possibly damaging&#151;on international student recruitment. There is growing evidence to suggest that international students are beginning to choose to study elsewhere.

 I appreciate that it is early days in the application process, but what the hon. Lady has just said is entirely wrong. Early signs are that international student applications in this country are up 5 per cent., not that they are appreciably down or that there is a trend downwards. That is simply a matter of fact from Universities UK.

<p><a name="st_63"><a name="51116-07_spnew1"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 The Minister needs to consider this in relative terms. Although he believes that applications are up 5 per cent., I suggest that he look at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&#039;s report on the UK&#039;s market share in international student recruitment, which shows that the number is down by 3 per cent., although I agree that that covers the period since 1999. Acceptances for international undergraduates through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service from key markets are also down this year in certain areas&#151;by 22.5 per cent. for China, by 18.6 per cent. for Singapore, and by 7.9 per cent. for Malaysia. Those statistics have been provided by Universities UK.

<a name="51116-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_41">Some 40 per cent. of vice-chancellors who responded to a Universities UK survey in December last year reported that they had seen a fall or no increase in the number of international student enrolments in the last academic year, and 50 per cent. said that they had missed their targets for international student recruitment. According to a snapshot survey by Universities UK, many institutions report a decline in international student enrolments for entry in 2005 compared with 2004. That decline inevitably means heavy financial losses for institutions&#151;some universities report expected losses of between &#163;1 million and &#163;3 million this year.

<a name="stpa_42">UK Visas reports a decline in student visa applications in a number of key posts, including Beijing, Islamabad, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Chennai. In Beijing, student visa applications are down by 38 per cent. and in Islamabad by about 37 per cent. In the further education sector, colleges report decreases of 20 per cent. in their income from international fees. I find it hard to understand where the Minister&#039;s information about an increase in applications comes from when the evidence that Universities UK has put before me shows quite a different position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_43">At the same time, for example, the USA has had an increase in student applications during 2005, and is issuing about 15 per cent. more student visas this year compared with previous years, encouraged by a US Government campaign in China to attract international students to US institutions. I am informed that US visa officers have been advised to concentrate on the intention or ability to study, rather than on the intention to leave on completion of the course. Visa officers concentrated previously on the intention to leave and often had doubts about applicants&#039; intentions to leave, and therefore refused more applications.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_44">Australia has been running an electronic visa application system in China for several months, and it is proving popular with international students owing to its efficiency and speed. It appears that electronic applications for UK visas in countries such as China are still several years away.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_45">All those indicators certainly show that we are not doing our best to encourage international students to study in this country. Certainly, in the context of increasing global competition and given the evidence that the market may be suffering, the Government should not press ahead with these potentially damaging measures. Although the downturn cannot be attributed to a single factor&#151;I am being fair&#151;visa changes are still the most commonly cited reason for recruitment difficulties this year.

That is very welcome. However, he has not addressed concerns about the fact that the appeal against removal will not be exercisable in the UK.

 Entirely in support of that proposition, may I tell the hon. Lady something that is not theory, but a real experience that many hon. Members have had to deal with for their own constituents and others? I know of someone from Latin America who did a masters degree for a year, finished in the summer and graduated in December, but was required to go back with all the additional expense entailed. In the meantime they were being encouraged to apply for both jobs and further academic opportunities, but they could not do that if they were not in this country, so their whole career was put in jeopardy because of the imposition of that requirement.

Unfortunately, these amendments are more narrowly focused on preserving appeals only for international students. Since the Minister repeatedly emphasised in Committee that he understood the education sector&#039;s concerns, we hope that he will now reconsider at least some of these proposals. I should like him to tell us whether he has had any representation from the Department for Education and Skills about how it feels about the provisions that he is proposing from the Home Office.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-07_para7">
<a name="stpa_48">Again, we must put the proposals clearly into context. There are 210,510 international students in higher education in the UK today. International fee income 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 983</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>accounts for 8 per cent. of the total income to the higher education sector. That is about &#163;1.5 billion a year. A further 75,000 international students are studying in further education colleges, and they bring &#163;58 million in tuition fees alone into the FE sector. It is estimated that, in the round, international students contribute about &#163;5 billion to the UK economy through their spending on goods, services, accommodation and so on.

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="51116-07_spnew6"><b> Sir Robert Smith  (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD):</b> 
 May I just reinforce the importance of not just that direct economic contribution, but the long-term lifetime contribution of those students&#039; links with the UK, especially if they have studied a practical subject such as engineering? They are much more likely to look favourably on dealing and trading with us when they go back to become major decision makers in their own countries. How we treat them makes a big difference to how they will relate to this country in the future.

<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51116-07_spnew7"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. We are sending the wrong message around the world about the way in which we welcome students here. We are underestimating the enormous long-term benefits that people who are educated in this country can enjoy. Many hon. Members will have been to places abroad where people have said proudly that they were educated in the United Kingdom. That is seen as a badge of honour, so the Government must take anything that damages our reputation in that area seriously before deciding to dispense with public relations so readily through such a draconian measure.

Even on the Government&#039;s figures, at least 25 per cent. of international students&#039; appeals succeed at the moment. Secondly, it is awful to give out the signal internationally that such young people may be criminalised for wanting to stay on in the course of their legitimate studies. The situation is utterly appalling.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his words. I hope that he will make a contribution to the debate, certainly about Government amendment No. 27, which relates to monitoring. If we were dealing with a situation in which few mistakes were made and the process was not subjective, we might feel more comfortable. Unfortunately, that is not the case, which explains the concerns being expressed in all quarters of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_49">Let me continue to put the matter in context. Education and training exports are worth &#163;10.2 billion a year. I do not know whether the Minister is aware that that is more than the amount for food, tobacco, drink, insurance, trips and aircraft. The Chancellor predicted that the figure could be twice that by 2020. If we send out the wrong messages abroad, we will jeopardise that income to UK plc.

<br>&nbsp;<br>and courses. It is perfectly proper not to want someone to keep applying to come back again and again when they never pass any exams and are still here seven years after they first came.

As the European Commission tells us&#151;goodness knows why I believe the European Commission on this occasion, but I think I probably do&#151;Europe is 700,000 scientists short of meeting what was originally the Lisbon goal of making Europe into a competitive and dynamic set of knowledge-driven economies.

I admit that the US also lost market share after tightening up on visas following 9/11. It suffered a 2 per cent. drop in 2002&#150;03, but it has learned its lesson and eased up on its visa restrictions. The UK could learn a lesson from the Americans on this matter.

The amendment is an attempt to address the heart of our concerns about the Bill.

He said that he was confident that the new points system would improve initial decision making.

 My hon. Friend tempts me to go down an enticing route. Yes, the performance of many Government agencies is sadly lacking, especially the Child Support Agency, which has an appalling record.

There is a considerable body of evidence to suggest that the reasons for refusal are frequently inappropriate or based on a simple misunderstanding of the facts of the case in question. In 2003, we were told that 52 per cent. of all applicants who had been refused initial entry clearance appealed successfully. In cases relating to international students, the official proportion of successful appeals is 25 per cent., but the Immigration Advisory Service states that the appeal was successful in 49 per cent. of the cases in which it acted on behalf of students.

<a name="stpa_63">In 90 per cent. of the cases involving international students who had accepted offers from the university of Sheffield and who were refused visas, either a successful appeal was made or, more commonly, the entry clearance post reconsidered the case before it reached appeal. Professor Bob Boucher, vice-chancellor of the university of Sheffield, has repeatedly made the point that without the right of appeal the incentive for entry clearance officers to reverse a visa refusal following representations will no longer exist. He is echoing a point that is extremely familiar to the House. In 1992, the then shadow Home Secretary opposed a similar measure in the Bill that became the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993, which removed the right of appeal for rejected visitors and short-term students. He said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;When a right of appeal is removed, what is removed is a valuable and necessary constraint on those who exercise original jurisdiction . . .

<a name="stpa_66">Unbelievable. Another university reports considerable difficulty in recent months with the visa application process, especially from China and South Asia. It said that on one academic linkage between the university and a partner institution in China, out of 25 applications only 10 were successful in obtaining a visa and then only after two or three attempts. Only as a result of the intervention of senior university staff and Ministry staff in China was a higher level of success achieved, despite it being a joint programme. It said that there appeared to be little appreciation that students had studied two years in China prior to application with the specific intent to transfer for the third and final year to a UK   university. The university believes that it loses between 200 and 300 genuine students each year due to   careless screening, inappropriate questioning and unsympathetic consideration by some visa clearance officers sending the signal of &quot;fortress Britain&quot;, where students are not necessarily welcome.

For one student, doubts were expressed about the student&#039;s ability to maintain and accommodate herself&#151;notwithstanding the fact that she had a grant from her own home Government to cover all of her costs. The immigration officer in the case also said that there was no reason for her to experience the British education system, which runs contrary to the spirit of the Prime Minister&#039;s initiative. There seems to be scope for further training of ECOs on the importance and quality of UK education. One institution reported that a prospective student from China was told that the course he proposed to study was widely available in China, led to the same qualification at significantly cheaper cost, and said that he could not satisfactorily explain why he did not undertake the course in China.

The big boys such as Warwick and Birmingham are experiencing falls, just as Derby, Greenwich and Southampton Solent are. We won&#039;t know the exact figures until mid-November . . . so we don&#039;t know yet whether overall overseas student numbers will be down. But we do know that a substantial number of universities are worried. Overseas students have kept British universities afloat, particularly in some subjects.

And China, which used to send large numbers of students abroad, is now recruiting overseas students to its shores.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="st_80"><a name="51116-09_spnew0"><b> Mr. Neil Gerrard  (Walthamstow) (Lab):</b> 
 I shall try to be briefer than the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) was in explaining my concerns about new clause 1 and amendments Nos. 47, 6 and 33.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_73">New clause 1 is generally welcome because it goes some way to meeting some of the concerns raised in Committee about the position of people whose leave had been curtailed or whose application for variation of leave had been refused and whether they would immediately be committing an offence. There are still some uncertainties. What exactly does it mean and how will it operate? I would be grateful if the Minister could address some of those issues when he replies.
<a name="time_4">
<a name="51116-09_time0"><h5>1.30 pm</h5>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_74">Subsection (3) is in the middle of the list of conditions that someone has to fulfil in order not to commit an offence. The condition is
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;that a decision has been made to remove the person from the United Kingdom.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_75">What does that mean in practice? Does it mean that the person has been served with notice of decision to remove, for example? There are many examples where decisions are taken to refuse an application of one sort or another. The decisions having been taken, there is then quite a considerable gap before anything happens about a removal decision. There is certainly a gap before the removal decision is served on the person concerned. I would like there to be clarify on what that condition will mean in practice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-09_para3">
<a name="stpa_76">Secondly, if somebody is covered by new clause 1, is not committing an offence and is awaiting an appeal, exactly what rights do they retain given the permissions that they already have? If someone had an entitlement to work, will that entitlement continue until the time where either removal or appeal occurs? People might be entitled to benefits or other forms of support. They will certainly be coming under some of the conditions in the clause in future. There are those who have been given refugee status&#151;which will now be a temporary protection&#151;whose leave has been curtailed. Will someone in that position still be entitled to any form of support when they are awaiting a decision on appeal? It would be helpful to have some clarity. The clause is well intentioned, but I am not convinced that it is drafted perfectly to cover all situations that might arise.
</p>





<p><a name="st_81"><a name="51116-09_spnew1"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 I endorse and underline the point about the need for certainty, especially as regards the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 989</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>right to continue in employment. The benefits system is also important. In my experience, there are many cases where people have had the right to work and then find themselves in the in-between period. They need to be able to produce something to confirm that they continue to have the right to work, that they are self-sufficient and are independent, otherwise they suddenly have to look to the state or to other people for benefits. That means that their prospects are again put at risk. Clearly, an employer does not want to break the law. It is an important issue and clarity is needed.
</p>





<p><a name="st_82"><a name="51116-09_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gerrard: </b> 
 That situation frequently occurs now. Someone may have been given temporary permission and perhaps exceptional leave to remain, which is coming to an end. They submit an application for indefinite leave, but that will take months to determine. Although their entitlements continue, if they do not have a piece of paper that proves that, there will be problems. I have come across many cases of people having employment problems who have been in that situation. There are also many people who have problems in accessing benefits where the Benefits Agency has not been prepared to accept that the earlier permission still existed. There is then the performance of having to get in touch with the Home Office for confirmation. We need absolute clarity and certainty about what someone&#039;s rights will be during the interim period. We must be clear about the meaning of the clause. I suspect that the drafting still has some holes in it.

<p><a name="st_83"><a name="51116-09_spnew3"><b> Sarah Teather  (Brent, East) (LD):</b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the problem is exacerbated by the time that it takes the Home Office to make decisions and by the complete opacity of its replies to constituents and to their solicitors? There is no information contained in the letters detailing whether these people really have the right to work or what their status is. This causes the problem. If we could have clarity and speedy decision-making, the situation would be improved.

<p><a name="st_84"><a name="51116-09_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gerrard: </b> 
 That is right. Ministers agreed fairly recently that they would look at the form of the letters that are being sent out to ensure that they are clearer in what they say. I hope that there will be improvements and that we shall get away from the notorious 30-week letters that state that decisions will be made within 30 weeks, and then six months later a constituent is asking his MP what is happening.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_77">Irrespective of the contents of the letters, it is important to be clear about how the new clause will operate and what people&#039;s rights will be. We need to know what they are entitled to and what is meant by, for example, a decision to remove. If we do not have that clarity, many people will be in confused situations, with the Benefits Agency, housing authorities and employers not really knowing quite where they stand. Many people will be ending up on our doorsteps wanting help and wanting to know just where they are in the process.

That is one clear category of person. I hope that he will consider using the powers rather more widely. There are, for example, unaccompanied minors. There are other categories of people whom I hope my hon. Friend will consider.

People who are given refugee status are no longer given indefinite leave to remain and receive only temporary protection, and clause 1 creates a right of appeal for them if their leave is curtailed in future. Caution is therefore required in removing that provision.

 I am grateful, as that is obviously important. I do not like the new measure which removes indefinite leave for people who are given refugee status.

<a name="stpa_84">In Committee, I raised the issue of unaccompanied minors and, encouragingly, the Minister suggested that he was prepared to look at the issue. Quite a few minors who apply for asylum are simply granted discretionary leave for a year&#151;in some cases, it is less than a year&#151;every year until they reach the age of 18. When they do so they are refused variation of leave on the ground that leave was only granted on the basis of age. People who are given leave for one year or less after being refused asylum do not have the right to appeal against that refusal. Unaccompanied minors or children are given a decision on the variation of leave at 18, but they do not have the right to appeal against the initial refusal. If clause 1 ends the right to appeal against the variation of leave, many of those unaccompanied children will not have any right to appeal at any point in the process against the substantive decision on their asylum claim. That serious problem has been created by the legislation.

 I hope that we can rid of clause 1, but if we do nothing else today, I hope that Ministers will respond positively to what the hon. Gentleman says. People come here on their own&#151;often without any family to leave behind&#151;from Afghanistan, Iraq, Sierra Leone and central Africa, which has suffered from civil war. They do not have anyone else in the world, but they do brilliantly here&#151;they gain a place at university or college and can contribute to the British economy. Suddenly, at 18, 18&#189; or 19, they are told that they must go home. However, they do not have a home to go to, so they must have a chance to appeal.
</p>





<p><a name="st_88"><a name="51116-10_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gerrard: </b> 
 I accept that. In Committee, the Minister accepted that this was a serious issue and that he needed to explore what could be done. He could make a statement that he will use the powers available to him under clause 1 to ensure that unaccompanied minors, as well as people who are granted humanitarian protection, will keep the right of appeal. I hope that at the very least that is what we achieve. Support for unaccompanied minors could also be a problem under Government new clause 1, as it is not clear that such children are still entitled to support from the local authority if they are leaving care, as is supposed to be the case for all children leaving care.

 Young single men have been disproportionately affected by the regulations on family visitor appeals.

 May I echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech)?

 I am sure that Members who deal with such cases will know of similar instances. For example, I recently learned that two sisters applied for a visa to visit.

If there is no right of appeal there is clearly a problem, which is why I am seeking assurances from the Minister.

It would be useful to know exactly how that will operate and whether the extension applies to the monitor who deals with other types of case or whether there will be an additional monitor. Many hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_87">The problem with clause 1 is that people will not be allowed to appeal against a refusal of extension of leave in country. Students, workers and spouses will lose their in-country right of appeal and will have to leave the country in order to appeal. That seems an unfair way of treating people who are in the United Kingdom legally, have abided by the terms of their leave and are simply seeking to extend it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_88">Sometimes the initial leave is given with a view to the likelihood of further leave being granted in future. A spouse or an unmarried or civil partner is expected to stay with their partner for more than the initial two year period, of course. If there were doubts about that, they 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 993</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>would not have been given leave in the first place. The granting of leave in such a case presupposes a reasonable right to apply for leave and therefore to appeal against decisions that are wrong, without having to seek human rights grounds on which to do so. In addition, business people are welcomed to the UK with limited leave in order to set up a business. I presume the expectation is that they will grow that business once they are here, and therefore seek leave to remain more than two years, particularly in view of the provision that they invest more than &#163;200,000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_89">Various groups of people would be affected by the clause. I have mentioned some of them. They include a person married here who has been living two years with their British citizen or British resident spouse, perhaps with children, who has been refused indefinite leave to remain on the basis of that marriage. I will deal in a moment with the proportion of decisions that are won on appeal. It is pretty significant to get that wrong and separate people from their spouse and/or their children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_90">The clause would also affect a work permit-holder&#151;for example, a nurse, a maths teacher or a head of an export department in a big company, whose employer wants them to extend their contract but whose application is refused, at least in the average third of cases where that decision is wrong; a person established in a business, who has invested &#163;200,000 or more, and who has created, under the regulations, at least two jobs for people settled in the UK; and a student several years into their studies&#151;we heard examples of how they might be affected in respect of graduation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_91">The Government&#039;s position seems extremely unreasonable. It is not as if such people had hopeless cases. There is no right of appeal in the case of mandatory refusals&#151;that is, where there is a mandatory requirement on the basis of age or nationality, or specific requirements to switch from one category of leave to another. Those cases do not attract a right of appeal. As I said, 33 per cent. of in-country non-asylum appeals succeeded in 2003, the last year for which figures are available. The Government have never justified the sweeping powers in clause 1.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_92">The Minister suggested in Committee that it was unfair to give a right of appeal against a refusal to vary leave in cases where the decision results in people having no leave left, whereas those who applied and were refused before their original leave runs out get no such appeal. However, that unfairness does not exist in practice, because as we know, the Home Office urges people not to apply for a variation, such as an extension, until shortly&#151;usually a month&#151;before their leave expires. When a person applies for a variation and is refused before their leave runs out, the normal practice would be for them to make a fresh application before the leave expires. It is not an appeal, but it provides an opportunity to address what are said to be the shortcomings in their original application, which are identified in the refusal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_93">At present, people prefer not to do that because of the cost, but if they are faced with the prospect of becoming overstayers if they do not, more will apply earlier. If more people apply more than a month before their leave runs out, that will create more bureaucracy or a replacement bureaucracy for the Home Office. That

<a name="stpa_95">Our main concerns about clause 1, in summary, are that the Government&#039;s desire for a single appeal can be achieved using existing powers. If the object is streamlining, we demonstrated in Committee that there are alternative ways to achieve that. We are not opposed absolutely to streamlining, but the provision is not a fair way of doing so. It is misleading to say, as the clause does, that people will still have a right of appeal against removal, if they will be able to exercise it only after they have left the UK. That is not the same thing. It puts people at a significant disadvantage and it is no cheaper for the Home Office to run the appeal from abroad. If anything, it may well be more expensive. The Government are relying on people not bothering to appeal. Denial of justice is not a substitute for justice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-10_para11">
<a name="stpa_96">We have already explained that the Home Office decision making is poor, so the best thing the Home Office could do is improve decision making, not deny appeal rights. The rights at stake are important. We have discussed the situation of spouses and people who are investing or working or who want to continue their rights to education and training. The opportunity for all these good things&#151;family life, more education and training, investment&#151;will be lost if people have to leave the country for an appeal against removal. The current system is not broken in terms of its structure. Decision making could be improved, but it does not need fixing on the suggested basis.

<a name="stpa_97">In Committee the Minister spoke at length about the new managed migration schemes. I am not inviting him to do so again, as he spoke eloquently and with passion on the subject then. Whatever the system is, there will still be the problem of people seeking to extend their leave. The Government say there will be a new and better scheme, but that does not solve the problem of injustice. There will still be human rights applications, which will still be allowed, but because of the fracture to family life that will result from the provision, more people will attempt to make such appeals than would otherwise be the case. The Government will not gain as much as they anticipate.

Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan), that people are effectively overstayers when they receive the first judgment&#151;that is, they do not get extended leave. I am disappointed by new clause 1, which is why I tabled a series of amendments. The hon. Lady and the hon.

However, given all the issues that were raised, not least by the hon. Member for Walthamstow, the new clause does not do so at all.

If he can give that undertaking, it would be welcome. However, if the Government propose nothing more than new clause 1 to deal with the issues raised by calling people overstayers before they have had a chance to exercise their right of appeal, that is a problem. Does he recognise that people who lodge a human rights appeal have an in-country right of appeal, and that, like everyone else with an in-country right of appeal now, they are allowed to stay in the country on the basis of their existing conditions while that appeal is heard? Even when there is a human rights appeal to be heard and it is not certified as clearly unfounded, the Government are saying that those people will still be treated as overstayers. That is a real change for people in the country who are arguing a non-certified human rights claim. Will the Minister at least concede that those people should not be considered as overstayers and that their existing leave should carry through to the appeal stage, as it does now? Does he think that anyone should be entitled to carry through their appeal right, and if so, who?

: I rise to support amendment No. 3, amendment (c) and the consequential amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats. The most controversial parts of the Bill, clauses 1 and 4, also cause the most concern. They would result in there being no more in-country appeals in variation cases in which people had applied to extend their leave or to change from one category to another. I understand the need to tidy up in this area, but the Bill is not the right vehicle for that exercise&#151;at least, not the Bill as currently framed.

All our universities depend to a large degree on international students. We should be proud of the fact that people come here to study, succeed, and make an economic contribution to society&#151;whether in the UK or abroad, it matters not.

<a name="stpa_159">I went to Aberystwyth university in Wales in the early 1970s, and I was proud to have friends there of many nationalities, including people from sub-Saharan Africa and many from Iraq. Most of them were studying agriculture, and many went on to study for an MSc or PhD. They would probably not be allowed to do that now, because their time would be up. In March this year, I met two members of the Iraqi Cabinet who had studied in Wales, but it will be far more difficult for such people to study here in future, which is a great sadness&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister, in his usual way, shouts, &quot;Rubbish&quot;.

<a name="stpa_160">Home Office decision making is, as we all know, of poor quality, and one of the most important things that must be done is to improve the quality of that decision making.

<a name="stpa_161">We have heard many statistics today, one of which was that, according to the Government&#039;s figures, 25 per cent. of student appeals are successful.

It is unfortunate that this Government, of all people, are presenting such a measure and it is misleading to say that there is a right of appeal against removal when it will be exercised only when the person has left the UK.

<a name="stpa_164">Many variation cases will involve human rights claims, and as was said earlier, there is a right to present those human rights claims within the UK jurisdiction. Therefore, even on that basis, I fail to see how the Bill can be certified as being compliant with the Human Rights Act 1998, although time will tell. It is obvious to me&#151;to anyone, I think&#151;that human rights points will become stronger if people are forced to leave the UK pending appeal. It will, inevitably, bring the legislation into disrepute if, time after time, human rights cases are presented to defeat it.

Both seek to foster good relationships, and other Members of the House, across the parties, have been involved. The Commonwealth Youth Exchange Council gets involved when people are teenagers and growing up so that they will think well of our country and might consider this a place to come to, just as we want our young people to experience other countries.

 I do not underestimate some of the difficulties that many universities are experiencing, but I challenge the notion that either a &#163;50 increase in the cost of visas&#151;the first hook on which all the malaise of the HE sector was hung&#151;or what the Bill says about appeals is absolutely and quintessentially, which is how the universities sometimes put it, the reason for the malaise that affects some courses. There are substantive reasons for the fact that the huge success of the HE sector in recent years is now being challenged. The language used by some members of the sector suggests that the entire world is crumbling down. It is not&#151;there is a vibrancy about many courses, although I do not dispute the fact that some universities are experiencing difficulties with overseas recruitment for certain courses.

<a name="stpa_187">I should have made a point at the beginning of my speech. Someone kindly alluded to it earlier, and I accept that it is a difficulty. The Bill must be seen not just in the context of the consultation paper on the points system&#151;consultation ended only on 7 November&#151;but, as I said in Committee, in the context of all that we are trying to do in regard to the entry clearance officer decision-making process. I said in Committee, and will say again, that I accept the charge that all ECO decision making throughout the entire world that takes place under the auspices of UKvisas could, broadly, be improved. I have committed myself to ensuring that those improvements are undertaken now, and will continue to do so. The hon.

<p><a name="st_126"><a name="51116-14_spnew8"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I take that point, which is germane to what I just said about the link between commencement orders and other matters. However, I shall not go down that road. I think most fair-minded people would accept that the position is not as clear-cut as &quot;successful appeal equals bad initial decision&quot;&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is the import of what the hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_188">Limited empirical evidence from the National Audit Office and material that we discussed in Committee suggest that up to 50 per cent. of problems&#151;happily only 50 per cent.&#151;were caused by inaccurate or incomplete documentation at the start of the process, or by the absence of some element at the start of the decision making. We need to explore those issues, and I shall be more than happy to do so in a moment. However, the crude notion that appeal success equals bad initial decision is simply not sustainable.

Many cases are overturned as a result of initial decisions because academics draw attention to problems, and a manager examines the position again. How will the Bill deal with that? Surely the poor decision making in the Department is due to the complexity of the legislation and the ever-increasing number of changes that the Government are introducing. Would not better and better administration be preferable to more and more legislation?

<a name="stpa_189">My hon. Friend&#039;s other point is important in the context of the points system and the five-year plan. There is a separate tier for students. There is a far stronger accreditation system, rather than the simple flick-switch that caused some of the early difficulties that the hon. Member for North Thanet mentioned, where an institute is good or bad with nothing in between&#151;no gradation, no notion of its past experience or anything else.

 I think the Minister fairly reflects the disagreement in the Standing Committee about whether the high proportion of appeals that were won by applicants was due to poor decision making or new factors coming in. However, I think the point was made in Committee that when appeals go in, the papers are supposed to be collected by the entry clearance manager, who has the opportunity to reverse a decision that was made on the basis of incomplete information. When the manager does not do that, there has been a second opportunity, with all the information the appeal has, for that to be corrected, so the point still stands about poor decision making overall.

 I do not think that it does. I specifically refer to the 900 or 1,000 decisions that were looked at by the NAO, or whoever it was&#151;if it was not the NAO, I apologise. That was done deliberately before a second sift, as I understand it, by the entry clearance manager. The paperwork that was initially submitted was examined.

<br>&nbsp;<br>that they are ultimately connected, simply put, to fee structures or to what we are doing on appeals.

There is that initial contact at, if one likes, elite level, but then there is contact at a more general level, and affection for the country where one did that initial study. None of that I refute in any way, but we think&#151;in the context of the five-year plan, the points system and all the improvements that we are trying to make in terms of ECO decision making&#151;that the way forward that we are suggesting, with those elements rather than simply what is in the Bill, has merit for students.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his advice, but we are doing that now. We are doing any number of things in terms of the ECO process. Admittedly, we are just starting the process, but all those things are happening now. We are enhancing the role of the independent monitor. He will be full-time, but it is essentially the same post, to answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham. I hope that he or she will be appointed in January. We are enhancing training, there is quality focus in UKvisas and we have objectives on best practice. This is within our international obligations. There are best practice reviews, more management resources for posts, quality of refusal notices&#151;which are often a problem for many individuals and MPs&#151;and we are working more closely with judges. There is any number of other elements: risk assessment, so we are informed far more readily on where risks are involved, communications, and general awareness, where we have suffered in the past. Those and other elements are happening now.

<a name="51116-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_193">I said this clumsily in Committee, as the hon. Lady reminded us, but I think that rather than delay matters to some far-off time, there is merit in looking at the notion that only when elements of the points system are introduced completely should the commencement order on appeal systems happen. The House will forgive me for not saying simply in terms that when the points system in all its entirety is introduced, only then will there be a commencement order on the lifting of appeals. I made it clear to the Standing Committee that there will be some elements of the points system that can be introduced earlier than mid-2007. Save for those elements that may be introduced earlier, including tier one and the highly skilled migrants programme, I will say that I am happy not to go down the route of introducing the provisions of the Bill that refer to appeals until the points system is in place. Those points were made in Committee and they are fair.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_194">I am trying to think of a way where, on the premise we get the independent monitor in place in January, he or she can help in that process, having grown into the role over a year when these resources are going in. There may be a commensurate impact both on allowed decisions and refusals, and more generally on the appeal rate, but it is not going to give us significant evidence to say yea or nay in any mechanistic sense. However, I will say, with the caveats that I have mentioned, that we will not do that with the appeal process until we get there.

<a name="stpa_195">I will come back to money because it is in this huge pile here&#151;not the money but the point that the hon. Lady made. There are some specifics to which I want to refer. Some go to the debate and some to other points raised. We have had, apparently, legal advice to the effect that, following the ECJ cases of Panyatova and Dorr and Unal, certain classes of persons claiming under European Community association agreements are entitled to rights of appeal under EC law. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) alluded to that point earlier. I will give him this note.

We think that we can cover that through section 92 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2000. I shall write more fully to the hon. Gentleman about that.

 On the substantive elements in new clause 1, I shall disappoint the House in that the most compelling point made in Committee was about the issue of the twilight zone and criminality. New clause 1 addresses that matter, although it may be clumsy. The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) clearly said that the provision affects only a limited number of people. On the appeal right process&#151;non-suspensive appeals versus in-country appeals issue&#151;it is an even more limited group. The points made about criminality in the new clause are limited to those who would exercise on a notice of removal and through the one-tier appeal their right to pursue an asylum or human rights claim. That is the very narrow pool of people who are affected in that regard.

<p>
<a name="51116-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_197">Let me be clear&#151;those people will not get extensions to leave or the rights and benefits that leave accrues because, as a result of the position that they are in, they have no leave. There can be no leave to pursue. I do not want to reach the stage&#151;there has been evidence of it over the past three, four or five years&#151;of putting a perverse incentive in the core of a Bill under which those people, albeit small in number, queue up to make erroneous and capricious human rights and/or asylum claims simply because they know that it will elongate the right to work and the benefits that they may have had prior to the refusal. The debate about that has been interesting and I shall take some of the points into account&#151;I do not accept the substance of points about students&#151;but much of the argument was erroneous because of the small, narrow focus of people who are involved.
</p>





<p><a name="st_139"><a name="51116-15_spnew8"><b> Dr. Harris: </b> 
 If it is a small narrow group of people, there is presumably nothing wrong with preserving their right to exist and to carry on working while the appeal is being considered. I may want to say more about that in a few moments. I want to raise a point that I made in Committee, to which I do not believe the Minister has responded. What happens if a valid judicial review application is given against a decision not to extend leave? Do the rights continue under that application? The Minister indicated at column 148 of the Committee proceedings that he might write to me, but I am not clear that he has done so. Will he now take the opportunity to clarify it either by answering now or writing later?

 I shall write. I do not think that the matter is particularly germane to new clause 1, but I will write in more general terms to the hon. Gentleman. His point&#151;I hope that I have it right&#151;is that the grant of leave pre-supposes that the holder should be able to stay while they bring any future appeal, but that is a pre-supposition that simply does not exist under law&#151;in intent or otherwise. A grant of leave signifies that someone may stay in the UK while they meet the conditions on which the leave was granted. If that is a truism, I apologise to the House. There is no pre-supposition there, only the terms of the conditions that were granted. Once they no longer meet the requirement of the rules or any application for further leave, there is no basis on which they are entitled to stay here. That is a fair point.

When it comes to the interpretation of the ECHR in all its glory, on balance I trust the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) rather than the hon.

<a name="51116-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_202">This is an interesting new clause. I hope that we will not get sidelined by issues that are not relevant, so that we can focus on those that are. There is a strong body of opinion that holds that paid activity should be available, on a voluntary basis, for people in immigration removal centres. This new clause works to that effect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_203">At the moment, detainees in immigration removal centres do not have the opportunity to undertake paid work of any description. Despite the presence of educational and other activities in removal centres, many non-governmental organisations have established that the absence of paid activity can lead to boredom and frustration among detainees. That is harmful to their well-being, and that of the entire institution, and contributes directly to control and order problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_204">Paid activity is generally accepted as a necessary component of the activities provided to individuals in custody. It benefits the individuals concerned by giving them additional constructive and purposeful activity with which to occupy their time. As a direct result, it plays a key role in helping to maintain order.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_205">The absence of paid activity for immigration detainees, with the potentially adverse consequences for their well-being and for removal centre security, has been highlighted by Her Majesty&#039;s chief inspector of prisons and by the prisons and probation ombudsman. Both have recommended that the current position should be remedied.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_206">In order to provide opportunities for detainees in removal centres to participate in paid activity, we need to exempt them from the national minimum wage. Detainees may be regarded as &quot;workers&quot; for the purposes of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 if they perform paid activity of any sort, and would therefore be entitled to receive the national minimum wage. That would not be viable financially, nor reflect the true economic value of the work likely to be carried out, which is likely to be remedial and assistive. &quot;Assistive&quot; is the correct word in this context, but nevertheless I apologise for using it. The current position has prevented detainees from being given opportunities to undertake paid activity. We need to change that.

<p><a name="st_159"><a name="51116-16_spnew7"><b> Mr. Gerrard: </b> 
 I understand the reasons that my hon. Friend the Minister has given for allowing detainees to undertake paid work, and that requests have been made to that effect. However, detention centres are often run by private contractors who have not always earned the most sparkling reports from the prisons inspectorate. I am worried that detainees will end up being used as cheap labour. Will my hon. Friend say how that will be prevented?
</p>





<p><a name="st_160"><a name="51116-16_spnew8"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 That is an entirely fair point, and I hope that my hon. Friend will allow me to get to it later, as I develop my remarks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-16_para8">
<a name="stpa_207">Prisoners who undertake paid work would do so on the basis of an exemption from the national minimum wage in section 45 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. There is no similar exemption for immigration

<br>&nbsp;<br>detainees in removal centres, and that is what we want to remedy. Paradoxically, individual detainees held in prisons are, by default, covered by the exemption for prisoners. That means that an immigration detainee incarcerated temporarily or otherwise in the prison estate is covered by the exemption for prisoners and could do paid work. In contrast, that person could not do paid work on transfer to the removals estate. The exemption created by this new clause would therefore remove that anomaly and bring detainees in removal centres in line with people held in prisons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-16_para9">
<a name="stpa_208">It is important to note that all paid activity would be entirely voluntary and provided in addition to the various educational, sporting and recreational activities offered to detainees at present. Detainees would be encouraged to participate, just as they are in relation to other activities, but in no way would they be compelled to carry out the work. Detainees who chose not to participate in paid activity would continue to receive any allowances due to them under the removal centre incentive schemes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-16_para10">
<a name="stpa_209">Work opportunities provided to detainees are likely to be of two main types. The first type would be the &quot;traditional&quot; custodial activities such as light cleaning, kitchen assistance, laundry work and gardening. However, I accept the point made by my hon.

<a name="stpa_210">The second type of paid work would include activities organised by charitable or voluntary groups, for which detainees would receive direct financial reward for participation.

No explanation, other than the one that the Minister has just delivered at the Dispatch Box, has previously been given for the change, although it is true that an anomaly does exist in respect of people detained in the prison estate and those detained in other establishments. That is the anomaly that the new clause addresses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_213">The report into the Yarl&#039;s Wood detention centre made it clear that we need to look at what happens to people who are detained. That is all the more important, given that the Government&#039;s five-year strategy for asylum and immigration states that increasing use of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 1018</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>detention is planned, especially in the context of the removal of failed asylum seekers. However, the Minister must answer a few questions relating to the new clause.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_214">The hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) asked a valid question in his intervention. At present, the UK has nine immigration removal centres. Most are run by private companies, but three are run by the prison service. It is important to understand how the private companies will be instructed to manage a work regime in the centres, as the Minister has made it clear that that regime will be intrinsically different from the practice in prisons and on the prison estate as a whole. What instructions will the private companies be given about running the work regime in their centres?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_215">Detainees are not prisoners. The Minister knows that people may be detained for a variety of reasons. Most are detained because they are about to be removed from the UK, or because their asylum claims are being dealt with through the fast-track process, so I am not entirely sure how useful the provision will be, especially given that the average stay in a detention centre is between seven and 10 days. That said, earlier this year, persons were recorded as being in detention in the UK for a year or more, solely under Immigration Act powers: 70 had been detained for a year or more, 45 of whom were asylum seekers. That statistic is staggering enough, but 125 people had been detained for more than six months but less than a year, of whom 95 were asylum seekers, and 150 people were detained from four to six months and 150 from three to four months. Purposeful activity or a work regime may be envisaged for those individuals, but the idea needs to be fleshed out and cannot simply be presented to the House in the form of the new clause.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_216">The proposals smack to me of the Minister envisaging that those individuals could be held in detention centres for a long time. When we were considering other aspects of the proposals, I noticed that a detention centre manager considered&#151;especially in relation to reports about the Yarl&#039;s Wood centre&#151;that the sort of work that could be done should be connected to the resettlement of the individual, particularly if resettlement could reasonably be supposed to be in the UK. But the Minister conveniently missed out that point by referring to light cleaning and a little cooking and domestic work at the prison.
<a name="time_12">

</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_217">My last point relates to the structuring of the regime as regards payment. The average rate of pay for employed prisoners is &#163;8 a week, but the Prison Service sets its own minimum rate, which is currently &#163;4 a week. Each prison is allowed to set its own pay rate. Does the Minister envisage that each detention centre will be allowed to set its own rates and, if so, at what level does he expect them to be?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_218">That is all I want to ask at this stage, but I reiterate to the Minister that, given the spirit of our conduct of the proceedings, I would have expected a new clause of this nature to be accompanied by an explanatory document, at least for members of the Committee, rather than relying on the Minister&#039;s slightly cursory introduction&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister is holding up a letter, but I am afraid that it has not reached me.

<a name="stpa_221">Earlier, I deliberately concentrated on new clause 2, but I shall now turn to the Government amendments in the group. Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 deal with local authority provision of section 4 accommodation, and I think they are straightforward.

<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 1020</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Abingdon (Dr. Harris) spent some time on that point in Committee, and I think that amendment No. 32 makes it clear that the Government are willing to concede that the consequences of non-compliance should be set out clearly in immigration rules and not be provided for administratively. I think that is what the hon. Gentleman was after and we have duly responded.
</p>





<p><a name="st_165"><a name="51116-17_spnew4"><b> Dr. Evan Harris: </b> 
 The Minister is correct to say that amendment No. 32 covers what we were seeking. I am grateful to him for that amendment. I also recognise he has dealt with a problem by introducing amendment No. 30, which relates to section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. The question that has not been answered is whether section 4 support&#151;non-accommodation support&#151;must be given in vouchers or whether it can be given in cash. He did not answer that in Committee or in a parliamentary question to him. If he would undertake to write to give a definitive answer about whether there is a statutory bar on paying cash or whether it is just his wish, the Liberal Democrats would certainly be very grateful.

<p><a name="st_166"><a name="51116-17_spnew5"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I shall happily write to the hon. Gentleman, and I am grateful to him for his comments on the amendments in this group. I hesitate to say that I will hand-deliver any response to him because I have enough to do without doing a poor impersonation of Postman Pat or a member of the Communication Workers Union. With all those frivolous comments put to one side, I commend Government new clause 2 and the Government amendments to the House.

 We move on to the part of the Bill that deals with rights and duties of employers, and in particular to clause 14, which imposes the somewhat novel concept of a civil penalty on a person who employs a person subject to some immigration control. It is in connection with the general theme of the civil penalty that I introduce amendments Nos. 8 to 16. I hope that we will be permitted to divide the House on amendment No. 10 at the appropriate moment. My remaining amendments are essentially probing measures.

<a name="51116-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_227">The problem of illegal working is acute. The strict liability criminal offence introduced by section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 dealt with it to some extent, but the problem with that legislation is that very few prosecutions have occurred. It is well known that hundreds of thousands of people are probably working illegally, but only 29 people have been prosecuted under the 1996 Act since 1997, and only eight or nine of them were found guilty.

: Illegal immigrants working in the Kettering constituency are a serious problem. I have tabled written questions to the Home Office, the answers to which revealed that no employers have been prosecuted in Kettering for employing illegal workers.

<p><a name="st_200"><a name="51116-19_spnew3"><b> Mr. Malins: </b> 
 I am interested in my hon. Friend&#039;s point. I visited his constituency some months ago, so I know that the matter, which he takes particularly seriously on behalf of his law-abiding constituents, is a problem in his area. I am not surprised to learn that no one has been prosecuted.

<a name="stpa_228">The civil penalty introduced by clause 14 is a new concept, but I am troubled by the fact that we know very little about the Secretary of State&#039;s plans. For example, the minimum and maximum penalties are not stated in the Bill. I have heard a rumour that the maximum per worker will be &#163;2,500, although perhaps the Minister will confirm that figure in due course. Maximum fines and penalties are always set out in criminal statute, so it is disappointing not to have that information. Likewise, the contents of the penalty notice referred to in clause 14 are left for us to guess at. The documents that employers must see and the steps that they must take are, again, not specified, and they will be decided later.

Does the Minister have any idea how many such persons are working illegally in this country?

<a name="stpa_241">The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, a much-respected body, also has concerns about the provisions.

The Minister may remember that this issue was raised in Committee by the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard), who always takes a great interest in these matters. The Government&#039;s response at that time, though helpful in part, was incomplete. That links up with my point on that amendment involving the nature of the documentation, which the employer will have to read and understand. Some of those documents are complex.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_245">I am going to say to the Minister something that may trouble him a little. I have read that those employers who are concerned that the penalty provision might impact on them can phone an employers&#039; helpline&#151;a hotline of sorts for employers&#151;to get the fullest possible advice as to what they should and should not do, and how they should approach individual employment cases. The parallel with the immigration hotline, which is used by many of my hon. Friends and Members across the House to get answers on immigration matters, is interesting. I want the Minister to tell us in his winding-up speech whether the employers&#039; helpline&#151;or it is a hotline?&#151;exists. Will he give us its telephone number? I have a number in front of me, but something tells me that it might be more appropriate for him to talk to us about this, just in case I have the wrong one.

Anybody with the slightest knowledge of the immigration world realises that we are now entering a minefield. Picture yourself, Mr. Deputy Speaker, or any of us here, running a small business taking on labour. Then, one asks to see certain documents. Bearing in mind that many documents that are not real seem to pass the test with our immigration officials and those at airports, I do not see how the innocent employer will spot them. Did you know, Mr.   Deputy Speaker, that it is a piece of cake in Lithuania to wander along and buy yourself a Lithuanian passport, which gives you everything that you need to come into this country? Did you know that it is a piece of cake in Italy and Greece&#151;I hasten to say that I have not done it, but I know it to be true&#151;to get hold of a Greek or Italian identity card and wander into this country on that basis? Finally, I am not sure that employers are expected to know that there is a terrific trade of Brazilians entering Portugal and getting hold quite easily of Portuguese identity and other documents, and then wandering around the EU, not to mention this country. The notion that expertise must be put into the mind of the employer is illusory.

<a name="stpa_252">My amendment No. 11 deals with a separate issue, and I hope that I have expressed fairly and opened up a debate on the burdens on employers, the concerns of business and the lack of detail that we have had so far. The clause states that a penalty notice must &quot;specify a date&quot;. The date specified in the notice&#151;goodness knows who sends it or has found out that an employer has an illegal migrant as an employee&#151;is meant to be

<a name="stpa_253">The amendment changes that from 14 days to 28 days. It is quite important&#151;I know that the Minister is taking the point on board&#151;that a reasonable period is given to the employer to pay the penalty. We do not know what the penalty will be, and have no idea who will judge how much it will be. If it is a Home Office official who decides on the penalty, such an official will have no idea about an employer&#039;s wealth, means or ability to pay and will, I presume, just pick a figure out of the air, which seems idiotic. It seems right, particularly as people are sometimes away for two or three weeks, that a reasonable period of grace should be given for the employer to pay the penalty.

<a name="51116-20_para13">
<a name="stpa_254">On the question of the financial means of the person in receipt of a penalty, I see nothing in the Bill to tell me that the level of the penalty will be adjusted according to the means of the person who must pay it. In our courts, however, defendants&#039; means are carefully examined&#151;they carefully fill in a form about whether they are on benefits or X pounds a week. As a result, the courts set the fine at a level compatible with the defendant&#039;s means. Where is that provision in the Bill, and where is the prospect of the Minister allowing a little more time? If one is fined in a magistrates court, one is invariably given, if one asks for it, 28 days to pay. That is why I have suggested that 28 days be allowed in relation to the penalty notice.

There is such a huge burden on the IND, despite the appointment of the new director general, Lin Homer, whom I wish well. An extra burden of this kind will not help the system. After all, that is exactly what the Government said when they introduced&#151;I think by regulation, but the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;the new certificates of marriage that people had to obtain from the Home Office in order to go to the registry office to get married. At the time, we were told that the purpose was to make the system clearer. In fact, there is still a huge delay for people trying to get those certificates from the Home Office because there is a backlog.

<a name="stpa_272">My final point is about the need to ensure that people who are here illegally and readily own up to it are given some sort of decision about their status. Occasionally, although I am not saying that it happens often, people who have lived in this country illegally for a long time come to my constituency surgery, as I am sure they do to the surgeries of other Members, and admit that they have been in the country illegally. Some have had an extended holiday. A gentleman who came to see me only last week came for a holiday 10 years ago on a visitor&#039;s visa. He is still here, he has had three children and he is working illegally, but he wants to come clean. He wants to make the Home Office aware of the position, although I am not sure whether he wants an amnesty. My job as MP is to stand in his shoes and write to the appropriate Minister or officials. I have done that&#151;as I have done for a number of people who have come to my surgery and want to admit to being here illegally. They want their status clarified, but the delay in dealing with their cases adds to the backlog and the wider delay in the system.

 I shall not detain the House because, ever the optimist, I remain hopeful that we might still get to the final group of amendments, which I consider to be very important. However, I want to share a few thoughts about illegal working, and I commend the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) for tabling these 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 1038</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>amendments. They allow us to discuss and place on the record some of our concerns about what is a real problem in many sectors of modern commerce and industry. Illegal working is a problem for all of us. It has a pernicious effect on community relations and leaves many people in different industries without proper protection or remuneration. If it is allowed to flourish, it places those who play by the rules at a real disadvantage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_275">The hon. Member for Woking said that most of his amendments are probing, and I think that that approach is correct, but he added that he wanted to press amendment No. 10 to a vote. The hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) said that his resolution to support him had been tested, but mine has not. I remain resolute and I will support the amendment in a Division. Yet again, part of the reassurance offered by the Government is that a code of conduct will be put in place, but so far I am not aware that one has been produced. The Government say something similar increasingly often, but such statements provide no reassurance. Effectively, we are being asked to buy a pig in a poke.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_276">The concept of civil penalties is superficially attractive, although I remain worried about some of the enforcement problems. What is the position of bodies corporate in relation to partnerships? In Scots law, partners are deemed to be jointly and severally liable, but it seems to me that the Bill could cause real injustice in that regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_277">Moreover, the people most likely to be caught and to end up paying are those small business men or sole traders who have made some error that has brought them within the jurisdiction of the civil penalty scheme. However, they will not necessarily be the real villains of the piece. The real villains will find a means of escape&#151;no doubt without much difficulty&#151;through devices such as the veil of incorporation. I am therefore worried that the proposed scheme will not tackle the mischief.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_278">Amendment No. 10 would reduce the test for establishing a defence and require traders to show that they had taken &quot;reasonable steps&quot; to comply with employment requirements. That seems sensible, and Liberal Democrat Members support it.

<p><a name="st_212"><a name="51116-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. John Greenway  (Ryedale) (Con):</b> 
 I listened to the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) with great interest. He and I entered the House at the same time and in our early days here worked together in the Home Affairs Committee. We looked at some of these matters then, and few of us can match his experience, given the ethnic make-up of his constituency and the many cases with which he has to deal. I am sure that what he said will have been of great value to the House.

<a name="stpa_279">I want to deal with some of the issues that are under consideration in the Council of Europe&#039;s Committee on Migration, Refugees and Population, to which I was appointed earlier this year. They go right to the heart of the difficult question of the employment of irregular migrants. I concluded that what the Government propose in clauses 14 to 21&#151;which the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr.    Malins) address&#151;namely, stronger criminal sanctions against employers who give work to irregular or illegal migrants, seems significantly out of step with the work of the Migration Committee and the advice it has received on future migration and employment trends.

<a name="stpa_280">As colleagues who follow economic trends will be aware, Alan Greenspan estimated recently that there may be between 10 million and 11 million irregular migrants in work in the USA, without whom, he said, the performance of the US economy would be adversely affected, particularly in relation to the rate of inflation. I understand that it is two years since any prosecutions were pressed against employers in the USA.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_281">We know that irregular migrants are in work in the UK&#151;the hon. Member for Leicester, East gave us one example. The clandestine nature of their employment can and does on occasion call into question the morality and ethical behaviour of their employers. On the other hand, some employers may unwittingly employ irregular migrants, especially through subcontractors in the agricultural sector or, as my hon. Friend the Member for Woking said, migrants who used false papers.
</p>





<p><a name="st_213"><a name="51116-22_spnew2"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 I agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman is saying. If an employer is going through a busy period and needs to fill a vacancy, when people apply for the job the first question he asks is not, &quot;Can I have a look at your passport?&quot;, but, &quot;Are you able to do this job?&quot; That is why people slip through.
</p>





<p><a name="st_214"><a name="51116-22_spnew3"><b> Mr. Greenway: </b> 
 Indeed. In the hon. Gentleman&#039;s community, he may know that the person in question has a wife and children to support, and I want to touch on the issue of the rights of a person in that situation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_282">For the reasons that I have given, I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Woking is entirely right to try to amend the Bill as he proposes. It would be wholly wrong for us to treat the unscrupulous employer and the unwitting employer in exactly the same way, as the Bill would do. Yes, there is discretion about whether prosecutions are brought and there is discretion in the court, but if we are serious about regularising the position of illegal migrants, which is really what the hon. Member for Leicester, East was saying in his third point, it is counter-productive to penalise the very people who are most likely to know or learn about the irregularities and do something to address them.If our economy benefits from the employment of irregular migrants, we need to ask whether the prosecution of employers is justified, beyond their failure to meet employment laws and obligations. In the longer term, however, it is much more important for the House to address the interests of the migrants themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_283">I listened with interest to the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality when he introduced new clause 2 and discussed the question of there being no minimum wage for people in detention centres who work. He made his point extremely well; the questions relating to the right level of pay were interesting. He pointed out that people in detention centres have a choice about whether to work, but that if they choose to work they are not paid the minimum wage. I see his point of view, but those people are nevertheless irregular migrants&#151;that is why they are in detention&#151;yet they are being given the choice and the right to work.

That is an extremely challenging concept. I have an open mind on the issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_285">The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) serves on the Migration Committee with me, and we have had quite a good exchange of views on what many colleagues on both sides of the House would find a challenging concept. However, we must all address the issue raised by the hon. Member for Leicester, East. If someone with a wife and children has lived in this country for 10 years but is here illegally because he overstayed his holiday and is in a job, does he have a right to work or not? That is the question. People say no, but the very fact that that question is on the agenda indicates the direction of thinking on this policy.

<a name="stpa_286">The Migration Committee has been given three different academic studies on the European convention on human rights, all of which conclude that irregular migrants must have some kind of rights. The better option is to regularise migrant workers because, without them, the long-term economic future of Europe, let alone this country, is in question. However, that is a debate for another day.

<p>
<a name="51116-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_287">All I would say is that if the rights of irregular migrants are as uncertain as many hon.

Amendment No. 10, tabled by my hon.

 I am grateful to hon. Members for the tone in which the debate has been conducted. We have had a proportionate and balanced debate on some very important issues. However, as the hon.

The secondary legislation detailed in the Bill will achieve the effect of his amendment. I know that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland indicated that he would support the hon. Member for Woking in such a vote, but if the hon. Member for Woking is in the mood for doing deals, I can say that I may well be minded to accept amendment No. 11, the other amendment that he described as important because it would put more flexibility in the Bill.

Friend talked about additional burdens on the immigration and nationality directorate and asked whether the enforcement activity would impact on other work. He also talked about consultation with the ethnic minority community about the impact of the measures and discussed the IND&#039;s ability to deal with overstayers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_292">We are bringing forward the measures because the regime introduced by the Conservative party has failed to fulfil its intended function. In the nine years since that regime was introduced, some 17 prosecutions have been brought, but that is not to say that the IND has not carried out many more operations than that to detect illegal working and that it has not detected many more illegal workers than that during the course of its activity. The situation demonstrates the inadequacy of the current offence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_293">The measures that we are introducing, especially the civil penalty scheme, will put a wider range of tools at the disposal of the IND, so it will not have to use such heavy-handed means to address the problem. The civil penalty scheme is a more measured and calibrated 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 1042</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>system through which the problem can be addressed without having to resort to criminal prosecutions in every instance. On my hon. Friend&#039;s point about consultation, a draft code of practice has been published to set out the steps that employers can take to ensure that they keep within race discrimination legislation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_217"><a name="51116-23_spnew0"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 I want the Minister to picture my constituency and areas such as East Park road and the Belgrave road. Every single person who is employed in every single factory on those roads is from the ethnic minority communities. Some are British born, some have acquired citizenship and others have indefinite leave. Does he not accept that the measure will disproportionately affect members of the ethnic minority community, and have an impact on those who are in this country legally because employers simply will not want to employ them?
</p>





<p><a name="st_218"><a name="51116-23_spnew1"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to raise such serious issues. I do not know his constituency anything like as well as he does, but I would guess that the vast majority of those people are British born and British passport holders, so there will be no requirement for employers to check their documentation. The draft code was published in October and I would encourage him to read it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_219"><a name="51116-23_spnew2"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 That is not the point. The Bill will allow those who have the power to go on fishing expeditions to find out which of those people are British citizens and individuals with indefinite leave&#151;with the right to vote and work here&#151;and which are not. The Bill will mean that people can start visiting factories and making checks, which will create more burdens.
</p>





<p><a name="st_220"><a name="51116-23_spnew3"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 The measures must be applied sensitively, which is why the draft code of practice sets out clearly the steps that should be followed to achieve that. The code makes what is acceptable clear to employers. We obviously want to ensure that there is consultation on the code of practice so that when it emerges in its final form, it will be a useful and practical document that will ensure that the scenario that my hon. Friend fears can be avoided. I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s point, but the purpose of the measures is to deal with illegal working. The IND carries out illegal working operations now and will continue to do so; the clauses simply gives the IND proportionate tools to use against employers who fail to comply.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_294">The main point made by the hon. Member for Woking relates to amendment No. 10, in which he requests that reference be made in the Bill to employers who take reasonable steps to comply with the legislation. As he knows, secondary legislation will be required to bring into effect the clauses on employment. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the table in the draft code of practice that we have issued for the benefit of employers. He will see that it lays out clearly the practical steps that employers can take to ameliorate the size of any penalty. They can carry out a full check, which is defined, a partial check or no check at all. We have taken a balanced approach: the penalty varies in proportion to the extent to which an employer has taken steps to comply.

<a name="stpa_295">The hon.

I genuinely believe that the secondary legislation to support the clauses will fulfil the purpose of amendment No. 10 by laying out clearly the practical steps that people can take, and I hope that it reassures the hon. Gentleman that first-time offenders will not be clobbered. The penalty will vary according to how many times the employer has breached the provisions and the extent to which the employer has taken steps to tackle the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_296">As I said, we are minded to accept amendment No. 11, which is sensible. It relates to the matters to be included in a civil penalty notice, specifically the Secretary of State&#039;s obligation under clause 14 to set a maximum period within which payment must be made. The effect of the amendment would be to increase the payment period specified in the notice from at least 14 days to at least 28 days. Clause 16 specifies that the period for bringing an appeal against a penalty will be 28 days and we intend that the maximum period for making objections under clause 15 will be the same. To accept amendment No. 11 is therefore logical.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_297">Amendment No. 8 would exclude part-time workers from the scheme. That would not be sensible as it would undermine the principles of the scheme, weaken it, and create a potential loophole in the legislation. Employers could employ an illegal worker on a part-time basis for up to 15 hours a week having carried out no checks at all. I do not believe that that is really what the hon. Gentleman wants. It would not be sensible to accept the amendment, nor amendment No. 9, which would effectively exempt overstayers from the illegal working provisions. To exempt overstayers would be a counter-productive step that would undermine the scheme. The hon. Gentleman may know that a high proportion of the people who are picked up during operations tend to be overstayers. The hon. Gentleman asked about enforcement. <i>[Interruption.]</i> He is chuntering away on the Opposition Front Bench about who will enforce the provision, and he has asked about robust documents. How about a national identity card? Has the hon. Gentleman considered that? That might be an easy way to ensure that employers could quickly verify whether or not the person had the right to work in the country. The hon. Gentleman might want to think about that before we conclude our deliberations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_298">Other, less crucial points have been raised and Members have been able to have their say. I note the   support from the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) for an amnesty for all illegal workers. I am not sure that that is the policy of the two contenders for the leadership of the Conservative party, but it is something that they might want to consider.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_299">I took the point made by the hon.

 I propose to make an extremely brief contribution on the amendments. I do not ask the Minister to deal with them at length, or at all, unless he feels it appropriate to do so, but I will be grateful if he is able to write to me.

<a name="stpa_304">Clauses 31, 32, 33 and 37 touch on important issues with regard to the sharing of information, which must be seen against the backdrop of the need for doing so in the more dangerous world that we currently face. The Minister is aware of our 100 per cent. support for Government attempts to ensure that our country is safe, and he must never be in any doubt about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_305">The amendments are entirely probing. I tabled amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 21 because I had hoped on several occasions in Committee to insert the word &quot;captain&quot; in relation to a ship.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_306">Amendment No. 19 would enable information required by a constable to be provided orally rather than in writing as long as it is confirmed in writing within 48 hours. There would be no harm in that. I am sure that the Minister will feel free to accept that sensible amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_307">Amendment No. 22 suggests that a breach of clause 30, as well as of clauses 31 or 32, should be an offence. As the Bill stands, I cannot see that breaching clause 30 by not providing information to an immigration officer is an offence. Would such breaches be imprisonable offences?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_308">Amendment No. 24 would strengthen the provision on the disclosure of information for security purposes so that a person &quot;shall&quot;, instead of &quot;may&quot; disclose

<br>&nbsp;<br>information. Amendment No. 25 would reduce the test to thinking that that information &quot;may&quot;, instead of &quot;is likely to&quot; be of use for a specified purpose.

If the House will indulge me for a few minutes, I would like to refer to a few of the objections that the UNHCR has brought to our attention.

<p>
<a name="51116-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_328">First, the UNHCR makes the point that clause 51 interprets article 1F(c)
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58">&quot;out of its context, contrary to accepted rules of interpretation of a treaty under international law.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_329">Secondly, the UNHCR says that the clause

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59">&quot;introduces an interpretation . . . which is incompatible with the accepted and long-standing interpretation of Article 1 F(c).&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_330">The UNHCR essentially makes the same points as the ILPA, as well as further statements, and the UNHCR briefing says that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60">&quot;bearing in mind the interrelationship between the three subsections of the provision, it is important that Article 1 F be interpreted and applied holistically. As presently drafted, Clause 51 is a piecemeal attempt to interpret one subsection of a provision which should be read as a whole and in context. UNHCR is concerned that the adoption of Clause 51 will result in a skewed and imbalanced application of the exclusion clauses in the UK. In its stead, UNHCR would recommend that the UK government consider the incorporation of Article 1 F in its entirety into domestic legislation. Such a measure would ensure that the exclusion clauses are considered in context and on a strong legal footing.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_331">The briefing then says that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61">&quot;terrorist-type acts (as defined in relevant international conventions) may qualify as excludable acts under Article 1 F if they reach an appropriate level of gravity to warrant denial of protection. This does not mean, however, that any act labelled as &#039;terrorist&#039; per se should automatically trigger exclusion under article 1 F. The fact that there are serious reasons for considering that an individual has committed acts described as &#039;terrorist&#039; in nature should trigger consideration of the exclusion clauses but may not in itself generally constitute sufficient evidence to justify exclusion. Each case will require individual consideration, taking into account the unique circumstances of each individual, their acts, motivation and risk on return. In this regard, UNHCR wishes to express serious concern over the current proposal in clause 51 to automatically link acts defined in the Terrorism Act 2000 with an excludable offence under Article 1 F(c) of the Refugee Convention.&quot;</p>

 Of foreign nationals, as my hon. Friend reminds me from a sedentary position. In our view, that test is far too low for such a serious step. It is a quantum leap to deprive someone of their citizenship or right of abode when that person, although they have a second nationality, might never have had recourse to using it, might have no links to the country concerned and might never have lived in it. To put someone in a position of relying on a citizenship other than their British citizenship on such a low test is unacceptable. The effect of our amendment No. 37 is to retain as the test for depriving an individual of citizenship that they should be shown to have done something seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom or a British overseas territory.

<a name="stpa_334">The Conservative amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are interesting, particularly No. 2, which seeks to delete the provision relating to Ministers&#039; thinking. I venture to say that if the Government are going to be required to satisfy courts that Ministers had thought about something before they did it, they might be in for a lean time as far as successful cases in court are concerned. I can think of no other instance in which &quot;thinks&quot; is used in such a situation. I would be interested if the Minister could point me towards a precedent. In the event of his failure to do so, it would be sensible for the Government to accept amendment No. 2.

<p><a name="st_282"><a name="51116-27_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gerrard </b> 
: I will be brief, given the time that is left. It is a pity that we have such a short time to debate what, I think, is one of the most important sections of the Bill, including a group of clauses that were added in Committee, have never been debated on the Floor of the House and are some of the most important changes that have been made. It is probably true that clauses 51 to 53 will affect relatively small numbers of people. For those small numbers of people, however, they will be extremely important.

<p>
<a name="51116-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_335">I have two or three points. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) asked whether clause 51 is necessary, in that the existing law provides for the exclusion of someone who is a violent terrorist from claiming asylum. I will not repeat what he said about the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In the years in which I have been in the House, however, the UNHCR has commented on a number of provisions in asylum and immigration Bills, and the comments about clause 51 are probably the strongest that I have seen from it about any such clause and its incompatibility with the 1951 convention. It made it very clear that interpretation of the convention is not what we should be doing. The provisions in the

</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_336">Last week we debated the Terrorism Bill, which has not yet completed its passage. The definitions in clause 51 are relevant to that Bill. The definition of &quot;encouraging terrorism&quot; is an example. It is quite possible that before we finish considering the Terrorism Act, there will be changes. I am also not sure how Government amendments relating to extra-territorial acts of terrorism that were agreed last week should be read in the context of this Bill, or how any changes will be dealt with. One of the commitments made by the Government during last week&#039;s debate was that the Home Secretary would ask Lord Carlile to review the definition of terrorism, not just in the Terrorism Bill but in the Terrorism Act 2000. The definition in the 2000 Act is mentioned in clause 51 of this Bill. I want to be certain that the outcome of any review, including Lord Carlile&#039;s review, will be translated into this Bill, because it strikes me as inconsistent to include a definition of terrorism in one Bill that does not relate clearly to the definition in another.

<a name="stpa_338">Let me repeat what I said in Committee. When the Minister introduced the new clause relating to deprivation of citizenship, he spoke with great courtesy and authority. I repeat that my party stands united behind the Government&#039;s attempts to combat the surge of terrorism. Indeed, the whole House is united on that. I should have like to question the Minister on a number of matters, but time is against us and I believe that they will be raised in another place. Deprivation of citizenship will, I think, be used rarely&#151;it has been used rarely so far&#151;and I know that the Government will retain a right of appeal. I also know that the Government will do their best to strike a balance between civil liberties and the defence of the realm. We are with them 100 per cent. on that, and I believe that any further matters that I might raise with the Minister will be raised in another place.

Although not all Members, including members of the Committee, were not party to the gestation period when the clauses were discussed, they were discussed on an all-party basis throughout and beyond the summer. The other place will be aware of that. I do not accept the terms in which my hon. Friend described the genesis of the clauses, or indeed the final discussions.

<a name="stpa_345">UN Security Council resolution 1377 is broadly in the same terms. I said in Committee that, as and when&#151;fortunately, the progress of Bills through Parliament favours this&#151;there needs to be read-across between the Terrorism Bill and any changes made to the constituent parts of that, and this Bill, we will seek to reflect those changes in this Bill. That makes perfect sense. I cannot pre-empt what the other place will do with the Terrorism Bill, but we stand ready to cross-reference the two Bills in the appropriate place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_346">I think that, given the state of this Bill and the state of the Terrorism Bill, little needs to happen, not least because Lord Carlile will conduct a substantive review of the definition of terrorism over the year. Much of the debate about read-across refers to the definitions that are included in the Terrorism Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_347">We believe that the UNHCR&#039;s points about the definition of terrorism in the 2000 Act are unfair. The definition is compatible with article 1(F)(c) of the refugee convention, as is the 2005 Terrorism Bill. We do not consider it to be at odds with UN Security Council resolutions that were drawn up reflecting the principles of the UN.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-27_para13">
<a name="stpa_348">We are exhorted by UNHCR to take a holistic approach to exclusion clauses. We argue that we have done so, and they are reflected in this Bill. Clause 51 is not piecemeal. Our approach to the application of article 1(F) is holistic and we contest the points made by UNHCR in that regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-27_para14">
<a name="stpa_349">We take the same attitude to the points made about positions of power. The UNHCR London paper suggests that in principle only persons who have been in power or a state-like entity would be capable of committing such acts, given that articles 1 and 2 of the UN charter set out the fundamental principles that states must uphold in mutual relations. A slew of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 1056</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Asylum and Immigration Tribunal case law and Security Council resolutions themselves contend that very position. Although I take UNHCR&#039;s points very seriously and take into account the points made by my hon. Friends and other colleagues that these are serious clauses in the Bill, I do not accept UNHCR&#039;s point that, of themselves and in their own terms, they are incompatible with the overall thrust of what is in the UN charter. They are very serious clauses that are a consequence of what we are trying to achieve in the broader sense in counter-terrorism and I&#151;

 I beg to move, that the Bill be now read the Third time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_352">As is customary on Third Reading, I thank all the members of the Standing Committee for what seemed to me, in my limited experience of the House, to be an informed, discursive and useful debate. We had plenty of time and all the necessary matters were considered in a spirit of reasonable discourse and, on the odd day, with some intellectual rigour. Our sittings were extremely useful and productive, as is right and proper given that the Bill deals with a range of extremely serious matters in the context of an important political debate. That description applied even before the Government introduced&#151;with agreement&#151;the counter-terrorism clauses after the Bill had been published. That was a most unusual way of proceeding, but the House in the main will understand why things happened that way. There was a significant degree of cross-party agreement on the process, if not on the substance of those clauses.

 Will the Minister give way?
</p>





<p><a name="st_296"><a name="51116-29_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 No, I will not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_353">The Bill should be seen in the context of a substantive political debate. Last February, we proposed a series of plans and policies on asylum and immigration. We published a five-year plan, on which the Prime Minister elaborated in the course of the general election. The Bill addresses much of that, but as I said in Committee it constitutes a series of building blocks. I mean no discourtesy in respect of previous pieces of legislation introduced by the Labour Government when I say that the Bill is not, and was not offered up as, an all-singing, all-dancing omnibus Bill that answers every conceivable question on the range of immigration, asylum and nationality issues. I made it clear in Committee and on Second Reading and that much of what is in the Bill should be seen as building blocks. Although that does not fit in terribly well with our processes and how we do what we do, I said that the Bill needed to be read in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 1062</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>context of the five-year plan and all that we seek to do in that plan in terms not simply of immigration, but of asylum and how we are trying to secure our borders through the e-borders programme and the border management programme. We are putting out for public discussion every aspect of where we are with asylum and immigration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_354">It would be remiss of me, as my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said on Second Reading, if the Bill, as it is now to be dispatched to the other place, were not put in the context of the political debate. I make no apologies for mentioning again that collectively the British polity, British public policy and the British media did not serve themselves or others well by the way in which these matters were covered during the general election. Throughout the election, these matters were discussed in terms and in a form that was proxy for a debate that we may or may not need on community cohesion, on race and on other such issues. They were wrapped up in rather bogus fashion as constituting a serious debate. I fully concur, not least as the Minister responsible for immigration, that such a debate is needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_355">We need a debate on asylum and immigration matters, but the way that such matters were discussed during the general election is a matter of shame, not least for the Conservative party. I am extremely pleased that none of the dripping poison that polluted our democratic process was evident in Committee. I heartily congratulate every Conservative Member in Committee for not going down the route that their central party took during the general election. I freely attest that that route was not taken by the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins); nor was it taken by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan). However, in the context of the general election they should collectively hang their heads in shame and send the running dog from Australia back to where he came from.
</p>





<p><a name="st_297"><a name="51116-29_spmin0"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. Perhaps the Minister will now address his remarks to the Bill on Third Reading.
</p>





<p><a name="st_298"><a name="51116-29_spnew2"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Of course I will, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am glad that you allowed me a little licence to consider the political context in which the Bill has been discussed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_356">There is no doubt, in the broadest of terms of British public policy over 30 years, that we have collectively run away from a substantive debate on asylum and immigration. I have no difficulty in engaging in such a debate. I am pleased that the Bill is before the House at a time soon enough after the election to put these matters in context. That is of great service to British public policy generally and to the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_357">The Bill is about only those matters that need legislation in the context of the five-year plan, based on what was published in February. The provisions in the Bill now put it in a better place than it was when we started consideration in Committee. There is no doubt about that. Many of the amendments that we discussed today on Report go back to our discussions in Committee and take on board many of the points that were made by Committee members. Sometimes they have not met the full satisfaction of hon. Members, but 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 1063</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I think that people will concur, when they read the <i>Hansard</i> report of our considerations, that many Government amendments were an attempt to meet some of the concerns that were expressed in Committee. There were some genuine concerns, many of which, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State and I attested in Committee, will be readily dealt with in secondary legislation and in other forms that will be wrapped round the Bill rather than being part of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_358">We think that the Bill improves our ability to improve border security by allowing border agencies to share passenger data more efficiently. It allows the use of 21st century technology to facilitate legitimate travel and to improve the identification of illegal immigration. That is not simply in terms of the Bill but in the context of everything else that we are doing in respect of important elements of policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_359">I freely admit that the most contentious part of the Bill was the introduction of a rationalised appeal system for managed migration routes in line with improved decision-making on visa applications. That is very important in the context of the points system. I may not owe the House an apology, but I accept that it is difficult for Members who did not serve on the Committee to understand the narrow focus of the legislation without the wider picture of the consultation paper on the points system and other aspects of the five-year plan. I repeat the promise that I gave in Committee: as there is no substantive change to the points system during the transitional phase, we shall preserve the appeals regime during that period. If discrete parts of the points system can be introduced early, the quid pro quo is that appeals will fall away. That will give us sufficient time to bed in the new resources, the decision-making process and other improvements in entry clearance officer structures. Hopefully, if the full-time independent monitor is appointed by January, they will be in post when our new decision-making process is introduced, which is all to the good.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_360">Genuine concerns have been expressed, some of which I did not accept, about unifying the appeal process to a single level of appeal. However, I tried to address anxieties about the transition to a points system without appeals. The Bill provides for civil penalties for employers of illegal workers, and creates a new offence of knowingly employing an illegal worker. The five-year plan and all the provisions in the Bill contain the vital elements of a progressive asylum and immigration process. If we are to do everything that we can to maintain our position on the 1951 refugee convention and ensure that this country remains a safe haven for people fleeing persecution, we must simultaneously adopt a robust approach to the removal of people who do not have refugee status under the convention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_361">Some people do not like that approach, but I am convinced that if we are to preserve the integrity of the convention&#151;hopefully, no party will fight the next election saying that they will get rid of the 1951 convention, as that would be shameful&#151;we need equally robust decision-making and removals processes.
</p>





<p><a name="st_299"><a name="51116-29_spnew3"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 I accept what the Minister says about a robust removals programme. Does he accept, however, that the practice of dawn raids on families with children goes beyond robustness and strays into the realms of barbarity?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 1064</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_300"><a name="51116-29_spnew4"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 No, I do not. I can tell the hon. Gentleman quite cheerfully that much of the debate, not least in the Scottish context, has been racked with inaccuracies, misinformation and outright mischief.
</p>





<p><a name="st_301"><a name="51116-29_spnew5"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 What about raids at 5 am?
</p>





<p><a name="st_302"><a name="51116-29_spnew6"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I could cite at length coverage in the Scottish media that talks about tear gas and riot police, as well as armies of police dragging children from their beds and kicking down doors at 4 am. None of those things are a substantial part of what the immigration service does in Scotland or elsewhere. The debate is ever so slightly skewed in the Scottish context. I freely accept that it is my job to make sure that we never reach a stage where people who make applications, whether or not they are successful in obtaining refugee status, languish in the system for four or five years, as that has an impact on integration, the putting down of roots and so on.
</p>





<p><a name="st_303"><a name="51116-29_spnew7"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 On the Scottish context, will the Minister say why the Government tabled new clause 3 on access to the housing list in Scotland, which is clearly a devolved matter, and why they then withdrew that provision?
</p>





<p><a name="st_304"><a name="51116-29_spnew8"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I shall cheerfully do so. The new clause was tabled on Report. I think&#151;people far more expert than I will tell me if I am wrong&#151;that was at the behest of the Scottish Executive, not least because there was an assumption that there is a grey area between what is a UK matter and what is devolved in regard to what we are doing in the Bill. Between the tabling of the new clause and our considerations today, there was a court case that rendered the form and the language of the new clause inappropriate.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051116/debtext/51116-30.htm"/>




<p><a name="st_305"><a name="51116-30_spnew0"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister, who is being exceptionally generous at this late stage in the debate. Is he saying that the Scottish Executive asked for new clause 3 to be tabled or to be withdrawn? I did not understand.
</p>





<p><a name="st_306"><a name="51116-30_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I apologise for my lack of clarity. Working with the Scottish Executive, it was determined that the clause needed to be tabled. The Court of Appeal in the case of Morris&#151;we got the final judgment this week&#151;made a declaration of incompatibility in respect of section 185(4) of the Housing Act 1996, holding that that provision was within the ambit of article 8 of the European convention on human rights and breached article 14, as it discriminated on grounds of nationality, immigration control, settled residence and social welfare.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_362">New clause 3(1)(d) is in the same terms as section 185(4) and, although it does not apply to persons subject to immigration control, but only to other persons from abroad&#151;essentially European Economic Area nationals&#151;which was the point of the new clause, it has the same potential for discriminatory effect. A petition has been filed in the House of Lords seeking leave to appeal. That is the present position. As the new clause was incompatible with section 185(4), it was withdrawn. I shall let the hon. Gentleman know in more detail about its gestation, but it originated from discussion between the Home Office and the Scottish Executive. If the hon. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 1065</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Gentleman understands that, he is a better man than me, but that is why the new clause was withdrawn in the end.
</p>





<p><a name="st_307"><a name="51116-30_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hollobone </b> 
: I welcome the Minister&#039;s comments on the need to get tough on deporting those whose applications have failed and who are in the country illegally. The other day, I asked his Department a written question: how many people in this country are awaiting deportation owing to failed asylum and immigration applications? The Department&#039;s answer was that that information was not available. Is that not the problem? The Government have not got a grip on illegal immigration.
</p>





<p><a name="st_308"><a name="51116-30_spmin0"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. I hope that in replying to the hon. Gentleman, the Minister will not stray too far from Third Reading of the Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="st_309"><a name="51116-30_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I shall follow your exhortation, Madam Deputy Speaker. Suffice to say that a confrere of the hon. Gentleman made a stupid and ignorant statement in the general election&#151;&quot;Which part of &#039;Send them back&#039; don&#039;t you understand, Mr. Blair?&quot; In the context of the Bill and more generally, that shows a profound lack of understanding of the individual. Let me make it clear: it was not the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker); it was the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink).
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_363">We need to understand each individual&#039;s case, assess their level of documentation and establish that there is agreement with the country that they are going to about whether they can go or not, and that they are who they say they are.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_364">If the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) makes that comment in the context of the five-year plan, regardless of what is in the Bill, with a modicum of satisfaction about the level of removals between 1979 and 1997, I wager him that the figures were not very good then, compared with now. In the context of the Bill and generally, one must understand that these are difficult matters. We have gone from a position where, at best, those who had unfounded claims in the end were being removed at a rate of 200 a month at a time when applications for asylum were pushing 10,000 a month, to a position now where, roughly speaking&#151;we are always about three months behind in these matters&#151;1,400 or 1,500 are being removed at a time when new applications are about 2,000 a month. That is huge progress. Prior to that, the position was even worse.

<a name="stpa_365">Elements of the Bill will assist us in reaching a stage where there is a robust asylum system that defends the rights of those who secure refugee status, and put us right back where we have always been collectively and across parties.

<br>&nbsp;<br>introduction of the points system. The quid pro quo for public confidence in a transparent, simplified, managed migration system is&#151;this goes to the heart of the Bill&#151;a proper regime, which includes employers taking responsibility for dealing with illegal working. The two elements that I have mentioned are reflected in the Bill, outlined in the five-year plan and the strategy document, and go to the heart of a progressive system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_368">As I have said, provisions were added to the Bill after the cross-party deliberations in July. They concern denying asylum to terrorists, extending the power to strip citizenship from those who act in ways contrary to the UK&#039;s interest and speeding up the appeals process in national security deportation cases. I agree with those who suggest that it would nice if the other place were to have a detailed discussion on that point, reflecting our discussion in Committee rather than today&#039;s truncated debate. Those elements, too, form a measured and proportionate response to the real threat that we face. Some hon. Members&#151;happily a minority&#151;think that the threat is not significant. The measures are aimed at people who threaten the UK&#039;s national security and engage in unacceptable behaviour that creates a climate in which extremism can take root.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_369">As I said in Committee, I do not believe that the measures will impact on large numbers of people in practice. As ever, some hon. Members&#151;they were not members of the Committee&#151;seek to take a universal position, assume that every attempt to counter terrorism affects everybody rather than just a small minority, and pollute and distort the argument.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_370">We shall utilise technology where we can in the context of this Bill and beyond, and we are introducing biometrics now rather than later for foreign visa nationals. This country has a chance to introduce a progressive asylum and immigration system rooted in a context in which refugees are welcome. If we need a debate about community cohesion&#151;our communities are now third, fourth or fifth generation&#151;we can have it, because the Bill and the strategy that surrounds it will hopefully lance the Powellite poison and Mickey Mouse Alf Garnett impressions that have characterised discussions about asylum and immigration thus far. That way lies madness, so I am pleased that this Bill gets us to a place where we have a progressive asylum and immigration policy.

I thank the Whip, who did an expert job, and the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham). I also thank the army, nay legion, of lawyers, policy officials and Home Office people who have helped us make what on the face of it looks like a small contribution to asylum and immigration policy in this country.

I was happy with the way in which the Government introduced the late clauses because of the need to tidy up some of the provisions relating to terrorism. I thank the Minister for making his officials available to brief me and my Front-Bench colleagues, because that enabled us to approach the amendments in a slightly different fashion from what would have been the case had we been unsighted.

He should be more magnanimous in victory; after all, his party won the election. I will not take any lessons from him or hang my head in shame, because whatever an individual may have said in the heat of an election, it does not represent my party&#039;s views. He does a disservice to the whole business of politics by raising that here.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para13">
<a name="stpa_375">More refinements may be made to the Bill in another place, perhaps in the light of current events or the way in which we have conducted ourselves here. I see that the Minister is nodding. I hope that the pattern of Conservative Members&#039; voting indicates to another place those areas where we have concerns. If truth be told, the Minister would also have some concerns were he not tied by his office.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_376">The current drafting of the provisions on appeals is a muddle, and that will cost us in terms of our reputation at home and abroad. There is probably good reason to retain in-country rights of appeal in some cases, where people will be in the country having entered legally with leave. The disruption if they are forced to leave the UK will be sufficiently enormous not only to create administrative chaos, but potentially to give rise to successful human rights applications in the courts and compensation claims. The effects on our universities and higher education institutions have been laid out pretty well in Committee and on Report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para15">
<a name="stpa_377">The Minister needs to deal with the situation whereby refugees may be left in limbo. The Refugee Council has said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64">&quot;It is a shame that the plan to leave refugees living in limbo for five years before giving them the right to settle in Britain has been included. This measure contradicts other helpful steps&#151;such as the extension of integration loans&#151;which assist refugees in building new lives in this country.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para16">
<a name="stpa_378">That reflects its view of some of the Bill&#039;s other provisions. The Government say that they wish to have a one-stop appeals system, but I should have thought that there were alternative ways of achieving that. I hope that the other place will examine that carefully, because improvements could be made.

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para17">
<a name="stpa_379">The quality of the decision making on entry clearance appeals has been identified as being poor, even in the report by the Constitutional Affairs Committee from which I quoted earlier. We are pleased that there is scope for review and monitoring. However, as additional efforts to improve quality control do not substitute for what is already in place, particularly for appeals, we hope that that will be examined in another place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para18">
<a name="stpa_380">As regards employment, there are real risks that employers, not least because of the heavy burden of checking placed upon them, will be reluctant to employ people who are, or whom they think might be, subject to immigration control. That could result in an increase of discrimination in employment. The proposed code of practice certainly holds no magic answer to this problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para19">
<a name="stpa_381">The ongoing obligation on employers to check the immigration status of employees will cause difficulties in practice. For example, at the time when a person&#039;s leave is due to run out, their documents are usually with the Home Office. There has been criticism from the Immigration Advisory Service and even from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, whose chief executive has said that part of the Bill is asking employers to do the Home Office&#039;s dirty work, and that people migrate here because there is work for them to do. There are warnings there, as well as in the views of the CBI and the National Farmers Union about the employment of agricultural workers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para20">
<a name="stpa_382">I was pleased that the Minister accepted some of our suggestions, particularly the amendment relating to the period of 28 days. We thank him for looking with favour on that. On the powers of search and arrest, it is extremely risky to give private contractors the right to detain. The Government say that the contractors will only be searching lorries, but what would happen if they found someone? I am still worried about the scrutiny, accountability and oversight of private contractors, on whom I am actually very keen. Concerns have also been expressed in that regard about the potential for ill-treatment during detention and escort, and those concerns must be dealt with at some stage. There is certainly no case for giving powers to detain, arrest or search to anyone other than professionals. The Minister must ensure that the people who are employed in this area are trained, skilled and accountable. Perhaps that issue will be considered in another place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para21">
<a name="stpa_383">I would like to acknowledge the people who have briefed us on these issues. There have not been as many lawyers, officials and rafts of people coming to our door to brief us as the Government have had, but we have been very impressed by the calibre of the organisations that have sought to have their views aired. I hope that they will consider that we have done justice to their views, even though in some cases we do not entirely agree with them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para22">
<a name="stpa_384">I also want to acknowledge the work of all members of the Committee. As I said at the end of the Committee stage, the Bill will make our borders safer and make our country a better place for people to come and live in and to visit. We hope that the legislation, in whatever form it finally appears, will help the people who defend our country to do a better job and to make it a place that provides us with a safe and sure environment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-30_para23">
<a name="stpa_385">The Bill will go to the other place, where I hope it will be refined in some of the ways that I have outlined today. However, in the light of the way in which we have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 1069</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>conducted the proceedings on the scrutiny of the Bill, I would like to tell the Minister that, should a vote be called on Third Reading tonight, I shall ask my hon. Friends who are present in the House to join the Government in the Lobby, to ensure that both parties stand four-square against terrorism. The message must go out clearly from the House that, regardless of rhetoric and political differences, when it comes to the safety and security of our citizens the Conservative party will stand behind the Government in this instance.

 I see that we have about a minute left, so it will be difficult to make much of a contribution. I want to make the point that, for some of us, there are still areas of serious concern in the Bill, especially on appeal rights. I know that a lot of what has to be done on appeal rights will depend on secondary legislation, and I say to the Minister that I hope that he talks to Members of the House before that legislation is introduced so that we are clear about where we can and cannot maintain some appeal rights.

<p><a name="st_323"><a name="51116-32_spnew1"><b> Mr. Mark Lancaster  (North-East Milton Keynes) (Con):</b> 
 I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to address the House on what I consider to be a major problem within Britain&#039;s drinking culture, a view that I think is shared by many hon. Members on both sides of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_389">In Milton Keynes, we are only too aware of the dangers of glass bottles and glasses. In the early hours of last Christmas morning, one of my constituents, Blake Golding, was the victim of a brutal bottle attack while working as a doorman. At just 22 years of age, he was scarred for life while going to the aid of a colleague. That terrible incident could have been prevented if the attacker had not had access to a glass bottle. The terrifying fact is that bars and clubs have extremely dangerous weapons at arm&#039;s reach. A glass or bottle can be used by anyone to cause a great deal of harm to another individual.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_390">On 14 June 2005, a campaign was set up by Blake&#039;s family and as a result 12,000 people, including hundreds of police officers, have signed a petition calling for a Government ban on glass drinking vessels in all late-night clubs and bars. The success of the campaign is testament to the determination of the Golding family and the support shown by our local newspaper, the <i>Milton Keynes Citizen</i> and Three Counties Radio. I hope to be able to increase awareness of the issue today, and to gain further support for such a change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_391">Unfortunately, this problem has remained largely unaddressed by successive Governments, yet we are talking about a readily available weapon that can cause much harm, as Blake&#039;s case has shown. In fact, glasses and bottles are the most common weapons used in violent assaults in the United Kingdom, which is no wonder when we consider how many drinks are served in glass containers. In the UK, over 5.6 billion pints of beer are served in bars, pubs and clubs a year, nearly 6.8 million bottles of beer, 4.2 million bottles of alcopops and 313,000 bottles of wine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_392">The risk associated with drinking glasses and bottles is being highlighted, but it takes cases such as Blake&#039;s to increase support for the proposed ban. Bar Mee in Milton Keynes became the first pub in the area to serve drinks solely in sturdy plastic glasses and bottles in a bid to reduce the horrifying number of bottle attacks. Milton Keynes council is proposing a motion to amend its licensing policy regarding this issue. It is also worth acknowledging the policy of Yates&#039;s bars nationwide, which already use shatter-proof plastic glass. We need to make that the case in all bars and clubs across the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_393">The night-time entertainment districts of many towns and cities are expanding. Although that has economic benefits, it can be accompanied by an increase in crime and disorder because of the high concentration of pubs and clubs. Research shows that there is a link between alcohol consumption and violent behavior. A study by the Prime Minister&#039;s strategy unit suggests that 1.2 million incidents of alcohol-induced violence are reported every year.

<p>
<a name="51116-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_394">According to the 2001&#150;02 British crime survey, in 47 per cent. of all violent incidents, the victim described the assailant as being under the influence of alcohol at the time of the assault. Furthermore, 38 per cent. of stranger violence and 23 per cent. of acquaintance violence occurred in or around a pub or a club.
</p>





<p><a name="st_324"><a name="51116-32_spnew2"><b> Mr. Peter Bone  (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for giving way and congratulate him on securing a debate on such an important issue. He will know that in the adjacent constituency of Wellingborough, this is a huge issue, too. Does he agree that parents have two main concerns when their nearly adult children go off perhaps to Northampton on a Friday night to attend a club? They are worried, first, about their children being in a car accident and, secondly, that they might be assaulted by some drunken yob in a club and come back home with dreadful injuries.
</p>





<p><a name="st_325"><a name="51116-32_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lancaster: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Our constituencies neighbour each other and his constituents go not only to Northampton, but to Milton Keynes. I thank my hon. Friend for his valuable point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_395">More than half of all incidents of alcohol-related violence result in some form of injury. In a fifth of incidents, the perpetrator had a weapon that he threatened to use&#151;usually a glass or a bottle. Figures obtained for Manchester show that one person is seriously wounded by a bottle every fortnight. Toughened glass is now being introduced in bars and clubs and serious assaults have fallen by up to 50 per cent.
</p>





<p><a name="st_326"><a name="51116-32_spnew4"><b> Julie Morgan  (Cardiff, North) (Lab):</b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this debate and I have great sympathy with what he is saying. May I draw his attention to the good work done by AMEC&#151;the Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign&#151;in Cardiff, and particularly to the work of my constituent, Professor John Shepherd, who works in the dental school at the Heath hospital and has campaigned for many years for the prevention of glass injury in pubs and clubs? He has succeeded in reducing the number of serious accident and emergency cases. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that recent proposals in Cardiff to compel some pubs and clubs to use plastic glasses after 11 pm and to introduce bottle banks in the city&#151;getting the glass off the streets&#151;represent a step forward that will further reduce the number of injuries in Cardiff?
</p>





<p><a name="st_327"><a name="51116-32_spnew5"><b> Mr. Lancaster: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Lady, who makes a very good point. The work of Professor Shepherd is well known to me, as I believe that he has proposed a British standard for toughened glass. I would certainly welcome that measure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_396">In Glasgow city centre in 2003, there were 313 serious assaults, 81 of which involved glass bottles. Of those, 69 involved people being struck on the head with a bottle. Those are hugely worrying statistics and if we take account of the number of drinks served every year, we have to accept that if someone wants to act in a violent manner, one of the many bottles or glasses that are close to hand will be an easy choice of weapon. If those bottles and glasses were replaced with plastic, they would not be able to cause the damage that they do. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 1075</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Plastic bottles and glasses would allow for a safer drinking and social environment and a change to plastic could also lessen insurance premiums for pubs and clubs, as well as provide a safer working environment for bar staff to operate in&#151;though those are just small benefits in comparison with the opportunity to save lives and prevent serious injuries.

 I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this evening&#039;s Adjournment debate. I represent the Kettering constituency and Kettering is the nightclub capital of Northamptonshire. I believe that many of my constituents will welcome both the debate that he has started this evening and his proposals for change. Kettering general hospital has a major accident and emergency department and I believe that many health service staff will also welcome the proposals that he is advancing this evening.

 I thank my hon. Friend for his comments, though I would, of course, dispute the fact that Kettering is the nightclub capital of the midlands, as I like to think that Milton Keynes is&#151;perhaps we should debate that at another time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_397">It is important to note that plastic bottles and glasses are recyclable. Britain&#039;s plastic bottles create 500,000 tonnes of waste every year, but many local councils now have recycling schemes that allow plastic to be reprocessed into various new products, including clothing and textiles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_398">The company Coors Brewers has also produced new containers made of reusable toughened plastic. They cost roughly the same as the traditional glass and are also unbreakable, which means that they cannot be smashed and used as dangerous weapons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_399">Glasgow city council is working towards becoming the UK&#039;s first glass-free city. In October, it introduced a compulsory ban on the sale of alcohol in glass bottles or containers in clubs. The conditions of that ban must be met by January 2006, and all other venues in Glasgow will be expected to follow suit within a year. Producers of top brands, including Stella, Budweiser, Foster&#039;s, Carling, Miller, Guinness and Tennants, support the principle behind that move, and I see no reason why the rest of the UK should not follow suit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_400">Unfortunately, despite positive steps by individual councils, bar chains and brewers, the Licensing Act 2003 merely calls for drinking establishments to look into adopting the use of toughened glass, but that substance cannot be used to produce bottles in the way that multilayered plastic can. In fact, the Government may be about to add to the problems with the implementation of the 2003 Act, which I and many others fear will lead to an explosion of binge drinking and antisocial behaviour.

 This subject is of particular constituency interest to me, as a young woman called Louise McClintock lost an eye in a glass incident in Taunton. She was also severely scarred by the attack. May I commend the Somerset police force&#039;s initiative called &quot;Drink Safe, Be Safe&quot;? The police have worked with bars and other organisations, particularly in Taunton, to improve the safety of drinking environments, and have encouraged the use of plastic bottles and glasses. I hope that both the hon. Gentleman and the Minister will find an opportunity to come to Taunton and see the excellent progress that is being made.

<a name="stpa_403">Hospital staff have also raised concerns that the new licensing laws will lead to an increase in binge drinking and a rise in the number of assaults. Currently, 40 per cent. of accident and emergency admissions are alcohol related, and the proportion rises to 70 per cent. between midnight and 5 am.

<a name="51116-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_404">An investigation into 24-hour drinking was carried out at Ninewells accident and emergency department in Dundee, where more flexible drinking hours already operate. Staff at Ninewells claimed that drink-related violence had got worse, with many more high-violence assaults resulting from people being involved in large fights. Many of the injuries sustained were caused by bottles and glass being used as weapons. That makes it even more crucial that we make it compulsory for clubs and bars to use only plastic glasses and bottles. We must do all we can to lessen the dangers to members of the public.
</p>





<p><a name="st_332"><a name="51116-33_spnew4"><b> Mr. Charles Walker  (Broxbourne) (Con):</b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this excellent debate. Does he agree that much attention is rightly focused on the danger posed by knives, but that glass can be just as lethal and damaging to those against whom it is used?
</p>





<p><a name="st_333"><a name="51116-33_spnew5"><b> Mr. Lancaster: </b> 
 I agree, but there have been suggestions that, even if my proposals were adopted, violent people would still find weapons such as knives, and that attacks would still occur. It has been said that my proposals may not be the answer to the problem, and I agree that promoting the use of plastic bottles and glasses does not tackle the wider issue of why people act violently, or of why binge drinking is such a problem in the UK. However, I do not accept that we should therefore forget about a compulsory change to plastic glasses and bottles. The fact remains that using only plastic will remove potential weapons that can inflict a great deal of harm. We would be taking glass out of the equation. How can that be a bad thing?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_405">There may be a short-term cost implication for manufacturers in a switch to plastic and I appreciate their concerns about that. It may require price increases, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>but surely those will be outweighed if serious injuries are prevented. It is a small price to pay for preventing the physical and mental damage that a glass attack can cause.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_406">There have been proposals for new measures in venue management; for example, ensuring a quicker collection of empties or altering the atmosphere in clubs and pubs. Introducing such measures is not enough, as it would not completely remove the risk. There would still be an opportunity for glass attacks to occur, and I do not want to see another person suffer injuries like those of Blake Golding.

<a name="stpa_407">My proposed change could save people&#039;s lives and will reduce the injuries that are sustained annually through bottle attacks.

<a name="stpa_411">The local police in Milton Keynes must also be commended for their overall approach to tackling the problem of alcohol-related violent crime and disorder. I understand that their proactive and targeted approach led to a reduction in public place violence offences of 39 per cent. between April and September 2005, compared with the same period in 2003, which is an impressive statistic. I believe that the proactive use of CCTV and fixed penalty notices has helped to contribute to that reduction. If alcohol misuse is going to be tackled effectively, full use needs to be made by all partners of the wide range of powers available.

<a name="stpa_412">Of course the police have an important role to play in preventing alcohol-fuelled disorder, but the drinks industry has an equally important role. As the hon.

He is wrong to claim that the 2003 Act empowers local authorities to turn only to toughened glass.

The courts may further extend the period of closure until the licence has been reviewed by the licensing authority.

<p>
<a name="51116-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_417">Following a review hearing, the licensing authority is given substantial powers to act where it is necessary to promote the prevention of crime and disorder and public safety. For example, it may add new conditions to the licence, such as requiring a ban on the sale of alcohol in bottles and on the removal from the premises of bottles and open vessels, such as beer glasses, and requiring alcohol to be served in plastic containers or toughened glass. Such conditions might apply at certain times of the day or on certain days of the week. They are all included as possible conditions in the guidance that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport issued to licensing authorities, with the approval of Parliament, in July 2004.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51116-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_418">Local licensing authorities can decide to add conditions to new or varied licences. Virtually all premises that have sought variations to the licences during the transitional period between the old and the new licensing regimes have had new conditions attached to their licences that have often been promoted by the police. Again, the conditions have drawn on the guidance issued by the Secretary of State as appropriate and necessary.

<a name="51116-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_419">If licence conditions are breached following a review, the licensing authorities have strong powers to suspend licences for between one day and three months, or to revoke a licence permanently. Premises licence holders may also be prosecuted for breaching their licence conditions and can face sentences of a fine not exceeding &#163;20,000, or imprisonment for up to six months, or both. The Licensing Act 2003 gives local authorities the power to target premises that have problems with alcohol-related violent crime and disorder and to attach conditions to their licences.

It set out several proposals for helping to tackle the problems of alcohol misuse, including plans for introducing drinking banning orders and powers for local authorities and the police to designate alcohol disorder zones and to charge licensed premises for the cost of dealing with alcohol-related crime and disorder. Drinking banning orders will bar people who have too much to drink and then commit crime or behave in a disorderly manner from licensed premises within a certain locality for a period between two months and two years.

An expedited review is a mechanism by which the police can apply to the local licensing authority for the review of a premises licence if premises are associated with serious crime or disorder. Let us make no mistake: an incident of someone being stabbed in the face with a glass or a bottle amounts to serious crime or disorder.

Interim steps can include attaching conditions to the licence, such as the need to use plastic vessels or toughened glass. Although it is possible for the police to apply for licence reviews under the Licensing Act, the Violent Crime Reduction Bill will allow the police to make a rapid response to tackle serious crime and disorder. The measure will be a vital tool for the police and licensing authorities throughout the country when dealing with alcohol-related violent crime and disorder.

<a name="stpa_425">The hon. Gentleman referred to the role of the industry. It has a vital role to play in minimising the risks of alcohol misuse. In individual establishments, there is a wide range of steps that can usefully be taken to minimise the risk of such injuries, including educating customers, licensees and staff about the possible dangers arising from the careless use of glass, ensuring that bar staff are diligent in collecting empty bottles and glasses, thus reducing the possibility of accidental harm, and ensuring that licensees and door staff keep a tight rein on their bottles and glasses and prevent them from being removed so that they cannot cause injury or other problems to people leaving the premises.

<a name="stpa_426">I am pleased with the efforts made by the drinks industry to promote the use of toughened glass in pubs and clubs. The industry estimates that between 80 and 90 per cent. of pubs and clubs use toughened glass as a standard. It is pleasing that brewers are now beginning to use bottles that are made of toughened plastic&#151;the hon. Gentleman referred to the work of Coors in that regard. In addition, there is an important role for local authorities to play in helping to manage the night-time

<br>&nbsp;<br>economy. That includes ensuring that sufficient secure bottle banks are provided in the right locations and emptied regularly to provide a safe place for bottles to be disposed of when, for example, they are confiscated by the police. That helps to reduce the risk of bottles being used as weapons.

<a name="stpa_427">I acknowledge that the problems of alcohol misuse are especially present on the streets. Responsibility for ending the binge-drinking culture lies with the individual as much as, if not more than, it lies with the industry and licensed premises. Extensive use has been made of the fixed penalty notice for disorder scheme for alcohol-related offences, and a range of other tools have been used to tackle problems of alcohol misuse in the public space.

<a name="stpa_428">As I said, through the Violent Crime Reduction Bill we are introducing a new civil order&#151;a drinking banning order&#151;which will be available to the courts to use to protect people and their property from criminal or disorderly conduct by an individual when under the influence of alcohol. The Bill also provides new powers for the police and local authorities to designate alcohol disorder zones as a last resort where other methods have been tried to tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder but have not worked. That will enable the police and local authorities to require licensed premises to undertake measures to prevent alcohol-related violence, including the use of toughened glass and plastic bottles, and to charge for individual enforcement services. The measures in the Bill will complement&#151;
