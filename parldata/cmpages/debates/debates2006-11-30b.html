As we all know, the vast majority of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses are small business people, and they sometimes trade jointly and service communities with other products.

The Prime Minister has established the Ministerial Committee on the Post Office Network, MISC 33, which has met several times.

Will he reassure us that the proposals in the forthcoming statement will enable sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses to enter into contracts with the Post Office so that they can compete by using their entrepreneurial flair in their own shops, and will also encourage the Post Office to produce a range of innovative products so that it can compete more effectively with the banking sector?</p>

The way in which benefits are received is changing, but as I said earlier, at least 1 million people will still depend fully on the Post Office for their benefits.

In rural communities, like my Bolsover constituency, which is 25 to 30 miles long, most rural post offices have survived&#151;with help&#151;but in some cases people do not want to run the post office because they cannot make a profit. We did things about that: one of the things we did was to manage to get one set up in the miners&#146; welfare, and it is still there. When the Minister discusses great and grandiose plans, will he take into account the fact that imaginative ideas such as that should be continued with, because we can save quite a lot of post offices if people only put their minds to it?</p>

The Department of Trade and Industry, Royal Mail Group and Post Office Ltd have spent &#163;25 million on pilots over 18 months, examining operations such as personal banking, virtual banking, mobiles and hosting operations, and they have been enormously successful. In fact, we have returned post office services to some communities that lost them years ago. The Post Office has to be imaginative. There will be an opportunity for communities to examine the Secretary of State&#146;s proposals and to see if they fit with their profile, and for them to come up with their own ideas on how best to protect their network, which we want to make sure will be provided nationally. So the points made by my hon. Friend are very relevant to many communities.</p>

We all understand that we need massive investment in energy infrastructure over the coming five, 10 or 15 years. The Government are therefore looking very seriously at those planning issues, so that we may achieve a better balance between local concerns and our energy security needs.

I have often gone on record saying that that relationship has to start when children are quite young, because they make their subject choices at a very early age. They should be inspired, and the enormous excitement that can come from a career in manufacturing and enterprise must be made visible to them, so I would be grateful if he gave me that information. I say to him, again, that he should not talk down manufacturing. Manufacturing output is up, quarter on quarter, and in the last quarter it went up yet again. In the automotive industry, for example, we are producing as many cars today as we did at the height of car production in the 1970s. It was when his party was in government that car production declined, because that Government failed to see the importance of manufacturing and enterprise to the economy.</p>

That will resonate with most people, who see the bicentenary of its abolition as a huge milestone.</p>

Of course there is more that we can do. In the spring, the Home Office, which has been consulting on those programmes, will publish an action plan. We will consider how that can be developed and how the UK&#146;s human trafficking centre, which was set up in October&#151;it is the first of its kind in Europe&#151;can be used effectively to gather intelligence.

Gentleman and all his friends a happy St. Andrew&#146;s day. On the wider issue, I commend to the House a brilliant article by Mr. David Aaronovitch that tore apart the position of the Scottish National party. He wrote about the SNP inhabiting a parallel world in which it pretends both everything to every person and that there will be no difficult choices to be made if that dreadful event befalls Scotland and it goes independent.

To date, some 24 venues have been, or are being, monitored, and experts have confirmed traces of contamination at approximately 12 of these venues.

As far as we can tell, the risk of exposure is very low indeed because of several factors. First, polonium-210 is an isotope that radiates over a very short distance&#151;centimetres, rather than metres. Secondly, almost any barrier between the source of polonium-210 radiation and a person will stop the travel of that radiation&#151;even thick paper.

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="61130-0006.htm_para14"><a name="06113081000289">Can the Home Secretary give the House an assurance that, once this episode is put behind us, the general issue of the availability and ready transport of radioactive materials will be considered with redoubled effort and the appropriate clinical priority attached? I discovered this morning that the International Atomic Energy Agency&#146;s database on illicit trafficking has recorded more than 650 incidents since 1993 of trafficking in nuclear or other radioactive material. Those are just the incidents that the IAEA knows about, and the House will be keen to ensure that the Government will redouble their efforts to address that issue.</p>

Gentleman and he is correct that there is a BA helpline for anyone who thinks that they may have travelled on one of the planes. If necessary&#151;and the numbers should be falling all the time&#151;the helpline will refer them to NHS Direct, which will monitor them and refer them on if appropriate. The helpline number is 0845 6040171, and the website also has information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="61130-0006.htm_para15"><a name="06113081000291">The hon. Gentleman asks about cross-reference to the police.

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="61130-0006.htm_para16"><a name="06113081000292">As regards radioactive materials, I told the House in my last statement that there are probably between 130 and 150 sites where the material might be used in some form in the UK. As far as we can make out, there has been no loss or theft from any of those sites. That is our concern in the short term, but the hon. Gentleman correctly points out that in the medium term this incident will enhance our awareness of the dangers of the proliferation of radioactive materials, and we will certainly look to learn lessons from it.</p>

Friend been advised that the radioactive footprint in the aircraft indicates polonium-210 or other radioactive material?</p>

There are two stages to the process. The first is the detection of some radioactive contamination and the second, which takes a little longer, is studying it to see which form it is. In most of the cases that I have identified, the contamination is polonium-210. It is at very low levels in some cases, and higher in others, although none is a health hazard of any significance. As my hon. Friend may know, the radiation output is measured in becquerels, which is the rate of radioactive deterioration of the material, or the number of clicks on a Geiger counter, for those who are not scientifically minded. The range of contamination of polonium-210 found so far is quite significant, but even at the higher limits it is not a huge risk to anyone.</p>

Is not that a loophole that the Government should look closely at closing as soon as possible?</p>

I think that the system is working satisfactorily, although I hope that people will understand the problems that arise from the sheer number of travellers involved. As I said earlier, since around 1 November the three planes that I mentioned have carried something in excess of 30,000 people to 221 destinations.

Other planes may be involved that we do not know about at present, but those are the five that we know of. The hon. Gentleman also asked about airports in this country. Although we believe that we need concentrate only on Heathrow, several European airports might require investigation. The investigation is dynamic and is changing by the minute, let alone the hour.

Thousands of such people have been given asylum in this country, which is seen as a safe haven for those with political views that are unpopular in their own countries. However, if dissidents and &#233;migr&#233;s are being assassinated in public or semi-public places in London, this country will no longer be considered to be a safe haven.

Friend the Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para0"><a name="06113081000316">Before going further, I should stress that there was overwhelming consensus among the leaders of the 26 NATO countries on the crucial importance of strong collective defence to meet the security challenges of the 21st century. They reaffirmed NATO&#146;s central role in defending our countries and our common values.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para1"><a name="06113081000317">The UK had three priorities for the Riga summit: ensuring success in NATO&#146;s military operations, notably in Afghanistan; improving NATO&#146;s expeditionary capability; and improving NATO&#146;s ability to work more closely with civilian partner organisations and the rest of the international community. I am pleased to report that, despite the complexity of some of those issues, and some genuine and legitimate differences of approach between member countries, real progress was achieved in all three areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para2"><a name="06113081000318">The primary focus of the summit was NATO&#146;s current operations. Today, more than 50,000 NATO personnel are deployed in six missions on three continents. More than half of them&#151;32,000&#151;are in Afghanistan, which remains NATO&#146;s top priority. All 26 NATO member states reconfirmed their commitment to the mission. There was a shared recognition that success in Afghanistan is crucial not just for the Afghan people and for regional and global security, but for NATO itself. As the Prime Minister has said, now that NATO has taken on this vital but challenging mission, its credibility is at stake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para3"><a name="06113081000319">The summit offered an opportunity to take stock of progress in Afghanistan, particularly since 2003 when NATO took on the mission, in the form of the international security assistance force&#151;ISAF. In place of the despotic rule of the Taliban, the country now has a democratic Government. The economy is growing, and infrastructure and basic services are being rebuilt. At last, after 30 years of conflict, the everyday lives of millions of Afghans are visibly improving. According to UN figures, 4.5 million refugees have returned to rebuild their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para4"><a name="06113081000320">Of course, at the same time, the mission faces serious challenges. The Taliban and the drug lords are determined to fight to resist progress and they continue to exploit the impunity they have enjoyed in the south. ISAF forces have seen hard fighting over the summer and have taken significant casualties, but they faced down the Taliban and reinforced the Afghan Government in extending legitimate governance and the rule of law throughout the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para5"><a name="06113081000321">We know that some member countries have had reservations about the mission. Their domestic audiences have been concerned about the intensity of the fighting and have raised questions about the prospects for success, but even after this difficult summer everyone at Riga agreed that the mission in Afghanistan has to succeed. We should not underestimate the significance, at this moment, of all member countries explicitly reaffirming their support  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="30 Nov 2006">

<notus-date day="30" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>30 Nov 2006 : Column 1240</b><br>
for the mission and their common pledge to provide ISAF with the forces and flexibility to ensure the continued success of this vital mission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para6"><a name="06113081000322">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister led calls for our allies to reconsider how they might do more to provide such forces and flexibility. There was a welcome signal from a number of nations that they would lift the national caveats on the use of their forces. There were also pledges of additional force contributions. I cannot give full details today; Members will have seen reports in the press, but we must wait for national Governments to confirm those commitments in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para7"><a name="06113081000323">The pledges made at Riga are a small step in the context of a 32,000-strong mission when the ideal, as I have been impressing on my NATO opposite numbers for months, is that there should be no national caveats at all&#151;something that I am proud to say is true of our 6,000 personnel in Afghanistan. Nevertheless, we should acknowledge that even if those are small steps, they are steps in the right direction. Before Riga, the Secretary-General estimated that 85 per cent. of ISAF&#146;s force requirements had been met; that has now risen to 90 per cent. and we must continue to work until we reach 100 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para8"><a name="06113081000324">We must also continue to work on the wider challenge of transforming NATO. The threat facing NATO members has changed dramatically since the alliance was formed in 1949. There is agreement that NATO must transform its capabilities to meet the challenges of a changing world. We must become more agile and more efficient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para9"><a name="06113081000325">That is easy to say in theory, but harder to achieve in practice in the context of an alliance of 26 countries each with its own approach and its own sovereignty. There are signs of progress, however. Yesterday, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe declared the NATO response force fully operational. The NRF was established following the 2002 summit to provide a high-readiness force able to deploy quickly where required, to carry out the full range of alliance missions. That is a key development. Even before the force reached full operating capability it showed its worth, in the relief effort following the Pakistan earthquake last year. We also agreed new initiatives to increase the strategic airlift available to allies, to enhance co-operation between our special forces, to improve alliance logistics support and to streamline the NATO command structure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para10"><a name="06113081000326">Of course, as I have said countless times from this Dispatch Box, success in the type of operation NATO is now undertaking will not be achieved by military means alone. That is especially clear in Afghanistan. The international community needs to work in a co-ordinated way across all the different lines of operation&#151;security, governance, law and order, reconstruction and development, and counter-narcotics&#151;to deliver a truly comprehensive approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para11"><a name="06113081000327">That comprehensive approach is not unique to Afghanistan. It is equally important in Kosovo where KFOR has been crucial not just in maintaining security but in supporting the political process. Such an approach will be needed in the majority of operations the international community undertakes in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para12"><a name="06113081000328">NATO cannot do the work of supporting governance and development by itself; nor should it. We have to improve the way we work with organisations such as the United Nations, the European Union, non-governmental organisations and national Governments who provide civilian capability. Yesterday, we agreed to develop new proposals for improving civil-military partnerships throughout all stages of operations, from planning to execution on the ground. NATO does not and should not pretend to be the sole means of creating and maintaining security. The civilians and military working in places such Afghanistan or Kosovo are working for the same aims; it is not a zero-sum game, where support for the UN or the EU is a defeat for NATO or vice versa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para13"><a name="06113081000329">Many commentators feared that the summit in Riga would be a waste of time and at worst a failure. Those fears were unfounded. The summit reaffirmed the strength of purpose within the alliance and its commitment to remain a force for good in the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para14"><a name="06113081000330">NATO is not perfect. It needs to prepare for tomorrow&#146;s challenges while continuing to adapt to today&#146;s operational needs. It has started the process of transformation and it is the responsibility of all of us, individually and collectively, to support that process.

Gentleman, we ought to celebrate the success of the transformation that has already taken place in NATO towards the expeditionary capability that we are seeing so successfully deployed in Afghanistan. However, that is not to say that there are not still challenges. Some of those challenges were discussed at length and relate to caveats and to a commitment of forces. Significant progress was made in that regard, but there is still much to do and I make no bones about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para25"><a name="06113081000344">I do not think that it is appropriate that we only recognise the loss in Afghanistan of soldiers who come from certain nations. Many other nations, including some of those who have deployed soldiers to the north and west of the country, have also lost brave troops in engendering the progress in Afghanistan. It would be entirely inappropriate if, as NATO, we reduced our policy in Afghanistan to a balance of body counts. That is not the appropriate way to look at things. Sacrifices have been made by other countries.</p>

However, the hon. Gentleman is right that the commanders on the ground need to have the flexibility to be able to move their troops, in relation to the operation plan, across the whole country. However, we should not become Helmand or southern-focused any more than those who are in the north or the west should become focused on only those parts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="61130-0007.htm_para27"><a name="06113081000346">On the comprehensive approach, there has been significant development. That is reflected in the declaration, which I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has read, in terms of the commitment for NATO to work. The area is difficult, and I understand that. As I explained in my statement, it is not a zero-sum game between the European Union and NATO, and it should not be allowed to become one. He is perfectly correct to say that there is no need for duplication, but there is a need for co-operation and, in particular, strategic co-operation.</p>

Is it true that the larger countries, with the significant numbers, have agreed only that they will help in an emergency?

50 and 10 troops respectively, that is not going to make a big difference to the shortages of troops in southern Afghanistan.

The part of the declaration that deals with that covers a number of pages and he will have to take the time to read it himself. In response to his question, that means that non-NATO countries, such as Australia and Japan, will be able to discuss existing and future operations with NATO in a flexible, transparent and pragmatic way, and will have access to the partnership tools, which are important, currently available only to existing partners. Those are significant steps forward and they were unanimously agreed.</p>

There is an understanding by all those involved in Afghanistan that this is a long-term commitment. However, I hasten to add that that does not mean a long-term commitment in its current phase. As we have seen, there are parts of Afghanistan where our commitment to the country has moved it on significantly. Holding that improvement is, of course, important. Stabilising it, and building governance and economic development in those areas is important to continued security. I am careful to qualify the commitment to the long haul, because it is often erroneously interpreted as a suggestion that there will be a long haul of, for example, the sort of war fighting that we have seen in Afghanistan in the immediate past, but that is not what I mean. There is a commitment by the developed world, beyond NATO, to a long haul in Afghanistan, because there is no alternative.</p>

One of the delights of NATO is that the countries are all different, and they have different ways of making decisions. Some of them constitutionally require the involvement of their legislature in making decisions and announcements, so we must just wait and see what happens. However, there has been an important step forward in accepting the principle that the troops deployed to such a theatre ought, in principle, to accept the same risks. That issue has to work its way through, and I accept that there are still challenges.</p>

Will the Secretary of State confirm that in recent years our troops have been instructed not to fire a shot, but also to fire lots of shots; not to storm the Taliban strongholds and compounds, but also to storm them; to reconstruct, and not to reconstruct?

In the Canadian press and media and in Canadian public opinion, the view is expressed that for a relatively small country, they are doing their fair share and they want others to pitch in.</p>

It is interesting that my hon. Friend cites Kandahar, as opposed to Helmand. We in the Chamber sometimes become a little Helmand-centric about the southern part of Afghanistan and lose sight of the historic importance of Kandahar to the Taliban, how iconic it is and how it may well be their most important strategic objective. I cannot speak for the Canadian media, but I met the Canadian Defence Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and as a result of the conversations that I had with them, I have no doubt that the Canadians are committed to continuing to make a significant contribution to what they have taken on and committed to Kandahar. Part of what the Government did in Riga, together with others who were represented and who have troops on the ground in the south, was to work more closely together than we have been able to do in the past to develop a collective approach to the southern part of Afghanistan, because we are all there together and all dependent on each other. It is that level of alliance, commitment and support that will reinforce the success that the Canadians have already had in Kandahar, and ensure that the support that they have from public opinion for their deployment in Afghanistan is sustained.</p>

As the framework for co-operation in these areas, the way the Hague programme is delivered is important and worthy of debate. I am therefore grateful for this further opportunity to set out the Government&#146;s position on the Hague programme, including the proposal to use the article 42 passerelle.

In general, it is the right format for organising justice and home affairs work. The mid-term review was welcome because it has helped us focus on what still needs to be done, and was an opportunity to ensure that we prioritise what is important to our citizens. So far, it has been a success. We have had some notable achievements, such as implementing the European arrest warrant. We have established or developed bodies such as the borders agency Frontex, Europol and Eurojust, which are becoming more and more effective.</p>

Our top priorities are clearly strengthening our borders, stopping organised criminals and preventing terrorist attacks. We need to focus on efforts to exploit technology to strengthen our borders, including use of biometrics, and look at ways to prevent illegal migration at its source. We must use our political weight with non-co-operating source and transit countries to return illegal migrants, particularly to Africa, and work with transit countries to disrupt illegal and often dangerous smuggling and trafficking routes.</p>

Eurojust facilitated mutual legal assistance requests, the initiation and co-ordination of investigations and prosecutions, and the execution of an urgent European arrest warrant. The cases resulted in the start of an investigation in Lithuania against the organisers, a number of convictions in the UK, including sentences of 18 and 21 years, and the transfer of prosecution to Lithuania of a Lithuanian arrested in the UK.</p>

We need to enhance compliance with the convention across the EU rather than creating new law. We can then draw on the experience of practical co-operation to ensure that real needs will be met through any proposed legislation.

The most likely and widely discussed consequence of that would be that voting would change from unanimity to qualified majority voting and member states would lose their right of veto. The Government have taken a consistent position on the question of the use of article 42. As active and influential players in justice and home affairs in the EU it was right that we participated in this debate and discussed whether there were ways to improve the speed and efficiency of decision making in the third pillar, including in particular whether using the passerelle would have this effect.

It did not get much beyond the question of whether, in broad terms, member states were in favour of transferring police and judicial cooperation to the first pillar. The majority, including the UK, expressed doubts about the Commission&#146;s reasoning and concerns about the potential impact. Given the overall tone of the debate, there was little discussion of what such a transfer might look like or what safeguards or restrictions might be put in place.

We should instead focus our energy on delivering practical measures that make a real difference to the safety and security of our citizens.

Unfortunately, the context in which this debate has arisen demonstrates that what we see on the Order Paper is no more than some fairly woolly words that do not describe with any accuracy what has gone before. The hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty) and his European Scrutiny Committee have, in their disappointment at the Government&#146;s response to their questions, required that the report should be debated on the Floor of the House. I accept that the Chamber is not particularly crowded this afternoon, but some Members present were not on that Committee.</p>

One does not have to read the question and answer session before the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Committee on 18 October to feel a terrible sense of foreboding that we are being represented inadequately in negotiations in Europe about these very important home affairs and justice issues.</p>

Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) held the Minister&#146;s current role, I debated with her in Committee a similar set of proposals in relation to the penal regime that flowed from breaches of environmental law. On 13 September 2005, the European Court of Justice ruled on the powers that allow the European establishment to impose criminal sanctions for breaches of legislation in policy areas where the European Union has primacy in matters of law. That disappointed many of us. When I asked the hon. Member for Slough what would be the effect of a vote negativing the take-note motion that she was moving, she candidly said that it would have no effect at all and that the Government would not be influenced by it one way or the other. It strikes me as strange that a Committee of the House set up to discuss a particular European activity was being told by a Minister of the Crown that we could do and say as we wished, but it would make no difference to the Government&#146;s implementation of policy.</p>

Until we get clear answers from the Minister about what the Government intend to do, what their position is, and how they propose to defend the interests and rights of the British public, it is perfectly proper for the Opposition and other Members to criticise motions that are tabled in this rather bland and meaningless fashion.

We have only to look at the remarks of the Foreign Minister for Ireland to see how strongly he feels about this issue. We need to understand how important the making, enforcing and policing of the criminal law is to each country&#146;s own national make-up; these are not ephemeral matters of temporary interest.</p>

The EU already decides some justice and home affairs policies on the basis of qualified majority voting, such as those relating to asylum, although the UK, along with Ireland, has opt-in clauses on such issues, which allow us to choose which area of EU legislation will apply to us.

co-operation decisions, require unanimity, which, in effect, gives every country a veto. There is a legitimate argument to simplify procedures on justice and home affairs matters where the EU has a justifiable role. Again, as we have made clear on previous occasions, we are not advocating abandoning the veto on legal matters, which is neither appropriate nor necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="61130-0011.htm_para21"><a name="06113081000506">It seems to me that the EU has a fundamental role to play in guaranteeing peace and freedom across Europe. By promoting enterprise, protecting the environment, supporting global development and fighting discrimination, the EU undoubtedly brings enormous benefits to Britain. The EU must have the powers and resources to act effectively in areas where problems cannot be solved at national or regional level, while keeping out of areas where policy can be successfully managed at those levels. We will therefore continue to press for a diverse, democratic, decentralised Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="61130-0011.htm_para22"><a name="06113081000507">We also acknowledge the need, however, to improve the quality of EU governance. The EU should focus its policy making only on those areas for which EU-wide action is indispensable. That means ensuring that the principle of subsidiarity is fully respected. We recognise that terrorism, environmental pollution, trafficking and so on should be tackled through co-operation and international solidarity. Some cross-border issues cannot be dealt with by an individual nation or individual nation states. Where issues do not recognise national barriers, it makes no sense to place those barriers in the way of progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="61130-0011.htm_para23"><a name="06113081000508">There is a competence to legislate across the European Union on matters of international concern, and the UK Government must recognise that some crimes must be tackled using the first pillar approach. The priority for the Liberal Democrats has always been to ensure security for the UK and its citizens without sacrificing our liberties. In a world in which terrorists, drug dealers and people traffickers do not respect national boundaries, that can best be secured by working with our European partners in an efficient manner, while still ensuring that our national sovereignty remains intact. The Hague programme harmonises action programmes in criminal justice matters in such a way. We must, however, safeguard the common-law system. Distinctions need to be made between the controls of decisions to move to the first tier. Decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis, and the UK should retain its veto.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="61130-0011.htm_para24"><a name="06113081000511">The Liberal Democrats also appreciate that there are some fundamental differences between the UK and our European neighbours in relation to the working of our criminal justice system. We therefore believe that any move to QMV must be accompanied by an insertion of an emergency brake system into the law-making process. Of course, the ill-fated European constitution proposed that. It would mean that if the UK deemed a measure&#151;such as an attempt to limit jury trial or habeas corpus&#151;to be a fundamental threat to our national sovereignty, we would not be bound to implement such policies. Our judicial and legal system is different from that of Europe, and we must not do anything to jeopardise it. Let me make it crystal clear that Liberal Democrats believe in the fundamental importance of trial by jury and habeas corpus, and will never agree to any policy, whether proposed by Europe or the Government, that puts those principles at risk. Some might say that, if anything, those values seem more at risk from the Government than from Europe. We need more than a 90-minute debate on the issue, and I hope that today&#146;s discussion will be part of a much wider and ongoing debate among all interested parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="61130-0011.htm_para25"><a name="06113081000512">I have noticed that many parliamentary colleagues have already asked questions on this matter and received somewhat vague answers&#151;not just today, but on previous occasions. I acknowledge, however, that the Government&#146;s intentions on implementing the Hague programme have become a little clearer, to be charitable, as a result of the Minister&#146;s comments, but could she try to clear up some of the outstanding doubts raised in today&#146;s debate? Specifically, will she please confirm that any decisions about the Hague programme will be made on the Floor of the House, and that all members of all parties will have an opportunity to contribute? It is important that the constitution is not, and is not perceived to be, slipped in through the back door. There needs to be an open and honest debate about where decisions are made in the European Union.</p>

It is too cold for a start, and our language is extremely difficult.&#148; Unfortunately, we are targeted by people who are not always admirable or desirable, so it is important for us to retain strong control of our domestic, national borders rather than becoming part of a European Union that is effectively a state with an external border.

That in itself is associated with this provision, because those who advocate sharia law are also among those who, regrettably, have fallen into the trap of believing that some of the activities, in relation to terrorism, are justified. This provision is about such questions and I warn the Government to be very careful about undermining our system, either today by failing to be specific and making it clear that they will use the veto, as they should have done years ago, or by opening the door to some of the undesirable ideas contained in the Hague programme, which should have been repudiated years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="61130-0012.htm_para20"><a name="06113081000546">Although the UK is not in the Schengen area, it is clearly in our interests to collaborate closely with those member states that are, and I am pleased to note that the Government support the plan to register entries to and exits from the Schengen area. We must also heed the concerns of front-line states, especially those on the Mediterranean, which report enormous pressure from hopeful migrants from outside the EU. That is an issue on which we need full co-operation from all member states to ensure that we tackle illegal immigration from outside the EU and have workable systems for managing legal migration. In particular, as we talk about commemorating the abolition of slavery, we must work together to tackle the present-day problem of human trafficking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="61130-0012.htm_para21"><a name="06113081000547">We need to improve co-operation in one specific area. Following a dreadful incident close to my constituency, in which a Polish migrant worker, who had already served a sentence for rape in Poland, raped again. I discovered from the local police that there is no systematic EU-wide system for registering sex offenders. When I raised the issue with ministerial colleagues in the Home Office, they were very sympathetic and told me that it is being considered by EU member states. May I therefore ask my hon. Friend the Minister what progress has been made in developing an effective, EU-wide sex offender register? It is practical co-operation like that that is needed. It is only by having effective systems to keep appropriate tabs on the very few individuals who pose a threat to public safety that we can build up positive attitudes&#151;</p>

take advantage of that exciting opportunity, so it is crucial that there is the fullest possible collaboration between member states to deal with the small but significant criminal element that seeks to profit from that freedom. That is why I welcome the motion&#146;s emphasis on practical co-operation to deal with transnational challenges such as terrorism and crime.</p>

<p><a name="st_o306"><a name="06113081000553"><a name="61130-0012.htm_spnew7"><a name="06113081001758"><b>Mr. Wayne David (Caerphilly) (Lab):</b> On the whole, I welcome the Hague programme. It offers a practical approach to many problems facing Britain and Europe today. I also welcome the action plan adopted by the Council of Europe in June 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="61130-0012.htm_para23"><a name="06113081000554">The European Scrutiny Committee has studied four communications from the European Commission, one of which was the annual report on the Hague programme. It said that progress had been satisfactory, except with regard to the measures proposed under article 6 of the EU treaty. The main reason for that was the alleged lack of unanimity among Council members, which the European Commission believes makes the case for change to qualified majority voting and the adoption of the passerelle clause under article 42.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="61130-0012.htm_para24"><a name="06113081000555">As we have heard, the Government believe that the debate about the passerelle clause has come to an end, but my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty) was right to point out that the Commission does not agree. Only the other day, Commissioner Frattini declared in a debate in Helsinki that the Commission believes that the debate is very much still going on. The Commission has not modified its position one iota: it still believes very firmly that the Council should adopt the passerelle clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="61130-0012.htm_para25"><a name="06113081000556">We must be clear about where Parliament stands on this matter. Although I believe that we should adopt the positive elements of the Hague programme, it is important that we reaffirm our opposition to the adoption of the passerelle clause. I have four concerns about this matter that I should like to set out for the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="61130-0012.htm_para26"><a name="06113081000557">First, opting in to the passerelle clause would have constitutional significance. We must be mindful that the clause could mean that it would not be possible for Britain to have bilateral extradition agreements with third countries. In other words, it might not be possible for us to have an agreement with a third country to extradite terrorists. Given that that is one of the main concerns for most British people, we need to be very careful about adopting such a provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="61130-0012.htm_para27"><a name="06113081000558">Secondly, it is important to stress that there is no provision for rescinding an opt in. If we decide to opt in to the passerelle process, we are in there for good&#151;once in, always in. A linked problem is the extension into new areas of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. In addition, more powers are implied for the European Commission, as it would be up to the Commission to bring infraction proceedings, and there would also be new measures for the European Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="61130-0012.htm_para28"><a name="06113081000559">Thirdly, the passerelle would put the UK in a weaker negotiating position, because other member states would not take our position seriously unless we had  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="30 Nov 2006">

<notus-date day="30" month="11" year="2006" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>30 Nov 2006 : Column 1275</b><br>
decided to opt in. If we are serious about influencing the European agenda on justice and home affairs, it will be far better for us to oppose the adoption of the passerelle clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="61130-0012.htm_para29"><a name="06113081000560">My fourth and final point is that if the passerelle clause is adopted, it will undoubtedly introduce a high degree of uncertainty in respect of the future of Europe and the treaties. A linked worry is that because the constitutional treaty has not been agreed&#151;indeed, it was emphatically rejected by two electorates in the EU&#151;measures will be brought in through the back door. The issues that the passerelle clause will open up need to be debated, but fully and frankly as part of treaty negotiations; we should not simply slip into adopting measures by the back door. I am worried about that uncertainty and pre-emption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="61130-0012.htm_para30"><a name="06113081000561">This debate is timely. The Council of Ministers is meeting on 4 and 5 December and as Commissioner Frattini made clear, the Commission is still arguing four-square for the measure, although it recognises that some member states, especially the UK, have strong reservations. Nevertheless, the Commission has not given up hope of agreement on a matter that it considers crucial. It is, therefore, important that we, as a national Parliament, send a clear message to the Government. There can be no question of equivocation and no suggestion of capitulation or compromise&#151;we must stand four-square in our opposition. That is what we want and I hope that our position will be maintained by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="61130-0012.htm_para31"><a name="06113081000563">We take the Select Committee report seriously and are pleased to work with the Committee on these matters. The process is helpful and we value it. The Government are broadly supportive of the principles of the Hague programme as it stands; it was a good outcome for the UK when it was negotiated, and it remains so. In general, the format is right for the organisation of justice and home affairs work over the next few years. However, commitment to a programme as a whole does not mean that we must agree with the detail of all the proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="61130-0012.htm_para32"><a name="06113081000564">I understand Members&#146; concerns about the passerelle. I made it clear to the Committee that the Government&#146;s concerns featured prominently in negotiations on the justice and home affairs aspects of the draft constitutional treaty. I pointed out that</p>
<a name="61130-0012.htm_brev9"><a name="06113081001388"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the UK identified a number of substantive concerns, including the potential impact on national security, the extension of external competencies and the need for safeguards such as the emergency brake&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="61130-0012.htm_para33"><a name="06113081000565">Those concerns remain valid, and given the strength with which Members raised them today, it is right to reiterate them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="61130-0012.htm_para34"><a name="06113081000566">I take on board Members&#146; concerns about whether the position of the Commission has changed. However, there can be no move to the passerelle, and no move of measures from pillar 3 to pillar 1, without a unanimous vote at the Justice and Home Affairs Council. It is not relevant to talk of the back door. It has always been  <br>

possible to move things from one pillar to another through a unanimous vote. It is not illegitimate that that issue should be raised, but that does not mean that that is what is going to happen. The emphasis on practical co-operation is right. That is where we want to be and that is where we want to direct our effort and see results. I urge hon. Members to support the motion. </p>

The fund is essentially a benevolent fund for former Members and their dependants who have fallen on hard times and need financial assistance, and payments are made with regard to individual circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="61130-0013.htm_para2"><a name="06113081000985">The fund is governed by various Acts that stipulate the basis on which payments can be made and the amounts payable. Some payments are known as &#147;as of right&#148; payments; others are awarded at the trustees&#146; discretion. &#147;As of right&#148; beneficiaries are such because they are either not entitled to a parliamentary pension because they left the House before 1964, or because, as widows and widowers of former Members, they have their small PCPF&#151;parliamentary contributory pension fund&#151;pensions topped up. Some beneficiaries receive discretionary payments because of hardship and their personal circumstances.

In the year to March 2006, more than over 85 per cent. were on time, and the figure continues to rise. Many train operators now regularly achieve 90 per cent. or better, and this improvement has been secured against a background of strong growth through investment, getting the organisation right, and listening to passengers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="61130-0013.htm_para8"><a name="06113081000993">In 2001, after the Hatfield accident, punctuality had fallen to 75 per cent. The industry faced other problems which had dragged down performance, particularly in organisation and structure. Since Hatfield, however, punctuality has improved consistently. The latest provisional figures for the year to October show 88 per cent. of trains arriving punctually at their final destination. Punctuality and reliability are now at their highest level for six years, and this been achieved at a time of significant growth in traffic. That is best illustrated by the numbers involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="61130-0013.htm_para9"><a name="06113081000994">Rail passenger journeys have grown by 35 per cent. since 1996-97. In 2003-04, for the first time since 1961, more than 1 billion rail journeys were made. In 2005-06, the rail industry delivered another record breaking year. Nearly 1.1 billion rail passenger journeys were completed&#151;the most since 1959, making Britain&#146;s one of the fastest growing railways in Europe. Rail passenger kilometres have also increased, by 34 per cent. since 1996-97. The amount of freight moved by rail has increased by 22 per cent. in the past five years. In the face of these welcome trends, performance has been lifted from its low point five years ago, and that improvement has been maintained.</p>

The decision about whether to admit an open access operator depends heavily on whether its revenue stream will have a significant impact on existing franchises. My hon.

The community rail partnership that is proposed for Island Line cuts across the new combined franchise that has just been awarded to Stagecoach, under which it promises to invest in rolling stock.

The problem is that it achieves those punctuality figures with very slow journey speeds in comparison with the east and west coast main lines and very low levels of investment in the track. In considering the new franchise arrangements for the Midland Mainline, will the Minister look closely at journey times? Will he also consider providing support for Network Rail, which is now looking into a project of enhancement, costing only &#163;85 million, to begin to start reducing the journey times to Sheffield and other cities along the route?

From the passenger&#146;s point of view, rolling stock is very tangible evidence of our record investment. The average age of rolling stock on the network has come down from 20 years old in 2001-02 to only 13 years in 2005-06. In addition, 40 per cent. of rolling stock has been replaced in the last 10 years, and with 4,000 new trains and carriages we now have one of the youngest rolling stock fleets in Europe, as well as one of the fastest growing.</p>

With increasing numbers of passengers, however, it can also mean longer station stops. It is therefore all the more important to get the timetables right, a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) earlier. With timetabling, the significant gains in punctuality made by some train operators and Network Rail in updating timetable structure and time allowances indicate further opportunity for performance improvement. Network Rail has a published programme progressively to review timetables on other routes. More realistic timetabling has contributed to the fact that, on many lines, up to 90 per cent. of passenger trains are now running on time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="61130-0014.htm_para5"><a name="06113081001030">While making timetables more resilient, however, it is also important to ensure that the right balance is struck between the time a journey takes, and ensuring that trains run on time.

the network to meet the demands of rail users. Performance, both by Network Rail and by the train operators, has improved progressively since then. The 2004 White Paper supported performance improvement by making Network Rail the single point of accountability for rail performance. This has given it leadership of operational performance on the network as a whole and restores accountability to where it is best exercised.

Those have been reversed over the past 10 years. As the Minister rightly said, we have a growing railway, but that&#151;particularly when it has grown as much as ours over the past 10 years&#151;creates its own set of problems.

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="61130-0015.htm_para6"><a name="06113081001082">Let me also offer the example of my experience of timetabling on the Great North Eastern Railway route. I went up to Newcastle in the summer, and I checked on the national rail timetable website what train I should take. To my surprise, it told me to change trains at York&#151;to get a Virgin Trains train there, rather than take a GNER train for the entire journey. I was puzzled by that, so when I got on the train I asked the guard why on earth the website had given me that advice. He said, &#147;Ah, that is because we add an extra 10 minutes to the timetable between Durham and Newcastle so that we can catch up on any timetable problems we might have.&#148;</p>

There might now be a more realistic timetable, but the point I have made has to be taken into account when Ministers say to us that the railway is performing dramatically better.</p>

operators, passenger growth during those years is likely to exceed 30 per cent. The small print of the new franchise arrangements means that it is almost certain that unregulated fares will rise sharply year by year: this year it is three times the rate of inflation, and last January there were fare increases of up to 10 per cent. We are seeing the brutal reality of that on some parts of the network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="61130-0015.htm_para10"><a name="06113081001090">This summer, we discovered that the Government and one of the major rail companies had had secret talks about pushing up fares and pricing passengers off busy London commuter trains to try to tackle the overcrowding problem. Ironically, the route in question was the Thameslink route, for which the Government&#146;s 10-year plan promised improvements by now. We were told in the 10-year plan that the Thameslink 2000 project would be open by now and would provide longer trains and more space for passengers&#151;another example of a promise that has come to nothing.</p>

Friend is absolutely right, and that is the issue that lies ahead for the rail industry and the Government. They talk about improvements in performance, but our trains are increasingly overcrowded and action is not being taken to ease the pressure. Our rail network seems to be expected to absorb the growth forecast as a result of increased economic activity and the increasing numbers of people coming to live in this country. The practical reality is that our rail network will be an unhappy place for passengers in the next decade if action is not taken to ease the capacity problem. The situation is unsustainable. It is not realistic to expect the passengers of the next decade to travel on increasingly overcrowded trains; nor will we get freight off the roads and people to leave their cars at home if the rail network is under such pressure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="61130-0015.htm_para11"><a name="06113081001093">We must remember that all this is happening at a time when the taxpayer&#146;s spending on the railways is at a record level. Five years ago, the subsidy for our railways was just over &#163;1 billion a year; this year, it is in excess of &#163;5 billion. I see no sign that the Government or Network Rail&#151;the two organisations with the power to do something about the problem&#151;are really getting to grips with the challenge ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="61130-0015.htm_para12"><a name="06113081001094">The irony is, of course, that six years ago the Government did promise that they would get to grips with the problem.

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="61130-0016.htm_para0"><a name="06113081001103">Today&#146;s applicants for a passenger franchise do not bid to run a business: they bid to operate a detailed specification and timetable provided by the Government. They bid blind and, if they are the incumbents, they risk losing their business overnight. Because they have relatively little flexibility, financially and operationally, the winners tend to be those who squeeze the most out of the system. In the case of South West Trains, that means squeezing the most possible people into its trains and handing over the fare money to the Treasury. What is the consequence for passengers? Well, South West Trains bid more than &#163;1 billion for its franchise and it will have a severe task hitting that target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="61130-0016.htm_para1"><a name="06113081001104">Where will the mysterious 20 per cent. increase in capacity come from? It is true that the company is buying 10 new coaches for the Windsor line, but they will come nowhere near providing a 20 per cent. increase in capacity. Instead, it will come from ripping out seats on suburban trains to create more standing room. On medium-distance routes, it will come from removing toilets to create extra room for passengers and, on longer distance routes to the south coast, it involves scrapping the still modern and comfortable express train units that have two plus two, four-across seat configurations plus tables and replacing them with the more cramped inner-suburban five-seat configuration trains, cramming more passengers into the same space. None of that represents an enhancement of the service for passengers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="61130-0016.htm_para2"><a name="06113081001105">It is not an enhancement of the service to ask passengers who are travelling from the north-west to the south coast to get off at Birmingham New Street and cross over several platforms to change trains. New Street is probably Britain&#146;s most overcrowded station, but the imperative for improvement comes not from a lack of platforms but from the available space on the concourse. Only this Government would think that it was a good idea to have more people get off at Birmingham New Street to change trains<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>Is the Minister willing to intervene to tell us that that will not happen?

Long distance through services from the north to the south of England using the cross-country franchise and passing through Birmingham will have to terminate there, instead of continuing to their destinations.

They felt that the trains in question should not terminate in Birmingham. I am delighted if the Minister is refining the service pattern to improve the situation, and I look forward to hearing from those involved in running the franchise that they are satisfied that those changes have eased the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="61130-0016.htm_para3"><a name="06113081001110">My final point concerns the decision yesterday by the Office of Rail Regulation to refer the rolling stock industry to the Office of Fair Trading. It is not for us as politicians to pass detailed judgments on the decisions of the regulatory authorities, but I want to ask the Minister a few questions that I hope he will answer when he winds up the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="61130-0016.htm_para4"><a name="06113081001111">The Minister will be aware of the pressures facing our train construction industry. He is right to say that the change in regulations requiring train operators to replace slam-door stock over the past three years or so has led to significant additional investment in new capacity. There has been a substantial bulge in the supply of new trains to the network but, after that boom period, the remaining rail manufacturers in this country now face something of a bust. I am sure that no hon. Member wants our train construction industry to disappear, but there is a distinct dearth of orders to keep those very valuable factories open over the next few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="61130-0016.htm_para5"><a name="06113081001112">The Government and the regulatory authorities have decided to pursue a full investigation of the ROSCOs. That is a big problem for the manufacturers: it will almost certainly involve a two-year moratorium on the ordering of new trains, as the ROSCOs will be uncertain about their future business and therefore reluctant to invest. What consideration has the Minister given to that problem? What discussions has he had with the train manufacturers? How can he ensure that there is no hiatus as a result of the investigation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="61130-0016.htm_para6"><a name="06113081001113">The rail industry has had many successes over recent years, as well as difficult times and some failures, but it is what happens in the next 10 years that matters now. For passengers and freight operators, the coming decade is likely to be a period of increasing capacity constraints, congestion and overcrowding, and there is precious little sign that the Government will act to deal with the problem before it becomes acute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="61130-0016.htm_para7"><a name="06113081001114">It is not too late to make a difference, but Ministers&#151;who have taken it upon themselves to have a central role in running our railway&#151;must take decisions and act quickly. So far, the decisions are not forthcoming: projects are sitting on the shelf and the things that could make a difference are not happening. If Ministers do not get on with the job, the problem of overcrowding on our railways will be vastly more acute  <br>

Opposition Front Bench should suggest that the poor ROSCOs should not be referred to the competition authorities simply because that would force them to put into abeyance any orders for new rolling stock. For the last three years, the rolling stock companies&#151;particularly in my constituency&#151;have been trying enormously hard to get the ROSCOs to invest in the sort of contracts that would have brought jobs to Crewe and would have enabled us to compete.

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="61130-0016.htm_para24"><a name="06113081001141">The punctuality of train services has been improving. However, the number of cancellations and late trains remains unacceptable. In 2005, more than 100,000 train services were cancelled&#151;one train every five minutes. Central Trains was the biggest culprit, with more than 16,000 cancellations. Figures given for this year in a parliamentary answer in November showed that cancellations remain high in 2006, with six of the franchises having more than 5,000 cancellations up to August. Punctuality has improved&#151;topping 90 per cent. in January 2006&#151;but only to pre-2000 levels. Five of the franchises are currently running at under 85 per cent. reliability, using public performance measures, with a further seven running at between 85 and 90 per cent. Only seven of the franchises are performing above 90 per cent.</p>

In fact, according to the Government&#146;s own annual report, nearly one in four passengers is unhappy with train punctuality. Network Rail argues that trains are more punctual than planes, but given the nature and importance of airport security, it is no surprise that airport delays are worse, and the fact that railways are more punctual than aeroplanes is no excuse for the railways to be complacent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="61130-0016.htm_para27"><a name="06113081001144">I am sure that the whole House would agree that safety is paramount to a successful railway. Unfortunately, although there has been significant investment in rail infrastructure and in safety improvements, more needs to be done. The number of signals passed at danger rose by a staggering 62 per cent. between July 2005 and July 2006, and that is 20 per cent. higher than the average for the previous three years, according to the Office of Rail Regulation. Until there is a significant decline in the number of signals passed at danger, safety will remain a concern.</p>

The Government are investing &#163;87 million each week, but neither passengers nor taxpayers get real value for money.

I have no complaint about the service provided by individual members of staff on the trains that I use; in fact, I have been impressed by the staff who work on Virgin trains. On some of the less busy trains, however, the standard of service drops to such an extent that the carriages are full of rubbish. That is true, too, of weekend services, which are badly affected by maintenance work and staff shortages, often resulting in trains from Manchester to London taking twice as long as the fastest services during the week.</p>

I made the point that the staff who work on Virgin trains do a good job but, unfortunately, some trains operate with reduced staff and thus a reduced service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="61130-0017.htm_para2"><a name="06113081001155">Passengers think that they are being ripped off. The fact that passengers cannot buy the cheapest ticket at the point of sale only adds to the belief that tickets are not good value for money. It is ridiculous that someone can fly from Manchester to London for less than the price of a rail ticket. Customers are forced to book tickets far in advance to take advantage of cheap fares, but it is often difficult for them to purchase the cheapest tickets. Trains are losing customers, because many people have been priced out of flexible walk-on travel. Excessive price increases mean that standard open fares are far from affordable for most people, and the knock-on effect is that value for money in rail travel has deteriorated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="61130-0017.htm_para3"><a name="06113081001156">The Select Committee report stated that the industry has demonstrated beyond doubt that it can neither be relied upon to produce a simple, coherent and passenger-friendly structure of fares, nor is it capable of maintaining reasonable ticket prices. Prices continue to rise. In January 2006, commuters faced a double whammy, as they had to return to work after Christmas and pay a fare increase of up to 9 per cent. Recent announcements, as the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) pointed out, will result in further increases so that after this year&#146;s Christmas break passengers will again be subject to higher fares.</p>

There is a huge differential between the peak and off-peak travel, so there is serious discrimination against people who cannot afford to pay those outrageously high peak fares. The Government should pay close attention to that problem, as it is the worst kind of social classism. I am sure, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman is on to something.</p>

Although &#163;12 tickets are available on the Manchester to London line, there are very few of them. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times that I have been able to obtain one. My constituents would agree, as they often have to buy saver returns and travel off-peak, because the cheaper tickets for peak travel have all been sold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="61130-0017.htm_para4"><a name="06113081001159">Under the Conservative Government, rail use declined. The present Government face the opposite challenge of growing the railway network to meet capacity needs. An additional challenge is that as rail travel increases, the network becomes more congested which, in turn, imposes additional pressures on punctuality. On my own route&#151;the west coast main line&#151;it is estimated that without additional work there will be no spare capacity after 2015, even after spending billions of pounds on the line. Significant investment has been made in the railways, but more is required. Also, we need to get Network Rail to spend the money that it has received. It seems ridiculous that last year it spent only &#163;4 million out of a &#163;50 million budget for small schemes. Significant further investment would be forthcoming if we give franchise holders the incentive to invest by awarding fewer and longer contracts, so that the train companies can plan their future investment with much greater certainty.</p>

The announcement by Network Rail that Oxford Road, Cheadle Hulme and Hazel Grove stations will be made fully accessible is welcome, and I know that my hon.

It seemed to be more about grabbing attention for the NAO than about what was in the report. The NAO report sets out how the west coast main line was upgraded, how the costs were brought down and how Network Rail got it right. Its earlier report deals with the Strategic Rail Authority, which deserves a great deal of praise for setting out the blueprint.</p>

The Secretary of State for Transport had to answer questions from the Select Committee on Transport about why it was necessary to appoint a large City law firm to deal with the franchise problems of the west coast main line with Virgin. The answer was that because Mr. Branson employs a lot of lawyers, he had to too. Mr. Branson did well from the situation created by Railtrack. I think he got about &#163;550 million extra. At present he should be paying hundreds of millions of pounds back to the Treasury, but I suspect he is still enjoying the subsidy. Perhaps I am more critical than my hon.

The Government must take that seriously. There are some fairly straightforward solutions to capacity, but they will not solve the problem entirely. One is to lengthen the Pendolino and Voyager trains. Unfortunately, the Alstrom factory in Birmingham has now closed down. If the line is restarted, it will probably be in France, but that needs to happen. I understand that negotiations are going on with the Minister to ensure that those extra carriages are ordered.

Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew), who speaks with great passion about the west coast main line. It is important that individuals should champion certain parts of the railway, and I should like to champion my own part in the context of Reading station. I do not know whether right hon. and hon. Members are aware of the great significance of Reading station as a national rail hub. What goes on there has a knock-on effect right across the country, including the south-west, Wales, the midlands, the north-west, Scotland, and the south coast. The problem is that it has become a barrier to improved rail performance. It suffers, among other things, from too few platforms, poor track configurations, lack of access, and a fairly ancient signalling system. Although that has been known for some time, Reading has languished far back in a long queue, with no one to champion the changes that are required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="61130-0017.htm_para16"><a name="06113081001176">That is why it is so important that the railway has champions. Since coming to this House in May 2005, I have focused very much on moving the issue up the agenda. I have hosted regular meetings involving Network Rail, the train operating companies, Reading borough council and other stakeholders to try to get a degree of common agreement about a workable plan for Reading station. I have spoken to Members from all political parties, and they all agree that Reading station should be a top priority in terms of the investment that needs to be made in the railway system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="61130-0017.htm_para17"><a name="06113081001177">Let me explain why. Every single day, 621 minutes, or more than 10 hours, are lost in hold-ups at Reading station&#151;172 minutes in the station area itself and a further 449 just outside on the approaches into it. To put that in context, First Great Western runs some 1,472 trains a day. Those hold-ups represent a massive loss of passenger time. They cause not only a great deal of frustration but productivity loss to the economy and to British business. They are also a strong reason why First Great Western cannot meet its punctuality requirements. Indeed, leaving aside its often dirty and overcrowded trains, it is the worst train operating company in terms of punctuality performance anywhere in the country.</p>

That would allow for four new platforms, two reconfigured platforms, improvements to access and better ticketing. It would mean longer trains, more passenger capacity,  <br>

improvements to the track, and future-proofing for the link to Heathrow from Reading and the west, from which many hon. Members will benefit enormously. The changes would also mean that the negative loss from hold-ups of 621 minutes a day would be turned into a positive saving of 39 minutes a day in terms of journeys going through the station. All that for a fairly small sum of money that would also lead to knock-on performance enhancements across the rail network. The Minister should give this issue a great deal of focus and his urgent attention. However, I do not want radical changes to be made to the very good Network Rail plan so that the whole process gets gummed up again.</p>

It costs nearly &#163;30 for a day saver ticket to travel the 40-odd miles from Reading to Paddington and back again. Surely my constituents and those travelling through Reading deserve a lot better. I hope that in December the Minister will be prepared to meet me and the stakeholder group that I convened, thereby delivering on the pledge that his predecessor made on the Floor of the House, and that together we can provide the improvements and enhancements that the railways require.</p>

It reaches a number of conclusions about the state of the rail industry, which should help to formulate Government policy, particularly regarding the franchising of rail services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="61130-0017.htm_para20"><a name="06113081001181">My hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew), a colleague on the Select Committee, said that the Minister is fortunate&#151;particularly after such a relatively short time as Minister&#151;in being able to announce good tidings about our rail system. The Government should be proud of putting significant investment into our rail system. However, the question has to be asked whether the improvements are the result of the current structure of the system or due to the Government&#146;s efforts. There is also the question of whether other structures would allow us to achieve even more in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="61130-0017.htm_para21"><a name="06113081001182">Rail subsidy by the Government is running at roughly three times the rate that obtained under British Rail. It could be argued that if it had been known at the time of British Rail&#146;s demise that it could look forward towards that level of growth in investment, the problems of declining numbers that resulted in privatisation could have been seen in a different light. The Committee received evidence from a number of people, showing that the benefits that we have seen and the growth of the rail industry over the last 10 years are not necessarily the result of the structure, but due more to the additional subsidies. Growth has come about through greater economic activity as opposed to the decline experienced in the 1990s. That, not the structure, is the key reason why improvements, expansion and increased demand on our railway system have occurred.</p>

time as I felt that the new management taking over from Connex had successfully turned round the rail service and produced an improvement, particularly on the lines serving Dartford via Bexleyheath, so that people were loth to see it toyed around with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="61130-0017.htm_para23"><a name="06113081001184">I can tell the Minister that not a single train that I have travelled on this month has been on time. Trains seem to linger for two or three minutes on the platform at the central terminal in Charing Cross. For no apparent reason, they do not leave on time. No explanation is given for the lateness, which often leads to enormous difficulties further down the line. Only last week, I was sitting on a train in Charing Cross when it was announced that it had been cancelled, so I had to get off. A large group of people had to get off the train and they stood around the platform trying to find out what was going on. When I asked, I was told that it was the Eltham train, so I got back on it. Lo and behold, it left and travelled to Eltham. That shows the chaos that is creeping back into the service on that bit of the network. Similarly, I was off to a meeting on Tuesday, and I arrived at London Bridge 15 minutes late on yet another train service. That is my experience just in the past month. It is nothing like the service that was available under the previous contractors last year or the year before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="61130-0017.htm_para24"><a name="06113081001185">As the Minister pointed out, there has been significant investment in the infrastructure in that part of the network. The electricity supply has been upgraded, allowing for greater capacity and more reliability for local train services. We hear stories about leaves on the line&#151;thankfully, there has not been any snow yet&#151;but there is no excuse for the level of delay that I personally have experienced in the past month. It is not what we have become accustomed to, and the franchise needs to be looked at very carefully indeed. We have enjoyed significant improvement and a consistently high standard of delivery in recent times, so any slippage backwards is unacceptable. I hope that the Minister will scrutinise the delivery of that service very closely because, it has to be said, it was the Government who reissued that franchise. The buck stops at the Dispatch Box, and I will be raising the matter time and again unless we see the standards to which we have become accustomed being maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="61130-0017.htm_para25"><a name="06113081001186">The Select Committee also took evidence about the transfer of risk, which my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) has already mentioned. There is evidence that, when train operating companies fall into difficulties and go cap in hand to the Government, they are treated with kid gloves and allowed to refinance at a cost to the public purse. The Minister has said that there is no intention to do that in future, and we fully support that decision. If the train operating companies decide to play Oliver Twist and ask for more, I would urge the Minister to play Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="61130-0017.htm_para26"><a name="06113081001187">We are concerned that the present franchising system does little more than maintain the status quo.

I would not expect the companies to say other than that this will have an effect on investment. I would not expect them to roll over and say, &#147;Okay, it&#146;s a fair cop&#148;. I would expect them to make the noises that they are making, but I urge the Minister not to be convinced by them, and to stick to the position that the Government have taken.

I am sure that the &#163;10 million will have a significant impact on the existing rail system, but we have to bear it in mind that Crossrail will provide 40 per cent. of the growth in capacity that is needed in London over the next 15 to 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="61130-0018.htm_para3"><a name="06113081001193">We must also recall the fact that London&#146;s population is likely to grow by the equivalent of that of a city the size of Leeds. No other region faces such population growth. On Tuesday, when I was at the launch of the Mayor&#146;s strategy and the Transport for London document &#147;Transport 2025&#148;, we were given figures showing that by 2016 London&#146;s population will grow to 8.1 million and that employment will be up at 5 million. That is up by more than 1 million jobs on the current level, which means that the demand for capacity on our existing transport network will be significant indeed.</p>

I urge the Minister to bring that scheme forward as urgently as possible and note that Network Rail has called for it to be funded as soon as possible.</p>

That is bound to have a significant effect on modal shift. If the Government are to meet that demand and at the same time meet their target to cut carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent. by 2050, our rail network will have to play a significant part in meeting that growth in demand.</p>

On some routes, however, people getting on at stations in and around London have virtually always had to stand.

Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech) in an article in the <i> Evening Standard </i>on 2 October. In response to commuters complaining about South West Trains&#146; policy of reducing the number of seats in carriages, he said:</p>
<a name="61130-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="06113081001400"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is unacceptable that people are paying more for tickets but are less likely to get a seat.&#148;</p>

From where will extra carriages on trains come to meet the growth in demand? The Opposition are misleading the public&#151;and being disingenuous&#151;in saying that there is a simple solution and that no capacity problem needs to be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="61130-0018.htm_para11"><a name="06113081001207">The Government have achieved a great deal, and even Opposition Members have had to recognise the Government&#146;s significant achievements in improving our train network. The current franchising system, however, has not delivered for the general public. We need to listen more to what the travelling public are saying about our rail services, and design our services in a way that delivers for them, not for the people who operate the services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="61130-0018.htm_para13"><a name="06113081001210">I am somewhat disappointed with the level of attendance today, particularly among the Liberal Democrats. When their spokesman, the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech), began his speech with the words &#147;We welcome this debate&#148;, I wondered which other Liberal Democrats he meant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="61130-0018.htm_para14"><a name="06113081001213">As for the Minister&#146;s speech, the number of journeys made by rail passengers has indeed increased, and I understand that the distance travelled by rail passengers in the last year was indeed the greatest since 1946. However, that does not necessarily equate to an improvement in performance. Such statistics can be misleading. More people are using pushbikes, scooters, cars&#151;of course&#151;and aeroplanes. That does not necessarily mean that performances have improved; it merely means that more people are travelling today. As was pointed out by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), who chairs the Transport Committee, the nation is much more affluent today. We can afford to travel, and we do travel.</p>

<p><a name="st_o420"><a name="06113081001214"><a name="61130-0018.htm_spnew11"><a name="06113081002281"><b>Mr. Evans:</b> According to population statistics, 600,000 people have come in from 10 other European Union countries, and I suspect that they are all travelling as well. Clearly more people are travelling in the United Kingdom for that reason alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="61130-0018.htm_para15"><a name="06113081001216">Let me say a little about the Government&#146;s method of monitoring their performance. They rely on something called the public performance measure, or PPM, which is their yardstick for assessing punctuality and reliability. According to that measure, a train is described as on time if it arrives up to five minutes late in London or the south-east, and up to 10 minutes late in other areas. I suggest to the Minister that a more accurate measure would be one that specified when the trains were on time and when they were up to 10 minutes late. That would constitute a better recognition of how progress in the United Kingdom is made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="61130-0018.htm_para16"><a name="06113081001217">As a result of the PPM, targets are currently set at about 85 per cent. If there is a 10-minute leeway in either direction, of course it will be possible to squeeze all trains into the &#147;window&#148; within which they must arrive or depart. In fact, we have gone backwards since 2000, when the performance measure was 87.8 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="61130-0018.htm_para17"><a name="06113081001218">The Transport Committee, which has done a great deal of work on this issue, has been highly critical of the PPM target. According to its report published in May this year,</p>
<a name="61130-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="06113081001401"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it is clear that the target of 85 per cent. was set far too low.&#148;</p>

It is now cheaper to fly from London to Barcelona than to travel to Bournemouth by train. It is also cheaper to drive by car to Bournemouth than to go there by rail. That is not an incentive for people to leave behind their cars. On the standard of service, as Members have said, the trains are more overcrowded, and nothing is being done to tackle that problem. The Government made huge promises in their 10-year plan, which I shall come to later; unfortunately they have been left wanting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="61130-0018.htm_para24"><a name="06113081001225">In a recent report, the CBI commented that 63 per cent. of the UK transport network will get worse in the next five years unless there is major investment. It goes on to say that an astonishing &#163;300 billion is the minimum investment needed to deliver the required improvements to the transport network over the next decade.

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para0"><a name="06113081001240">We also need to look at some of the other targets. Halfway through the plan, the Government&#146;s transport targets have been shown to be unachievable and have been watered down. They are now considered not targets but &#147;aims&#148;, and the target of a 50 per cent. increase in rail use has been abandoned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para1"><a name="06113081001241">A subject that has not been mentioned much is violent crime on our railways. There were 9,748 cases of violent crime on the railways in 2004, the most recent year for which I could obtain statistics, which is an increase of 12 per cent. on the previous year. That is another concern that the Government must address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para2"><a name="06113081001242">I intervened on the Minister at the beginning of the debate to ask how much rail freight is going through the channel tunnel, and he agreed that it is important that we increase the amount of such freight. The channel tunnel has the capacity to push through some 10 million tonnes of freight a year, but it is averaging about 2 million tonnes. That is testament to where we are in our attempt to get freight on to our railways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para3"><a name="06113081001243">Colleagues will agree that every time that we overtake a lorry on a motorway, we wonder why on earth such goods are not being transported by rail. The reason is our existing capacity. An inter-city train charging along the west coast main line, for example, requires 8 miles of free track in front of it, because that is the necessary stopping distance. As a result, any freight or other commuter train is shunted out of the way. If we are to increase the amount of freight on our railways, there is a fundamental requirement for more track.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para4"><a name="06113081001244">According to a recent YouGov survey, 79 per cent. of people identified transferring freight from our roads to rail as the priority for the Government in tackling congestion on our motorways&#151;more than twice the percentage who advocated a reduction in roadworks, and more than four times the percentage who were in favour of building more roads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para5"><a name="06113081001245">The Government have a huge responsibility so far as our rail network is concerned, particularly given the challenge of climate change, to which reference has been made. I agree with many of the points that have been made today. One Member raised the question of a north-south link. Travelling to Europe by train is a very competitive alternative to doing so by plane, but the same is not true of travelling within the UK. If we want to travel to Manchester, Newcastle or even further north, the plane is the faster option that wins every time. A north-south link is imperative if we are to open up the north. I come from the south-west, which is hugely overdeveloped in part because businesses do not feel that they can locate in the north, given the lack of transport connections to the south.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para6"><a name="06113081001246">There are also other imaginative ideas, such as double-decker trains. To use such trains, we would have to rebuild some of our tunnels, which are far too low to accommodate them. However, that is the sort of vision that we must have if we are to have a proper 10-year plan, instead of simply taking seats out of trains to tweak the figures. We should also consider investment in signalling, as has been mentioned, and examine the timetables.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para7"><a name="06113081001247">The rail system is far from adequate. It is unable to meet the challenges of the 21st century and the  <br>

demands of a growing customer base, and it is unable to take advantage of the nation&#146;s desire to go green. It is also unable to meet the existing targets without ripping out seats, and it is not as integrated as it should be; indeed, it is fragmented.

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para8"><a name="06113081001250">I also participated in a debate yesterday and I apologise to the Minister for his having to listen to me speak twice in two days about the railways; I promise that I will say different things today. Unfortunately, in between the two debates there has been a crisis on the line that I have travelled on for the last 37 years, such that it took my researcher four hours to travel 30 miles yesterday. It took me an hour and a half to get home on what would normally be a 45-minute journey. Sometimes things go wrong and we must seek to improve maintenance standards as much as we can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para9"><a name="06113081001251">There has been much talk about climate change, and rail freight produces one twelfth of the amount of CO2 per tonne/mile of road freight. It would be a fantastic bonus for tackling climate change if we could get more freight on to rail. My hon. Friend the Minister will know that together with colleagues I am promoting the concept of a dedicated freight line from Glasgow to the channel tunnel, which would take 5 million lorry loads off our roads every year, transform the economics of the channel tunnel and provide for double-stack containers and trailers on trains all the way from Glasgow and our major industrial areas to the continent of Europe. It is a massive concept. It would also take most of the north-south freight from the east coast main line and the west coast main line, freeing up those lines for faster and more frequent passenger trains, producing much more capacity. If the east coast main line had some tweaking, such as quadrupling the track with a new viaduct at Welwyn and a couple of bypass loops further north, we could have 140 mph, non-stop trains from King&#146;s Cross to Edinburgh. On the west coast main line, we could have 135 mph trains, which might not be non-stop, but they would provide a very fast service. That would, at least for the foreseeable future, provide sufficient capacity for passengers on the north-south routes and transform journeys between here and the north.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para10"><a name="06113081001252">The rail freight line is my most important concern. Because we are an island off the coast of Europe we must be linked in to the European economy more strongly. We need a better freight artery into the heart of Europe and across the whole of Europe. The idea was promoted by Lord Kinnock, when he was the Transport Commissioner, of a rail freight network across continental Europe. It is now going great guns and a 35-mile tunnel is being drilled through the Brenner pass so that double-stack containers will be able to reach the dedicated freight line. Freight lines are also being built through the Alps between France and Italy. In the not too distant future, it will be possible to get full-scale freight trains all the way from the toe of  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para11"><a name="06113081001253">I raised the question of costs many times in transport questions with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when he was Secretary of State for Transport. The costs that I have been given for rail maintenance and new track have not been challenged and are horrendous. Before rail maintenance was brought in house, it was suggested that costs had gone up by four times under privatisation. Network Rail said that what was happening was that contracting companies were working strictly to specifications that might not be exactly right. Network Rail would discover the problem on Monday morning and the whole thing would have to be done again. The contracting companies were doing very nicely thank you, out of having to do the work twice. When it was done in house, the corrections were made as they went by directly employed engineers. The work was done once and much more cheaply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para12"><a name="06113081001254">My hon. Friend the Minister may be aware of the railway engineers forum, at which the keynote address was given by an official from his Department, who said that there is a huge gap between what the Government want to pay for the British rail system and what they are being presented with as a bill. He addressed construction costs and said that, at present, major project expenditure goes 50 per cent. on construction costs and 50 per cent. on other things. He contrasted that with the situation in British Rail days, when the east coast main line electrification took place under Don Heath, the very fine BR engineer, who is now retired. When he was asked what the project management costs were, he said that they came to 1 per cent. of the total, with 99 per cent. of the money going on construction. The Department for Transport official said that, by today&#146;s standards, the project represented &#147;exceptional value for money&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para13"><a name="06113081001255">The solutions that we need can be found in the way things were done in the BR days. I do not say that merely to make an ideological point, but it is clear that cash-limited projects undertaken by engineers directly employed by a publicly owned railway industry did a good job with the money that they had. The cash limits might have been painful and difficult, but they worked and we should return to that system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para14"><a name="06113081001256">Moreover, the people directly employed by the railway industry took great pride in doing the best possible work with the money available. We need to get that motivation back into our rail industry, as opposed to the present contractual relationships. Under the present system, the more contracts and funds that are available, the better contractors like it. It is very difficult to control the associated costs, as is shown by the fact that Network Rail is bringing its maintenance arrangements back in-house. I suggest that we return to something resembling what we had in the past&#151;an integrated rail system with directly employed engineers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para15"><a name="06113081001257">My hon. Friend the Minister knows what I think about franchising, so I shall not repeat what I said  <br>

If costs are brought down, we will get more for our money, and fares and freight charges will also be cut. Our rail system might then start to look a bit more like the systems on the continent, where fares are much lower. In addition, the travelling public will get a much fairer deal.</p>

Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) strongly criticised the Government for exercising what he called a high degree of operational control. That is an important matter, and I hope that he will bear with me as I set out my argument. If the Government were to abrogate their responsibility to set down minimum timetable standards, does he believe that private rail operators would continue&#151;perhaps for altruistic reasons&#151;to run services on lines that they deemed to be unprofitable? Were the Government to adopt that approach, I am sure that he would be one of the many MPs knocking on my door and asking me to intervene. He would want the Government to do what we are doing already&#151;that is, specify minimum levels of standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para19"><a name="06113081001262">Earlier, I issued a challenged to him. I asked whether, if he were to become Secretary of State for Transport in a future Government, he would commit his party to a completely laissez-faire policy in respect of the railways. I wanted to him to say, on the record, whether a future Conservative Government would set those minimum standards. It is telling that he refused to offer that commitment, which means either that he is convinced that private operating companies should be allowed to set any level of standards that they choose, or that he thinks the Government should intervene.</p>

The Government should have a strategic approach, and not get involved with minute operational details in the way that they do at present.</p>

I understand where the hon. Gentleman is coming from. It is perfectly legitimate to hold the view that the Government should not specify service levels, although I do not agree with it, but he must understand the real political consequences. Does he believe that Governments should take only a general strategic view? The Labour Government take a strategic view, but if he believes that the Government&#146;s role should end there, and that Members of the House would not want Government intervention on such matters, his mythical and hypothetical tenure of office will be extremely short and panic-stricken.</p>

Member for Epsom and Ewell has been consistent in saying that he does not want the Government to micro-manage and to specify conditions, but I detect a note of criticism when he stands at the Dispatch Box talking about South West Trains removing seats from certain trains. I may be mistaken, but he seems to be criticising the Government for the removal of those seats. Is he saying that the Government should intervene to stop SWT removing seats? Does he believe that future Secretaries of State for Transport should intervene at that level and stop train-operating company managements reconfiguring the seating arrangements on their trains? I suspect not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para20"><a name="06113081001269">The hon. Gentleman referred to fare increases. He said that the amount of money paid by taxpayers was at an all-time high&#151;those may not have been his exact words, I am paraphrasing. As he knows, some fares are regulated but others are not. If he is saying that more fares should be regulated, that is certainly an interesting policy proposal. If we regulated more fares, we would have to subsidise the private operating companies to an even greater extent. Does he believe that the Government should put more money than we do already into private train-operating companies to keep unregulated ticket prices down?</p>

In the meantime, does he accept my view that the way the Government have changed the franchising process is flawed and that the consequence will be more overcrowded trains and a less good deal for the passenger?

Friend says, we had the opportunity today to discuss precisely those matters. The British public will probably expect the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para21"><a name="06113081001273">I want to talk about the South West Trains franchise, which was announced in September and to which the hon. Gentleman and several Members referred. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency is served by South West Trains so it is perfectly legitimate for him to talk about the franchise. He cast aspersions, but much in the franchise is good news for the travelling public. He questioned whether there will really be increases in capacity and seats&#151;there will. There will be new rolling stock. Smartcard ticketing will be rolled out. There will be more secure stations; 95 per cent. of all passengers using the South West Trains network will travel to and from secure stations. There will be gating at stations, including Waterloo, as a way of preserving revenue. If he is not aware of some of those important, positive developments in the franchise, I am more than happy to write to him with the details. If he wants, I will even phone him. I do not know whether he has a mobile phone, but if he wants to give me the number, I am more than happy to get the information to him..</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para22"><a name="06113081001275">The hon. Gentleman also talked about the rolling stock companies and asked whether it was true that there was going to be a moratorium&#151;he predicted a two-year moratorium&#151;on the building of new train stock. Is he saying that, with the suggestion in the air that the rolling stock companies are making excess profits&#151;massive profits that would account for something like 8 per cent. of the total cost of tickets&#151;we should not have asked for a full inquiry into that business, simply because of the fear that those companies would stop producing new trucks? That is a dangerous attitude for someone in his position to take. The Government have a responsibility to be a good steward of the public purse and if the inquiry that we hope will take place reveals that we could be using some of that money for investment in the rail industry, I would have thought that he would welcome that.</p>

He is a member of the shadow Cabinet; he is in opposition; his job is to criticise the Government. However, a part of opposition is also to come up with alternative answers. His comments were noticeably lacking in any positive suggestion for finding a way to meet the challenges in the rail industry in the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para24"><a name="06113081001277">A similar comment could be made of the speech by the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech). I accept that he is standing in for the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael), but some of the comments that the hon.

Gentleman did talk about signals passed at danger, but I am talking about a separate part of his comments. He started his speech by making a comment about passenger safety, without reference to signals passed at danger. If that is what he meant, I accept that. It is something that the Government will continue to monitor. Just for the record, passenger safety on the railways has been going up historically and is now at an all-time high. It was going up during British Rail&#146;s tenure and it continued to go up after privatisation. It has certainly been going up over the past 10 years under the stewardship of this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="61130-0019.htm_para25"><a name="06113081001280">Rather than accept the fact that passenger surveys have shown that eight out of 10 passengers are happy with the service, the hon. Gentleman chose instead to emphasise that one in five passengers are unhappy with the service. That is a typically Liberal Democrat analysis. He forgot to point out, as I pointed out in my original comments, that for eight out of 10 passengers to be satisfied with the service is, in itself, an all-time record high. I find it a bit churlish of him and his party not to accept that that is quite an achievement at a time when we face so many challenges in terms of capacity.</p>

Gentleman said that there is still much to be done, but I come back to my criticism of the comments by the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell. Just because the Liberal Democrats are not, and never will be, in a position to form a Government, or part of a Government, that is no excuse for not having proper policies. I recognise that he accepted some of the good things that are happening in the railways, but it is not acceptable simply to stand in the corner of the Chamber and make criticism after criticism of the Government, without offering at least some glimmer of what the Liberal Democrats might do in the alternate reality where they form a Government. He did not talk about increased spending, what new investment the Liberal Democrats might make, or what new tracks they might build. I am sure that very few of the dozens of people across the country watching this debate will conclude that the Liberal Democrats have anything positive to offer, in terms of policy on the network.</p>

That is not the case in the UK, so we need a robust system to measure the effectiveness of our timetabling. In my speech, I made the point that the 10-minute window&#151;it is five minutes in some parts of the country, which is strange&#151;provides too much leeway. I accept that we could use a 10-minute measurement, but we should record how many trains arrive dead on time, too.</p>

I doubt that it is technically correct that in any European country one can set one&#146;s watch according to the arrival of any train. It is a nice idea, but I suspect that it is a utopian one. It is a delight, however, to hear Conservative Back Benchers espousing the joys of Europe for once. The hon. Gentleman said that the price of tickets was a disincentive, preventing people from travelling by train. That criticism has been levelled at the Government for a number of years, particularly since the regulations changed several years ago. However, customer numbers continue to rise, and they are predicted to do so in future.</p>

I have received apologies from the hon. Member for Calder Valley (Chris McCafferty), who has done such great work on HIV/AIDS on the Council of Europe and wanted to be present for the debate, but has sadly had to return early to her constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para10"><a name="06113081001303">I intend to speak for no longer than eight minutes in order to give my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) and the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard), the chairman of the all-party group on AIDS, an opportunity to contribute to the debate. I also speak in my capacity as chairman of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association virtual working group on HIV/AIDS, and I am grateful for all the support that I get from the group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para11"><a name="06113081001304">Sadly, the problem of HIV/AIDS is not declining. According to international AIDS charity Avert, there are 39.5 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. That figure includes 37.2 million adults, 17.7 million women and almost 2.5 million children. Last year about 3 million people died of AIDS, but 4.3 million more were diagnosed with HIV this year alone. AIDS has now surpassed the Black Death on its course to become the worst pandemic in human history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para12"><a name="06113081001305">Reading the news over recent years, one might have been led to believe that AIDS was a problem only for Africa, but other countries, including the United Kingdom, also have problems. In 2004 there were 58,300 cases of HIV/AIDS, but that rose last year to 63,500. Some, such as the Terrence Higgins Trust, believe that the figure is closer to 70,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para13"><a name="06113081001306">I praise the Government for allocating &#163;315 million, via the White Paper &#147;Choosing Health&#148;, to improve sexual health services, but as the Minister knows, many trusts are operating under huge financial constraints. The money was not ring-fenced, and much of it that should have gone to sexual health services has been used for other purposes, such as paying off some of the debts. In his talks with the Secretary of State for Health, will he ensure that any future funding is ring-fenced so that the money goes where it ought to go?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para14"><a name="06113081001307">The Government promised a &#163;50 million advertising campaign to promote sexual health, but the money never materialised. Only &#163;4 million has been provided for a health campaign, which recently started. Clearly, the Government need to reconsider what needs to be spent to ensure that people, particularly young people, get the information that they require to protect themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para15"><a name="06113081001308">On the international scene, with few exceptions the picture is grim, but at least an increasing number of services are being made available. Africa, as we all know, has been hit hardest. Almost two thirds of all those who are affected by HIV/AIDS live in Africa, although it contains only 10 per cent. of the world&#146;s population. During 2005 alone it is estimated that 2 million people died of AIDS in Africa. Since the beginning of the epidemic more than 15 million Africans have died of AIDS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para16"><a name="06113081001309">I was privileged to attend the world AIDS conference this year in Toronto and was appalled to hear first-hand of the problems facing Africa and other countries, including India, where 5.2 million are suffering with HIV. At the conference I had the opportunity to meet many groups and I applaud the work of the voluntary sector and professionals, who do fantastic work in education and by ensuring that drugs are getting through to the community, particularly rural communities, encouraging people to come for testing, and working with other agencies in countries that have a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS or in their own communities, especially universities, helping to remove the stigma.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para17"><a name="06113081001310">I welcome the support of Bill and Melinda Gates and Bill Clinton with their amazing foundation. They do so much to help get drugs to the right people and to raise the profile of the issue. I welcome the fact that the Department for International Development&#151;I am delighted to see the Secretary of State in his place, which shows how significant he thinks today&#146;s debate is&#151;has given &#163;1.5 billion since 1997, trying to strengthen health systems in the developing world and over the next three years has committed to a further &#163;1.5 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para18"><a name="06113081001311">I welcome where the money is to be spent, but I urge the Secretary of State to look at other areas where money is also vital. Will he target much of the money at his disposal at helping to provide vital drugs that are needed to combat the disease? Cheap drugs, such as Neviraprine, which costs as little as &#163;6, prevents HIV from being passed from mother to baby. I applaud this week&#146;s articles in <i> Metro</i> that pinpoint Ethiopia, where the drug has helped to provide protection for the babies of pregnant women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para19"><a name="06113081001312">I urge the Secretary of State to ensure that in the coming years Government funding is prioritised so that vital drugs such as these are provided to patients. We must also look at other drugs that could make such a difference to people&#146;s lives. Microbicide cream could make a huge difference to prevent the spread of AIDS. I welcome the development of recent years and we are now in the final stages of that drug being tested. For women across the world, particularly in Africa, it will provide independence and empower them to make positive choices to ensure their well-being.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para20"><a name="06113081001313">Will the Secretary of State also work with multinational businesses in this country so that all introduce positive work practices for their work force in countries that suffer from the pandemic?

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para21"><a name="06113081001317">Clearly, I could say much more about the issue, but I want others to speak. When I attended the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference in Nigeria recently I visited a small township just outside Abuja called Lugbe where I met Sister Cecilia and others who do fantastic work on the ground in a Catholic mission. I praise the work of the Catholic Church and other Churches. She introduced me to a lady called Pauline who lost her husband last year to AIDS. She herself was infected and destined to die. She lived in a typical humble setting and many thought that she would die soon. The drugs reached her and when I talked with her she was smiling and grateful, but more than anything else she displayed a vision of hope. Two of her sons beamed as they played around their mother. Had she died, the children would have been known as a cadet family, with the eldest brother looking after the youngest and all helping one another. That would have been pitiful. At least now the children have hope and the mother has a hope of seeing her children grow up. In this case tragedy was averted and I wish Pauline and her family the best of health in the coming years, but not everyone is so fortunate.</p>

I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) for suggesting that he would welcome the presence of colleagues in this debate. This is not a party political issue and never will be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para23"><a name="06113081001320">I want briefly to make three points, two on what is happening internationally and one on what is happening in the UK. The theme of world AIDS day this year is accountability. Organisations outside Parliament are asking us to be accountable for the promises that were made at Gleneagles and other international conferences, particularly on universal access to treatments by 2010. We have made real progress in the past few years. Not long ago, many people were saying that we will never be able to deliver anti-retrovirals in developing countries. Although we did not meet the target of 3 million people by 2005, the &#147;3 by 5&#148; campaign made a step change in the approach to the delivery of drugs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para24"><a name="06113081001321">There are two specific issues apart from the obvious one of finance. The first is that of drugs pricing. At the moment, there are significant differences in prices for second line therapies. That will become increasingly important over the next few years. Some of the first line therapies that are now available quite cheaply will not be as effective, and we will have to try to secure cheaper access to second line therapies. Connected with that is the TRIPS&#151;trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights&#151; agreement and the way in which that might affect the supply of generics. The waiver was agreed at Doha, but no developing country has yet taken advantage of it. I hope that through DFID we can actively help developing countries to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para25"><a name="06113081001322">The second issue is that of the pattern of the epidemic&#151;that is, the growing danger of major epidemics in eastern Europe and in India and China. If we get things right, we might stop those epidemics  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="30 Nov 2006">

becoming as generalised as they have become in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. It is partly down to money. However, to a large extent, particularly in eastern Europe, it is not so much a question of what the UK does to provide financial aid but of what we can do in working with those countries on developing sensible policies, particularly those where intravenous drug use is driving the epidemic and there is still considerable resistance from many politicians to adopting policies of harm reduction. If we can have influence through our contacts with politicians in some of those east European countries, we might be able to make a significant difference in time to stop the further development of mass pandemics in eastern Europe and in Eurasia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para26"><a name="06113081001323">Finally, I turn to the situation in the UK. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley mentioned the statistics. We are still experiencing a growing number of infections, although the Health Protection Agency figures seem to show a bit of levelling off in 2005. I hope that that is a genuine trend and that we will start to see a reduction. All the evidence suggests that a major epidemic in the UK is still possible. Although the figures for infections are relatively small, the number of new sexually transmitted infections is evidence that a lot of people out there are indulging in pretty risky behaviour. There is still the potential for a significant increase in infection in the UK, particularly in marginalised populations where men have sex with men, and especially now in African communities. This is not the Secretary of State&#146;s direct responsibility, but there seems to be a contradiction between what we are doing internationally in talking about universal access to treatments and what we are doing domestically in denying treatments to some people in the UK who are infected. That does not make good sense on public health grounds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="61130-0020.htm_para27"><a name="06113081001324">I am deeply grateful for the leadership on this issue that has been shown by Ministers in our Department for International Development.

He will be greatly missed, but his work will continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para1"><a name="06113081001328">I would be grateful if the Secretary of State dealt with three concerns about moves towards universal access. First, I have researched some figures that seem to indicate that the cost of distribution of anti-retroviral drugs is up to five times higher through the global fund as compared with the distribution through PEPFAR&#151;the President&#146;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. That is connected to the fact that PEPFAR is quite happy to distribute anti-retrovirals directly to non-governmental organisations, whereas the global fund tends to prefer to distribute through host country Governments. That is obviously a great concern and the effectiveness of the global fund will be incredibly important in this battle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para2"><a name="06113081001329">My second concern is the continued lack of availability of paediatric anti-retroviral drugs, which I know that the Secretary of State has looked into. My third concern is how we are going to meet the targets for universal access in conflict and post-conflict zones&#151;in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where there is little or no health infrastructure. I am not sure that we have a strategy for determining whether we can achieve that and, if so, how best to do it. It is a very important consideration. </p>

AIDS in his or her lifetime; when we know that in Zimbabwe female life expectancy is now just 34 years; and when we see that the epidemic is actually growing fastest in eastern Europe and central Asia, with 90 per cent. of cases in Ukraine in Russia, we know how much of a challenge we have on our hands. Those are awful statistics, and behind every single one lies an individual. I join the hon. Member for South-West Surrey in acknowledging the exceptional work of Father Angelo d&#146;Agostino, who he rightly praised. I also acknowledge the efforts of the civil society organisations and foundations that were rightly praised by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para6"><a name="06113081001334">We are making some progress. We and others worked jolly hard to get the commitments last year at Gleneagles, and at the United Nations in June all Governments agreed to work towards achieving universal access to treatment, care and support by 2010. One way of measuring the progress is to acknowledge that there are now 10 times as many people on anti-retroviral treatment in sub-Saharan Africa as there were three years ago. That involves 1 million people. My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow and other colleagues were right to point out that, five years ago, that would have seemed like a dream. I remember that my very first visit to Africa was to Malawi, where people were discussing how they might provide anti-retroviral treatment to just some of the population. It shows what we can do collectively when we put our minds to it. However, in Africa we are reaching only a quarter of those who need treatment, and an even smaller proportion in Asia. So, it is progress, but is it enough? No, it is not: we need to do a lot more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para7"><a name="06113081001335">The other thing that we agreed at the UN in June was that countries should set out plans with ambitious interim targets. Forty-four countries have submitted targets, and 20 have submitted fully costed plans. What those countries need to do is very clear and simple, in one sense. They need to build their health infrastructure, and that involves building clinics, ending user fees, employing doctors and nurses, doing the tests and buying anti-retroviral drugs. Those are all things that hon. Members have mentioned tonight. The countries in question have their own funds, but they need our support alongside that. The UK is pushing hard for donors to get their act together&#151;that is why we worked so hard on the &#147;three ones&#148;&#151;so that the help that we give comes in a form that the countries can make best use of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para8"><a name="06113081001336">The commitments on aid made at Gleneagles were important, as is replenishing the global fund. Hon. Members have generously referred to the funding that we have made available, including the &#163;100 million going to the global fund each year. I will look into the point raised by the hon. Member for South-West Surrey about the cost of distribution under the global fund, because we need to ensure that every single pound that we commit gets to work to make a difference on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para9"><a name="06113081001337">The hon. Member for Ribble Valley was right to highlight the importance of preventing mother-to-child transmission. I am pleased to tell him that a further &#163;25 million of DFID support in Zimbabwe will provide more services to prevent transmission from pregnant women to children. We also support similar efforts in several others countries, including Malawi, Mozambique  <br>

and Zambia. It is also essential, as the hon. Member for South-West Surrey said, that we work in conflict and post-conflict countries, where the Governments are weak. Zimbabwe is one example, and Burma is another, of countries where we work with the UN, non-governmental organisations and faith-based organisations. That helps to build the infrastructure that they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para10"><a name="06113081001338">We also need to take more steps to bring down the price of drugs. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley was absolutely right about microbicides, and that is why we have already invested &#163;50 million in their development. If that comes off, it will be a really significant step forward, not least because it will put some control into women&#146;s hands. Many women have very little control over what happens to their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para11"><a name="06113081001339">I share the concern that has been expressed about medicines for children. That is why, in September, we helped to found UNITAID, the new international drug purchasing facility. That predictable, long-term funding aims to lower drug prices, and to get more people on to treatment. UNITAID&#146;s first board meeting in October agreed $36 million to fund anti-retroviral treatment for up to 100,000 children in 2007 and double that number in 2008, and approved $70 million to expand second-line therapy&#151;where first-line anti-retroviral treatment does not work&#151;to 100,000 patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para12"><a name="06113081001340">I warmly welcome the Clinton Foundation&#146;s announcement at the UNITAID board meeting this morning of cheaper treatments that will reach 100,000 children. Cipla and Rambaxy are reducing the price of their paediatric anti-retrovirals to $60 a year, which represents a 45 per cent. reduction. That is the good news from this morning. We have made a 20-year commitment to UNITAID, as hon. Members are aware. We are also helping countries to use the flexibilities under the TRIPS&#151;trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights&#151;agreement. They are there, but people have to work their way through them to deal with this public health emergency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para13"><a name="06113081001341">The other point that I want to come to is the fact that although treatment is the priority for keeping people alive today, if we are to achieve an AIDS-free generation&#151;that is what every single one of us wants&#151;prevention is the key for tomorrow and the day after. That will not happen unless prevention is directed particularly at those who are most at risk: young people, women and young girls, men who have sex with men, sex workers and injecting drug users.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para14"><a name="06113081001342">We know that women make up almost two thirds of the people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. In some African countries, young women are almost three times more likely to be HIV-infected than men of the same age. Why? It is because of gender discrimination, social restriction, violence, fear of violence and lack of financial security. Women sell themselves for food or money because that is how they keep themselves alive. That makes women much more vulnerable to HIV.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para15"><a name="06113081001343">We know that sex between men accounts for 10 per cent. of global HIV infections, yet UNAIDS reports that fewer than one man in 20 who have sex with men can access the HIV-prevention services that they need. We know that in Ethiopia up to three quarters of female sex workers are infected with HIV, yet some donors debate whether it is right to give them condoms.  <br>

Some donors even place restrictions on working with them. That is not sensible if we want to defeat this epidemic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para16"><a name="06113081001344">Injecting drug use accounts for a third of new infections outside sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in eastern Europe. We know that harm-reduction programmes work&#151;needle and syringe exchanges in particular&#151;but less than 5 per cent. of drug users can access them. We have to put that right and ensure that people are not harassed when they are trying to use those services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para17"><a name="06113081001345">We know that condoms save lives, but they are in short supply. Since 2001, the UK has paid for more than 1 billion condoms. That amounts to the use of about 54,000 every hour, but in Africa there are still only enough to provide eight condoms for each man each year. There are 200 million couples with an unmet need for contraception. That is not good enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para18"><a name="06113081001346">Therefore, improving services is crucial to achieving universal access. Supply is important, but so is demand. That is why tackling stigma and discrimination really is significant. Stigma and discrimination stop people accessing the services that they need and stop them coming forward for counselling, testing and treatment. If, as happens in Ukraine and Russia, police officers patrol needle exchange points and arrest people, surprise, surprise, drug users do not go to use them. Some women will not get tested because they are terrified that if their husband or family finds out, they will be thrown out of the family home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para19"><a name="06113081001347">What we do know is that where there is greater openness and honesty about HIV, progress happens. That is the case for Brazil, Thailand, parts of India and Malawi, but it is not straightforward, because in Lesotho although less than 10 per cent. of women in their late teens are infected, the figure for those in their early 20s rises to 40 per cent. We must keep on the case everywhere. As I said a moment ago, many women and girls do not have control over what happens to them. They need to be able to say, &#147;If we&#146;re going to have sex, you&#146;ve got to use a condom.&#148; Men and boys need to respect women&#146;s decisions and to understand that no means no.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para20"><a name="06113081001348">This is about changing culture and attitudes, and we can do that only if we are honest about the nature of the disease and what the problem is. Also, we must be honest about what works and in giving people the information and services that they need to protect themselves. Not all societies and not everybody finds it easy to do that, because some people feel very embarrassed and we are not always good at talking about sex. However, that is as nothing compared with the shame that we should feel about the huge daily death toll. The truth is, as our experience teaches us, that we can do something about it, and we have to do something about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="61130-0021.htm_para21"><a name="06113081001349">I am really grateful to the hon. Member for Ribble Valley for giving us the chance to debate the progress that we have made and what we have yet to do. Now is a good time to show that we are serious about doing something on this issue.</p>
