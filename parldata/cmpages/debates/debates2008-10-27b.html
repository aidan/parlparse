 Although we are largely compliant with the convention, some changes to legislation and procedures were required before ratification and, following a cross-government effort, the necessary legislation is now in place.

 Given that only 10 of the 27 European Union countries have ratified the convention, when the Home Secretary ratifies it for us later this year, will she ensure that her approach is compassionate, thoughtful and caring towards the victims of trafficking? They have endured terrible problems and suffered tremendous trauma, and they need help in the form of psychological assistance, accommodation and a thoughtful country that understands the plight that they have been through. Many of them feel that this country wants to throw them out as quickly as it possibly can.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has done some fine work in raising this issue, and he rightly says that victims must be at the centre of our response, as is the case in our action plan. That is why we have announced the 45-day reflection period and the one-year temporary residence permit for victims&#151;both measures exceed the minimum standard outlined in the convention. It is precisely why an important role of Pentameter 2&#151;the enforcement programme&#151;is to identify the best process for dealing with victims, and it is also why we have made additional support available to those who work with victims.</p>

 When my right hon. Friend considers the steps necessary to implement the convention, will she consider action against child trafficking? Will she reflect on the fact that, in many instances, children who are trafficked into this country disappear from social services&#146; care within 48 hours?

That is why we welcomed the additional support of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which, with our support and that of Comic Relief, is running a 24-hour advice line for practitioners. It is also why, last year, we published multi-agency guidance to all front-line staff on how trafficked children can be identified and safeguarded, and why we need to build on the work of the &#147;Young Runaways Action Plan&#148; published on 16 June.

 My hon. Friend raises an important point. One of the reasons for setting up and funding the UK Human Trafficking Centre, which has already run some important publicity campaigns and provided fundamental support to police and others for whom this should be mainstream business, was to examine how we can help victims to be confident about coming forward and to recognise that when they do so, they will receive support from the police and others, not only for themselves, but in order to identify and bring to justice the perpetrators.</p>

 My hon. Friend the immigration Minister has completely reinforced the view that I expressed last week in the debate on immigration, which was called in Opposition time but to which the shadow Home Secretary did not feel it appropriate to contribute. I have made it completely clear that assumptions about population levels increasing to 70 million fail to take account of the points-based system that we are introducing. As my hon. Friend has identified again today, had that system been in place last year, it would have resulted in lower numbers of people coming through those routes into this country.

 I am sorry: I do not often have to correct my right hon. Friend, but I have to correct something that he has just said, which was that the change in the counting rules, which had been agreed alongside police officers and independent statisticians, meant that the levels of violent crime had been misreported. That is wrong. The levels of violent crime have not been misreported. In fact, the reduction in violent crime of 7 per cent. that we saw reported last Thursday is reliable and can be depended on. We were clear that we needed to ensure that, within the category of violent crime, everything that should be counted as most serious violence was so counted. That is why we, alongside the police, reviewed the counting rules and why some of the changes announced last week were made.

 The Police Federation and I have discussed the issue and it has recognised that changes in the licensing legislation have not, in most cases, led to much longer opening hours and that there has been an overall reduction in violent crime against individuals during the evenings. The Police Federation will continue to work with us on the work that I mentioned earlier, which is intended to make sure that we clamp down particularly on irresponsible promotions in areas where the link to crime and disorder is most obvious.</p>

 I think that it is right to say that the vast majority of young people&#151;over 18, of course&#151;drink alcohol responsibly, but there is a minority for whom the way in which alcohol is promoted and their lack of understanding of its impact have had a detrimental effect. That is why we, as a Government, have worked hard through the &#147;Know your Limits&#148; advertising campaign and through the work of my colleagues in the Department of Health to bring home to people the potential danger that irresponsible drinking can cause. People need to behave responsibly both for their own health and on account of the impact of their behaviour on the wider community, and we will continue to make that case.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. May I take you back to the start of the Session, when you correctly reminded Members about their obligations in relation to the new parliamentary boundaries? You told us:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="81027-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0810274000162">I seek your advice. The neighbouring Labour MP, the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush (Mr. Slaughter), has written to the Department for Communities and Local Government seeking the calling in of a planning application in my constituency. I was not informed of that involvement in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="81027-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0810274000163">Further, may I ask you whether it was proper for a Minister to write to that Member about the planning application&#151;indeed, announcing that it was to be called in? That seems to me to be entirely contrary to the advice that you gave the House at the start of the Session.</p>

 We all have to obey the conventions of the House and we have to remember that, while this is a parliamentary boundary proposal, it is up to the electorate as to whether we are returned as Members of Parliament after the general election.

Member could ask about a matter that is outwith his or her constituency. That could happen. The question could be about a hospital. In my own case, there might be a hospital in the city of Glasgow that is outwith my constituency, but I could ask a question about facilities, although health is a devolved matter.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for welcoming me and the amendments; I am sure that if we had not introduced them we would have been accused of not listening and of failing to take due account of the deep discussions in Committee, which I have read about and spoken about with the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), who took the Bill through Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="81027-0006.htm_para43"><a name="0810274000308">We appreciate that there are many amendments in this group, but they can conveniently be discussed under four separate headings: first, the Government&#146;s proposal to replace quality contracts scheme approval boards in England so as to place the decision making squarely in the hands of local authorities; secondly, proposals to strengthen further the employment protections already contained in the Bill for bus company workers; thirdly, provisions to enable local authorities to operate bus services as the operator of last resort in certain very limited circumstances; and fourthly, some technical amendments to clause 44, which enables additional non-quality contract bus services to be registered within a quality contracts scheme area in certain specific circumstances. It might be helpful if I take the time to go through the amendments that stem from those four areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="81027-0006.htm_para44"><a name="0810274000309">There was healthy debate in Committee about the Bill&#146;s provisions for proposed quality contracts schemes in England to be approved by independent approval boards rather than the Secretary of State. Several hon. Friends, as well as the hon. Members for Lewes (Norman Baker) and for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech), raised questions about the proposed new approval process, and the Government agreed to consider them further. Members will be aware that we are very much in favour of devolution to local authorities; indeed, much of the Bill is aimed at achieving precisely that. However, it is also important to recognise that quality contracts schemes could have substantial impact on bus operators&#151;particularly smaller operators&#151;in an area and the drivers, maintenance staff and others whom they employ. The Government have consistently made it clear that we see a crucial role for independent scrutiny of local authority proposals for quality contracts schemes, and I stand by that commitment that we clearly outlined in Committee. At the same time, the Government have carefully listened to Members and local authorities who have argued with some passion that the final decision about quality contracts schemes should be placed squarely in the hands of locally elected members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="81027-0006.htm_para45"><a name="0810274000310">In the light of those arguments, the Government have tabled new clauses 13 to 19 and amendments Nos. 163 to 265. The amendments would ensure that local authorities took the final decision on whether a quality contracts scheme should be made in their area, but they would also preserve an important role for independent scrutiny to ensure that the legitimate interests of bus operators remain protected. First and foremost, the amendments would replace the proposed approvals boards for England with quality contracts scheme boards, which are called QCS boards in the amendments. Instead of making the final decision as to whether a scheme should go ahead, the role of a QCS board would be to provide an opinion and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to  <br>

the local authority. The scrutiny would take place at the end of the consultation process, so that the QCS board could form its opinion in light of the comments made by consultees, but it would be for the local authority to take the final decision having considered the QCS board&#146;s opinion and recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="81027-0006.htm_para46"><a name="0810274000311">I have taken careful note of the points raised in Committee about the remit of those boards, and the amendments now spell out much more clearly their precise role. There are two aspects to that role. First, the boards are to consider whether the local authority has satisfied the statutory requirements to give notice of their proposed scheme and to consult on it. Secondly, they are to consider whether the proposed scheme meets the public interest criteria set out in the Bill. Those criteria are whether it is likely to benefit passengers, increase patronage and contribute to the authority&#146;s local transport policies in an economic, efficient and effective way, and whether any adverse effects of the scheme on operators are proportionate to the benefits that will result from it. That makes it clear that the QCS boards will be focused on considering the proposed scheme. They will not be delivering opinions or recommendations on wider matters such as the authority&#146;s local transport policies, which are rightly a matter for the authority itself in consultation with the electorate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="81027-0006.htm_para47"><a name="0810274000312">My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central, set out clearly in Committee why it is important for the Transport Tribunal to have a role in the QCS process. In particular, the intention is to provide a quicker, more accessible and less costly alternative to judicial review. The role of the Transport Tribunal is equally important under the Government&#146;s latest proposals, but at the same time we have listened carefully to the point made by Labour Members that we need to avoid needlessly creating a two-stage process for local authorities.</p>

 On the Transport Tribunal, my hon. Friend will be aware that the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 makes provision for two tiers of tribunal, the lower and the upper. On the face of things that may be fine, but under the Bill the first appeal would be to the integrated transport authority itself. Surely we will not then have two further tiers of appeal, as that would be over-bureaucratic. Will he clear that matter up?</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that comment. He is absolutely right that under the 2007 Act, sectoral tribunals will be done away with in favour of the new first-tier and upper tribunals. Decisions on interim arrangements and which levels will be used are still being consulted on, but we are keen to ensure that processes are not drawn out by any individuals or groups. The Bill contains provisions on that point, which we are keen to recognise. I add that if a QCS board states its opinion that the five public interest criteria are met and that the authority meets the statutory consultation obligations, the right of appeal to the tribunal will be limited to points of law.</p>

 The proposing transport authority will need to do a cost-benefit analysis using the five public interest criteria laid out clearly in clause 19, including the benefits for passengers and whether they are delivered in an economic way. It will have to follow all five of those criteria. That will have to be set against any disadvantages for operators, and the effect of delivering the revised and new contracts schemes must be proportionate. We would expect traffic commissioners to use other schemes within industries as a benchmark against which to judge if needs be, but in the first instance the authority will need to do a cost-benefit analysis using those five criteria.</p>

 I note my hon. Friend&#146;s comments a moment ago about the Transport Tribunal. May I push him a little further on that point? Will he commit to discussions with the Ministry of Justice to ensure that when the new tribunal framework to replace the Transport Tribunal is finally in place, it is no more onerous for local authorities than the current arrangements? That is a very important point.</p>

 I assure my hon. Friend and the House that we are consulting our colleagues at the Ministry of Justice on how the appeals should be handled. Hon. Members will be aware that the provisions are that if the QCS board gives the scheme a clean bill of health on meeting the requirements, an appeal can be made only on points of law. If a clean bill of health had not been given, there would a wider opportunity for an appeal to be taken, and that would happen through the different tiers. It is possible that appeals on points of law would be taken by the upper tribunal and other appeals would be taken through the first tier, but that is open to a discussion, which we will take forward. I hope that clarifies matters on the tribunals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="81027-0006.htm_para48"><a name="0810274000319">A number of existing features of the Bill would remain unchanged. For example, a QCS board would still be chaired by a traffic commissioner, who would sit alongside two people from a panel of independent experts to be appointed by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State would still have the power to specify in regulations a target time limit for the QCS board to complete its deliberations. In contrast to what is proposed in amendments tabled by my hon. Friends and by the Liberal Democrats, the Government are not proposing any significant changes to the arrangements in Wales. As applies now, schemes in Wales would be considered by the Welsh Ministers, which is fully in line with the preferences expressed by Welsh Assembly Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="81027-0006.htm_para49"><a name="0810274000320">Some other refinements to the Bill&#146;s QCS provisions are proposed. For example, the amendments would give the local authority the option&#151;I should emphasise that it is an option, rather than an obligation&#151;to begin the process of tendering for quality contracts while an appeal to the tribunal is in progress. Previously, the Bill would have prevented that, but it should help to speed up the overall process of implementing quality contracts schemes, helping to address another concern expressed by hon. Members in Committee and on the Floor of the House.</p>

Will he assure us that, as part of those deliberations, there will be no requirement to go back to any of the operators to seek their views on the board&#146;s comments, and that if there is a discussion between the board and the transport authority, there will be no obligation to involve the operators in it?</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for his comments in welcoming me to my post. How long the process takes will depend, in part, on the nature of the scheme. Obviously, a city-wide scheme will take longer than a localised scheme because of the advance work needed build up to having a scheme to work with, regardless of any provisions in the Bill; the time needs to be taken for that to be done.</p>

 I was trying to tease an answer out of my hon. Friend on a second question. Is it the case that once the transport authority has consulted and set out a scheme, the board will look at it?

 The role of the QCS boards is clearly laid out. They judge whether due process has been followed and whether a scheme meets the five public interest criteria.

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="81027-0007.htm_para2"><a name="0810274000329">Government amendments Nos. 124 to 128 deal with TUPE and pensions issues. There was a good debate in Committee about the ways in which a quality contracts scheme could affect bus workers in the area concerned. I agree wholeheartedly with those who argued in Committee that we need to ensure that appropriate protections are put in place to safeguard bus workers&#146; interests. That is why the Government tabled amendments in the other place, so that the protections afforded by the TUPE regulations would apply where employees transfer to a new employer on the coming into force of a quality contract. Those amendments were a considerable advance on the Transport Act 2000 as it was originally enacted, which contained no provisions about TUPE. Nevertheless, we listened with great care to the points raised in Committee by several hon. Members, and especially by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer). In light of that debate, I am pleased to be speaking to Government amendments Nos. 124 to 128 today. These amendments will further enhance the protections that the Bill already provides.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="81027-0007.htm_para3"><a name="0810274000330">Government amendment No. 124 describes an additional situation that is to be treated as a &#147;relevant transfer&#148; for the purposes of the TUPE regulations&#151;that is to say, an additional situation where the protections of TUPE will apply. When a local authority has awarded a quality contract to somebody other than the incumbent operator, there is a risk that the incumbent might decide to withdraw from the local bus market before the contract comes into force. That could lead to a short-term gap in bus service provision, which the local authority may well decide to fill by means of a subsidised service agreement with another operator. The amendment provides for such a situation to be treated as a &#147;relevant transfer&#148; for the purposes of the TUPE regulations, so that the incumbent operator&#146;s workers can benefit from the same protection as the Bill already provides in relation to services that transfer straight to the quality contract operator. Government amendments Nos. 125 and 126 are consequential on Government amendment No. 124.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="81027-0007.htm_para5"><a name="0810274000334">Government amendment No. 127 is a technical amendment, intended to provide certainty that the pension protections afforded by sections 257 and 258 of the Pensions Act 2004 will apply when there is a TUPE transfer in connection with a quality contracts scheme in exactly the same way as those protections apply to a normal TUPE transfer. Those sections of the Pensions Act set out the minimum level of pension provision that must be made available to a person who is subject to a TUPE transfer and who had pension rights before that transfer.</p>

It provides a power to make regulations to specify pension protection requirements over and above that afforded by the Pensions Act.

Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central promised to consider the matter further in the light of the debate. The Government have now done so, and I am pleased to have moved new clause 9.</p>

There is not an enormous difference between the two sets of amendments, so I shall describe those tabled by the Government. They consist of a new clause whose effect would be to empower a local transport authority to operate interim services, and two minor consequential amendments. The proposed new power would allow a local transport authority to provide services as an operator of last resort in a quality contracts scheme area. That would be  <br>

possible only when a quality contracts operator ceased to provide the contracted services before the quality contract was due to expire. The power could be exercised by the local authority only for a time-limited period. In one respect, the power goes further than amendments Nos. 98 to 100, tabled by my hon. Friends, as it would apply to any local transport authority in England or Wales that has made and brought into force a quality contracts scheme, whereas their amendments would apply only to areas with passenger transport executives. It is nevertheless a modest and limited power; it applies in only a very specific set of circumstances, and it certainly would not give local authorities a general power to run bus services.</p>

 I entirely understand where my hon. Friend is coming from, and new clause 9 is very welcome. He says that the power will be time-limited. What will happen if the time runs out, but a new operator has not been found?</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. The power is time-limited; the proposal is that the time should be limited to nine months, with the option of having a further three months thereafter. It is, in our opinion, highly unlikely that a transport operator would not be found, because if things got to that stage, I suspect that the proposed scheme would not have met other criteria. Our genuine belief is that it is highly unlikely that we would end up in the situation that he describes.</p>

 The Liberal Democrats welcome the new clause as a sensible step in the right direction. My only question is about the difference between the nine-month period and the 12-month period to which the Minister referred. The last three months are subject to approval by the traffic commissioner. Is the Minister planning to publish guidelines on the circumstances in which the traffic commissioner would be empowered or encouraged to give that three-month extension? As the times&#151;nine and 12 months&#151;are quite limited, presumably any discussion with the traffic commissioner would have to begin some time before the nine-month limit was up.</p>

 Obviously, in the situation that we are describing, the traffic commissioner would watch things closely in the interim period in which a local authority was acting as an operator of last resort. As I have indicated, we are consulting on how provisions in the Bill will operate, and that is another way in which consideration will be given to the matter. Now that my hon. Friends have heard what I have said about the new clause&#151;in particular, now that they know that it would apply not just to PTEs but to local transport authorities elsewhere in England and Wales&#151;I hope that they will be persuaded not to press amendments Nos. 98 to 100.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="81027-0007.htm_para11"><a name="0810274000346">Finally, I turn to Government amendments Nos. 123 and 129 to 138. Clause 44 will, in certain circumstances, enable local bus services to be registered in an area covered by a quality contracts scheme. The amendments are essentially technical amendments to improve the clause. They look rather complicated&#151;they certainly did to me&#151;but the intention is fairly straightforward; it  <br>

is to set up a procedure for varying bus registrations when, exceptionally, they apply within the area of a quality contracts scheme. The general rule is that bus operators cannot register services in the area of a quality contracts scheme, but clause 44 provides a procedure for them to do so if the authority that made the scheme is satisfied that the proposed service would not be detrimental to the scheme. A service that has been registered under those new provisions may subsequently be varied or cancelled. Clause 44 makes no provision for that, so the normal process for varying registrations under section 6 of the Transport Act 1985 would apply. Under the Bill as it stands, that means that it would be possible for an operator to register a service that the local transport authority is happy to accept, but then to vary it in a way that the authority would not be happy with.</p>

The purpose of this group of amendments is to rectify that. Some variations to the registrations&#151;probably most of them&#151;would be perfectly acceptable to the authority that approved the service in the first place, but others could totally change the nature of the service in ways that the authority could not have anticipated and which would have an adverse effect on services within the scheme. It is only right that the authority should have an opportunity to comment before the traffic commissioner accepts the variations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="81027-0007.htm_para13"><a name="0810274000348">The Government have considered whether a similar procedure for cancelling registrations is also needed, but have concluded that it is not. As the local transport authority did not make provision for these services in its quality contracts scheme, it would presumably not be detrimental to the scheme if they were withdrawn. If the authority thought subsequently that the services were valuable, it would have the option to vary the scheme so as to include them. The amendments therefore deal only with service variations.</p>

nonsense. Finally, the Government&#146;s management of this part of the Bill has been discourteous to the House. We finished consideration of the Bill in Committee on 8 May. The Government chose to wait until 17 October to produce the bulk of their amendments. Last Thursday, the very last business day before Report, they produced another three amendments and another new clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="81027-0007.htm_para17"><a name="0810274000353">There is a real possibility that bus operators, particularly small operators, may go out of business in the current climate. We are already seeing operators struggle as a result of the iniquitous distribution of funds for the concessionary fares scheme. The underfunding of the national scheme is threatening the scheme and already driving bus services off the road. My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill) and I were both contacted last week by Mr. Peter Shipp, the chairman and chief executive of the East Yorkshire Motor Services Group, who described the difficulties facing his firm. He spoke of &#147;disastrous consequences&#148; and a</p>

The clause provides for that and for the scenario where an operator gets into trouble because it is tied into a quality contract and can no longer fulfil its obligations. If an operator goes out of business, it is clear that those who use its services need to be protected. It is therefore right that local authorities should be able to step in as operators of last resort, but only for a limited period. Provided that it is for the limited period that is the premise of the Bill, I understand the necessity for it and will support it. However, I am concerned that people may use it as an excuse to return bus services for a prolonged period to be run by local authorities, thus depriving the sector of the private sector funds and innovation it needs if it is to flourish.</p>

Normal services should be resumed as quickly as possible in the event of an operator going out of business, and my new amendments (a), (b), (c) and (d) would place an obligation on the local authority to invite tender for the provision of replacement services no later than a month after the termination of the original service. Amendment (b) is of particular significance because it would firmly place an obligation back on the local authorities to ensure that they did not take their time, that services continued and that the tender was put out. That strikes me as reasonable and generous.</p>

My amendments (g), (h), (i) and (j) would ensure that once arrangements had been made for a replacement service to begin, the authority would cease to be the operator within six months. That is a sensible and generous period; after all, the Minister has just reassured us that he does not expect anyone not to wish to be involved in the tendering process.</p>

As we have seen in a number of cases, partnerships have brought innovation and good and efficient services, and they are proven to work. When an operator has failed, for whatever reason, to fulfil its obligations under a quality contract, surely it is irresponsible and short-sighted to replace that quality contract with another. That method has been tried and it has failed. If something is broken, why would we replace it using the same broken method? That would be illogical. I suggest that we at least provide the option of it being replaced with something that works. There should be an option to replace a failed quality contract with a voluntary or statutory quality partnership.</p>

If an authority says to a board, &#147;Our scheme will increase patronage by 5 per cent.&#148;, how will the quality contracts scrutiny board determine whether that is a valid prediction? Will it have to conduct as thorough a consultation as the authority, or does the Minister claim that due process does not involve consultation? In what circumstances does he believe that the outcome of an application for a quality contracts scheme will be different under the new arrangements from that under the previous arrangements, or, indeed, from that under the arrangements that the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) proposes in his amendments? Is it not true that the same unelected people who would have sat on the approvals board will now sit on the tribunal? Is it not therefore unlikely that they will reach a different decision?</p>

I fear that the new arrangements that the Minister is attempting to introduce today will make a possibility a probability. The new clauses are so important and so potentially detrimental to bus services that I will, with your permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, test the will of the House at the appropriate time, especially with regard to new clause 13.</p>

consultation&#151;for example, replies to any responses that it received. Those changes are essential if the board is to take a complete and fair view of the consultation that has been carried out. After all, that is one of the board&#146;s main roles. I hope that the Minister accepts that the amendment is fair and uncontroversial. It would not place a significant burden on local authorities and would greatly help the QCS board to reach a fair decision about the consultation. I cannot foresee any reason for the Minister refusing to accept the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="81027-0008.htm_para16"><a name="0810274000386">Amendments (b) and (c) would slightly extend the QCS board&#146;s mandate. If a board decided that the local authority that proposed a quality contract had not fulfilled its public interest criteria, it should be able to recommend that the authority consider scrapping the scheme. If the board decided that the local authority that proposed a quality contract had not fulfilled the Bill&#146;s the requirement to consult, it should be able to recommend remedial action to ensure compliance. These amendments would preserve the advisory function of the board while allowing local authorities to benefit from the expertise of those who serve on the scrutiny board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="81027-0008.htm_para17"><a name="0810274000387">I deal now with the amendments to new clause 15. There are two overriding reasons for my opposition to quality contracts schemes. First, the innovation of private sector investment working in partnership with local authorities throughout the country has meant that bus services improved in quality and quantity. I am worried that quality contracts will reverse that process, and that the travelling public will suffer. Let us remind ourselves that private investment in the bus services slowed the decline in patronage.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman seems to be lauding the success of deregulation and privatisation, but patronage in passenger transport authority areas has halved since bus deregulation. Although there has been a slight increase of 9.5 per cent. over the past 10 years, most of that is down to increases in patronage in London. The situation outside London is no better&#151;in fact, it is a lot worse&#151;than it was in 1985.</p>

 Yes, but there are two points about that. One is that patronage in county council areas has increased. More importantly, 86 per cent. of the decline in bus patronage since 1950, which is when bus patronage started, happened while buses were still regulated, not in the period of deregulation.</p>

partnership scheme throughout Committee and on Second Reading. As the hon. Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell) knows, the issue in London is a devolved matter and not something over which we have competence. However, my constituents in Wimbledon would say that the huge increases in the precept that the previous Mayor exacted from them were the reason why there might be more buses on the road, not regulation. There is no clear evidence that regulation has brought better bus services anywhere.</p>

<p><a name="st_o167"><a name="0810274000394"><a name="81027-0008.htm_spnew18"><a name="0810274000693"><b>David Howarth (Cambridge) (LD):</b>
 What has happened in Cambridge is often cited as an example of the success of partnerships. Nevertheless, the increase in bus patronage in Cambridge had rather more to do with the geography of an historic town, which allowed the county council more scope in restricting car traffic, and with the city council, unusually for a district council, offering a subsidy for buses. People in Cambridge would not reject the option of a quality contract, as the hon. Gentleman seems to be doing, which would have the additional benefit of allowing them to control fares. If a bus company has a local monopoly, the way it makes money is by restricting services and increasing fares.</p>

 I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is looking forward to explaining to his constituents why a quality contract is necessary when all the benefits could be derived under a statutory quality partnership.</p>

 The point is that local authorities would benefit from having the option of moving to a quality contract if the current improvements continued, especially if fares continued to be high and if the volume of services was restricted. Having the option is fantastically beneficial, even if local authorities do not use it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o170"><a name="0810274000397"><a name="81027-0008.htm_spnew21"><a name="0810274000696"><b>Stephen Hammond:</b>
 But the hon. Gentleman has just given the lie to that argument. Everything that local authorities wished to achieve under a quality contract could be achieved under either a voluntary partnership or a statutory quality partnership. That is the key point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="81027-0008.htm_para18"><a name="0810274000398">The other reason I am concerned about quality contracts is that there is a chance that operators will challenge them in the courts. Quality contracts have damaging implications, the first of which is financial. In this day and age, the last thing that local authorities want is heavy legal costs. Quality contracts also have the potential to damage the relationship between the local authority and the bus operator. It is essential that that relationship should be good if good services are to be provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="81027-0008.htm_para19"><a name="0810274000399">Proposed new section 127A(2) of the Transport Act 2000 says that anyone who was or should have been consulted by a local authority wishing to make a quality contract scheme has the right of appeal to the Transport Tribunal. Under normal circumstances, that could be done on either a point of law or a question of fact. However, new clause 15 says that if the QCS board has decided that a local authority has followed due process, the appellant loses that right.</p>

Every quality contracts proposal, and every quality contracts extension, should go through the approvals process. I do not believe that we should be able simply to extend a quality contract without it being subject to the procedures and processes of the expert and independent scrutiny board that has supposedly been set up for that very purpose.

However, I ask the Minister to consider seriously whether, having put in place an independent scrutiny process, he thinks it is right that a local authority should be able to extend the schemes without those processes and procedures being undertaken.

said that I oppose quality contracts, but if they are to be placed on the statute book, even for a limited period, they must be introduced only when the benefits of voluntary partnerships and statutory quality partnerships have been exhausted. The places where bus services have improved the most are those where there are strong partnership arrangements between the local authority and operators.

There may be more public subsidy or less, but the public transport systems in all those cities are better than the deregulated system that we have in this country.</p>

 Is there not another fatal flaw in the argument of the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond)? He talks of the benefits of competition, but we know&#151;especially those of us whose constituencies are in passenger transport authority areas&#151;that such competition simply does not exist. We have de facto monopolies: evidence of that is seen every time a tender is made for a subsidised service. Usually there is only one tender, in some cases there may even be none, and, despite increasing levels of public subsidy for private operators, we are seeing no commensurate increase in services.</p>

 Precisely. My hon. Friend has exposed the aim of the Conservative party, which is to defend the vested interests of private bus companies rather than those of the travelling public outside London. Since deregulation, bus fares in passenger transport executive areas have doubled in real terms and patronage has halved. The profits&#151;the bottom lines&#151;of the bus  <br>

companies are two or three times as great as before. Companies are making the same profits outside London as they are in London, where there is a better public service. Not for the first time in the Conservative party&#146;s history, it is on the side of vested interests and against those of public transport and the travelling public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="81027-0009.htm_para24"><a name="0810274000430">The hon. Member for Wimbledon is not just trying to fight the evidence from an ideological position. As may become clear when we discuss later amendments, he is also fighting against local democracy and local decision making. He recalled the arguments advanced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central in Committee about the need to protect the process of moving from judicial review to quality contracts. The arguments were advanced for perfectly good reasons. The bus companies that are making two or three times as much profit since deregulation are going to fight like ferrets in a sack to prevent the introduction of quality contracts. It is not a question of partnership in most of the passenger transport executives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="81027-0009.htm_para25"><a name="0810274000431">There is, however, a major principle in opposition to the pragmatic facts that my right hon. Friend had to consider. Labour Members believe that matters that can be determined locally should be determined locally, by locally elected people. The hon. Member for Wimbledon would clearly prefer such matters to be determined by appointed people such as traffic commissioners, if that is possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="81027-0009.htm_para26"><a name="0810274000432">I believe that my new clauses 7 and 8, and the Government&#146;s new clauses 13 and 19, solve the practical difficulty posed by the need to respect the wishes of locally elected people by proposing the establishment of a super-consultative body, the quality contracts scheme board, which must be consulted by means of a special process. It will be able to judge whether the public-interest criteria have been met, and, if there is agreement, the position for which we argued in Committee will be achieved. Bus operators will be able to appeal only on matters of process and procedure, which is as it should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="81027-0009.htm_para27"><a name="0810274000433">I have one worry, and I would like my hon. Friend the Minister to comment on it. There is some ambiguity to the way in which the QCS board can view public interest, and one can go into all sorts of detail about whether a proposal is viable or is meeting the better public transport criteria&#151;these are difficult issues. I have been either associated with or a part of local government for most of my adult life and I am a great supporter of local democracy, but I acknowledge that&#151;very occasionally&#151;local government introduce crazy schemes. I hope that there will be some guidance on this measure, even if only in response to my hon. Friend saying that it is intended to weed out any extraordinarily badly conceived or wacky scheme that local authorities might propose by making it possible to say to them, &#147;This simply isn&#146;t going to work, chums, and you should go back to the drawing board&#148;, and that the intention is not to go into intricate details such as, for example, the percentage differences in the cost-benefit analyses of one route as opposed to another. This is an order of magnitude issue, and I would like some reassurance from my hon. Friend on it. I do not intend to press my amendments to a Division, however, and I shall support the Government new clauses.</p>

operator moving out and another operator coming in. I understand that a defining time for when a quality contract comes into operation appears in the Bill, but does not appear in the amendments. I would like my hon. Friend the Minister to say whether there is any significance in that, whether it is a difference without meaning, and whether it might be better if we were to use the same clear definition throughout the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="81027-0009.htm_para29"><a name="0810274000435">On the operator of last resort and amendments Nos. 98 to 100 and Government new clause 9, as we argued in Committee, an operator of last resort is necessary; otherwise, large areas of the country and considerable proportions of the population could be left without any public transport. I do not share my Government&#146;s worry that such operators might try to re-municipalise bus services&#151;I would welcome it if they did. However, leaving aside that possible back door to municipalisation, there is the possibility of a gap lasting longer than nine months plus three months on appeal. This is a particularly testing issue and bus operators might make a challenge on human rights or procedural grounds, leaving an area without services for longer than that period. My hon. Friend the Minister rightly proposes to allow quality contracts to start during this process. Where an integrated transport authority or a transport authority is searching for new operators because the operator has pulled out of an area, I do not think the market will be attracted to the area for what might be only a very short period. If there is a dispute in the courts, I can foresee times the process taking longer than 12 months. Will my hon. Friend reconsider that? The first nine months, to be used under normal circumstances, may well cover virtually all situations, but if a fight was going on, a three-month extension with all the safeguards that he has included may well not be long enough. Again, however, I shall not press my amendments on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="81027-0009.htm_para30"><a name="0810274000436">Finally, a matter that is not currently dealt with in the Bill, but may well be later in secondary legislation, is the deregistration period. The short period of deregistration is one issue that has destabilised public transport in many areas, and I would welcome a clear statement from my hon. Friend of whether the deregistration period will be increased, and to what. I hope that it will be doubled compared with the previous period.</p>

 I welcome the Minister to his new role. I am not sure whether he or his predecessor is responsible for the amendments that the Government have tabled, but either way they are sensible and take the Bill forward productively, and I thank Ministers for listening. The hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) is a very affable chap, but the idea that Ministers should not listen during debates, and that if they do they should disregard what is being said no matter its validity, seems a rather curious proposition. If the Government had accepted amendments tabled by the Conservatives in Committee, heaven forbid, I wonder whether the same argument would have been forthcoming. I suspect not.</p>

the termination of the Committee stage. There may well have been detailed discussions going on that were so complicated that no earlier date was possible, or it might be the Machiavellian reason that the Government wanted to give bus operators little notice of the amendments. Be that as it may, we have had to absorb a number of amendments in very little time. However, that is a small point if the amendments are broadly right, which I think they are. No doubt if I read the small print afterwards I might find something slightly wrong with them, but that seems to be the case at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="81027-0010.htm_para1"><a name="0810274000440">I wish first to pick up on the issue of quality contracts, which are at the heart of the Bill in many regards. In my view they are certainly the most important proposal in it. I think that the hon. Member for Wimbledon might agree about that even though he objects to them somewhat, because he recognises the importance of the proposal. Many of us are concerned that although the original arrangements in the Transport Act 2000 went in the right direction, they did not work in encouraging local authorities to bring forward quality contracts. I made that point in Committee, as did Labour Members. Above all, we did not want a repetition of the Government bringing forward powers that no local authorities actually wanted to take up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="81027-0010.htm_para2"><a name="0810274000441">I felt, and I think other members of the Committee agreed, that the hurdles that were in place&#151;the quality contracts boards, the Transport Tribunal and the possibility of judicial review&#151;were one hurdle too many for local authorities that wanted to go down this road. Therefore, the move towards the arrangements that the Minister has set out today was right. He neglected to mention that the proposal introduced today to make the quality contracts board a consultee was one that I made in Committee&#151;I am sure that was an oversight on his part, so I put it on the record for his benefit&#151;and it is an eminently workable solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="81027-0010.htm_para3"><a name="0810274000442">For the benefit of the hon. Member for Wimbledon, I should make the comparison with a planning authority that is receiving a planning application in respect of a flood area, because the quality contracts arrangements in the Bill are similar. Such an authority would have to consult the Environment Agency, which may recommend refusal or approval. The local authority still has the right to approve, against the recommendations of the Environment Agency, but it would have to make its decision stand up if an appeal was made to the Government inspector&#151;the Transport Tribunal is the equivalent in this case. The arrangements in the Bill have a direct parallel with those in respect of planning in flood areas&#151;those arrangements work, as will the ones being placed in the Bill today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="81027-0010.htm_para4"><a name="0810274000443">I am also pleased that the Minister has sought to define more closely the role that the, now advisory, body may have in picking up points of law, being satisfied that statutory requirements have been met and analysing the closely defined public-interest criteria. A concern was expressed in Committee that the quality contracts board, as it then was, was far reaching and might have adopted powers outwith its responsibility&#151;or outwith that for which we thought it should be responsible&#151;even though that was not closely defined. In particular, it might have had a view on the democratic decisions that a local council or transport authority had  <br>

reached on its local transport plan. To be fair, the Minister has tied that matter down. I, for one, no longer have a concern about it, because the Bill has been improved significantly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="81027-0010.htm_para5"><a name="0810274000444">Improvements have been made to the quality contracts process, and I hope that local authorities will have the confidence to take the quality contracts route in a way that they would not have done had the amendments not been introduced. That is a significant step forward, because over the past 20 years the cost of travelling by bus has increased significantly, particularly outside London; the increase has been far higher than inflation. Even in the past 10 years, the cost of travelling by bus has increased by 13 per cent. above inflation, whereas the cost of motoring has reduced&#151;we must remember that. In addition, bus usage has decreased, except in London and in one or two other isolated examples; services have dropped off, particularly in some rural areas, where it is almost impossible to get a bus unless it is 3 pm on a Tuesday, and then one is given only half an hour to go to the bank and come back again, if one is lucky; and bus company profits have rocketed. If those four factors are put together, they do not add up to a success story for public transport or for public administration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="81027-0010.htm_para6"><a name="0810274000445">Something has to be done to correct that situation, and I believe that the quality contract route is one such way forward. It provides the opportunity for local authorities to have responsibility for transport in their areas&#151;why should they not have that responsibility? The hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) is right about that, because local authorities are elected, they have their own mandate and they should be responsible for transport. Equally, there needs to be an external check to ensure that statutory requirements are being followed, and that is provided by the mechanism being put in the Bill now. We must also bear in mind the possible effect on small bus operators, who could be disadvantaged. I think that the balance will now be right in the Bill, so I have nothing but approval for the amendments that the Government have tabled in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="81027-0010.htm_para7"><a name="0810274000446">It is also right that tendering should be allowed to begin while appeals are under way. Local authorities will take their chances on that. If they wish to take a chance and incur some expenditure with the possibility that they might lose in the end, that is their problem. They should have the right to take that course of action if they believe it is the correct one. I suspect that, on most occasions, authorities will weigh up the matter carefully and all they will do is to ensure, in line with their intention, that a hiatus is not created. That will be the right course of action, but if they want to take a risk, that is up to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="81027-0010.htm_para8"><a name="0810274000447">The same point applies in respect of judicial review, which has been mentioned. A successful judicial review is no more likely as a consequence of these amendments. Judicial review may be more likely, but it is unlikely to be successful. However, that is a matter for local authorities to judge in the circumstances, as democratically elected bodies. It is a local responsibility, so they should make that judgment. If they get it wrong, they should be held to account for that, but it is not for us to second-guess them, or to impose unelected bodies to regulate what is properly a local function.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="81027-0010.htm_para9"><a name="0810274000448">The Minister also mentioned the TUPE regulations. I welcome the fact that Ministers have considered the points made in Committee. I have not had much time to  <br>

look at the amendments, given how many have been tabled in the last week, but they appear to be sensible ones that meet the concerns expressed in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="81027-0010.htm_para10"><a name="0810274000449">It is also important to close the loophole relating to operators of last resort, even though those provisions may never be used. Indeed, their very existence makes their use less likely, and that is welcome. I concur with the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley about what happens when the nine-month period begins to run out. According to the arrangements set out in the amendments, the last three months of the 12-month period will be subject to approval by the traffic commissioner. Obviously they will consider the matter at that point, but they will also need to be involved at some time before the nine months is up. They may be persuaded to grant an extension for three months, but it is not clear what would happen if no solution had been found at the end of that time. When the Minister winds up, he must tell us what would happen then. If that is not made clear, individuals who have an interest in a lack of clarity at the end of the 12 months may be encouraged to drag matters out and ensure that clarity is not achieved. We need an answer on what would happen if the matter were still unresolved at the end of the 12-month period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="81027-0010.htm_para11"><a name="0810274000450">The technical amendments sensibly address points raised in Committee, and I have no quibble with that. I do not wish to make a Third Reading speech now, so suffice it to say that we broadly welcomed the Bill on its introduction, although we identified room for improvement. To be fair to the Government, many of those improvements have been made, so if the points identified by the hon. Member for Wimbledon are pressed to a vote, we will support the Government.</p>

 I support the amendments on the approvals process for quality contracts, the operator of last resort and the TUPE regulations. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) and other hon. Friends&#151;and indeed the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)&#151;I am delighted that we are considering the amended Bill today. It is much improved and, like my hon. Friend, I am very grateful for the work done by the previous Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton). She did a great job in getting the Bill into shape after Committee and ensuring that the points raised were fed into the Bill before consideration on Report. I also commend the new Minister on the speed and competence with which he has grasped those points. The result is before us today and is very welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="81027-0010.htm_para12"><a name="0810274000452">A demand for change led to the tabling of this Bill and it should not be ignored. That demand is underpinned by the evidence. The overall subsidy levels for the bus industry in this country have now risen to 40 per cent. of bus industry income at &#163;2.5 billion. At the same time, the use of buses in passenger transport executive areas has declined by 8.6 per cent. in the past 10 years. More subsidies are going into the bus system, but the level of patronage, in PTE areas in particular, has declined by 8.6 per cent. At the same time, patronage in London has increased by 54 per cent. It is quite clear that the issues to do with patronage and subsidy versus regulation are not quite as clear cut as the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) would have us believe. There is a relationship between regulation and whether or not a bus service can succeed.</p>

 The matters before us today do not relate to Northern Ireland, but I turn the question back on the hon. Gentleman. If he is so sure about regulation, why will not the Conservative party revisit the matters devolved to the City of London if&#151;and that is an uncertain if&#151;it returns to government?</p>

That title should not be forgotten. The Bill is about giving more local control to bus users up and down the country&#151;not just in London, but in all our areas. It is particularly aimed at those living in metropolitan areas&#151;often including quite considerable rural areas, too&#151;where the need for re-regulation is at its greatest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="81027-0010.htm_para14"><a name="0810274000456">Local control is a form of devolution that I would have thought that the Tory party would be keen to pursue. I thought that the Conservative party was now the party that believed in local control and in giving local people more say in how their services were delivered. The responses given by the hon.

That position is unreconstructed and unmodernised and is based totally on dogma rather than an appreciation of what is pragmatic and what will deliver for local people. <i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> .</i><i> ]</i> The hon.

 I would recommend that to a future Conservative Government. They might start with Birmingham, where I understand that there is quite strong support for the Bill from Conservative councillors. Indeed, the Conservatives have some councillors in South Yorkshire, I understand, in Rotherham. I understand that they would join the consensus in South Yorkshire, among all political parties, that the Bill is absolutely necessary to the future of public bus services in the area. As I say, the Bill is all about giving more local control to bus users in areas outside London, so that bus services can be improved. The amendments put forward will make it a great deal easier for us to deliver the improvements that we want&#151;the quality contracts.</p>

For example, there is now to be a consultation board, rather than an approvals board, thanks to Government amendments. The only point of difference that remains concerns the use of the Transport Tribunal for appeals. The Minister said earlier&#151;I think that I understood him correctly&#151;that the system for appeals, which will be prescribed in regulations, will be no more onerous than the current system. I would like to hear more from him on that point when he responds to the debate on this set of amendments. A new tiered system will come into effect as a result of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, but in the Transport Tribunal, we certainly do not want a number of tiers to come into operation in the appeals process, replacing the hoops and obstacles put in place by the Transport Act 2000. Those obstacles are what made it so very difficult to introduce the quality contracts that we are keen to see in our metropolitan areas. That issue needs exploring even now, and even more clarity is needed on the subject than was provided earlier in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="81027-0010.htm_para16"><a name="0810274000462">I welcome the new amendments on the TUPE regulations. People often underestimate or forget how important drivers are to the delivery of a good bus service. They are not always that well-paid, and the status of their employment has not always been that well-protected. We need to make sure that we deliver the best deal possible, because they need to be happy in their work and sure about their pension scheme if they are to deliver the punctual, courteous service that we want. One reason why we have problems getting the kind of service that we want in south Yorkshire is the difficulties that bus operators have in recruiting bus drivers. Levels of sickness are high, too. The aspects of the Bill that relate to the TUPE regulations are therefore very important to Labour Members. We know that the issue is not just about the rights of workers and so on, important though they are; it is also about the quality of the service delivered. I am absolutely delighted that the TUPE regulations are now in place.</p>

Member for Lewes about the operator of last resort. As I see it, the most likely scenario in which the operator of last resort power would be used is one in which a quality contract is awarded to an operator, and another operator who did not win the contract decides to walk away and deregister, leaving the service to flounder while the local authority or integrated transport authority establishes the new contracted service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="81027-0010.htm_para18"><a name="0810274000464">Of course, it should take no longer than nine months to put services run by the local authority on the road, and to replace them by means of a new quality contract. However, I welcome the extension to 12 months. We must think through the possibility of instances in which the new quality contracts are not delivered within nine months, and instead take up to 12 months to be put in place. It would be foolish of us to exclude the possibility of the process taking even a little while longer than that. It would be sensible to put clear provisions in the Bill, or perhaps in regulations, that would make it possible for the period to go beyond 12 months in exceptional circumstances. It would be really unfortunate if, despite the best attempts of local authorities and ITAs, things  <br>

went wrong, and we were left with a crisis situation because the Bill&#146;s provisions meant that the local authority could no longer fill the gap while it was in the process of establishing an alternative service via a quality contract.</p>

It is not based on dogma. It is not based on a belief that we must run the system in one way and no other. It is based on the evidence that we have been hearing from our constituents, the bus users in our areas, over a period of 20 years. That voice has been rising from a whisper at first to a crescendo of dissent against the current arrangements for running bus services in areas such as Sheffield, Barnsley and Manchester. Our constituents demand change. They demand that local councils improve services and do something about those that people are no longer getting. Sometimes bus services are changed every three months, withdrawn or diverted. Buses do not turn up on a regular basis, letting people down as they try to get to work.</p>

I am tempted to describe him as the David &#147;Supersub&#148; Fairclough of the Government&#146;s transport team.

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="81027-0010.htm_para22"><a name="0810274000469">The Government&#146;s new clauses take on board the concerns raised by both Liberal Democrat Members and some Labour Back Benchers in Committee and introduce proposals to limit the power of the new quality contracts scheme board by effectively making it a super-consultee, rather than a decision-maker. I am happy for the Minister to attempt to take some of the credit, just as the Government did when they took on Lib Dem plans for free travel for the elderly prior to the 2005 election.

some of the worst results of bus deregulation. It is true that certain routes have seen additional buses, particularly the Wilmslow road corridor, but that has been at the expense of other less profitable routes. Overwhelmingly, bus deregulation has not increased competition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="81027-0011.htm_para1"><a name="0810274000472">Where other bus companies have tried to compete&#151;for example, on the 85 and 86 bus routes from Chorlton to Manchester&#151;bus wars have ensued. Stagecoach flooded the routes with extra buses taken off other routes and introduced cheap fares. Buses were prevented from entering the bus station or stopping at certain stops. However, as soon as the competition was run off the road, the additional buses disappeared. Now the cheap fares have been phased out too, despite a local outcry from residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="81027-0011.htm_para2"><a name="0810274000473">Bus companies have used deregulation as a way of making services more profitable by cutting out parts of routes that are less profitable or that affect reliability. Again, in my constituency, that has resulted in fewer services running to the most deprived area in the whole of the constituency because more profit can be made by ending most of the services at the bus station. Similarly, the bus companies have attempted to hold the passenger transport authority to ransom on some routes by demanding subsidies to run services for part of the day, particularly in the evenings. When passenger transport authorities have been unable to add that subsidy, the services have disappeared.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="81027-0011.htm_para3"><a name="0810274000474">Those service failings can be addressed through quality contracts and they will need to be if the proposed transport innovation fund bid is to go through in Greater Manchester. The Greater Manchester passenger transport executive has been quick to assure me that the bus companies are keen on partnership working to deliver an improved bus network for the area; I am not surprised, given that &#163;3 billion is at stake. However, I am less convinced that the companies will agree to partnerships whose profits would be low.</p>

of amendments that affords workers extensive protection. TUPE protection has now been introduced, and it has been extended to the transitional period; that will assist in protecting the work forces of operators that fail to win a quality contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="81027-0011.htm_para6"><a name="0810274000478">Some of those protections will be laid out in detailed regulations. I shall refer to three particular issues that I would like the regulations to address and in respect of which I would like them to offer specific protections. A number of the unions have been pressing for a dismissal to be automatically construed as unfair under the regulations if it was given by an operator that did not win a quality contract or that decided to withdraw services instead of bidding for a quality contract. TUPE applies to many such workers, but we would welcome that specific protection against unfair dismissal. That would strengthen the unions&#146; hand in deterring the almost truculent treatment by employers that lose a contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="81027-0011.htm_para7"><a name="0810274000479">I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) about the need for an extension of the deregistration period. That would allow local authorities to protect services and jobs and plan accordingly. The amendments constructively and helpfully ensure that there will be protection when employees transfer to a quality contract so that the new pensions are broadly comparable to the previous ones. That is a major breakthrough and will give reassurance to many in the industry. It is suggested that the protection will be based on a formula similar to that used in the local government pension procedure. I welcome that. It has been pointed out in some of the discussions that some of the workers may be eligible to join the local government pension scheme. It would be useful if that was addressed specifically in the regulations; a number of transport workers would welcome the opportunity to join the scheme and gain benefits and security from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="81027-0011.htm_para8"><a name="0810274000480">Overall, I welcome the amendments on behalf of the unions. I am the son of a Liverpool docker who became a bus driver for 30 years; if my father were alive today, he would be heartbroken at what has happened to our bus services across the country as a result of privatisation and deregulation. However, he would broadly welcome this legislation, which gives our bus services the potential for a new future and a firm footing for the delivery of services on which so many of our communities rely.</p>

amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) and other Members, we now have a much better Bill than we did previously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="81027-0011.htm_para10"><a name="0810274000483">I want particularly to support new clause 6. I agree with colleagues that quality contracts, if we can get them right, are vital for ensuring that bus services are up to scratch for all local residents, whether they live in city centres, town centres, busy suburbs or remote rural villages. In many areas, bus routes are being reduced or even discontinued, often leaving people isolated because bus companies do not believe that they can make the routes profitable, while busy urban routes are often served by more than one bus company. That is hardly the best distribution of resources. Even when there are services we have problems with efficiency and reliability, with many people being put off using buses because they are not frequent enough or they cannot be confident that they will arrive on time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="81027-0011.htm_para11"><a name="0810274000484">There is consensus on both sides of the House that we can and must do better in providing a truly efficient bus service fit for purpose across the country. We need to put passenger needs first, and I genuinely believe that quality contracts are an essential step towards helping to accomplish that. When they work as they should, they can give local people and their representatives more control over local services. For quality contracts to work properly, we need to ensure that the process for making them is easier. In the Bill as originally drafted, there were many hurdles that made that process too slow, time-consuming, complicated and expensive an option for many authorities. That is why I am pleased to acknowledge that the Government have accepted the argument that unelected approvals boards&#146; recommendations are treated as being advisory only so that local authorities have to listen to their opinion of the scheme but do not necessarily have to follow their advice. If local accountability is to mean anything, it is vital that local councils should have the last word.</p>

That was not because I was a trade unionist in a union for the transport and public transport industry, but because it was one of the biggest demands of my constituents. The ability to get around the community, particularly for the elderly, the disabled and young mothers, is important to the debate about adequate public transport. Indeed, the economic interests of an area depend greatly on people being able to get to work on time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="81027-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08102714000003">In the Standing Committee considering the Transport Act 2000, some of us spoke to the then Minister&#151;in the Committee and privately&#151;and tried to highlight the fact that there was an imbalance since the Conservatives had deregulated public transport outside London. That imbalance was not in favour of local people, and we argued strongly that it should be put right by giving local elected passenger transport authorities more powers. It is well recorded that, like my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer), I would like to see public transport run by locally elected people in the interests of local people. But that is not the case; we still have a system in which private operators deliver the services. That is fine, but if we have to accept that, there should be a good balancing effect, with local, democratically elected members making sure that the process is carried out in a fair way that looks to the interests of the operators earning reasonable profits and keeping people in work, and most importantly, to ensuring that the service is adequate and affordable for our constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="81027-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08102714000004">I turn to the question of deregulation being a matter of local democracy, and how the Bill will redress the imbalance. When the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) spoke earlier, he referred to a provision in the Bill that says &#147;as it sees fit&#148;. That related to local decision making, and the attitude of the hon. Gentleman was an attack on local democracy. The phrase &#147;as it sees fit&#148; implies local knowledge, and if we chose to remove those words from provisions to do with locally elected or public bodies, we would indeed be reducing local democracy.</p>

 I am glad to have the chance to correct the hon. Gentleman.

He will remember, as he was a member of the Committee, that we discussed that wording several times and in several places. In this case, I was referring to the requirement to publish. I am sure that he listened carefully to what I said later, and I made the point that there could be no misinterpretation about the word &#147;publish&#148;. Therefore, the phrase &#147;as it sees fit&#148; would not add anything to the wording of the Bill.</p>

Friends and Opposition Members is TUPE. In our efforts to ensure that the interests of our constituents&#151;meaning the public&#151;are looked after, we sometimes forget that the workers in the companies involved are also constituents and that we should be looking to their interests. I spoke at length in Committee on TUPE. The matter is complex, but it is fundamentally a question of recognising the limitations of any system that throws people into unemployment. It should be a duty of politicians to look to making that as short a period as possible and, where possible, ensuring that workers are kept on, and kept on under terms and conditions that are at least equal to those they enjoyed under their previous employer. Having gone on at length about that matter in Committee, I am satisfied that the Government have moved forward and provided a protection that is probably as good as possible, with the exception of what was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell); the question of dismissal needs to be looked at more closely. I support my hon. Friend on that point.</p>

We do not yet have an adequate explanation of what happens when we move into the period after 12 months. I ask the Under-Secretary to consider the matter before the next stage.

 The man is a mind reader. By the way, I do not care if anybody calls it dogma, but I think that the matter is straightforward. The well-being of my constituents in Eccles and the city of Salford&#151;and of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents&#151;is served by ensuring that buses are provided on routes where they are needed, that they are modern and safe, run regularly and turn up on time, and that travel on them is affordable. That looks after the well-being of our constituents, and if it is dogma, I admit to being dogmatic. I would like my constituents to be able to rely on the Bill&#146;s delivering those objectives by giving more power to locally elected politicians and passenger transport authorities. Only the Labour Government can deliver that&#151;a Conservative Government could never do so.</p>

There is nothing novel about that, and local authorities are familiar with the Department&#146;s guidance on transport scheme appraisal. Clause 19 clearly sets out the criteria that must be fulfilled, and they are relevant to several points that were made in other interventions and contributions to the debate.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Those who have worked and been elected locally are the best people to deal with such matters and to make those judgments on behalf of the people whom they represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="81027-0012.htm_para0"><a name="08102714000023">The hon. Member for Wimbledon also asked about TUPE and the extra costs. The costs would be reflected in the price that the operators bid. The local authorities clearly need to factor any such costs into their assessment of a proposed scheme&#151;they must take them into account when working through the criteria. However, it is important to remember that applying TUPE will also deliver benefits. Having an existing, well-trained work force transferring to the quality contract operator will lead to savings and benefits. It is therefore sensible all round to protect the employees of companies that are not successful, but we should also remember that having such a qualified work force will be beneficial.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his patience. We are considering issues that are important to our constituents and to us as politicians. The TUPE regulations were originally intended to ensure that unscrupulous employers could not make workers redundant on a Friday and offer them a new contract, with lower terms and conditions, on a Monday. The Bill&#146;s provisions on that matter are good and will hopefully remain when it becomes an Act.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right that those provisions are some of the many good aspects of the Bill. He is also right about the purpose of TUPE.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="81027-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08102714000026">Let me respond specifically to some of the amendments. Proposed amendment (a) to new clause 14 deals with the detailed workings of the QCS boards. It appears that it would do two things. First, it would place a further obligation on local transport authorities, to be fulfilled when they decide that they are ready to submit their proposals to the QCS board for consideration, to send to the board copies of documents that the authority sent out as part of the consultation or in response to it. Section 125 of the Transport Act 2000 already provides that the authority must publish notice of its proposed scheme at the outset of the consultation, and Government amendment No. 165 would provide that the notice must be copied to the senior traffic commissioner. That notice must describe the proposed scheme and state where a copy of it and the consultation document may be inspected. The purpose of having the notice copied to the senior traffic commissioner is that, when he designates the commissioner who is to chair the relevant QCS board, he can also ensure that that commissioner has access to the local authority&#146;s consultation materials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="81027-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08102714000027">Amendment (a) also refers to documents that the local authority sends out during or after the end of the consultation period in reply to written responses from consultees. We consider that the local authority will have a clear interest in ensuring that the QCS board is aware of any such documents, as they are likely to be important in spelling out the local authority&#146;s case for proceeding with its proposed scheme. I am therefore not persuaded that we need to make explicit provision for that, but I would be happy to reflect on the matter further as I develop more detailed proposals for regulations and guidance that will support the quality contracts scheme provisions in the Bill.</p>

The amendment would mean that if, having consulted on its scheme and reflected on the consultation responses, the local authority wished to proceed with its proposed scheme, it must send a copy of the consultation document to the QCS board. Again, that is quite unnecessary, because the Government amendments already make provision for the consultation materials to be disseminated to the QCS board via the senior traffic commissioner. The Government amendments also include provisions requiring the authority to supply the board with information about all the responses that it has received and to ensure that the board has before it a copy of the final proposals for the scheme before it begins its deliberations. Our amendments therefore already provide for the board to have all the information that it needs.</p>

 My hon. Friend is very generous in giving way.

 I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention. There is a clear duty to consult all interested parties on the proposals and schemes being considered. It would be most bizarre if an authority did not use the option to consult, for example, bus operators, bus users and businesses in its local area and to follow that through. Again, however, we believe in allowing local bodies to decide how best to pursue those options in the consultation procedure.</p>

New clause 14 already makes it clear that in such circumstances the board may make recommendations on the actions that the authority or authorities might take in response to that opinion. New clause 14 is not prescriptive about the recommendations that a QCS board might make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="81027-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08102714000033">The Government would normally expect a QCS board to take a constructive approach. Where a board identifies defects in a scheme, the constructive approach would be to offer suggestions to the local authority as to how it might remedy them. It is unlikely that, having invested a great deal of time and effort in developing and consulting on proposals, an authority would submit to a QCS board a proposed scheme that was so defective that it was beyond salvation. If that very unlikely situation were to arise, I suppose it might be appropriate for the QCS board to say so, but there is no need to amend the Bill to empower the QCS board to do so. The provisions in proposed new clause 126AC(2) are already sufficiently broad to cater for that most unlikely outcome.</p>

 I agree with the Minister&#146;s analysis, but does he think it would be helpful for local authorities to avoid any pitfalls by discussing the scheme informally with the QCS board before its submission, or does he think that the two processes should be separated so that there is no prior consultation with the QCS board, informally or otherwise?</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I have said clearly that those who propose the scheme should use every option to ensure that they consult. As I said in response to an earlier intervention about the time process, local transport authorities will take time to develop a scheme. Depending on a scheme&#146;s complexity&#151;for instance, it could be a city-wide scheme or a more localised scheme&#151;it will obviously take time for it to be ready and presentable. I therefore assume that authorities would use every option to ensure that they have consulted as widely as possible.</p>

Again, new clause 14 already provides that the board may make recommendations on how the authority might address the apparent failure. In addition, amendment (c) would provide a power for the board to direct the local authority to take particular actions. However, I fear that the amendment rather misses the point of the Government new clauses and amendments that we are debating. The purpose of the changes that we are proposing, following lengthy debate in Committee&#151;again, we listened&#151;is to place decision making in the hands of elected local authorities. In that context, it would be inappropriate for a QCS board to have a power to direct a local authority.</p>

Amendments (a) and (b) seek to amend the grounds on which an appeal may be brought before the Transport Tribunal. I have already explained that under new clause 15 the grounds for appeal would depend on whether the QCS board had, in effect, given the final version of the scheme a clean bill of health. Where the board, which after all will be independent of both central Government and the local authorities, has examined the facts of the case and given that clean bill of health, the Government consider it entirely appropriate for the onward right of appeal to the tribunal to be limited to points of law, as was discussed earlier. That would enable an appeal to be brought on grounds that, for example, the authority had acted unreasonably in deciding to make the scheme, had acted with bias or had fettered its discretion. There would therefore be a clear safeguard in the most unlikely event of a QCS board failing to identify a major flaw in the authority&#146;s proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="81027-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08102714000038">However, where the final version of the scheme had not received a clean bill of health from the QCS board, an appeal could be brought either on points of law or questions of fact. That would enable a full-case review. The Government consider those proposals to provide an entirely appropriate level of protection, while avoiding unnecessary stages in the process, which after all could delay the implementation of schemes that are manifestly in the public interest.</p>

Is the Minister saying that it would be possible for the Transport Tribunal to reopen the whole case even when the QCS agrees with the local authority?</p>

 No, that would not be possible where the QCS agreed with the local authority. If the scheme had failed on the five public criteria test, it is likely that issues would arise that cut across a number of those criteria, which would therefore be open to a review through the appeals process. There would be knock-on effects where there was a problem with those public criteria.</p>

 No. My thought was that a cutting across over a number of those criteria would be likely, but if the disagreement was confined to just one, that would be the issue for an appeal. The hon. Gentleman is right in that sense.</p>

New clause 15 includes a power under which, in certain circumstances, the tribunal could quash the local authority&#146;s decision to make a scheme. But, as with QCS boards, the Government envisage that the tribunal would seek to take a constructive approach by proposing solutions to remedy any defects in a scheme, where such solutions could be identified. That is why new section 127B(5) limits the tribunal&#146;s power to quash a scheme, so that it may be exercised only in situations where the scheme cannot be varied to put things right.</p>

I should start by reminding the House that the purpose of new clause 9 is to provide a very limited power for local authorities to take action, in a specific emergency situation, to protect the interests of bus passengers&#151;the people at the heart of the Bill. The power would apply only where a quality contract operator was unable to operate the services that it had contracted with the authority to provide. In such a situation, it is possible that the only way to ensure continuity of services to passengers would be for the local authority to step in.</p>

the way that we want, using the various options that are open to them. It would therefore be wrong to extend the 12-month period. If we extended it for another three months, why should we not extend it for another six or beyond? We believe that the provisions for nine months, plus three months, will be able to meet the requirements in all circumstances.

 May I suggest a way forward? We all understand that the Minister does not want to give local authorities carte blanche indefinitely. A solution might be to give the traffic commissioner further authority to extend the process beyond the three months. The commissioner, an independent person, might be able to pick up on unforeseen circumstances and say, &#147;Yes, given that there are circumstances that we cannot foresee today, there might be a case for extending this for another month.&#148; That could be the safeguard that the Minister is looking for.</p>

quickly to do it before 9 o&#146;clock. I ask hon. Members to accept that we have recognised the issue of the operator of last resort, because we think that that was a powerful argument. That is another instance of our listening to the arguments that were made in Committee and by those who are seeking to deliver these services. We have taken the point on board. I ask all hon.

 It might be that I do not understand new clause 9. Will the Minister talk me through the scenario that was adverted to by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer), in which an authority issues an invitation to tender within the appropriate time frame but no one tenders? According to new clause 9, this will be covered in subsections (4), (5) and possibly (6) of proposed new section 132D, but I confess that I do not understand what the time frame is to be.

 This provision is for a time-limited period of nine months, plus three months as a further option, to get the contracts in place. Under the scheme, there is a period of time for the contract that was running, so it would be for the remainder of that period that this would run.

They seek to insert references to quality partnership schemes into new clause 9. The idea seems to be that, if a quality contract operator were unable to continue operating his services, the local authority might seek to fill that gap with a quality partnership scheme. But such an arrangement is wholly unworkable. The whole point of quality contracts schemes is that bus services falling within them are to be provided under quality contracts. I simply cannot see how the authority could superimpose a quality partnership scheme on top of an existing quality contract scheme. Furthermore, a quality partnership scheme involves the provision of facilities by the local authority, and bus operators wishing to use them must deliver an improved standard of service.

Clearly, the requirement must be judged against some other scenario, and the only reasonable and realistic one is to do exactly what the amendment says&#151;to compare the expected benefits of a quality contracts scheme with what would be expected if things carried on without a scheme. Indeed, that is what the guidance will advise. That is not quite  <br>

the same as saying that the effects of the scheme must be compared with the status quo, because in some cases it would be clear that, if no changes were made, services would be cut, passenger numbers would fall and we should be into a downward spiral.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="81027-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08102727000003">The effect of amendment No. 6 would be much more substantive than that of amendment No. 5, because a quality contracts scheme could not be made if there were any adverse effects on any bus operator or anybody living or working in the area. I think that anyone who understands the public transport industry or who has had to respond to correspondence from the public about bus or rail services will know that that condition is impossible to meet&#151;or as good as impossible. Virtually any change in the pattern of service routes or timetables, however well planned and however well intended, will inconvenience somebody or other&#151;even if it brings great improvements for the vast majority. That applies just as much to franchised rail services as it does to deregulated bus services, and it is just a fact of life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="81027-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08102727000004">Amendment No. 7&#151;another amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Wimbledon&#151;is more perplexing. It appears to remove discretion from the local transport authority about how it would publish a consultation document, but it does not prescribe how it should be done. In the absence of anything further, the local transport authority could do only what it thought fit, having regard, of course, to the statutory guidance. The Government believe that local authorities can be relied on to take a reasonable view to how consultation documents should be published; it is something that they do all the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="81027-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08102727000005">Amendment No. 8 would require the local transport authority to send copies of the consultation document to various specified people or classes of persons. That is over and above the list of statutory consultees specified in the Transport Act 2000. The guidance that we are proposing can supplement the statutory requirements on local authorities, without obliging them to follow it to the letter in every single case. We published this guidance in draft in December, but we will consult on a revised version of the quality contracts scheme volume around the turn of the year, taking into account a number of points made in debates both here and in the other place. The guidance will certainly highlight the need to ensure that bodies representing disabled people are properly consulted.</p>

 No; let me make some progress. In common, however, with my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central, I want to respond to the amendments and to comments made by right hon. and hon. Members in the debate. Indeed, it would be discourteous not to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="81027-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08102727000011">My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) raised a number of points, particularly about how QCS boards will view the public interest. He hoped that the boards would not nit-pick too much&#151;I think that that was my hon. Friend&#146;s terminology. It will certainly not be the job of QCS boards to second-guess every point of detail in a local authority&#146;s proposal. Their role will be to ensure that a proper and plausible analysis had been carried out. My hon. Friend was equally concerned about drafting issues and I can confirm that the reference to the</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="81027-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08102727000013">My hon. Friends the Members for Manchester, Blackley and for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) raised a number of issues, including about the number of days of notice to be given. We can confirm that the notice period will be dealt with in regulations and increased from 56 to 112 days, which we believe is the right time for a period of transition towards a quality contracts scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="81027-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08102727000014">In addition, questions about the tribunal process have been asked. I had hoped that my earlier comments clarified the position, but my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith) was particularly concerned about it. I reiterate that our intention is to ensure that the process is not overly cumbersome. We cannot prejudge what our Ministry of Justice colleagues will do, but I can give an assurance that, whatever the outcome, the process will have taken less time than a judicial review does.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="81027-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08102727000015">My hon. Friends the Members for Hayes and Harlington and for Eccles (Ian Stewart) asked about the wording of &#147;broadly comparable&#148; and whether anyone would end up worse off. The &#147;broadly comparable&#148; wording in the amendment is consistent with the wording in the Local Government Act 2003, which makes provision for pension protection policy where activities are contracted out by the local authority. We are not aware of any difficulties that have arisen from the use of that wording. We are happy to work with the unions and other interested parties as we develop the secondary legislation that will support this important Bill.</p>

The Government have confirmed to the trade unions that an operator of services provided under a quality contract would be eligible to join the local government pension scheme in respect of employees engaged in the provision of services under the quality contract.</p>

We do not believe that that constitutes unfair dismissal. Because of the changes that we introduced in the mid-1980s, buses operate under a deregulated market, so bus operators, like suppliers in all sectors of the economy, are free to decide what services they wish to provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="81027-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08102727000020">The Employment Rights Act 1996 provides that the dismissal of employees who are redundant is not unfair dismissal. That is an important principle in employment legislation. The best we can do is, first, ensure that, wherever possible, employees in the area of quality contract schemes are protected by TUPE and, secondly, minimise as far as possible the likelihood of that situation arising where TUPE does not apply.</p>

for the establishment of passenger transport authorities with overall responsibility for public transport services across each of those cities. By the time of the establishment of the metropolitan county councils in 1974, there were six of these PTAs, covering the west midlands, south and west Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Tyne and Wear and Merseyside. One was also set up north of the border in Strathclyde. Although the PTAs survived the abolition of the metropolitan county councils in the mid-1980s, the power to create further PTAs was removed from the statute book, even in circumstances where local authorities themselves were keen to see new ones set up. So, the broad arrangements for local transport decision making have, almost unbelievably, effectively been frozen since then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="81027-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08102733000025">Over the last quarter of a century, there have, inevitably, been many changes in the transport needs and patterns of different areas&#151;for example, in the distance that commuters are prepared to travel to their workplaces&#151;yet the existing legislation offers very little flexibility to update local arrangements for the planning and delivery of transport, or for one PTA area to do things differently from another, where local needs differ; hence our provision in this part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="81027-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08102733000026">I come now to the Government&#146;s amendments. At present, membership of each of the six English PTAs consists entirely of local councillors representing each of the local authorities that make up the passenger transport area. The Bill offers greater flexibility, both to areas that are considering setting up a new integrated transport area and authority and to those where the existing PTA has become an ITA, as to whether they would prefer to broaden the membership of their ITA to allow a wider range of bodies or persons to be represented on it. At the same time, a majority of members of each ITA would still have to be elected members of the local authorities that make up the integrated transport area.</p>

 I shall come on to those points shortly, but let me say that the ITAs will be able to draw together responsibilities for integrated transport.

whether some form of ITA could be created within those authorities. It is not for the Secretary of State, or central Government in general, to dictate what the local authorities should do; it is up to them to come forward with proposals as to how they might take advantage of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="81027-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08102733000031">A range of issues relating to ITA membership was explored in detail in Committee. In particular, concerns were raised as to whether it was appropriate for those members of an ITA who were not elected representatives of a local authority to be able to vote on matters in the integrated transport authority. As we explained at the time, we are keen not to be too prescriptive in the Bill about the details of the structure of each ITA and how it will operate. As I indicated to the hon. Gentleman, we think that it is far better for us to leave different areas the flexibility to do things differently if they so wish, including deciding whether non-elected members of ITAs should be able to vote.</p>

 Just a few moments ago, when we were discussing the previous group of amendments, the Minister agreed about the importance of local democratic accountability. He made the point forcefully that the local authority would have the final say on quality contracts, and that it would not be left to advisers. Will he explain to the House why this is a different principle? Why does he feel that the matter that we are discussing now should be at the discretion of local authorities, and why is the principle of democratic accountability not just as important on this matter as on the one that we were talking about just a few moments ago?</p>

 The ITAs will consider all the transport options that exist. We are still giving the final say to local authorities, and in fact it is provided that they will be in the majority on any ITA board. Representatives of the local authorities will make up the larger number, and there will be a minimum of one representative from each authority in the ITA area. Equally, it would be right for them to bring in others, potentially including representatives of users&#151;that option would be open to the ITA and local members&#151;to be involved in their deliberations and discussions. Whether they had voting rights would be decided by the elected members of the ITA. I hope that that covers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.</p>

Members of all parties recognised that voting arrangements are best decided locally, which was why we were happy to respond with new clause 10, which applies to secondary legislation setting up new ITAs, and new clause 11, which applies to secondary legislation covering ITAs that already exist. They provide that it will be for each ITA to decide for itself whether those of its members who are not elected members of the local authorities but who are appointed by them should be able to vote, and if so, on which issues. That is instead of the issue being determined in the governance order to be made by the Secretary of State.</p>

 It will be for the local ITA to decide how that provision will operate. It might decide on voting rights on issues that appear on the agenda for a given meeting, or it might well decide on broad categories of provisions. It could agree that non-elected members cannot vote on finance issues, or another such category. There will clearly be supporting guidance to help ITAs through that process, but it will be for them to deem how they run their own affairs.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for being generous in giving way on a difficult point. My concern is this: if a party in control of an ITA can bring people on to it and give them voting rights on everything from capital and revenue expenditure to the network route, will it be able to say that those people have voting rights for four years, potentially undermining any elections in its constituent authorities? That is not clear from the new clauses.</p>

 My hon. Friend raises an interesting point. If I recall correctly, the authorities themselves will be able to review provisions under the new clauses periodically. I shall return to that issue shortly, but I recall that they will certainly be able to review them as and when required.

 May I return to the previous issue? I realise that it is a tricky point, and I understand that the Minister listened to what was said about concerns over voting rights for non-elected members of an ITA. The problem is that although the members of an ITA will be able to decide whether non-elected members can vote on particular issues, if a party with a majority sees an election coming that it might lose, it could seek to build in its majority by giving rights to non-elected people. That is the real concern.</p>

 I understand what my hon. Friend is saying. Nothing in life is easy, and all I can say to him is that he should ensure that, through people coming out to vote correctly, his area does not end up with a hung ITA. It would be equally wrong for us to try to prescribe at central Government level how local authorities should handle the delivery of transport in their area. It is right that local authorities should make decisions on such matters and set up the governance arrangements that they want to have. The ITA can always decide to take away voting rights by overturning a resolution that it passed earlier giving voting rights in the first place, and that is why we are allowing local people to make that local decision.</p>

 If I recall correctly, such provisions exist within other local government legislation in respect of health improvement forums and so on. We should not necessarily seek to implement decision-making processes in transport in the same way, because this is a complex area.

 I wish to tease this matter out by simplifying it for the Minister. In the west midlands, there are seven metropolitan authorities. Let us suppose that there are seven members of the passenger transport authorities, although that is not quite the case. The west midlands is a swing area, which is, unfortunately, controlled predominantly by the Conservatives at the moment. Let us also suppose that a few years ago, Labour, predominating among those seven councils, had appointed six&#151;a minority on the PTA&#151;of these non-elected members for a four-year term. Elections take place in the west midlands authorities three out of every four years, so in practical terms there is an election every year. During the four-year term of the six appointed members, the predominant control could change so that there were two Labour and five Conservative authorities. As Labour had packed the PTA with six non-elected members on a four-year term, however&#151;our party would not do that, but we are talking about a hypothetical situation&#151;despite the fact that the preponderance within the metropolitan authority would have changed, there would be a majority on the ITA of Labour representatives; there would be six &#147;placemen&#148; and two from the two remaining local authorities. Hon. Members from metropolitan districts are concerned that such a situation could occur, and on that basis, I urge the Minister to re-examine the mathematics of how this arrangement could play out in metropolitan authorities. I am not suggesting that any party would play fast and loose, but we need democratic safeguards.</p>

 As I have said before, that will be an option for the ITA, as the rules and regulations set out. If an ITA changed, in terms of the representation of newly elected members from the local authority after a given May election, it would be for it to decide the rights of the non-elected members. The Local Government and Housing Act 1989 sets out the political balance requirements, and section 15 sets out the principles, including the need to review all appointments after political changes. That is the point that I have just made.</p>

 As has been pointed out, if the ITA has the power to decide that non-elected members can have voting rights for several years, they may be entitled to be involved in the initial decisions at the annual general meeting. The question is whether the elected politicians should run the AGM and decide, after each AGM or council election, whether the non-elected members should have voting powers.</p>

 That is for the ITA to decide. I repeat that locally elected members will always be in the majority. It could be that the ITA decided at its AGM that non-elected members were not to vote, or could not vote on constitutional issues. A range of options will be open to the ITA, and that is what we are trying to allow. We want proper representation with proper structures to deliver good public bus services, as we discussed regarding the first group of amendments. We want to modernise the delivery of those services.</p>

Government amendments Nos. 151 and 153 therefore delete the existing references to ITA membership in clauses 73 and 78, as these will now be covered by Government new clauses 10 and 11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="81027-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08102736000029">Government amendment No. 156 is intended to ensure that the political balance of those district and county councils that make up the area of a newly established ITA is reflected in the appointments made by those councils to an ITA. That also responds to concerns raised in Committee that a governance order under part 5 of the Bill could be used to circumvent the new political balance requirements. In fact, PTAs are already subject to section 15 of the Local Government Act 1989, which requires that the political balance of the local authority representatives who sit on a PTA reflects the political balance of the constituent councils that make up the passenger transport area. There may have been some confusion on this point in Committee, but I can reassure hon. Members that section 15 of the 1989 Act will also apply to integrated transport authorities&#151;not just to those six ITAs that will replace the existing PTAs, but also to any new ITAs that might be set up in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="81027-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08102736000030">I recognise that there were some concerns that the powers in clause 86 for the Secretary of State to make incidental, consequential, transitional and supplementary provision by order could, at least in theory, be used to disapply the requirement for ITAs to be subject to political balance. I am very happy to make it clear that the Government believe the membership of ITAs should be subject to the rules on political balance, in the same way as are other authorities to which the 1989 Act applies. Government amendment No. 156 underlines that by making it clear that the powers in clause 86 cannot be used to remove the requirements for ITAs to be subject to the rules on political balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="81027-0015.htm_para7"><a name="08102736000031">Government amendment No. 152 makes a small drafting correction in clause 76. Government amendment No. 157 provides that orders under clauses 73 to 91 of the Bill would not be subject to the hybrid instruments procedure when laid before Parliament. That would apply to orders made by the Secretary of State in response to proposals for changes to existing arrangements put forward by local authorities of the sort that we have already been discussing, such as an order setting up a new ITA or making changes to the boundaries of an existing ITA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="81027-0015.htm_para8"><a name="08102736000032">The amendment would, of course, apply only to proceedings in another place, as the hybrid instruments procedure does not apply to this House. Such dehybridising clauses are not unusual in local government legislation. Similar provisions have been included recently in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 and the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008. Indeed, the Local Government Act 1992 also provided that orders setting up unitary authorities, such as those in Hartlepool or the City of Leicester, would not be subject to hybrid procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="81027-0015.htm_para9"><a name="08102736000033">The Bill quite properly already provides that governance orders under it should receive detailed scrutiny, both inside and outside Parliament.

that the Secretary of State must consult relevant local authorities and other parties with an interest before such orders are made. Given that fact and the precedents that I have mentioned, the Government do not feel that potentially subjecting such orders to hybrid procedures is necessary to ensure the proper scrutiny of the proposals. That is especially true as such a process could have the effect of delaying changes to existing governance arrangements, which have enjoyed widespread local support.</p>

The amendments address the issues behind amendments Nos. 12, 13, 26 and 29, tabled by Opposition Members, and behind amendment No. 101, tabled by my hon. Friends.

 I am glad to see the new clauses, although I would like slightly more clarification of certain parts of them. In Committee I said:</p>

I question the need for direct elections, although I understand that that process would have even greater...linkage. We have a process whereby elected officials can sit in a democratically accountable way on an ITA, but unless the ITA reflects the political proportionality, democratic representation and democratic consent are removed.&#148;<i> &#151;&#151;</i>[<i> Official Report, Local Transport Public Bill Committee, </i>8 May 2008; c. 317-18.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="81027-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08102739000003">I am pleased to see the new clauses, because they begin to cover the issues that were raised in Committee and have been raised again tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="81027-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08102739000004">My argument in Committee, unlike my arguments on the previous group of amendments, gained some support from all parties. I argued that if ITAs were to be a success, they must be accountable and democratic: that the ITAs must be made up of elected members of the councils that constitute the ITA area; that those elected members must be appointed to the ITA in such a way that their numbers reflected the political make-up of the councils; and that, if there were to be unelected members, they should not have the right to vote. The Government&#146;s proposals go some way towards that. The new clauses are a starting point, offering total flexibility of membership and voting, that could lead to my desired finishing point of fully accountable ITAs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="81027-0015.htm_para14"><a name="08102739000005">The new clauses specify that each ITA must include at least one elected representative from each authority represented in the ITA. Furthermore, the Government&#146;s amendments specify that those members not appointed will be able to vote only on those matters that the ITA permits them to vote on. As hon. Members have said, that raises a number of issues, and so I have tabled two amendments to new clause 10 and a further two to new clause 11. Unless I get some further reassurance, I shall test the will of the House on amendment (b) to new clause 10. Those amendments complement my original amendment No. 12, which was tabled before the summer recess. The first effect of the amendments will be not only that a majority of ITA members will be local  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para0"><a name="08102739000006">The amendments to the new clauses also complement amendments Nos. 11 and 13, which were tabled before the summer. Amendment No. 11 will ensure that a new ITA can be set up only when there is public consent for it. I have given two options for how that consent could be given. Firstly, the elected councillors on each local authority could agree a resolution. Secondly, there could be a referendum. The principle of local validation and local accountability is extremely important to the Opposition. Indeed, we might return to it if we ever get to the clauses that deal with road charging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08102739000007">When we debated the creation of ITAs in Committee, I was not alone in thinking that the then Minister was not entirely convincing in trying to persuade us that the current constitution and membership details were bottom-up arrangements and would have the impact and effect that most Members required. Amendment No. 13 goes further, and I hope that the Minister will reflect again on the subject before we finish tonight. The amendment will ensure that only members appointed from among the elected members of the constituent councils will be able to vote in the ITA&#151;that is, that only democratically elected members will be able to vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08102739000008">Amendment No. 13 goes further than the Government&#146;s amendments, which, as we have discussed, say that the ITA can decide when and on what issues members may vote. I think that there is some support for amendment No. 13, which goes to the core of our democratic principles. We want ITAs to be democratically accountable bodies and it is therefore logical that the members of the ITA who are given the power to vote ought to have the mandate to do so by virtue of having been elected by local people to represent them and to take decisions on matters such as local transport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08102739000009">With the new clauses, the Government have come a long way. They have left the starting blocks and are halfway around the track, and if they were to accept amendment No. 13 they would cross the finish line. I was not initially tempted to press amendment No. 13 to a vote, and I am probably persuaded that I should not. However, I hope that the Minister will consider the number of interventions from his own party and look again carefully at my wording. It will provide him with a way out and with the answer that his Back Benchers were looking for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08102739000010">Let me turn to the other amendments in the group. Amendments Nos. 26 and 29 have been tabled by the Liberal Democrats, and amendment No. 26 is essentially the same as amendment No. 13. Amendment No. 101 is in the name of the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) and he states that the ITA will decide what matters non-elected members can vote on. I wonder whether that goes far enough in terms of what the House wants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08102739000011">I agree with the Minister that amendments Nos. 151 to 153 appear to be purely consequential amendments. I certainly welcome amendment No. 156, which states  <br>

that sections of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 that relate to political balance on local authority committees cannot be disapplied by order. I think that the Minister has given the clear explanation of amendment No. 157 that I would otherwise have sought. I am certainly looking forward to hearing the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley talk to amendment No. 64, because I am keen to hear exactly what he thinks that it will achieve.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Minister found himself in difficulties on this issue. I sympathise, because he walked into the job only very recently. I genuinely hope to be helpful by going through the issues as I see them. I hope that we can come to a resolution, if not now, then possibly in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08102739000013">When the metropolitan county councils were abolished, it became the constituent authorities&#146; responsibility to send members to the passenger transport authorities and other joint boards. After a lot of argument, it became clear that rules had to be applied to retain the correct political balance. At best, my hon. Friend was not clear about the fact that that political balance relates to the number of members sent to the PTA by the constituent districts. If, for example, there was a Labour majority of one in Wolverhampton, the district could not send three or four Labour delegates to the PTA; it had to be proportionate. That requires a little thought. Although the constituent authorities will do their best to send a proportionate balance of members to the PTA&#151;or, in future, the integrated transport authority&#151;it is likely that the final balance will not reflect the balance across the county.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08102739000014">If, as seems intended in new clauses 10 and 11, we reduce the number of council representatives on the integrated transport authorities to one per authority&#151;that is the minimum&#151;it becomes impossible to reflect the political balance in the county, unless the county is a statistical freak. There are difficulties to do with where we start. In Committee, we discussed holding direct elections or referendums to set up the bodies, but that is not what the amendments that we are discussing are about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08102739000015">In new clause 10(5) and (6), there is both a prohibition on having non-elected members on an ITA, and a power giving ITAs the ability to waive that prohibition. It is not clear what the purpose is of providing for such members. I do not mind the 47 professors of transport that universities feel they need being on integrated transport authorities. I do not mind bus operators or passengers being on them, either. Discussion with those people would add to elected members&#146; knowledge. However, what is the purpose of allowing non-elected members to vote? I have not heard the Minister give any good reason for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08102739000016">I should like to query one statement of fact that the Minister made. He said that voting arrangements were determined locally. That is simply at odds with the facts. Local authorities cannot co-opt people with voting rights on to them. In fact, the right is jealously guarded. The Local Government Act 1972 got rid of aldermen, who had been there for ever&#151;I mean, some of them, personally, had been there for ever. From that point on, all directly elected local authorities have been just that&#151;they have had only elected members. That was the political balance. Where there are joint boards, an attempt is made to recreate that political balance on them. The  <br>

one exception is police authorities. Historically, magistrates have long been seen as almost equal, if not equal, to elected members of such authorities, but all the other authorities have jealously guarded the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08102739000017">I would therefore be fascinated to hear the objective, beyond that of providing expertise, behind allowing non-elected members. The Minister said repeatedly that elected members will be in a majority, but that is not really the point. Those of us who stand for election do so because we believe certain things. Often, parties believe different things; that is why their representatives stand for election. What matters is the political balance. If the Labour party or Conservative party has one representative on a body, that is the balance that matters, and not whether there are more elected than non-elected members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08102739000018">I ask my hon. Friend to think about that, because as things stand&#151;given the fact that the relationship between subsections (5) and (6) is ill-defined, and given that there is no clear stated objective&#151;the process can change the political balance of the authority, and we do not know how long for; it may be for four years, or for one year. That can be done while elected members remain in a majority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08102739000019">As the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) said, I attempted to define and address some of those issues in amendment No. 101. Having listened to the debate, however, I think that it does not go far enough. I certainly will not press it to a Division, but I look to the Minister at least to make a statement in the House saying that he will look into the issues with a view to ensuring that the political balance is maintained within authorities. What is proposed in the Bill is at best ill-defined. The provisions were introduced in response to comments made in Committee, and I accept the Government&#146;s good will, but they could work to undermine essentially good proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08102739000020">I cast the problem as being to do not just with members, but with the purpose of setting up integrated transport authorities; the Minister referred to that. In one sense, the purpose is to say, &#147;Transport has probably not been considered as important as it should have been in the local democratic context, and we will give it a shove. We will have integrated transport authorities, and after consultation and once statutory instruments have been agreed to in this place and the other place, we will give them the ability to take highways powers away from local authorities.&#148; If that is the purpose&#151;to give a push to transport&#151;one has to keep the scheme in the most powerfully democratic context that one can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08102739000021">I have been on passenger transport authorities, and I have been on the Transport Committee, although I was not on it when I was a member of the Government. I believe in giving transport as much help as it can get, but there are competing interests that must also be part of the democratic process. If one is setting up a bus priority measure, shopkeepers, local residents and pedestrians will often have very different views about it. If the proposals in the Bill were agreed to, and those with special interests from the transport world altered the political balance, there would be less and less possibility of people who disagree with transport proposals gaining their point through the democratic process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08102739000024">Transport proposals are often at the core of the most intense debate in local areas. In Greater Manchester a tremendous row is going on about the transport innovation fund proposals. A referendum on the matter has been proposed, but many of us believe that the question has been fiddled. Transport is not an easy subject, and to take it further from the democratic process may well be a mistake.</p>

We had that discussion in Committee. The Government&#146;s position is that ITAs should be created by statutory instrument, under the affirmative procedure because they fundamentally change the structure of local government. Highways powers will be changed, and borrowing powers may well be transferred to different authorities. People will be able to vote more easily to effect some policies as an elector if the proposals go ahead.</p>

People have interests and they often have rows about boundaries and about the powers involved. When I proposed the super-affirmative process&#151;the regulatory reform order&#151;rather than a simple SI, the then Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton) made two points in Committee on 8 May.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08102739000027">One of those points was that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of the other place had concluded:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08102739000028">but that is not the same as saying that the proposals are better&#151;that a regulatory reform order or a super-affirmative process would not be better, because the difference between a super-affirmative process and an ordinary SI, apart from the fact that if there is dissent, there can be longer debate on the Floor of both Houses, is that representations can be made directly to the Committee dealing with them and amendments can be made to the regulatory reform order before it is placed before both Houses. On issues that are highly controversial, that separate parliamentary pathway, with more consultation and more ability to amend, is better than an SI, which would be passed on a whipped vote, as the recent changes to Cheshire were.</p>

try in new clause 10 to improve the process of setting up integrated transport authorities. I leave my hon. Friend the Minister with one final thought. If, by means of ITAs, we are trying to set up not good transport authorities with elected members who have a relationship with the electorate, but a process that is moving towards the quangoisation of transport, looking to the way that Transport for London has been set up in a completely different political context, it would be easy to interpret the provision as a way of saying that transport in the metropolitan areas, and possibly eventually in the shire counties or the unitary authorities if they go for the same structure, are on the way to being quangos, because we are creating an almost equal status for non-elected members as for elected members, with no clear idea of the purpose of their voting on that body.</p>

 I shall comment briefly on the proposed make-up of integrated transport authorities and the voting rights within them. It is clear that the Minister has considered the concerns expressed in Committee by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) and by other hon. Members about the political accountability of ITAs, but unfortunately the Government amendments do not go nearly far enough to allay those concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08102739000032">The guarantee in the Government&#146;s new clauses that each ITA would include at least one elected councillor from each local authority is not enough to guarantee political balance and the local accountability of the ITA. In his opening remarks the Minister was quick to argue that the Government were seeking not to dictate to local authorities on the make-up of the new ITAs and whether non-elected members had voting rights, but he was unable to give one example of a local authority or PTA that was asking for the power to include non-elected people in the ITA with voting rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08102739000033">The current arrangements for PTAs are hardly perfect, but at least they make some attempt to reflect the relative size of each local authority and its political make-up. In Greater Manchester, for instance, the Labour party recently lost control of the passenger transport authority, but that would almost certainly not have happened if the PTA were made up of one member from each local authority area. The temptation will be great for so-called independent members of ITAs to be selected by political allegiance, rather than because of their transport knowledge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para24"><a name="08102739000034">Surely, therefore, the most appropriate way forward is to ensure that any independently appointed members of the ITA have no voting rights. The Government can attempt to put as many restrictions in place as they want, but if they continue to insist on voting rights for non-elected members, they will seriously damage the accountability of each ITA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para25"><a name="08102739000035">Amendment No. 26 in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes seeks to restrict voting rights on the ITA to elected councillors appointed by individual local authorities, while allowing for independent members who have expertise in transport matters. It is right and proper that an ITA should benefit from the expertise and experience that some appointed members may be able to contribute. It is not right or proper, however, that those people should exercise votes. The only people who should have voting rights are elected members of an ITA&#146;s constituent council. Those members  <br>

 I am following what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but it appears to contradict his amendment No. 26, to which he has just referred. The amendment says that</p>

 Ideally, we would take the position that there should be no voting rights for unelected members; I suspect that an ITA would never agree to give voting rights to a non-elected member anyway. However, to try to get the Government&#146;s support on this matter, we are pushing an amendment that simply gives the opportunity for local authorities to restrict those voting rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para27"><a name="08102739000039">Although the Government&#146;s new clause 10 heads in roughly the right direction, it does not guarantee accountability. It is not acceptable to put the question of whether an ITA is accountable directly into the ITA&#146;s hands; that runs the real risk that an ITA will appoint a large number of co-opted members&#151;little more than party stooges&#151;who would then have the power to thwart the wishes of the electorate and the local community. The Government have a duty to safeguard local democracy, not to threaten it as they are currently doing with this element of the Bill. I shall be slightly bolder than the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) and push amendment No. 26 to a Division.</p>

<p><a name="st_o282"><a name="08102739000040"><a name="81027-0016.htm_spnew6"><a name="08102739000546"><b>Mr. Betts:</b>
 I should like to make four big points. First, we have to be careful about the use of the term &#147;political balance&#148;. Although it is possible to ensure that each constituent authority within an ITA area is required to propose representatives who reflect the political balance of their council, it is not possible to construct a system under which all the authorities together are taken as a whole and the political balance of the ITA reflects their total political composition. There cannot be a mechanism for doing that, because there would be nobody to oversee it. There is no way in which we can do it, and we must be careful about that. Currently, under the passenger transport authorities, each local authority selects its members to the transport authority on the basis of the political balance in that authority&#151;and that, I suggest to the Minister, is also how things will have to be done with ITAs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para28"><a name="08102739000041">Secondly, it would help if the Minister said that there would be an attempt to balance representation on grounds of population within local authority areas as well. Currently, there are big differences in population among authorities that constitute passenger transport authorities, and the membership of the PTAs reflects that. I hope that that will be carried through. Obviously, Sheffield is the largest authority in south Yorkshire and if we had an extended ITA for that part of the country, I would like that fact to be reflected. We could end up with a mix of met and non-met districts forming a new ITA in which the differences in population size between the authorities would be even bigger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para29"><a name="08102739000042">Thirdly, I turn to the issue of votes for unelected members. In the end, the arguments are pretty persuasive. There is no good reason in principle why unelected members should have the same votes as those on the same authority who are elected. Nevertheless, in moving as far as they have, the Government may well have been helpful. In the vast majority of circumstances, no group of elected councillors on an ITA will award the vote to people who are not elected; they would not share their democratic entitlements in that way. The only time when that might happen is when people want to play political games&#151;when, for example, the majority on an ITA think that they are going to lose power and seek to appoint like-minded people to positions as non-elected members and then give them the vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="81027-0016.htm_para30"><a name="08102739000043">I think, however, that the Minister has already said that the decision on whether non-elected members should have a vote on the ITA should come up after each local authority election at the very least, so that it could be repeated. Indeed, there was some suggestion that the voting members on the ITA might be able to vote on the rights of non-elected members at any time. That might deal with the problem.</p>

 I agree with what the hon. Gentleman has said so far. Is not the problem that the Government are standing too far back? They should be saying that setting a framework within which everyone had to operate would in no way affect local accountability. That framework should be designed to prevent abuse and ensure democratic accountability.</p>

 In new clause 10, the Government are trying to set a better framework. Some on the Labour Benches are just trying to encourage the Minister to make the framework a little more specific to secure democratic accountability and prevent the misuse of powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="81027-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08102739000046">Finally, I turn to the potential extension of the new PTA areas and the new ITAs. I think that that is a real possibility in south Yorkshire, north Derbyshire, north Nottinghamshire and perhaps even north Lincolnshire. The issue is exciting, because the current PTA boundary ends at the bottom of my garden. There is nothing intrinsically wrong about that, but the problem is that the travel-to-work area does not end there. The travel-to-work area of Sheffield, as a city region, extends into north Derbyshire, north Nottinghamshire and north Lincolnshire. Good relationships are now developing between the various local authorities, which want to come together on issues of transport, and perhaps skills, to consider how they can work together better.</p>

However, the possibility of doing that is a positive and helpful step in the Bill. I ask the Minister to think about the one issue that might be restrictive. I am thinking of representatives of an ITA that incorporated only part of a county but the whole of certain districts within that county, which could happen in, for example, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire. In such a case, there would have to be a decision on whether the county or  <br>

each individual district was represented on the ITA. Might not making that decision, and saying that only one or the other could have representation, create a further problem for an agreed way forward between the county and districts on those other issues? Will the Minister think about how such a restriction might prove more unhelpful than it need be?</p>

 We have certainly had an interesting discussion about the provisions of integrated transport authorities&#151;those that exist and those that we want local authorities to consider as a way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="81027-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08102739000049">The last comment made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) was about the representation of districts and counties. He is right that there is a minimum position of there being a representative either from each of the districts or from the county council, by agreement. We are saying that that would be the minimum representation. I shall come back to the other matters that he raised and reflect on other things that he mentioned. I shall try to deal with some of the amendments and then with the issues that have been raised individually.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="81027-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08102739000050">Amendment No. 11 relates to clause 73, under which the Secretary of State can make an order establishing a new integrated transport authority and integrated transport area where the local authorities in the area have reviewed their existing governance arrangements and have published a scheme that proposes that an ITA be set up. However, let me make it absolutely clear: an ITA to be established can usually cover only those geographical areas included in the proposals for a new ITA put forward by two or more local authorities&#151;county councils, metropolitan districts, councils or unitary councils. The only exception to that rule would be in the circumstances that two or more authorities have not only been directed by the Secretary of State to undertake a review of all or part of their area but have been directed by the Secretary of State to prepare and publish a scheme for the establishment of a new ITA in that area or part of that area. I would expect that to be a rare occurrence, if it ever proved necessary at all. However, there might, for instance, be a major difference of opinion between neighbouring authorities that made it impossible for them to decide what area a new ITA should cover, thus holding up a review that could lead to improvements to transport locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="81027-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08102739000051">In those circumstances, a direction by the Secretary of State determining the likely area of an ITA could remove the main blockage to a review going forward. If the local authorities failed to comply with such a direction, the Secretary of State would be able, subject to the procedures and safeguards set out in the Bill, to make an order setting up the new ITA. The Bill already provides several constraints on the Secretary of State&#146;s power to establish a new ITA&#151;for instance, the procedural safeguard of consulting representatives of appropriate authorities and others. What is more, any governance order setting up a new ITA would need to be approved by this House and by another place.</p>

transport in the area may not always live within the boundaries of the proposed ITA itself, especially where it is an urban area that has a large number of commuters. I hope that my explanation has convinced hon. Members that the safeguard that they are attempting to introduce into the Bill is unnecessary and that they are able to withdraw their amendments.</p>

I have already explained the purposes of the new clauses, one of which is to provide that non-elected members of an ITA should have voting rights only where the existing voting members of that authority agree. This deals with the concern expressed in Committee that having non-elected members could lead to a shift in the political balance of the ITA. That is why, as some right hon. and hon. Members have recognised, we moved to reflect the debate that took place in Committee.</p>

 Amendment No. 13 would mean that non-elected members had no voting rights at all under any circumstances. I have already been through that discussion. The hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech) referred to the fact that individual authorities have not yet asked for non-elected members because they have not yet undertaken a review of their governance arrangements in those areas.

 My hon. Friend has mentioned other examples of where this happens&#151;for example, police authorities. If the provision is not widespread, that does not mean that it should not apply and that we should not be far-thinking in getting the arrangements for governance of the transport system in our towns and cities that we think are right and will deliver.

the ability to change the boundaries of existing areas because of changing travel-to-work areas.

 ITAs are responsible to local authorities and, ultimately, to the people whom they serve&#151;the travelling public. I reiterate that this is about making a provision for an ITA to take if it so wishes. If it wants to incorporate and involve non-elected members&#151;for example, representatives from user groups, operators, or other interested bodies that it thinks would add to its deliberations&#151;that is one of its powers. The second power is the ability to say, &#147;You can vote or you can choose not to vote.&#148; It is a matter to be decided locally.</p>

 That might be a good provision to be incorporated within the constitution of an ITA, but I want to talk further about the question of a review after an election. An amendment was tabled by the hon. Member for Wimbledon to new clause 10 that would require that members were appointed precisely in proportion to their representation. This is an example of where the provision would work exactly as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) says.</p>

Members have said, it is unlikely that we would always have a situation where a precise political balance on an appointing council matches the number of appointments that it can make to an ITA. That is why the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 sets out at length the way in which political balance works. Section 15 sets out principles by which appointments can be balanced. When political balance changes, the duty on the appointing authority is to review the representation as soon as is practical thereafter. A review would therefore be going on, even if there was not a change of political balance, because the legislation requires it. Section 15(6) of the 1989 Act deals with non-elected appointees by requiring the number of such appointees to be taken into account.</p>

 No, I do not accept that because of the safeguards in the Bill that I hope we will pass today, and in the 1989 Act. I do not believe that the proposals would do as the hon. Gentleman describes. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe talked about reflecting population differences in the numbers that could come from each participating authority. That is a possibility, and the relevant ITA could decide to reflect the population on that basis. The effect of further amendments to new clauses 10 and 11 would be to preclude any representation on ITAs other than by elected councillors. The Government believe that non-elected members of the ITA could have an important role to play if the local ITA so decided.</p>

A key objective of the Bill is to allow local government arrangements to be tailored to meet local needs. In contrast to the current statutory arrangements, which are extremely inflexible, the Bill allows for separate orders to be made to introduce changes in different parts of the country. An order covering the west midlands could include different provisions from one covering Merseyside.

 I will deal first with new clause 12. Government policy is to encourage efficient and effective working in the highway, with works properly co-ordinated by the highways authority. Key to that is the need for the authority to be given notice of works on its highways to be carried out by undertakers, whether they are placing, maintaining or removing apparatus in or below the highways or of consequential works&#151;for instance, carrying out a permanent reinstatement as a separate phase or works to remedy a failure to complete a reinstatement to the correct standard in the first place. That is known as &#147;remedial works&#148;. All occupy the highway and impact on our crowded roads.</p>

Unfortunately, when the Road Safety Act 2006 was drafted, the definition of &#147;conditional offer&#148; in this context was not amended to include conditional offers issued by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency&#146;s vehicle examiners in Scotland.

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="81027-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08102743000053">The Bill includes a number of powers to make secondary legislation to amend other legislation, including primary legislation where necessary, as a consequence of provisions made either by the Bill or by secondary legislation made by virtue of the Bill. In effect, those powers aid proper implementation of the Bill by ensuring that other relevant legislation can be amended to make it consistent. For the present debate, the relevant powers are contained in clauses 1 and 6, about the traffic commissioners, and clauses 68 and 69, about passenger representation. Each of those powers is limited to making consequential, incidental, supplementary or transitional provision, or savings. In other words&#151;</p>

 No. In other words, any secondary legislation amending legislation under those powers must be directly related to the implementation of provisions contained in the Bill itself. Each of the powers that I have referred to is expressed to include power to amend</p>
<a name="81027-0018.htm_brev14"><a name="08102743001022"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;any enactment (whenever passed or made)&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="81027-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08102743000056">That wording makes it clear that each power can be used to make consequential and other amendments to enactments passed or made both before or after the Act that contains the power. However, it leaves open some ambiguity as to whether the powers can be used to make consequential and other amendments to the Act that contains the power itself&#151;that is, the Bill we are considering&#151;or to the amendments to other Acts, such as the Transport Act 2000, that the Bill will make. It is important for the Bill to be clear on that point, and the purpose of the amendments is simply to provide that clarity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="81027-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08102743000057">Amendment No. 155 also relates to a power in the Bill for the Secretary of State to make secondary legislation. Clause 86 allows the Secretary of State to make secondary legislation containing consequential, transitional or supplementary provisions. Those would support the changes to transport governance arrangements in individual areas of the country that he could make under clauses 78 to 84.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="81027-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08102743000058">As I explained to hon. Members earlier, the Bill allows flexibility for different governance arrangements to be put in place in different areas, and for changes to be made to existing arrangements.

arrangements to make incidental or consequential changes to other legislation. For example, and to help the House, if an ITA decides that it wants to make changes to the structure and functions of its executive body&#151;its passenger transport executive&#151;it will probably be necessary to make consequential changes to the Transport Act 1968, in which the structure and functions of PTEs are set out.</p>

 If I may, I shall move the Minister ahead a little.

 En passant, in connection with the amendments, that is one thing that has been reflected on in the House in relation to my discussions about the Bill with Members over the past three weeks. I am more than happy to be able to meet a cross-party delegation to discuss the Humber bridge.</p>

Members will want to avoid losing the thread of what those powers require. They involve making different orders to reflect different governance arrangements. Were we to need to make, say, eight different orders covering eight different parts of the country, making eight sets of textual changes to various pieces of existing legislation, that would make matters extremely complex and difficult for legislators to understand in the future. Given that, we think it would be simpler for the Bill also to allow for modification of legislation, where that is more appropriate. Hence the proposal before us.</p>

Accordingly, they would like the Bill to include a power for the Welsh Ministers not only to appoint such persons, but to pay them for their services. The new clauses and amendments constitute a direct response to that request, and confer on the Welsh Ministers a power equivalent to the one that clause 18, as amended in Committee, confers on the Secretary of State.</p>

The Bill has been further improved at each stage of its progress through the other place and through this House. I am grateful to Lord Bassam of Brighton and to Baroness Crawley for their careful stewardship of the Bill, and to all noble Lords who participated in the debates in the other place.

I emphasise how much we want these relationships to continue as we work to implement the Bill in the months ahead. I know that many have already contributed to the development of various draft regulations and guidance, and we look forward to further contributions from all those with an interest, within the House and beyond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o587"><a name="81027-0025.htm_para6"><a name="0810282000692">The Bill forms a crucial part of the Government&#146;s strategy to empower local authorities to improve public transport and to tackle congestion. Our priority is to reverse the downward trend of bus usage that we have seen outside London since the disastrous deregulation following the Transport Act 1985, as well as to put right the legacy of underinvestment that we inherited in 1997. This Bill, together with the Government&#146;s huge increases in public transport investment since 1997, is our response to local communities saying, &#147;Enough is enough&#148;, to worsening services and declining patronage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o588"><a name="81027-0025.htm_para7"><a name="0810282000693">Bus services are at the heart of public transport in Britain, with more than 5 billion journeys made each year&#151;two thirds of all public transport journeys. A reliable, high-quality public transport system makes a real difference to people in their everyday lives. People depend on buses to get to work, to the shops and to essential services such as schools and hospitals, and to visit their friends and family&#151;and it is often the most vulnerable in our society who depend on buses the most. With this Bill, we aim to move beyond the failed deregulation of the 1980s and to do more to provide the transport services that the public deserve. By devolving decisions to those who understand the needs and requirements of their local area, we are empowering local authorities to secure the services that people want: buses that go where people want to go and when they want to go there, buses that turn up when they are expected to, and buses that are clean and comfortable&#151;in short, an attractive and affordable alternative to the private car.</p>

However, we need to ensure that all our communities have the opportunity to make the same progress on transport as some are already enjoying. We also need to ensure that the governance arrangements in our major cities outside London, designed four decades ago, remain fit for purpose. This is why we have introduced this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o590"><a name="81027-0025.htm_para9"><a name="0810282000695">We have heard today, as we did at earlier stages of the Bill&#146;s progress, a range of views about how best to secure those changes.

The Bill is about empowering local areas and communities to take the decisions that are right for their areas. It is also about empowering individuals, particularly by providing for the creation of a statutory bus passenger champion to give passengers a stronger voice.</p>

 It is clear in the Bill what is meant by public interest.

That is an important part of the balance and compromise that lie at the heart of the most recent Government amendments.</p>

 I come from the city of Sheffield, where bus ridership has declined to a third of what it was before deregulation.

On climate change, there is a requirement for transport authorities to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State. Will my right hon. Friend ensure that authorities cannot get away with simply making that a tick-box exercise, and that there is a real requirement to deal with climate change? Would he consider asking local authorities to make an annual statement in their local transport plans about the progress they are making on this matter?</p>

Their resistance to the Bill&#146;s decentralising approach was at its most transparent in the debates on quality contracts, which the Opposition seem to rule out at all costs. Even where there is a demonstrable public interest case, they have argued that quality contracts schemes should not even be an option for local authorities, but they still have to say whether they would seek to abolish bus franchising in London.</p>

 The Secretary of State made an interesting speech. At least he recognised that the Opposition were entitled to scrutinise and criticise the measures that they considered. The Minister of State previously dealing with the Bill became somewhat hysterical about any clauses that we opposed either in Committee or on the Floor of the House. Indeed, the management of the Government&#146;s business has been such that the Opposition had no time to consider successfully, properly and democratically the amendments that the Government tabled. They tabled 162 amendments and 11 new clauses on 16 October. There was little business the next day, so few people saw them until the following Monday, thus granting less than a week to consider 162 amendments and 11 new clauses. On the last possible day, they tabled another phalanx&#151;three more amendments and another new clause.

<p><a name="st_o322"><a name="0810282000714"><a name="81027-0025.htm_spnew12"><a name="0810282001735"><b>Stephen Hammond:</b>
 The hon. Lady would do better to address those remarks to Labour Front Benchers, who gave us so little time to scrutinise those issues.</p>

<p><a name="st_o323"><a name="0810282000715"><a name="81027-0025.htm_spnew13"><a name="0810282001736"><b>Mr. Scott:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the British public will be mightily disappointed about how little time has been given to debate the important issue of road charging throughout our country?</p>

<p><a name="st_o324"><a name="0810282000716"><a name="81027-0025.htm_spnew14"><a name="0810282001737"><b>Stephen Hammond:</b>
 Indeed. The Government have performed U-turn after U-turn on national road pricing so that they are going round in circles. It was interesting that the Secretary of State refused to confirm whether the Government were prepared to use local road pricing as a Trojan horse for further stealth taxes. New clause 3 would have made it impossible for local government to impose local charging schemes without local validation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o597"><a name="81027-0025.htm_para16"><a name="0810282000717">We cannot support the quality contracts. We believe that the reregulation of the bus services for reasons of political dogma is not born out of any desire to improve services for the travelling public. Labour Members should remember that bus patronage has decreased consistently since the second world war. It fell most dramatically when bus services were regulated, not when they were deregulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o598"><a name="81027-0025.htm_para17"><a name="0810282000718">If the Government genuinely want to do something about the bus service, they must wake up and confront the problems that face the industry. Patronage is declining not because the bus service is deregulated but because people use their cars for short journeys, buses spend half their time stuck in traffic and passenger information  <br>

is poor. Throughout the country, partnerships are delivering better bus services for the travelling public. Clearly, if the Government had followed the partnership route, they would have had our support this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o599"><a name="81027-0025.htm_para18"><a name="0810282000719">As I have said several times before, the Bill is truly a curate&#146;s egg&#151;or should I say the son of the manse&#146;s egg?&#151;for it is good in parts, but fatally flawed in others. It is because of those flaws that I shall ask my colleagues to vote against it on Third Reading.</p>

 I am delighted to have secured tonight&#146;s Adjournment debate, in which I will highlight the negative effect of repeated digging by utility companies on the structure of our roads and highways. It has become a particular problem in my constituency, becoming increasingly costly to both the local authorities covering the Denton and Reddish area&#151;Tameside and Stockport metropolitan borough councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o609"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para8"><a name="0810282001196">Indeed, so bad is the situation that Tameside council has launched a campaign, &#147;restore the roads&#148;, which the borough&#146;s three MPs are supporting to highlight the problem. Tameside council believes that our roads should be dug up only once in any year by the utility companies&#151;very different from the 8,000 separate diggings that the borough had to suffer last year alone from a potential 106 different firms, all in a borough with only 442 miles of road! This continued work can lead to an unsightly patchwork effect of repair, which affects my constituents&#146; everyday movements and quality of life. Basically, the law needs to be changed to allow for the full cost of restoration of the whole length of road by the body that carries out any digging, and for full ownership restoration of the roads with absolute permission being required from the council to carry out any digging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o610"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para9"><a name="0810282001197">Over recent years, the growth in the economy, the introduction of competition into utility services and increasing customer demand for essential services have brought with them increasing numbers of excavations in the streets in order to supply these services. That increase brings with it the increased potential for conflict between the utility contractors, which have the statutory rights to use the streets for provision of essential services, the highway authorities, and others who maintain them, and those who use the streets for transport purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o611"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para10"><a name="0810282001199">To address those issues, the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991&#151;or NRASWA, as the engineers like to call it&#151;provided a legislative framework for street and highway works, and it is supported by regulations and codes of practice. A number of measures have already been introduced to encourage improvements in the planning and execution of street works, and to help to minimise disruption, notably a scheme under section 74 of the Act to charge undertakers who fail to complete works within the time scales agreed between them and the highway authority. Additionally, the Act lays down standards for backfilling and reinstatements, as well as guarantee periods for maintenance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o612"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para11"><a name="0810282001200">Part 4 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 was introduced in April 2008 and has supplemented NRASWA, giving highway authorities more power to control and direct promoters of works effectively, with the aim of minimising disruption. Under the 2004 Act, there is provision to operate a permit scheme. Permits apply equally to activities carried out by highway authorities and utility companies, although highway authorities will not pay a fee. A permit will be required for every opening in the highway, and that will replace the system of noticing. Discussions are taking place on the way forward for operating a common permit scheme across the county of Greater Manchester.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o613"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para12"><a name="0810282001201">The Act also has provisions for issuing fixed penalty notices for failure to provide notices or for giving inadequate or incorrect information on notices. Utility organisations are required by legislation to notify the authority of programmed works with realistic start and end dates, determined by type of work to be undertaken. Records of utility openings are kept, which monitor the time works are ongoing. Again, regular and systematic checking takes place to ensure that the works do not overrun the specific notice times permitted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o614"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para13"><a name="0810282001202">The implementation of section 74 of NRASWA enables works to be better planned and provides better information for street authorities to plan their inspections and co-ordinate works. Those notices contain the actual start date, the agreed duration and the completion date of the works. The council can charge utilities that overrun the agreed completion date, in accordance with laid out rules. However, with more and more excavations taking place, roads and footways are still becoming a patchwork of unsightly scars on the highway, leading to increased complaints and poor public perception of local authority management of its assets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o615"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para14"><a name="0810282001203">One such example is Oldham road, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (David Heyes), which is a significant route.</p>

<p><a name="st_o327"><a name="0810282001204"><a name="81027-0026.htm_spnew1"><a name="0810282002200"><b>David Heyes (Ashton-under-Lyne) (Lab):</b>
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for mentioning Oldham road in my constituency, as it is possibly the worst example in relation to the general point he is making. He would agree that Tameside is an excellent local authority&#151;probably the best&#151;but it is constantly frustrated in its endeavours to maintain the roads and footways to a high standard. Oldham road is a good example of that. In preparation for it becoming a quality bus corridor, the road surface was reconstructed. Within weeks, the utilities arrived and the pneumatic drills got to work. In next to no time, that splendid new road was pockmarked and potholed because of inadequate reinstatement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o616"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para15"><a name="0810282001205">Does my hon. Friend agree that that causes long-term and expensive damage, and that it is time that local authorities such as ours were given powers to re-charge utilities with the true cost of putting right this long-term damage to the integrity of our roads?</p>

<p><a name="st_o328"><a name="0810282001206"><a name="81027-0026.htm_spnew2"><a name="0810282002201"><b>Andrew Gwynne:</b>
 I agree absolutely. My hon. Friend makes an excellent case about Oldham road in his constituency. Similarly, just 12 months ago, extensive repaving&#151;much of it modular block paving and carriageway resurfacing&#151;took place in Denton town centre in my constituency. A year on, it is set to be ripped up by utility companies seeking to do extensive and major maintenance work, which they say was not programmed when the council contacted them 12 months ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o617"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para16"><a name="0810282001207">Looking at some of the poor reinstatements across the borough, it is clear that long-term damage is caused by the street works, as my hon. Friend rightly says. The number of reinstatements in the highway is increasingly affecting both the appearance and quality of road and footpath surfaces in Tameside. Moreover, the premature maintenance required as a result of the structural and environmental damage caused by the deterioration of reinstatements is placing additional pressure on already stretched highway maintenance budgets. There is increasing public dissatisfaction with what must be described as a deteriorating situation.</p>

 I am glad that my hon. Friend has secured a debate that is timely for, in particular, constituents of mine who have battled home through the roadworks of Brighton and Hove. I have been courteously kept informed by the utility companies, and have become involved in discussions with Tory-led Brighton and Hove city council. However, over the past year&#151;while the current council has been in office&#151;the roadworks have multiplied, and there are few issues about which I have received more complaints.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o618"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para17"><a name="0810282001209">The roadworks increase pollution and decrease the quality of life, and I am concerned about their effect on the economy of Brighton and Hove. Does my hon. Friend agree that we need joined-up thinking from the councils before they give permission for otherwise worthy roadworks?</p>

<p><a name="st_o330"><a name="0810282001210"><a name="81027-0026.htm_spnew4"><a name="0810282002203"><b>Andrew Gwynne:</b>
 I entirely agree. In the case of Oldham road and Denton town centre, the council approached the utility companies, which said that they had no such works planned for the area. They recently ripped them up. However, I take my hon. Friend&#146;s point about Brighton and Hove council, and I am sure that that is common practice throughout the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o619"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para18"><a name="0810282001211">Proper reinstatement will restore the actual area that has been excavated, but I think it is commonly accepted that there is consequential structural damage to adjacent areas. There is also some evidence to suggest that reinstated areas display more surface defects, which in turn will allow further deterioration of the structure of the highway itself. Current legislation does not deal with the damage caused to the integrity of the highway. As things stand, the utility companies continually get away with it. They have to pay only for the part of the road that they dig up, and the council must pay for the rest to rectify the damage. That is very unfair to council tax payers and the community at large. Not only are many of the utility diggers ripping off the community with the excessive charges; they are ripping up our roads, and the community must pay again for a full restoration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o620"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para19"><a name="0810282001212">Recent research undertaken by Tameside council has shown that between 20 and 30 per cent. of inspected jobs are found to be defective in regard to health and safety, guarding issues, reinstatements causing danger, and non-adherence to specifications determined by road category. All those defects are monitored by the council&#146;s streetworks inspectors, and defects are corrected. Recent core sampling&#151;checks on specifications after expiry of guarantee periods&#151;has also indicated that 30 per cent. of jobs failed inspection, and would require utility organisations to return and rectify the problems. Those works will cause additional disruption to road users. Furthermore, the opening of trenches will have a significant negative public impact on Tameside as an &#147;attractive borough&#148;, and will cause disruption and congestion to all users of the network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o621"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para20"><a name="0810282001213">The Minister will be interested to know that Tameside council has also calculated how much the work is costing it. Following detailed examination of Tameside's road network and condition, figures have been determined, subject to final verification. It has been calculated that the current gross replacement cost for carriageways and footways is &#163;620 million. Tameside has established through its transport asset management plan that the improvement investment&#151;that is, backlog maintenance&#151;required is in the region of &#163;27 million for carriageways and &#163;10 million for footways, a total of &#163;37 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o622"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para21"><a name="0810282001214">It could be argued that if it is accepted that utility organisations reduce the life of the road by 30 per cent. as a direct result of utility openings, the local tax payer is contributing some &#163;11 million as a direct result of the long-term damage caused to the local highway network by utility openings. That is &#163;11 million diverted from schools, libraries and services for pensioners in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o623"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para22"><a name="0810282001215">It is high time that the utilities footed their fair share of the bill. I do not believe that they pay the real costs of the damage that they cause; in my view, they pay only part of it. However, there are a number of remedies that we could suggest to the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o624"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para23"><a name="0810282001216">Utility openings create disruption and are difficult to manage and control, despite legislation and authority efforts to co-ordinate works. They contribute significantly to the expected&#151;reduced&#151;life of the highway and ultimately affect life-cycle plans for planned repairs, creating disproportionate demand on reactive spend levels, which is ultimately borne by the local taxpayer. It is impossible for local authorities to inspect all the openings at each stage and, as I have said, about 30 per cent. of inspections reveal defects and/or issues to be resolved. Recharges, made in line with legislation, allow costs to be recovered, but do not cover disruption or address long-term damage issues, so we need a change in the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o625"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para24"><a name="0810282001217">There are a number of possible remedies, such as full width reinstatements under law. The Secretary of State has powers under section 78 of NRASWA to enable there to be a financial contribution by the utility organisations for the effects of long-term damage. However, this section of the Act has never been enacted. To help alleviate these issues, Tameside council has already tried to persuade companies to undertake full width construction at some locations. Although it has been successful in part, it has no powers to enforce this, and can only use a persuasive approach to achieve the objective. This should now be a legal requirement that makes the utility companies fully reinstate the roads. I believe it is now time for that part of NRASWA to be enacted, making the utility companies pay the full price for their works. I urge the Minister to consider enabling this part of the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o626"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para25"><a name="0810282001218">This situation needs to be addressed. It cannot be fair for local people to be so regularly inconvenienced by road works, and for Stockport, Tameside and many other local authorities to have to pay for the structural damage caused by the utility companies. The utility companies made millions of pounds last year and can well afford to put right all the damage they have caused to local roads and highways. The estimated &#163;11 million price tag should not be borne by the local council tax payers as it takes money away from valuable services. We urgently need a change in the law to make utility companies legally responsible for the very real damage they cause to our roads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o627"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para26"><a name="0810282001220">Roads are the vital arteries of modern life. Not only do they allow roads users to travel to their destinations or deliver goods or services, they allow utility companies to provide the energy, water and telecommunications that we have come to expect as part of modern life. We expect them to be available all day, every day. This level of availability&#151;99.9 per cent. of the time&#151;is not easy to achieve. It requires utility companies to maintain, replace or upgrade their infrastructure to ensure this reliability and continuity of supply, as well as to repair and restore supply when it fails. This is not easy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o628"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para27"><a name="0810282001221">One penalty of being the first industrialised nation is that our infrastructure is older than that of most other countries. In London, up to 50 per cent. of the water mains are more than 100 years old and, astonishingly, 30 per cent. are more than 150 years old. London is not unique; many other parts of the country, such as Greater Manchester, have water and sewer mains that are more than 100 years old. This is not only the case for water. Gas mains are frequently more than 100 years old, and the majority are more than 50 years old. The majority of electricity mains cables are more than 50 years old, as are some telephone cables.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o629"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para28"><a name="0810282001222">Given the age of much of this apparatus, it needs to be replaced, or, given growing demand, upgraded. This is not always easy on our busy modern roads. The New Roads and Street Works Act 1991&#151;or NRASWA, as my hon. Friend catchily calls it&#151;requires local authorities to co-ordinate all works on the highway to minimise the inconvenience to road users, promote safety and protect the street. Statutory undertakers such as utility companies have to co-operate with local authorities and each other. The 1991 Act also requires utilities to notify works, carry them out safely and reinstate them properly so that the highway can be returned to use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o630"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para29"><a name="0810282001223">In April this year, we brought in stronger powers for local authorities to co-ordinate works. They include longer periods of notice for major works to allow better co-ordination, clearer powers on directing when works can or cannot take place and longer restrictions on works by utility companies following roadworks&#151;up to five years following major reconstructions and up to three years following resurfacing. All other substantial roadworks may be followed by a 12-month restriction. The powers also include the fact that a highway authority may now impose a restriction following major works by a utility company, restricting further work on the street by any utility company for up to 12 months. Fixed penalties for certain offences, mainly the failure to provide timely and accurate notices, have been available to authorities since May as an alternative to prosecution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o631"><a name="81027-0026.htm_para30"><a name="0810282001224">The Traffic Management Act 2004 also provided new powers for authorities to operate a permit scheme that allows them to control works in the highway proactively, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State. Permit schemes apply to the highway authority&#146;s own works as well as to those by utility companies. There have already been consultations on two such schemes, the London common permit scheme and the Kent permit scheme. The Department received applications for the London common scheme from 14 London boroughs and Transport for London in July. No decisions have been made on the current applications.</p>

charges&#151;when their works take longer than agreed. That has resulted in better estimates from utility companies of the duration of works, which in turn increases authorities&#146; ability to co-ordinate works and helps them to comply with their network management duty. The co-ordination code of practice, published by the DFT as statutory guidance in July 2007, stressed the importance of co-ordination for longer-term planned works anything up to five years away, but more usually two years away. That allows authorities and utility companies to adjust the timing of works so that utility works take place before a road is resurfaced by an authority, or so that road closures can be shared.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o633"><a name="81027-0027.htm_para1"><a name="0810282001226">The 2004 Act placed a network management duty on local authorities, requiring them to do all that is reasonably practicable to manage the network effectively and keep traffic moving. That statutory duty reflects the importance placed on making best use of existing road space for the benefit of all road users. That strengthens the need for co-ordination of works, so that the same street does not have a series of works by different utility companies or the local authority over an extended period. Authorities and utility companies are encouraged to co-ordinate works where possible, so that they can share traffic management such as temporary traffic lights or one-way operations, even if the works are not in the same trench.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o634"><a name="81027-0027.htm_para2"><a name="0810282001227">However, emergency repairs will always be needed for burst water or gas mains or to ensure that supply is restored to households and/or businesses. In Staffordshire, the highway authority has worked with utility companies and its own highways management team to co-ordinate works that, if carried out separately, would take many weeks. It is succeeding in reducing the time for which the highway is occupied. One example, on the A449, involved a gas main replacement and major resurfacing. If carried out as separate works they would have lasted 25 weeks. Instead, all work was completed in 12 weeks, with traffic management, temporary signals and one-way closure organised to maximise traffic flow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o635"><a name="81027-0027.htm_para3"><a name="0810282001228">Similarly, in London, Bishopsgate, a vital artery in the City, was closed for a weekend in March to allow a bridge for the East London line to be lowered into place. Transport for London used the opportunity to allow 10 different works promoters to carry out works at 25 separate sites in Bishopsgate. That removed any impact on weekday traffic that several separate works would have had.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o636"><a name="81027-0027.htm_para4"><a name="0810282001229">Utility companies are required to make good or reinstate the highway after they have carried out works. When possible, they are encouraged to do that immediately after the works, which is known as first-time reinstatement. If that is not possible, due to inappropriate weather conditions for materials to set or the unavailability of specialist finishes, the utility company can make a temporary or interim reinstatement to allow the highway to be safely returned to use as quickly as possible. The permanent reinstatement is then carried out within six months. Local authorities can carry out inspections to ensure that sites are safely laid out and that the reinstatement is to the appropriate standard immediately after it has been done and is still adequate two years later, just before the guarantee expires.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o637"><a name="81027-0027.htm_para5"><a name="0810282001230">Utility companies are investing in developing innovative ways of working to minimise the amount of excavation that needs to take place or reduce the duration of works when they are maintaining or upgrading apparatus.

instance, gas and water companies are placing plastic pipes inside existing pipes rather than excavating a trench along the entire length of the mains. The most important thing is that the reinstatement is suitable for the level of traffic using the road and that deterioration does not take place. The 2004 Act provides new powers for local authorities to require those undertaking the work, such as utility companies, to resurface a street following works, but those powers have not yet been commenced. Their implementation will require new affirmative regulations and a statutory code of practice on how the powers can be exercised. Discussion with key stakeholders, especially local authorities and utility companies, will need to focus on the circumstance in which the powers could be exercised by local authorities; the extent of resurfacing that would be appropriate; whether a requirement to resurface a particular street could be placed on several utility companies; whether a financial payment could be made instead of resurfacing, and how that would be calculated; and when and how local authorities contribute to the cost of resurfacing by a utility company.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o638"><a name="81027-0027.htm_para6"><a name="0810282001231">Careful consideration needs to be given to how the provisions in the 2004 Act should be delivered to ensure that there are no unintended consequences that adversely impact on either the travelling public or the customers of the utility companies. We prioritised our 2004 Act programme after we listened carefully to the views of our key stakeholders, who are, as I have mentioned, the local authorities, utility companies and their contractors. We keep in close touch with our stakeholders&#146; opinions and if they have a strong view that we need to change our priorities, we will take that into account.</p>

are revising the inspections regime&#151;to ensure the safety of works and the quality of reinstatement&#151;the safety code of practice and how records of buried assets are recorded and shared with others. Those important areas of work have been given priority, as inspections will help to ensure that works are carried out to the appropriate standard and improved records of buried assets will ensure that excavations are carried out in the right place and that the risk of damage to other people&#146;s assets is minimised, along with the risk to workers and the general public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o640"><a name="81027-0027.htm_para8"><a name="0810282001233">Department for Transport officials continue to work closely with the local authorities, utility companies and others to ensure that the regulations and statutory guidance are proportionate and practical.
