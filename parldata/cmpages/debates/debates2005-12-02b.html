 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Can you help me? Yesterday, at business questions, the Deputy Leader of the House stated that there would be no opportunity to debate the police restructuring proposals before Christmas, yet on Wednesday the Home Secretary, when challenged at a regional newspapers lunch by Ian Mean, the editor of <i>The Citizen</i>, said that the House would have three opportunities before the Christmas recess to debate those proposals. I have written to the Home Secretary but have not yet had a reply, and I gave his office notice that I would raise this point of order.

<a name="stpa_5">I want to explain why we need a change in the law. The law is not clear and we need a deterrent to show burglars why they will meet more force and resistance than may have been the case hitherto. Undoubtedly, fear of crime, and of burglary in particular, is increasing and the violence used by burglars is increasing, too. Only this week, on 30&nbsp;November, <i>The</i> <i>Birmingham Post</i> reported that a shop assistant had been shot twice in the face during a robbery in Birmingham and that he could lose his eye. The report stated that the father of two, Imran Shah, who is only 21&nbsp;years old

 My hon. Friend may remember that about three years ago in my store in Swansea I confronted a shoplifter who attacked me.

Is not the problem in such cases that when someone is confronted by a burglar the last thing that they should be thinking 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Dec 2005 : Column 500</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>about is whether they will end up in court? They need to protect themselves, and the Bill will allow them to do that.

 Order. The hon. Lady is not giving way at the moment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_22"><a name="51202-02_spnew0"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 When we consider recent case law we can see that the reasonable force defence is not satisfactory. The case of Tony Martin captured public imagination. Most of us would prefer, if we were being burgled, to phone the police and receive, as we would expect, a prompt response. However, as we have just heard in points of order, we are faced with a restructuring of the police force and in areas such as North Yorkshire and Norfolk we shall undoubtedly lose our rural police forces, as officers will be asked to serve in urban areas on anti-terrorist or security duties and will have even less time to attend to burglaries. People such as Tony Martin will thus regrettably be faced with the prospect of having to take the law into their own hands.
</p>








<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51202-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Henry Bellingham  (North-West Norfolk) (Con):</b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on bringing forward this excellent Bill. She rightly mentions the case of my constituent, Tony Martin, who was driven to desperation due to the lack of a police response. He should not have been charged with murder; I feel strongly that when burglars break into a house they should leave their rights outside, except in the most extreme circumstances. Does my hon. Friend agree that the Tony Martin case has sparked a huge national debate and that there is a large amount of public support for her measure? Why are the Government not listening to her and supporting her Bill?
</p>








<p><a name="st_24"><a name="51202-02_spnew2"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Perhaps we shall all get a surprise this morning and find that the Government are willing to support my reasonable proposals.

<a name="51202-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_8">The Tony Martin case captured public imagination. Regrettably, however, a threshold was crossed and the burglar was fleeing the building, possibly not with stolen property&#151;that could not be proved&#151;and Tony Martin ceased to be acting in self-defence and was an aggressor. The modest provisions in my short three-clause Bill set out precisely where grossly disproportionate force would kick in.
</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51202-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Peter Bone  (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> 
 Let me cite an example of something that happened to my family. My wife returned home one day to find burglars in the house. If she had set the dog on them, would she have been safe under the Bill? If she had done that and a burglar had been injured terribly, I am not sure whether she could have been charged under the current law.
</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="51202-02_spnew4"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 We would rely on the courts to decide what grossly disproportionate force would be.

 Will the hon. Lady give way?

 May I make some progress?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-02_para1">
<a name="stpa_9">I wish to cite two recent cases that demonstrate how the criminal justice system is failing the victim&#151;the home owner and the property owner. Persistent offenders can be released early and then go on to commit burglaries, which can lead to the death of innocent victims, as these cases show. Marian Bates was innocently going about her business as a jeweller in her shop in Nottingham. The persistent offender in that case was let out on licence. He was meant to be tagged and under the supervision of a security firm, but he released himself from the tag and went on, with tragic consequences, to commit a horrendous burglary during which he murdered Marian Bates. The case of John Monckton was equally tragic. It is a matter of fact that the main perpetrator in that case had been released after serving only seven years of his 12-year sentence for attempted murder.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-02_para2">
<a name="stpa_10">The people of England feel badly let down by the Government not only because the police are not in a position to attend burglaries as quickly as would be liked, especially in rural areas, but because it is perceived that burglaries are on the increase. When burglaries do occur, they are virtually risk-free because there is little chance of a burglar being detected, prosecuted or convicted.
</p>








<p><a name="st_29"><a name="51202-02_spnew7"><b> Nick Herbert  (Arundel and South Downs) (Con):</b> 
 I fully support my hon. Friend&#039;s attempt to change the law on the use of reasonable force against people who are found in others&#039; homes. Given the inadequacy of the law and the prevalence of burglary that she describes, may I draw her attention to the case of one of my constituents? He woke one early morning to find two people in his house and chased them off. When the case went to court, those people offered the defence that they had been in the house looking for their cat. Incredibly, the case fell because of lack of evidence that they had the intent to steal. Is it not absurd that they were able to offer that defence? Should not the law be changed 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>








<p><a name="st_30"><a name="51202-02_spnew8"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a valid point and echoes the sentiments expressed by the former Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir John Stevens.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-02_para3">
<a name="stpa_11">Against the background of an increase in violence, we need a recognition that the concept of reasonable force is simply not understood. When the Crown Prosecution Service guidelines were issued earlier this year, Sir Ian Blair said that for a person faced with an intruder in their home at 4&nbsp;am, the concept of reasonable force is difficult to understand, yet the concept of grossly disproportionate force would be more obvious.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-02_para4">
<a name="stpa_12">We are not asking for the Oklahoma law and we are not saying that anything goes. However, people should not be prosecuted for force that is less than excessive or grossly disproportionate. The Government used that test when they introduced a provision in the Criminal Justice Act 2003&nbsp;to allow burglars to sue home owners or property owners for damages if they had been subjected to such force. I argue strongly that the same test should apply under criminal and civil law.
</p>








<p><a name="st_31"><a name="51202-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering) (Con):</b> 
 Constituents in Kettering are fully behind my hon. Friend&#039;s reasonable proposals because in Nottingham, as recent Home Office figures show, there is a rising fear of crime and a worryingly low burglary detection rate. Local people want extra protection against criminals.
</p>








<p><a name="st_32"><a name="51202-02_spnew10"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend.

</ul>

</p>

<a name="stpa_14">but that could cover a multitude of things, some of which could well lead to the death of an intruder. However, under the heading &quot;Will you believe the intruder rather than me?&quot;, the guidelines say:

<a name="stpa_15">It is still the case that an innocent victim will be subject to a police investigation and thus public attention.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that burglars are well aware of their rights before they commit a burglary? If the Bill is passed, it will send a strong message to all burglars. Does she have any evidence that some people might not have committed burglaries if the terms of the Bill had been in place?
</p>








<p><a name="st_34"><a name="51202-02_spnew12"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 I hope that we can examine that matter in Committee. My hon. Friend is right that most burglaries that were examined in the context of the Bill were not opportunistic, but well thought out and designed for a specific purpose.

<p>
<a name="51202-02_para8">
<a name="stpa_16">Let me move on to the definitions in the Bill. I paid tribute earlier to my hon. Friends the Members for North Thanet and for Newark. My Bill is different from their Bills, and especially the Bill that was introduced earlier this year by my hon. Friend the Member for

<br>&nbsp;<br>Newark, because it would extend to all properties, both commercial properties and homes. It is interesting to note that the Bill enjoys the considerable support of members of the Federation of Small Businesses and members of the National Neighbourhood Watch Association. I was staggered to discover that Federation of Small Businesses statistics show that 58&nbsp;per cent. of small firms are the victims of crime each year. I wanted to take account of excellent points made in the Standing Committee that considered the Bill of my hon. Friend the Member for Newark. It would be wrong to limit the Bill&#039;s provisions purely and simply to homes, so I want to extend it to all properties, including commercial properties, such as shops and retail premises.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-02_para9">
<a name="stpa_17">As my hon. Friend the Member for Newark recognised, we want a threshold for when prosecutions should be brought. I thus argue that no prosecution should be brought against a person without the permission of the Attorney-General. In preparation for the Committee stage of the Bill introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Newark, the flawed trawl of the Crown Prosecution Service found that there had been 26&nbsp;cases in a 15-month period, of which 11&nbsp;had been brought to prosecution. The measure in my Bill would dramatically limit future prosecutions.

<p>
<a name="51202-02_para10">
<a name="stpa_18">Clause 1&nbsp;would amend the Criminal Law Act 1967. Proposed new section 3(1C) says:

</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-02_para11">
<a name="stpa_19">The Bill thus covers all buildings, homes, commercial vehicles and vessels. It is worth considering the provisions of the Theft Act 1968&nbsp;because it makes the good point that the offence of burglary is a serious crime that involves not only a threat to property, but a threat to the privacy of one&#039;s own home. That factor differentiates the offence from simple theft. Over time, the offence has been understood to cover a dwelling place and to encompass any building. Under the Theft Act, someone is guilty of burglary if

<br>&nbsp;<br>lead to even greater support for the Bill. I asked the Home Office for the level of burglary detection in each of the past eight years. Incredibly, it has fallen dramatically. When the Conservatives left government in 1997, 23&nbsp;per cent. of burglaries were detected by the police in England and Wales. As of 2001&#150;02, that rate had reduced to 12&nbsp;per cent., and the detection rates for offences of burglary recorded by the police in England and Wales was only 13&nbsp;per cent. in 2004. Right hon. and hon. Members will know that many people who report burglaries, particularly of vehicles, are simply given a police number. Those burglaries are not investigated or detected, so the offenders are never brought to book. Even more worryingly, only 3.6&nbsp;per cent. of defendants were convicted of burglary in the courts in 2004&#150;05. In the same year, only 1.6&nbsp;per cent. of defendants were sentenced to immediate custody or given a custodial sentence for burglary.

<a name="51202-03_para0">
<a name="stpa_22">What message are we as legislators giving victims and, indeed, potential burglars other than suggesting that burglary is completely risk-free? To receive a criminal sentence and be designated a criminal someone must be accused, and their crime must be detected, recorded and prosecuted. The figures show that that is simply not happening. In clause 2, I seek to extend the provisions of the Bill to Northern Ireland, and I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Newark, because when his Bill was in Committee he said that such measures should be relevant to Northern Ireland as well as to England and Wales. I would like the provisions of my Bill to extend to Scotland, as I am qualified as a Scottish advocate, albeit a non-practising one. I hope to pursue that proposal if I am fortunate enough to see my Bill proceed to Committee. Under proposed new subsection (1A), a property owner is not guilty of an offence unless they use &quot;grossly disproportionate&quot; force and unless the excessive nature of that force is apparent to them.

 My hon. Friend has been listening closely, as the Criminal Justice Act 2003&nbsp;sets out the test for an offence to be grossly disproportionate. The Government had to revisit the issue in the light of the claim by Brendan Fearon against Tony Martin in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk. Brendan Fearon was granted legal aid, reportedly to claim compensation of &#163;15,000&nbsp;for the injuries that he received. I am delighted that in September 2003&nbsp;the case was settled out of court when Brendan Fearon dropped his claim and Tony Martin therefore dropped his counter-claim. Such cases make a mockery of the law. I am arguing, with the support of my hon. Friends, that we need a consistent test. Burglars should not be able to sue us for damages that we may inflict on them when they intrude and trespass on our property and commit a criminal act so, under the Bill, there is a higher test of grossly proportionate force for the householder.

<a name="stpa_23">The arguments for the Bill are forceful. Burglary is virtually risk-free, and detection rates are at a 25-year low. Fewer than one in seven burglaries are cleared up by the police. Only three in 100&nbsp;burglaries result in conviction. Public fear of crime in general and burglary in particular has increased, yet police in rural areas are severely stretched. My right hon.

 Initially, I shall ask some of the questions that the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh) did not allow me to put during her own presentation. The first is that the crucial distinction made by her Bill by comparison with the current state of affairs is to replace the test of reasonableness with the test of gross disproportionality. She was asked by the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone), who left the Chamber immediately afterwards, what would happen if his wife set the dog on an intruder. The hon. Lady responded&#151;with respect to her&#151;evasively, saying that that was a matter for the courts to decide. Is that not a classic example of the state of uncertainty, about which she and her hon. Friends complain, in the current situation?

<a name="51202-03_para3">
<a name="stpa_25">At present, if the hon. Lady were to break into my house and I had to decide how far I could deter her, I would have to consider what would be deemed reasonable. Under her Bill, I would have to consider what was grossly disproportionate. It is possible to imagine situations where behaviour is unreasonable but not grossly disproportionate, or cases where it is grossly disproportionate but not unreasonable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-03_para4">
<a name="stpa_26">Let us take, for example, the case of the British tourist who, in one of the southern states of America, one dark night got lost. He went up the path to a remote house and wanted to ask the way. As he approached, the nervous householder, who I believe had been burgled several times, thought he was another intruder and shot the tourist dead. We could all agree that that was grossly disproportionate&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Some of us would.&quot;] Unlike the hon. Lady, I shall be glad to give way if she wishes to intervene, but I hope she would agree that that was grossly disproportionate.
</p>

<a name="51202-03_para5">
<a name="stpa_27">Could we also say that that was unreasonable? Looking at the case, at least through British eyes, we would say, yes, it was unreasonable. But suppose the householder had not shot the tourist dead, but merely wounded him. An American court, and, I submit, a British court might in that case have said, &quot;Well, this is grossly disproportionate&#151;using a firearm to attack somebody who has not yet done anything worse than walk up the drive&#151;but is it unreasonable?&quot; One could argue that with a history of burglaries, it is understandable if the householder feels nervous.

<a name="stpa_28">Here we have a case where the householder would be prosecuted under the hon. Lady&#039;s Bill, but not under the current law.

 That is right. The Tony Martin case is useful because it illustrates one element of the grey area. We all agree that Tony Martin used excessive, grossly disproportionate force, and we disagree with a number of members of the general public, which is perhaps because the general public have not studied all the aspects of the case. For example, some members of the general public are not aware that the person who was shot was fleeing at the time, and they are not aware, as I understand it, that Mr. Martin left that person to die before calling the emergency services. Those elements clearly influenced the jury to convict Tony Martin. We must avoid going too far up the side alley of the Martin case, because as my hon.

 Despite the citing of several examples of violence, we are primarily discussing not violent crime but burglary. Under every form of measurement, the incidence of burglary has been falling since 1995. To make a non-partisan point, it started to fall under the

 Is not the intervention by the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) a classic example of leading people astray in a partisan way? Aggravated burglary&#151;that is, where the burglar has a weapon&#151;accounts for less than 1&nbsp;per cent. of burglaries. Furthermore, the chance of someone being burgled is at its lowest point for 20&nbsp;years.
</p>








<p><a name="st_82"><a name="51202-05_spnew14"><b> Dr. Palmer: </b> 
 Yes, that is right. It is not a question of reported crime. It is generally accepted that burglary is usually reported, if only to get a crime number for insurance purposes. We are comparing like with like&#151;police statistics with police statistics and the recorded crime survey with the equivalent survey. If we are having a serious discussion, we should accept that burglary is becoming less common. That is not only because of Government action, although that has a great deal to do with it, but because people are getting better at ordering their security&#151;alarm systems and so on. It is also because some criminal gangs are diversifying into activities such as smuggling where the pay-off is higher and the risk is lower.

 It is asserted that the figures are inaccurate because fewer crimes are reported. What about the British crime survey, which asks people about their actual experiences and so gives a more accurate picture of crime levels and trends across the country? Even according to that survey, the number of burglaries is the lowest for 20&nbsp;years and aggravated burglaries represent less than 1&nbsp;per cent. of all burglaries.

We all have constituents who complain that youths whom they do not know have wandered into their garden. They are worried by it because they do not know what those youths, who have perhaps kicked a football over the wall or are just being insolent, have in mind.

<a name="stpa_37">Let us consider what that means. For example, if a 14-year-old were to wander into the garden of a householder who had a history of being aggravated by local kids, and who then assaulted the child and bundled him off the premises, causing him bruising and minor injuries, would that be seen as grossly disproportionate? I am not sure that it would. Under the present law, it would certainly be seen as unreasonable, because it is unreasonable for someone to use force against a person who has merely strayed on to their property, unless they have first asked them to leave and taken all reasonable steps to get them to do so. Would it be grossly disproportionate? As a householder, I would have great difficulty in deciding whether it would be grossly disproportionate.

<p><a name="st_88"><a name="51202-06_spnew1"><b> Dr. Palmer: </b> 
 The hon. Lady makes a good point. If we changed the law in this way, we should be saying that it was okay to be disproportionate or unreasonable, so long as we were not grossly disproportionate. I would be very reluctant to anchor that principle in the law of Great Britain. The principle of reasonableness, which we apply to enormous swathes of the law, is very valuable. It has stood the test of time, and juries have traditionally interpreted it in a way that most of us would accept. If we were to move from the concept of what a reasonable person would do, and to adopt a concept of what a not-grossly-disproportionate person would do, I submit that we should be moving on to dangerous territory. We should be moving into the area of frontier law.

<a name="stpa_38">I hope that I am not misrepresenting the hon.

I assume that such measures would include the possession of some kind of weapon with which the householder could defend themselves in the event of what they saw as a dangerous intruder entering their property. That would say to people across the countryside, &quot;We encourage you to equip yourselves with weaponry, and, if you see someone who you believe to be an intruder, you can use those weapons on them so long as you are confident that a jury will not find that you have behaved in a grossly disproportionate manner.&quot; That would be dangerous in the extreme. I do not believe that the general public want it to be the norm in the British countryside for people to arm themselves in order to assault potential intruders. That is not where we want to go; it would lead to more trouble than we have at the moment.

<br>&nbsp;<br>introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale), my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York or myself that aims to aggravate the situations that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. That is precisely why we have included new subsection (1B).
</p>








<p><a name="st_90"><a name="51202-06_spnew3"><b> Dr. Palmer: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, which was, as always, measured and restrained. None the less, as the hon. Member for Vale of York said in her introduction, the Bill would be significant in the sense that it would send a message to householders. There are two possible messages that we could send. One is that nothing much has changed; we might have changed the wording a bit, but basically people are still in the same legal grey area as before, in that they will not know whether they are going to be prosecuted or not. I suggest that, if we send that message, people will be quite fed up with us. They will say that we just mess about and do not change anything.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_39">The other message that we could send is that people can take additional measures to arm or protect themselves against intruders. That is what people would understand by the Bill if it were passed. All the clarification in the world would not make a difference to that conclusion, and the result would leave the peace and quiet of the British countryside in a much worse position than it is today. There is a tradition in the British countryside, as I am sure the hon. Member for North Shropshire will confirm, that if someone gets lost or needs help, or if the weather turns unpleasant, they can go to a stranger&#039;s house and ask for assistance. People might be a little wary if they were to do that in central Nottingham&#151;&quot;Who is this stranger knocking on my door? What does he want?&quot;&#151;but the tradition still exists in the countryside. It would be a great pity if we were to tilt the balance away from that because of the increasingly rare cases of violent burglary. We must not put that balance at risk by starting what my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South referred to as a sort of arms race. We should not encourage householders to buy knives, to set traps, or to build barbed wire or electric fences in order to fight off intruders by themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_40">We all appreciate that people who choose to live in a remote area might be worried about the time that it can take for the police to respond when they are called. However, the measure proposed by the hon. Member for Vale of York would make no difference to the probability of conviction. It would instead risk sending a message that would be counterproductive to law in order in Britain. That is the fundamental risk that the Bill creates.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_41">If the Bill had been presented in a non-partisan way, I would merely have thought it a mistake. As it stands, however, it seems to me to be a mistake that has been made for political reasons. This subject deserves more serious treatment than it has so far received.

The two boys who went to try to burgle Tony Martin&#039;s farm both came from the crime-ridden estate of Hawtonville, in the north of my constituency. One of them, Brendon Fearon, survives today, despite having sustained gunshot wounds to his left buttock. The other, Fred Barras is, in my view quite wrongly, in his grave.

When it became clear to that excellent organ, the <i>Newark Advertiser,</i> that I was going to introduce my Bill, it went to interview Brendon Fearon. It knew quite well that he was certain to be found at the magistrates court, which is exactly where it found him. It put the case to him by saying, &quot;If our Member of Parliament manages to introduce this Bill, what effect would it have on you as a persistent offender?&quot; A number of Labour Members, from a sedentary position, have referred to the fact that if Conservative Members thought that criminals would be deterred, we were living in cloud cuckoo land.

Sadly, that proved to be incorrect. Much to my regret, the Bill was hijacked by politicians and turned into a party political issue, and I genuinely regret its proximity to the general election. We were robbed of a useful measure that would deter burglars, help and assist policemen, support householders and, most importantly, shift the balance from householders feeling that the law was against them to burglars and other intruders knowing that the law was against them. At the same time, we might achieve a lessening of the possibility of bloody affray either in shops or houses.

<a name="stpa_62">Being burgled is a frightening experience, and householders who react instinctively and attack intruders will be prosecuted under the existing law only if they use very excessive force. Only in the most extreme circumstances are householders prosecuted for violence against burglars. The Director of Public Prosecutions made it clear on 12&nbsp;January that prosecution would be considered only in those extreme circumstances. The law also takes account of the fact that a person under attack or being robbed may be frightened or confused. When they find an intruder at 3&nbsp;o&#039;clock in the morning, a person cannot be expected to judge to a nicety the level of force that might be required to defend themselves against the threat posed. The law quite simply asks that the person should act instinctively and honestly. We must be clear about that: the law, and every part of the criminal justice system, must, and do, support the right to self-defence.

<a name="stpa_64">We should not underestimate the emotional impact of burglary. In the British crime survey 2004&#150;05, 86&nbsp;per cent. of respondents were emotionally affected by burglary, and if there was forced entry, too, the figure was 89&nbsp;per cent. The responses experienced include: anger, at 56&nbsp;per cent. for all burglaries and 63&nbsp;per cent. for burglary with entry; annoyance, at 46&nbsp;per cent. and 51&nbsp;per cent. for burglary with entry; shock, for 36&nbsp;per cent. at burglary and 42&nbsp;per cent. at burglary with entry; and a loss of confidence or feeling of vulnerability, for 27&nbsp;per cent. and 30&nbsp;per cent.

<p><a name="st_143"><a name="51202-09_spnew11"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 Earlier on, Opposition Members were talking about the incidence of burglary. We must examine the true facts and figures. Burglary peaked in the mid-1990s. According to the British crime survey, domestic burglary from 1995&nbsp;to 2004&#150;05&nbsp;reduced by 57&nbsp;per cent. In 2003&#150;04&nbsp;to 2004&#150;05, British crime survey and police statistics showed that domestic burglary was down by 20&nbsp;per cent., and that non-domestic burglary was down by 14&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_69">The risk of being a victim of burglary has halved since 1995. On average, the chance of a burglary on a particular property is at its lowest for 20&nbsp;years. On average, a property is likely to be burgled once every 50&nbsp;years. In my constituency, in July, there were 45&nbsp;fewer residential burglaries than in the previous year, and there were 48&nbsp;per cent. more detections. That picks up the point made earlier about detection rates.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-09_para7">
<a name="stpa_70">We need to challenge some of the perceptions about the likely victims of burglary. We have heard a great deal about rural people and so forth. The people most likely to be victims of burglary are those aged between 16&nbsp;and 24. Those least likely to be victims are pensioners. The people most likely to be burgled are those with household incomes of below &#163;5,000. Those least likely have incomes of more than &#163;30,000. The most likely 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Dec 2005 : Column 525</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>victims are those in private rented property, closely followed by social renters. The least likely are owner-occupiers. The most likely are those who are unemployed or economically inactive. The most likely are those who live in flats and not detached houses. The most likely are those who live in urban areas, who are twice as likely to be a victim as those who live in rural areas, particularly people living on council estates. It is probably self-evident that those with high levels of home security are the least likely to be burgled as opposed to those who have no measures of home security. That starts to correct some of the perceptions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-09_para8">
<a name="stpa_71">We need to consider also the number of offences in which violence was used in a burglary. In all burglaries, that was about 9&nbsp;per cent. The prospect of being a victim of violence when a burglary is committed is very low. To an extent, Opposition Members have run a scare story to try to pretend that we are living in a crime-ridden country. In fact, the incidence of burglary is low, and the chance of being a victim of violence during a burglary is extremely low.

 One of my concerns about the Bill is that burglars, far from being deterred from breaking into people&#039;s houses, may arrive at the view that home owners are more likely to be arming themselves with guns and all the rest of it to defend themselves should they be burgled, and that they should arm themselves too. So if the Bill were to come into force, we may end up with an arms race and with more people being shot by burglars.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I hope to address that issue at greater length when I come to analyse the Bill. To go into more detail, rape can be part of a burglary.

<a name="stpa_78">I want to return to the risk of the escalation of violence if the burglar thinks that the householder is likely to have a firearm, knife, sword or other such weapon. In the last debate on this, there was a discussion of the merits of cricket bats and baseball equipment and I was pleased to note that my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North equipped himself with a cricket bat in good British tradition. The fact remains that, if householders are likely to have weapons of defence&#151;there is nothing in the Bill to prevent it&#151;burglars are more likely to be tooled up too and there will be an escalation of violence, or, as my hon.

<a name="stpa_79">The other risk is that burglars may go for softer targets. They may think it too risky to choose households where people are armed with swords or knives. They will be less likely to confront the firearm-owning toff but more likely to invade the home of the old lady living alone. The Bill would have a disproportionate effect: the lord in his castle armed with his shotgun would mean that the burglar would be more likely to carry firearms, while the old lady in the Burnt Oak estate in my constituency would be at more risk of being severely beaten by an intruder. She would not be in a position to defend herself, not because of the law, under this Bill or the previous one, but because she is frail and the burglar has switched his modus operandi because he is frightened of attacking wealthier homes, which, as the figures I gave earlier show, are less likely targets anyway.

 Does my hon. Friend accept that many burglars commit burglaries to fuel a drug habit? If a burglar is high on an illegal substance, the last thing they will do is sit down and analyse whether there is a deterrent, be it a baseball bat or whatever. They will commit the crime to fuel the drug habit. The Opposition&#039;s argument that the measure will be a deterrent is nonsense.

 My hon. Friend makes the point clearly. If someone is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, the mental faculties and the ability to discriminate between right and wrong are inevitably impaired.

If a burglar commits an offence while tooled up for violence, he is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life. The reason given by the criminal law revision committee for the creation of this offence is that burglary when in possession of the articles mentioned is so serious that it should be punishable with imprisonment for life.

The Bill is about property, not about people, which is one of its most serious weaknesses. The Bill proposed by the hon.

 My hon. Friend makes an entirely correct and very good point. Currently, if a shoplifter tries to leave the premises&#151;technically, they are committing a burglary under theft legislation&#151;the security guard can use reasonable force to detain them. In other words, if the shoplifter is trying to escape, the guard can grab hold of them and detain them, pending the arrival of the police. Under this Bill, if the shoplifter tried to escape there would be nothing to prevent them from being beaten half unconscious, simply because they had tried to walk out with stolen goods. Of course, the problem is even greater for people who leave the shop by mistake, having picked up an item and forgotten to pay for it. Such people may appear to be shoplifters, but in fact they have made a genuine mistake. By the time the mistake comes to light, however, they could be lying on the floor in a pool of blood.

Between the Oklahoma law&#039;s introduction in 1987&nbsp;and 2000, there was a 48.5&nbsp;per cent. fall in burglaries.

Friend quotes Lord Morris and refers implicitly to the subjective and objective test. Does he agree that the test of whether force used in self-defence is reasonable is largely objective? However, the last sentence of the quote from Lord Morris emphasises that there are subjective elements that would depend on a defendant&#039;s specific circumstances. That means that the safeguards that we all want are in the law at present, so the Bill is clearly redundant.

<p><a name="st_193"><a name="51202-13_spnew0"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point. He is right that when we consider self-defence, we have a mixed objective and subjective test. There is a slightly different test in the civil law, and I hope to refer to that shortly because the simple alignment of civil and criminal law is prayed in aid by those who support the Bill. However, the measure set out in the Bill is an objective test, so we are all over the place. Are we considering the mind of the person who commits an attack on the alleged criminal, the general reasonableness test, or a mixture of the two? The whole position will be very different depending on the circumstances in which an attack takes place.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that if those who support the Bill are serious about getting it on to the statute book, it is disappointing that such matters have not been clarified since the last time that the House considered such a measure?

<p><a name="st_195"><a name="51202-13_spnew2"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. A series of criticisms were made on Second Reading of the previous version of the Bill that was promoted by the hon. Member for Newark. I am surprised that the opportunity was not taken in the intervening period to get some of the tackle in order and produce a Bill that at least addressed some of those problems, which might have found more favour in the House today.
</p>








<p><a name="st_196"><a name="51202-13_spnew3"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the existing legislation works and is sound, but is not widely understood by the public? I am sad that the promoter of the Bill, the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh), is not in the Chamber and is thus unable to hear what are hopefully my pearls of wisdom. Does my hon. Friend thus agree that Opposition Members would have done better to direct their energies at making the public more aware of the existing legislation and how it can be used to protect the householder and property owner?
</p>








<p><a name="st_197"><a name="51202-13_spnew4"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. The Bill has effectively suggested to people that they have a weaker right to defend themselves than they actually do. It is confusing the position to such an extent that people do not know where they stand. If Opposition Members had been acting responsibly, they would have given out copies of the CPS leaflet in their constituencies. I distributed a large number of those leaflets so that people would know where they stood if they faced such

<br>&nbsp;<br>a situation. It would have been rather more constructive if Opposition Members had explained what the policies of the CPS were and what the law was, instead of trying to frighten people into thinking on the one hand that they cannot defend themselves, and on the other that the country is rife with burglary.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that this is yet another example of Her Majesty&#039;s official Opposition ignoring the advice of the police?

</p>








<p><a name="st_201"><a name="51202-13_spnew8"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 I hope to deal with that shortly, because it is important that we understand where the law stands.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_97">I was talking about the black letter law expounded by Lord Morris, who was explaining the common law in the case of Palmer. Basically, it is a common sense test, and who can object to that? Many other myths have developed. In paragraph 19.42&nbsp;in the section on offences against the person in &quot;Archbold&quot;, the old rule that a man who is attacked must retreat as far as he can has disappeared. Whether the accused retreated is only one factor for the jury to consider when determining whether force was reasonably necessary. Moreover, the same paragraph states that there is no rule of law that a man must wait until he is struck before striking in self-defence. If another person strikes at him he is entitled to make his blow first if it is reasonably necessary to do so in self-defence. The existing law therefore goes further than most people think.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_98">Moreover, if the defence of self-defence is offered, the burden of disproving it is on the prosecution, not on the defendant facing trial. &quot;Archbold&quot; says that where such a defence is offered, the burden of negativing it rests on the prosecution. If, on consideration of all the evidence, the jury is convinced of the innocence of the prisoner&#151;&quot;Archbold&quot; uses old terminology because it is citing an old case&#151;or is left in doubt as to whether he was acting in necessary self-defence it should acquit. In the Crown <i>v.</i> Abraham the Court of Appeal said that a judge should deal with the issue by telling the jury that someone who acts reasonably in self-defence commits no unlawful act. Just as it is for the Crown to show that the plea of not guilty is not acceptable, so the Crown 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Dec 2005 : Column 536</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>must convince the jury beyond reasonable doubt that self-defence has no basis in the present case. There are therefore many safeguards in the existing law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_99">We must also look at the charging standard text used by the CPS, which was published on 26&nbsp;November 2004&nbsp;and tells CPS staff how they should approach such cases. Prosecutors must consider all assaults in the context in which they were allegedly committed. Particular care must be taken in dealing with cases of assault where the allegation is made by a &quot;victim&quot; who, at the time, was engaged in criminal activity himself. An example relevant to today&#039;s debate is a burglar who claims to have been assaulted by the occupier of the premises concerned. Prosecutors are reminded that it is lawful to use reasonable force in the following circumstances&#151;self-defence; to defend another person; to defend property; to prevent crime; and to lawfully arrest someone. Where the use of force in such circumstances is reasonable the assailant&#151;the person about whom we are concerned&#151;has an absolute defence, and charges relating to the assault should not be brought. Paragraph 5&nbsp;of the CPS charging standard text therefore sets out the position in black and white.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_100">The advice to prosecutors continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;In assessing the reasonableness of the force two questions should be asked: was the force used justified in all the circumstances? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and was the first force used excessive&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_101">The courts have shown that both questions are to be answered on the basis of the facts, as the accused&#151;the householder&#151;honestly believed them to be. To return to my exchange with my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting, the test is a subjective one. The issue of whether a reasonable person would regard the force used as reasonable or excessive is the subsequent question, not the primary question.
</p>








<p><a name="st_202"><a name="51202-13_spnew9"><b> Mr. Khan: </b> 
 My hon. Friend gave figures for the decreasing number of burglaries in the past 20&nbsp;years. Last year, there were 943,000&nbsp;burglaries, which is the lowest figure for 20&nbsp;years. There have been approximately 10&nbsp;million burglaries in the past 15&nbsp;years, but there have been only seven cases in which a householder has been prosecuted for defending himself against an intruder. Does that not confirm that the CPS is applying the guidance that he cited correctly?
</p>








<p><a name="st_203"><a name="51202-13_spnew10"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is basically right, and I hope that we can analyse some cases in more detail later. Many of the cases that have been prayed in aid by the Opposition predate the guidance in the CPS charging standard text, which was published in November 2004. They certainly predate the joint statement by the CPS and ACPO, which was first published in January 2005&nbsp;and subsequently produced as a leaflet.
</p>

I would be interested to hear my hon. Friend&#039;s comments on my previous intervention on the hon. Member for Newark, when I referred to the case that was cited. The individual in question was arrested and would still be arrested under the proposal in the Bill. The second intervention, which I sadly was not permitted, was intended to highlight the fact that the CPS guidance to which my hon.

<p><a name="st_209"><a name="51202-14_spnew4"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b>

In the current law there is the test of reasonableness that juries interpret in a reasonable way. Under the Bill, if I can persuade the jury that I was not aware that it was grossly disproportionate to stab somebody who had just walked on to my garden, I would be required to be acquitted.

<p><a name="st_211"><a name="51202-14_spnew6"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises an interesting point which is to do with what the law calls mens rea. To be honest and fair to the promoter of the Bill, I am not entirely sure that my hon. Friend has construed the Bill accurately in that respect, but I hope to come to the issue in due course.


</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_105">Before that intervention, I was referring to the joint statement by the CPS and ACPO, which deals with what happens if an intruder dies. It makes it clear that if a householder acts in reasonable self-defence and an intruder dies, then the householder will still have acted lawfully. However, it goes on to caution that if, having knocked someone unconscious, a householder decides to hurt or kill an intruder in order to punish them, or if a householder knows about an intended intruder and sets a trap to hurt or kill them, that householder would be acting with excessive and gratuitous force. In such cases, the householder would be prosecuted under the existing law. Even if the Bill were passed, a householder in those circumstances would still be prosecuted.

So long as they do no more than they honestly and instinctively feel is necessary in the heat of the moment, that will be the strongest evidence that the householder has acted lawfully.

 Is my hon.

One of the problems experienced by the police was people running from one building along the walkways, which were open and therefore not part of the building, into the next building. They ran round and round the maze of the estate in that way to avoid the police. My hon.

What if it turns out that the person they attack is not a burglar but a neighbour returning a lawnmower late at night, or a genuine gasman&#151;not the artificer who has come to nick the money out of the teapot&#151;who has come to read the meter?

Thus, where a defendant was neither under threat nor actual attack but honestly believed that he was, the jury should be directed to consider whether the degree of force used was commensurate with the degree of risk that he believed to be created by the attack. What that means, if that basic principle of law will still apply, is that the gasman or the neighbour returning a lawnmower could be half beaten to death, but it would be all right for the assailant homeowner to say, &quot;I made a big mistake, I&#039;m very sorry and mortified, but that&#039;s life and I&#039;m not being prosecuted.&quot; That would not be much consolation to the gasman or neighbour lying in a pool of blood. The Bill effectively encourages that level of violence.

Of course, it is bizarre to say that people should use disproportionate force, never mind grossly disproportionate force.

<p><a name="st_262"><a name="51202-17_spnew12"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has raised some further thoughts in my mind. What if someone had set a device designed to give a mild electric shock to an intruder at a level where no harm would be expected but the intruder had a heart condition and the shock was sufficient to trigger a heart attack? Under the vigilante Bill as it stands such a system would not be disproportionate. What if something designed to stop an intruder accessing the roof was mounted on the outside of a building but fell into the grounds or the street? It would have gone from being something within a building to something outside a building. Where would that stand under the vigilante Bill?

<p><a name="st_263"><a name="51202-17_spnew13"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. Properties are often protected by barbed wire, razor wire or the new material called cactus, which is very effective. There is also the old-fashioned use of broken bottles stuck in concrete on top of a wall. Those are not traps because they are obvious. There may be civil remedies if someone is injured by them, but they are certainly not traps.

<p><a name="st_269"><a name="51202-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 The child might be injured but the householder would not be protected by the Bill because the ball would presumably be in the yard or garden. The householder might not draw the distinction that a QC would between the house itself and its immediate surroundings. People might think that they are protected by the Bill in using disproportionate force in dealing with a lad trespassing while chasing a ball, but find themselves in the dock because the Bill would not protect them. That is the sort of problem that arises when there is a duplicity of standards in respect of the law of self-defence.

<p>
<a name="51202-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_138">Let us consider what we mean by &quot;entered as a trespasser&quot;, which is the phrase used in the third line of what would become new subsection (1A) of the Criminal Law Act 1967. I happen to have with me a copy of the eighth edition of Professor Sir John Smith&#039;s &quot;Law of Theft&quot;, which, if we follow its advice, produces some interesting anomalies in respect of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_139">Let us first consider the definition of &quot;enters&quot;. The common law rule was that the insertion of any part of the body, however small, was a sufficient entry. If a burglar pushed through a window pane and the forepart of his finger was observed to be inside the building, that was enough. The Theft Act gives no express guidance and it seems to have been assumed in Parliament that the common law rules apply. Under common law, if an instrument is inserted into the building for the purpose of committing the offence, it counts as an entry, even though no part of the body was introduced into the building. Someone who just pokes a finger through the window could be met by disproportionate force when the mad householder with an axe comes along and chops it off. That is disproportionate for sure, but is it excessive? We do not know, but I believe that the House does not really expect or wish to see that happening.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_140">We know that the common law still applies, because Professor Smith, one of this country&#039;s leading experts in criminal law, explains it in his book. He goes through a whole series of anomalies that can occur, but he goes on to say at the end of the section that deals with &quot;peculiar effects&quot; that the &quot;best course&quot; is probably to assume &quot;the continued existence&quot; of the &quot;common law rules&quot;. He provides some very strange examples. One of the most interesting is the case of transvestites who hooked dresses worth &#163;600&nbsp;through the letter boxes of shops and pleaded guilty to burglary. Well, if that is committing a burglary and if the essence of burglary is trespass, I dread to think what might have happened if the householder had got hold of them while they were hooking things through his letter box.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_141">Now that we have looked into the question of entering, we have to understand exactly what is meant by trespassing. A trespasser is a legal concept that is rooted in the civil law rather than the criminal law. The basic rule in civil law is that entry with the consent of the occupier cannot be trespass, but obviously the opposite is the case. &quot;Mistake&quot; by the person who enters the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Dec 2005 : Column 550</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>property is no defence if, for example, the person accused of being a trespasser and therefore at risk under the Bill were to enter the house next door, mistaking it for his own, on a very dark night. That would still be regarded as an intentional entry in trespass law, even if the person doing the entering had made an honest and reasonable mistake. To revert to my earlier example of the neighbour returning the lawnmower, one wonders whether the full force of excessive force is appropriate in those circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_142">I can provide an even better example than that. Let us suppose that the person allegedly committing the trespass were separated from his wife and he wrongly supposed that he had the right to enter the matrimonial home of which he was still technically the owner-occupier as he was still paying towards the cost of the home. He thought that he had the right to go in, even though he may not have had that right in law, and enters with the intent of removing some of the belongings. In fact, even in law, he may be a trespasser, but he is not actually a burglar because he can rely on some of the defences that apply in the law of trespass. My concern in that case is that he is potentially a trespasser for the purposes of the Bill, but he is not a burglar for the purposes of the Theft Act 1968. He could be beaten up by whoever happens to be inside the property&#151;by his wife&#039;s new partner, for example&#151;and if he were subjected to excessive force, it would be covered by the Bill even though in law he was not really a burglar at all.
</p>








<p><a name="st_270"><a name="51202-18_spnew4"><b> Mr. Khan: </b> 
 Is there not a problem with the words &quot;entered as a trespasser&quot;? Earlier, an Opposition Member, who is no longer in his place, referred to an example, in which &quot;but for the law&quot; he would have been a hero for retaliating against someone who came into his shop to commit an act of theft. As my hon. Friend knows, the reality is that if someone commits a criminal act on a property, the licence is revoked and he then becomes a trespasser. If someone enters a shop as an innocent purchaser of an item without the intention of breaking the law, but subsequently decides to commit a criminal act thereby becoming a trespasser, he or she did not enter the shop or property as a trespasser, which is the threshold required for the provisions to apply. Is not that the problem?
</p>








<p><a name="st_271"><a name="51202-18_spnew5"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a very interesting point, which relates to the Theft Act. If someone decides to commit a theft at a particular stage, they become a trespasser from the moment they entered the building and could theoretically face the charge of burglary; in practice, they are usually charged with theft. Technically, if they were to jump over the counter and raid the till, I suspect that it would be classed as burglary.
</p>








<p><a name="st_272"><a name="51202-18_spnew6"><b> Chris Bryant: </b> 
 Let us consider the example given earlier of an estranged husband returning to the matrimonial home, which he still half owns. He might not be entering as a trespasser and may have no intention of committing a burglary of any kind. None the less, in an altercation he might end up offering violence against his wife, and at that point it might be necessary for her to offer violence in return. Of course, this Bill would not protect her in any sense.
</p>








<p><a name="st_273"><a name="51202-18_spnew7"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 To be fair, I am not sure that that is accurate. In that situation, the husband would probably 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Dec 2005 : Column 551</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>be committing the offence of burglary anyway, because burglary is not just thieving: rape and grievous bodily harm, for example, can constitute burglary. People often think that burglary is just stealing; it is not. It can include other offences linked to breaking into a property. The problem is that the Bill refers not to burglary but simply to people trespassing on buildings. The definitions of trespass in civil law and in criminal law are different, as are the definitions of the motive of the person entering the building. The situation is very confusing indeed, and part of the problem is that the Bill is unclear on the circumstances to which it would apply.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_143">As has been demonstrated in a number of different examples given today, under the Bill, the person defending themselves could be completely unclear as to which test applies: the reasonable force test or the excessive, disproportionate force test. They would not know where they stood, and the creation of such confusion would put them in a very difficult position. There is a very real risk that they might naturally assume that they could use disproportionate force in circumstances where they in fact could not. The consequence could be entirely the opposite of that intended. People could end up appearing in the dock to defend themselves who currently would not need to, because as it stands they would be using reasonable, rather than disproportionate, force. If someone used the latter in circumstances where they were entitled to use only the former, they would rightly be charged with a criminal offence. That could happen under the Bill, simply because it has led them up the garden path.

 Under this vigilante Bill, burglars could decide to stop committing burglaries and start mugging instead, because the prize is the same but the chances of being beaten up are reduced. In other words, it could push burglars out into the parks to mug people. Moreover, under this very woolly vigilante Bill, somebody threatened with being mugged in the park might rush to the nearest house and hammer on the door to get in, only for the person behind the door to think, &quot;Somebody is trespassing on my premises; I can now use disproportionate force against them.&quot; What are my hon.

<a name="stpa_144">In an intervention, my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South mentioned the displacement of crime from burglary to street robbery. Well, that may happen anyway if we are able to bear down on the incidence of burglary; indeed, there has been a rise in street crime as a consequence of the fact that burglary has become a more difficult crime to commit. The problem with the Bill is that it may drive people further into that type of criminal behaviour.

<a name="stpa_145">I mentioned previously the problem of displacement from properties where the householder may be thought to have weapons to defend himself to the home of a little old lady who could not defend herself. The Bill would inevitably lead to such displacement, and my hon. Friend is right to say that there will also be displacement from burglary to street robbery, perhaps as an alternative way of funding a drug habit. Obviously, we have to deal with street crime, too, but the Bill does not provide the same protection for victims of street robbery as it does for the lord in his castle.

 We all admire my hon. Friend&#039;s ability to retain the thread of his remarks despite our interventions. I want to take him back to an intervention that he did not fully deal with: my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan) pointed out that under the Bill the situation would be different for someone who entered as a trespasser and for an opportunist who went into a shop and then decided to commit a burglary. A householder would not necessarily know which of those two things had occurred, so the exemption in subsection (1A)(b)&#151;

<p><a name="st_279"><a name="51202-19_spnew4"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 That is one of the problems. My hon. Friend switched from a shop owner to a householder halfway through his analogy, but I think it would be interesting if we stayed with the shop owner. If somebody enters a shop and tries to steal goods or raid the till, they retrospectively become a trespasser for the purposes of the Theft Act, so technically would fall to be dealt with under the Bill. The problem is that the shop owner may not know that. I suspect that most shop owners do not know the law of trespass well enough to draw that distinction. Yet again, we would be in the difficult position where different rules applied in different circumstances, with a complete lack of clarity for the victim about the extent to which they are entitled to defend themselves&#151;whether the high test in the Bill or the common-sense test in the existing law of self-defence.

 My hon. Friend is right. If we are talking about the countryside, there is an interesting point that people who have limited authority to do one thing and may thus enter a place legally can become trespassers if they do something outside the extent of that authority. An example cited under the Game Act 1831&nbsp;is of someone who had permission to go on to land to hunt for rabbits, but then started hunting hares. It might be splitting hairs to raise the case, but such evidence of trespass under the Game Act 1831&nbsp;would presumably be evidence of trespass under the Bill if the animals in question were inside a building&#151;we would presumably be considering battery-farmed rabbits or hares in such circumstances.

However, the burglar in his flat could also use disproportionate force to defend the stolen property from its lawful owner and fight back, so the situation would ratchet up. Each person is legally entitled to use disproportionate force against the other. That is surely not the Bill&#039;s intention, but it is the inevitable and logical consequence of the way in which it is drafted. The lawful owner of the property is preventing crime while operating inside a building, and the burglar, who is also inside the building, is defending property, even though it is not his.

<a name="stpa_153">I have dealt with the position when property is owned illegally, but what is the position when property cannot be owned legally in the first place?

The junkie finds that he does not have enough money, and tries to grab the drugs. The drugs gang could use disproportionate force against the junkie to prevent him from seizing the illegal drugs that should not be in its possession in the first place. The junkie could argue that he was trying to prevent crime by seizing drugs from the dealers. Theoretically, both parties could deploy the argument that they were entitled to use disproportionate force.

<a name="stpa_154">Similarly, a drugs gang may wish to use disproportionate force against another gang whose members are trying to collect payment or steal the drugs. That is not an infrequent occurrence, as we know from the leaflet produced by the CPS and ACPO, which says that burglaries are often used to conceal the fact that nefarious activities such as drug dealing are under way. The law is bad enough without introducing legalised gang warfare between tooled-up drugs gangs in a shoot-out. Each gang could use their Uzis to mow the other down&#151;the Opposition might think there is nothing wrong with that&#151;with disproportionate force. That is perfectly legal for both gangs under the Bill, because one is entitled to shoot someone if one faces the threat of force. One drugs gang is trying to prevent crime, and the other is trying to commit it. However, both are trying to defend their property, and the net result is legalised gang warfare.

 If I have understood my hon. Friend&#039;s definition of a building, which concerns the building&#039;s degree of permanence, I imagine that a cave would not be a building, but what about a tunnel that has been built and is a permanent structure? I mention that point because the Bill refers to the prevention of crime in general rather than just crime against persons or property. Criminal action on the permanent way is a great headache for the railway authorities. Would the railway authorities have powers under the Bill?
</p>








<p><a name="st_310"><a name="51202-21_spnew4"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has raised two issues. First, what about troglodytes? Troglodytes are people who live in caves. Many people live in caves. Indeed, when I was on holiday in Spain, I visited several towns in which the houses were made out of caves. Are such caves buildings? My hon. Friend has posed a very good question. I presume that if they had a built-on front wall built and possessions inside they would be a building, whereas a tunnel would not. However, there may be a building inside a tunnel&#151;for example, a sub-surface underground station. That raises interesting questions. If the British Transport police wanted to apprehend an offender who was in the ticket hall and then leaped over the barriers and ran down the tunnel, what would be the powers of the constables chasing him? Would those powers switch between the moment they left the ticket hall and the moment they entered the tunnel? Under the Bill, they probably would.

<p>

It is not my fault that the drafters made that cross-reference. I would far prefer that they had set out what they mean by &quot;building&quot; in the Bill. If we are to explore the Bill properly, I therefore have to consider how &quot;building&quot; is defined for the purposes of section 9&nbsp;of the Theft Act.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_169">My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda asked about vehicles. Cars certainly do not apply. Before I come to the issue of mobile homes, though, it is important to set out the benchmark definition of a building. That was given by a former Master of the Rolls, Lord Esher, in a case that took place quite a while ago. He says that a building in the ordinary sense is a block of brick or stonework covered in by a roof, and a structure of considerable size that is intended to be permanent or at least to endure for a considerable time. He says that a telephone kiosk is not a building, that the outbuildings of a house are buildings, and that a detached garage, tool shed or greenhouse may be a building. He identifies a difficulty on building sites in that a roof will be thought necessary for a structure to be a building but says that there is no obvious answer to borderline cases. He says that one lodger may commit burglary by entering another lodger&#039;s room, that a guest in a hotel may commit a burglary by entering the room of another guest and that on a ship somebody could commit a burglary by going into another cabin. A whole series of examples are brought into the Bill by the cross-reference from the Theft Act.


</p>








<p><a name="st_315"><a name="51202-21_spnew8"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 This draft vigilante Bill gives me grave concern, because of the confusion that it would cause. Could my hon. Friend, with his vast experience of these matters, give me some guidance as to what would happen on a building site that had on-site security? If some of the buildings were partly completed and some were not, would the security guard be acting within the law under this vigilante Bill if he used disproportionate force when he caught someone trying to steal things from the site?
</p>








<p><a name="st_316"><a name="51202-21_spnew9"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 I have an example that I was going to use later in my speech, but it is relevant to my hon. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Dec 2005 : Column 560</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Friend&#039;s question. I would pity the security guard in those circumstances. Let us suppose that, on a housing development, some of the houses had been finished, some had been constructed as far as the second floor and had a roof, some had only the first floor and no roof, and some were still just a wishful thought in the developer&#039;s eye, consisting only of footings or perhaps just open land.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_170">The problem that the security guard would face as he chased the burglar from one part of the site to another would be that he would be able to use disproportionate force when he was in a finished house, but he may or may not be able to do so when he entered a half-finished house, depending on how much of it had been built, and when he chased the burglar over the open land heading for the gate, he would be back under the old rule of reasonable force. Frankly, nothing could better illustrate the anomalies that the Bill would create as a result of defining the word &quot;building&quot; insufficiently tightly. Instead, it sloppily cross-refers us to the Theft Act 1968&nbsp;because its drafters could not be bothered to apply their minds to what a building should be, for the detailed and specific purposes of the proposals. The net consequence is that we should have all these amazing anomalies.
</p>








<p><a name="st_317"><a name="51202-21_spnew10"><b> Mr. Khan: </b> 
 I am really troubled by that last example. My mind is drawn to our police officers, who are governed by their disciplinary codes, as well as by the civil law. Having read about these matters, what guidance would my hon. Friend give to a police officer giving chase, for example, to a teenage trespasser on a building site or on the railway&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Jim Dowd) mentioned tunnels earlier. How would the police officer know how not to fall foul of the Bill&#039;s provisions, by contrast with the provisions of the disciplinary code or the civil law provisions that might apply if they were sued, if someone were assaulted as a result of the way in which the police officer behaved?
</p>








<p><a name="st_318"><a name="51202-21_spnew11"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises an important point. I would hope that the police officer would exercise their common sense. A police officer is entitled to use reasonable force in apprehending a criminal, as is any citizen attempting to effect a citizen&#039;s arrest under the law as it stands. Police officers are trained in the criminal law, and they know when they may and may not use disproportionate force, but that would not be the case under the Bill, because of all the anomalies that it contains. I suspect that a police officer would have more sense than to use disproportionate force. I have rather greater respect for the police service than do the Conservatives, given their suggestion that police officers might wish to use disproportionate force beyond that necessary to detain a suspect.

 If a police officer giving pursuit to a drug dealer, for example, were in plain clothes and went across the building site that we talked about earlier, he would need not only to think about apprehending the criminal but to be cognisant of the fact that the security guard on the premises could use disproportionate force against him, not realising that he was a police officer because he was in plain clothes. Would not the police officer therefore have to take into account the fact that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Dec 2005 : Column 561</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>he might encounter disproportionate force simply because of the area in which he was pursuing the criminal?
</p>








<p><a name="st_320"><a name="51202-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his correction. Kenneth Noye was a well known member of the organised crime fraternity. He killed a plain clothes police officer who was staking out his property, because he thought he was a trespasser. Noye escaped conviction, even under the existing law of reasonable force. What would be the position were the new proposals in the Bill to apply? Plain clothes police officers could be subject to disproportionate force all over the place, both in the circumstances that we have heard described and in many others that I am sure that everyone in the House can imagine.
</p>








<p><a name="st_323"><a name="51202-22_spnew4"><b> Mr. Khan: </b> 
 An additional point is the criticism that a police officer would face if he or she used excessive or disproportionate force but not grossly disproportionate force. My hon. Friend and I, and our hon. Friends who work with the police, are aware that that would lead to criticism of the police when they were not falling foul of the Bill.
</p>








<p><a name="st_324"><a name="51202-22_spnew5"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. All that one can say to police officers in those circumstances is that they should use their common sense, and use the reasonable force that they consider necessary to apprehend the offender. Ultimately, I suspect that that is the advice that we would all have to give to householders, or anybody else, even if the Bill were passed. To do anything else would still lead to the grey areas mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe.
</p>








<p><a name="st_325"><a name="51202-22_spnew6"><b> Dr. Palmer: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that we would end up back where we started if we gave householders the advice that the law is not completely clear and that they must rely on the common sense of the jury and behave reasonably, which makes the task of the jury that much harder? Does not he agree that there will be situations in which the use of force to make an arrest is an ongoing process? The police officer might have to hit the suspect several times to subdue him. If the first blow was in a building, and the second blow was not, the question arises as to whether the first blow has become disproportionate.

<a name="51202-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_178">The problem is that neither disproportionate nor grossly disproportionate are defined in the law anywhere. There is no case law on it&#151;civil or criminal.

 My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. We know that the Bill is about defending property. I will bear in mind your constraints earlier, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and not stray down the highways and byways of other Acts and measures that the House has passed, although those may be the only guidance. It will be interesting to know, if I may say in parenthesis, whether that terminology has ever been interpreted in the courts or whether it simply appears in the statute. If that is so, it will not provide us with any more guidance than we have to start with.

 Does my hon. Friend envisage a situation where the Association of Chief Police Officers will have to distribute large amounts of leaflets explaining what proportionality, disproportionality and grossly disproportionate mean? Will that not be a tremendous waste of money?

 I envisage ACPO having to distribute tomes the size of &quot;Archbold&quot;, rather than a leaflet, to explain to people what the new law will be. I have had to trawl through &quot;Archbold&quot; to try to find some definitions. Those will have to be incorporated in the leaflet. My hon. Friend is right: it is important that people are made aware of what the law is. However, I suspect that it would need to be rather bigger than a leaflet. It would be at the very least a thick pamphlet or a tome along the lines of &quot;Archbold&quot; if it is to make clear what the law is, should the Bill go through.

 The hon. Lady raises an interesting point and an issue canvassed previously when the Bill of the hon. Member for Newark was debated. It is incumbent on the Government to make sure that there is a proper information programme so that people are made aware what the law is. It is also incumbent on them to produce a leaflet in other languages, too, as people from minority communities particularly fear the impact of burglary. For recent arrivals to our shores, the regime of law under which they previously lived may have been a little more anarchic than ours, and it might be important to remind them of exactly what they are or are not entitled to do. I hope that the Minister will be able, should she come to reply to the debate, to pick up that point and say whether the Government intend to distribute the leaflet in a way that makes it accessible to all our citizens, whatever their native tongue.
</p>








<p><a name="st_339"><a name="51202-23_spnew6"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that rather than bringing in a vigilante Bill, a better way forward would be to encourage the Home Office and the Inland Revenue, for example, to work together so that small businesses receive just such a leaflet directly with their end-of-year packs?
</p>








<p><a name="st_340"><a name="51202-23_spnew7"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point. Although the leaflet is targeted at householders, the same provisions apply to business people, whether they be shop owners or work in an office. The Home Office might well imagine that it would be helpful to ensure that shop owners, about whose fears of people breaking into their shops we have heard much, benefit from a leaflet that would not require greatly to be changed from the existing leaflet, which sets out the position very well. It might require just a change to the title, and shop owners would benefit from it. I hope that the Minister will pick up on that if there is time for her to reply to the debate.
</p>








<p><a name="st_341"><a name="51202-23_spnew8"><b> Mr. Khan: </b> 
 I urge caution. My hon. Friend has explained his excellent practice of informing his 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Dec 2005 : Column 565</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>constituents about their rights, but I urge caution because we must put matters in context. Fewer than 1&nbsp;per cent. of burglaries are aggravated. Burglaries are also at the lowest level for 20&nbsp;years. My hon. Friend, as a hard-working constituency MP, will understand that the perception of crime often overtakes the reality, and I would not want us to be carried away and to end up creating more concern among some of our most vulnerable constituents.
</p>








<p><a name="st_342"><a name="51202-23_spnew9"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 My hon. Friend echoes some of the points I made earlier in giving some statistics about the incidence and risk of burglary. The important thing is that the leaflet must reassure people, and can do so in two ways. First, it can reassure them that the prospects of their being the victims of burglary are relatively slight. Secondly, they could be given some information on what they could do to reduce the risk of burglary&#151;for example, the installation of window locks or asking the local police service to make a crime prevention visit. It is important that people know where they stand on these difficult issues. An information leaflet would not be just about telling people what they could do if their home were invaded. It would tell them what they could do to stop their home being invaded in the first place, and to reassure them that the risk of that happening is relatively slight.
</p>








<p><a name="st_343"><a name="51202-23_spnew10"><b> Mr. Khan: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that it is grossly irresponsible of opportunist Opposition Members to refer to the one or two stark cases where householders have been prosecuted because of action that they took against intruders?
</p>








<p><a name="st_344"><a name="51202-23_spnew11"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. If we examine some of the cases, we see a different picture emerging. As we have no definition of &quot;grossly disproportionate&quot;, perhaps we should consider some of the cases that have come before the courts and test them against the existing definition and against the &quot;grossly disproportionate&quot; definition.

<a name="51202-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_181">The research paper from the Library helpfully sets out a number of examples. The Library has gone back almost 20&nbsp;years in looking for these cases. Having done so, it has produced relatively few. The number of cases that we are dealing with, even under existing law, is relatively small. The first case concerns a Mr. Eric Butler in May 1987. He was charged with malicious wounding after he stabbed a mugger on the underground with a sword stick. That case was withdrawn&#151;it was reasonable force.

 My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. Going back to the discussion that I had earlier with my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Jim Dowd), it could be argued whether it was or was not a building, depending on whereabouts on the underground it took place.

They ran away, but one was shot in the back with 40&nbsp;shotgun pellets. Again, that was probably grossly disproportionate; moreover, the Bill would have offered no protection in such an incident because it took place outside. In a third case, a householder laid in wait for a burglar who tried to burgle his shed, and shot him in the back. That is the &quot;Tony Martin circumstance&quot;, which, as we know, given the concessions already made by Opposition Members, would amount to grossly disproportionate force.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_204">The question then arises of why we need to change the law of self-defence in the first place. I suggest that we do not. The law is clear and we have to have consistency in the law; having different tests for different circumstances is fraught with danger. We have already discussed what would happen when such incidents occur in, and outside, buildings; and, for example, whether a dormobile constitutes a building. I mentioned earlier the example of a security guard taking such action on a building site. As it stands it would constitute reasonable force, but if he is in the construction hut, the question arises as to whether the hut constitutes a building&#151;a marginal point. If it is on completed premises, it probably constitutes a building. Would he have the nous to work out when he can and cannot use the defence provided in this Bill? What about allotments and garden sheds? Clearly, the allotment itself is not a building; the garden shed may or may not be, depending on the size of the structure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_205">What about people who are attacked who are not in any form of building? The victim of a street mugging could use only reasonable force. We know that a phone box is not a building, because there is case law to that effect. The victim of a phone box mugging could defend himself with nothing other than reasonable force. Such an incident could easily happen, because as we know, a lot of drug deals are done in phone boxes.

 I realise that my hon. Friend is in danger of running low on time, but I want to mention one issue that has yet to be stressed. The general public take separate views on the danger of excessive injury to a criminal, and on the danger of any injury to an innocent party or to someone who has committed a very minor act of trespass. Does my hon. Friend not think it important to stress that the Bill as drafted poses a risk of excessive over-reaction to someone who commits an actual offence, and of grievous harm to someone who has done no real harm?

<p><a name="st_368"><a name="51202-25_spnew5"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a very interesting point. My main concern is that, one way or the other, the Bill would lead to an inevitable escalation of violence, rather than a diminution, as its proponents would have us believe.
</p>








<p><a name="st_369"><a name="51202-25_spnew6"><b> Mr. Khan: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has explained the Bill&#039;s inconsistency in respect of the approaches taken by victims of crimes against property, and by those who have been mugged in the street. However, is there not a more fundamentally offensive aspect of the Bill? Victims of crimes against their person&#151;those who are raped in a park or assaulted in a public place, for example&#151;would have fewer rights and less protection under the Bill than the victims of crimes against property in the household.
</p>








<p><a name="st_370"><a name="51202-25_spnew7"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. Indeed, that was to have been my next point. How can we distinguish between the victim of a rape in a park who is allowed to use only reasonable force against her assailant and the victims of rape in other circumstances, inside a building that could be a public place, such as a tube station or a shopping centre&#151;attacks have occurred in both&#151;or the victim&#039;s own home? In one case the victim would be allowed to use disproportionate force to defend herself, whereas if she was raped in a park, in an open space, she could not. That cannot be right. How can we explain to women what they can or cannot do to defend themselves if we have to say that it depends on where they are attacked? That is ludicrous.

There would be a possible cross-reference to article 8&nbsp;and the UN convention on the rights of the child if the alleged criminal were a child.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-26_para15">
<a name="stpa_225">The problem with secondary school provision in Wellingborough has been apparent for many years, ever since the closure and demolition of a local secondary school in 2001. The John Lea secondary school was closed in 1998&nbsp;by the Labour-run county council, which thought that there were enough secondary school places in Wellingborough for local children. How wrong it was. John Lea secondary school was a modern school with good buildings and facilities. At the time, there was widespread fear that the closure of the school would leave the remaining schools in Wellingborough oversubscribed, and would leave some children without any education at all. Despite that fear, the school was demolished in 2001&nbsp;to make way for new homes for new families. Those families, of course, had children who required secondary school education.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-26_para16">
<a name="stpa_226">Let us be honest: the closure and demolition of John Lea was meant to make money, yet that money has never gone back into secondary education in Wellingborough. I was not living in Wellingborough when John Lea was closed&#151;I moved there shortly afterwards. However, I was living there when the decision was made to demolish the school. Along with many others, I fought to save the school with my &quot;Listening to Wellingborough&quot; campaign. I founded that campaign because I felt that too many politicians of all parties had become arrogant and out of touch. They were more than happy to preach to people, but were not prepared to listen. My &quot;Listening to Wellingborough&quot; campaign aims to seek the views of local people, groups and organisations and to campaign on their behalf for change.

Sarah Robertson, who was 15&nbsp;at the time, was at a critical stage in her education, with exams imminent, yet she had been without a school place for almost six months. I met many worried parents who did not know which way to turn because of the failure of the Labour-controlled local authority, and I met pupils who were bored and frustrated by being stuck at home. If that had been a one-off incident, it would have been bad enough, but it has happened time and again because of the closure of the school. In a subsequent year, another large group of children were left at home for weeks on end without any education at all.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this afternoon&#039;s debate. As the Member of Parliament for the neighbouring constituency of Kettering, may I say that I share his concerns? I put it to him that one of the major themes in our combined local area is that we face the prospect of 52,000&nbsp;new houses being built in north Northamptonshire by 2021, while existing educational provision is not sufficient for the current population.
</p>








<p><a name="st_409"><a name="51202-27_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bone: </b> 
 I know how hard my hon. Friend works on behalf of his constituents. I feel a little guilty that secondary school children from Wellingborough are being bussed into Kettering because provision in Wellingborough is insufficient. I shall address his second point later in my speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_233">What was the solution proposed by the local authority and the Government? They decided to force already overcrowded schools to take even more pupils, which damaged the education not only of the pupils forced into those schools, but of all those already there. That should not have been allowed to happen, but unfortunately some children still do not have a school place. Since 2001, there has been a huge amount of growth in my constituency with many, many new families, whose children require secondary school places, moving into the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_234">Over the past four years, there has been an explosion of new development in my constituency, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) has referred, and it is set to get much, much worse, with thousands of new homes being built on the order of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The Milton Keynes south midlands sub-regional strategy will see 13,000&nbsp;new homes being built in Wellingborough by 2021, with another 10,000&nbsp;homes planned for east Northamptonshire, large parts of which are in my constituency. Yet despite the knowledge that those new homes will be built, the Government have not indicated whether the infrastructure will be in place to support new and existing Wellingborough residents and their children.

<a name="51202-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_235">Turning to the problems that we face at the moment, there are currently four secondary schools in Wellingborough&#151;three are foundation schools and one is a community school. I have been told that in Wellingborough between nine and 10&nbsp;children a month find themselves without a secondary school place and must go through a lengthy process in order to get into a school. For example, a parent came to see me at my surgery last Friday. Mr. Hussein moved back into Wellingborough after being away for two years. He has two children, one of 17&nbsp;and one of 12. The 17-year-old had previously been educated at a secondary school in Wellingborough, but that school could not re-admit her because it is now over-subscribed. The other child could not get into a secondary school near where they live, and both children were told that they had to go on a waiting list, so they are currently at home with no education at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_236">I have spoken to the local education authority, which will do its best to get those children into a school. However, the process that it uses to place nine or 10&nbsp;children a month involves a meeting which occurs only once a month and which can only occur after the LEA has been made aware of the situation. It is quite possible that such children will be without any education for three months. Do the Government think that that would be the case if one of Wellingborough&#039;s secondary schools had not been knocked down?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_237">The LEA claims that some secondary school places are available in Wellingborough, but those places are all at the only school in Wellingborough that is in special measures. For many families moving into Wellingborough, there is no choice whatever&#151;no matter where they live and no matter how far away they are from the school, they must go to the school that is in special measures. That situation is unacceptable, because there must be choice&#151;parents should have some choice in what school their children go to. I note with interest that the Government&#039;s education White Paper advocates parental choice, which is welcome, but unfortunately it is just not happening in my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_238">Even those pupils coming from primary schools in Wellingborough are limited for choice. At the Wrenn school last year, there were 280&nbsp;applicants for 250&nbsp;year 7&nbsp;places. Twenty-six people appealed, but only three of those appellants were able to get a place at the school. That means that the school is already, in year 7, three pupils over the number that it considers to be its maximum admission level. The admissions system allows parents to put down a first, second and third choice of schools in Wellingborough, but if their children do not get their first-choice place, they are extremely unlikely to get their second choice, because those will already have been filled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_239">It is natural that every parent wants their child to go to the best possible school, and inevitable that some schools are better than others, but the most popular schools in my constituency are constantly oversubscribed and struggle with the limited capacity of their school buildings. Let me take one as an example. It is extremely popular and high-achieving. Only 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Dec 2005 : Column 580</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>208&nbsp;places in each year group are available because of the restrictions of building capacity. In fact, the school now has to operate a one-way system on the stairs because the corridors are so full. It is having to use up its reserves to pay for essential maintenance. There is damp on the walls in some of the classrooms and condensation on the windows. This popular and high-achieving school needs Government funding to allow it to remain so. It is simply not big enough, and parts of it are literally falling down.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-27_para13">
<a name="stpa_240">When I asked the Minister whether provision was being made to build a new secondary school in Wellingborough, I received a written answer stating that as part of the building schools for the future programme, Northamptonshire schools are due to be refurbished or rebuilt over the next six to 14&nbsp;years. Six to fourteen years? This work needs to be carried out now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-27_para14">
<a name="stpa_241">In response to a second question that I asked about a new secondary school in Wellingborough, the Minister said that the Wellingborough area of Northamptonshire is prioritised towards the end of the building schools for the future programme. Apart from the obvious paradox that nothing is prioritised if it is at the end of a list, that means that, three times over, year 7&nbsp;students could start secondary school and go through the whole of their secondary education before the existing Wellingborough schools are refurbished, yet those schools are in desperate need of repair now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-27_para15">
<a name="stpa_242">There is currently no real choice for parents and children in Wellingborough. If children are not granted their first choice of school, they are rarely granted their second choice. The only pupils who seem to have a real choice of school are those with special educational needs. That is most welcome, but although it is important that statemented children should be able to go to the school that parents believe will cater best for the children&#039;s needs, it is equally important that the right funding and resources are put into these schools to help facilitate SEN pupils throughout their schooling. I do not believe that that is happening in Wellingborough.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-27_para16">
<a name="stpa_243">Schools in Wellingborough are oversubscribed and some have been forced to take on extra pupils over their maximum intakes. At Wollaston school, years 7&nbsp;and 9&nbsp;are over the 240&nbsp;maximum. At the Wrenn school years 7, 8&nbsp;and 10&nbsp;have more pupils than the 250&nbsp;maximum. Last year, Sir Christopher Hatton school was oversubscribed by more than 40&nbsp;pupils who put it down as their first choice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-27_para17">
<a name="stpa_244">It is clear from what I have said today that Wellingborough needs a new secondary school, and given the huge increase in development over the next 15&nbsp;years, we need it now. I ask the Minister to be good enough to deal with the following points. First, what are the mechanisms necessary to get a new secondary school built? Secondly, when can we realistically expect a new secondary school in Wellingborough to be opened? Thirdly, in the intervening period, will he undertake to look at providing more funding so that existing schools can expand for the benefit of all the pupils in Wellingborough?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-27_para18">
<a name="stpa_245">I believe that the demolition of John Lea school may have been a genuine mistake, but it is essential that the Government, working with the local education authority, take urgent action to correct the situation.

<p><a name="st_410"><a name="51202-28_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Phil Hope): </b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) on securing this debate. I am aware of his interest in this issue from the parliamentary questions that he has tabled in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_246">Changes to school provision in an area are essentially a matter for local decision. The local authority has a statutory responsibility for planning sufficient school places and for proposing to close schools and to open new ones. These duties are further strengthened in the schools White Paper, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, and I shall say more about that later if time allows.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_247">The hon. Gentleman asked about the relevant mechanisms, and I will start by talking about the present school organisation arrangements and why they came about. Before this Government took office in 1997, proposals for changes to schools often came to the Secretary of State for a decision. We considered that those matters were best decided locally, however, and a new system was put in place by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_248">If a local authority decides that there is a need for a new school, it must first consult in the local area. Among those bodies that we advise should be consulted are any schools affected by the proposals, as well as parents and teachers in the area. I am pleased to say that the guidance was revised in September, when local Members of Parliament were added to the list, as were the local district and parish councils in the area in which the schools are situated. Local authorities are responsible for planning for school places in their area. They have a statutory duty to ensure that there are sufficient places and that high quality education is provided in a cost-effective way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_249">I understand that Northamptonshire updated its school organisation plan in September this year. The new plan shows that the authority expects the number of secondary pupils in Wellingborough to increase gradually between now and 2008. However, there are at present 425&nbsp;surplus places in the town. I shall come back to that point in more detail in a moment. In the longer term, a new secondary school might be required, and if Northamptonshire decides that such a school is needed to cater for a growth in the local population, the mechanism requires it to hold a competition in accordance with the provisions of the Education Act 2002. We have introduced competitions because we want to encourage a wide range of educational providers to come forward and promote schools that have a strong ethos. This is all part of our aim to drive up standards and to ensure that every child has the opportunity to go to a good school.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_250">As the hon. Gentleman has asked, I shall explain what would happen should Northamptonshire decide to hold a competition. First, the authority would publish a notice inviting interested parties to bring forward proposals for the new secondary school. The authority would then publish a summary of all the proposals received and any that it wished to make itself, as the local authority. Anyone would be able to pass comments on any of the proposals, be they objections or 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Dec 2005 : Column 582</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>expressions of support. The authority would then submit all proposals and comments to the school organisation committee for consideration. The committee would pass the proposals, with its comments, to the Secretary of State for a decision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_251">Of course, any promoter may publish proposals for a new foundation or voluntary school at any time, under the existing arrangements, to increase diversity. There does not need to be a general shortage of places. Such proposals are decided by the school organisation committee, or by the schools adjudicator if the committee cannot reach unanimous agreement. The committee may approve proposals only if it is satisfied that any capital necessary to implement the proposals has been secured. I hope that I have described the mechanism in a straightforward manner.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_252">Under the normal funding arrangements, the Department for Education and Skills is allocating Northamptonshire schools more than &#163;78&nbsp;million of capital over the next three years. We expect that money to be used for its priority needs, including the provision of statutory school places. It includes an element to cover pupil number increases. However, local authorities can also apply to the targeted capital fund&#151;the TCF&#151;every two years, if they have exceptional growth that they cannot fund from other sources.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_253">Northamptonshire has been allocated &#163;12&nbsp;million from the TCF for 2006&#150;07&nbsp;for a replacement school in another part of the county where it is prioritising need. Northamptonshire did not apply in the TCF round for 2007&#150;08&nbsp;funding. It will have a further opportunity in due course to apply for 2008&#150;09&nbsp;funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_254">On the revenue side, Northamptonshire has benefited from an increase in its total funding for education of &#163;1,100&nbsp;per pupil in real terms since 1997. We will announce in the near future the school funding settlement for 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08, including each local authority&#039;s allocations of the new dedicated schools grant for each of those years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_255">In the longer term, the building schools for the future programme&#151;a massive investment in schooling&#151;will support investment in all secondary schools in Northamptonshire, including new schools, where there is a need. Northamptonshire is expected to enter the building schools for the future programme in waves seven to nine&#151;2011&#150;14&#151;with projects in Northampton and Corby. It has proposed five geographical groupings of schools for its building schools for the future investment. Wellingborough, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, is prioritised in the final tranche of investment in waves 13&nbsp;to 15, in 2017&#150;18.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_256">I want to set out the detail of the local position that the hon. Gentleman described. I understand that since the closure of the John Lea school more than seven years ago in July 1998, Wellingborough has been served by three secondary schools. The John Lea school was closed because the number of pupils on the roll fell below 50, with more than 90&nbsp;per cent. surplus places, and funding empty places, as we know, can represent a poor use of resources. The three remaining schools&#151;Sir Christopher Hatton, the Weavers school and Wrenn school&#151;now have 425&nbsp;spare places between them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_257">I am aware&#151;and the hon. Gentleman mentioned&#151;that the Weavers school has been in special measures since November 2004. In conjunction with Ofsted, the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Dec 2005 : Column 583</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>authority is addressing that. The new head teacher is helping the process and two additional school governors have been appointed to provide additional support. The local authority is also supporting the school, and there have been discussions with Department for Education and Skills advisers about how that can most effectively be done The Department has partnered Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire for the new relationship with schools. Each school will be allocated a school improvement partner, who are mostly experienced head teachers and senior managers in schools. They will provide high-quality support, challenge and monitoring. Given the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern about the quality of education at that school and its current position, I advise him strongly to get active and join the school and local authority in finding ways in which the school can turn the situation around.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_258">On the question of growth, which has been raised by the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members in the Chamber, the authority is confident that recent enlargements to its secondary schools will provide sufficient capacity to meet future demand for places in the medium term. In the longer term, Northamptonshire might decide that a new secondary school will be required to cater for growth in the local population, but that will be a decision for Northamptonshire at a local level. I understand that there are no current plans to open a further secondary school in Wellingborough, but the local authority will monitor that situation and the progress with growth projections, which he mentioned earlier.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_259">I have described the situation that pertains to date, so I shall briefly mention some of the changes that we propose in the White Paper, which might have some future relevance to the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman. Building on the progress that we have made 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 Dec 2005 : Column 584</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>since 1997, our aim is to transform our school system, so that every child receives an excellent education, whatever their background and wherever they live.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para14">
<a name="stpa_260">The White Paper sets out our plans to improve radically the system by putting parents and the needs of their children at the heart of our school system. We will ensure that every school delivers an excellent education, that every child achieves to their potential and that the system as a whole is increasingly driven by parents and by choice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para15">
<a name="stpa_261">We are going to introduce tougher rules for failing schools. Schools in special measures will be more quickly turned around and where no progress is made after a year a competition for new providers will be held. Schools that receive a notice to improve from Ofsted will enter special measures within a year if progress is not made. Parents will be able to urge Ofsted action, or request new providers. Where there is strong demand or dissatisfaction with existing choices, local authorities will have to respond to their concerns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para16">
<a name="stpa_262">Time does not allow me to go into more detail unfortunately, but there is a new approach, in particular with the abolition of school organisation committees, which gives local authorities a key role in making decisions on the most appropriate schools for an area. The authority will be expected to assess proposals that it receives on their merits and approve the one that best meets the needs of the area. Under the new regime, it will be possible for a local authority&#039;s decision to be challenged, in which case the schools adjudicator will make a decision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51202-28_para17">
<a name="stpa_263">I hope that I have described the mechanisms, outlined some of the factors that will affect a decision in terms of timing&#151;
