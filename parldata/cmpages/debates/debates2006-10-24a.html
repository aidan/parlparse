work, and to consider all the evidence on the clinical effectiveness of

the final appraisal determination is still subject to such appeal. At

that balanced clinical effectiveness with cost-effectiveness. I do not
dispute that myeloma is an awful condition, of which some 4,000 new

what the Minister says about the independence of NICE, but NICE is
answering the question that the Government have asked it. What is
different about the process here? Why are other European countries
coming up with the answer that Velcade is both clinically effective and

that that was not the case? Has the Minister considered how this is
handled in other countries, and whether we can learn from

not right to jump on the bandwagon for political purposes whenever a

whether treatments are effective or not. We must give a clear line to
the public, and not raise false expectations. That is what NICE has
been seeking to do, and Opposition parties have supported it before. I
believe that it is when decisions are difficult that we owe NICE the
most support, and all parties in the House should provide that support

not back treatments such as Velcade? If no one had backed insulin two
generations ago, people would still be dying of diabetes in great
numbers rather than leading longer and more fulfilling lives. We really
must do more to turn incurable, dreadful diseases such as myeloma into
chronic illnesses. I agree that we should not jump on bandwagons, but
we should show faith, provide support and produce the necessary
resources to give hope to thousands of families in the United

find a way forward that allows patients to receive the drug for a

The inequalities in deaths from coronary heart disease, stroke and

attention to dealing with the different determinants that affect
people&#146;s life chances and health. Our work with local
authorities is very important in that respect, as are the mandatory
targets for health inequalities in local area agreements. The
forthcoming White Paper will ensure that there is a good working
partnership with local communities in the delivery of health. However,
I will look at what my hon. Friend has said, and get back to
him.</p><p><a name="06102455000088"><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew53"><a name="06102455000518">Richard

which quality will be raised will be through the PSHE certificate for
teachers and nurses, which will increase their confidence in delivering
the subject. However, there are good examples of schools that are
working in partnership with others&#151;both inside and outside the
school&#151;to deliver the sort of sexual health services that young
people require. We need to make sure that appropriate information is
given, although that can be delivered by a number of different
individuals and organisations. Young people certainly complain about
the patchy nature of PSHE. As they grow into young adults, clearly the
process must be continued with good advice about the range of
contraceptives available that NICE supports the use of, and the
promotion of by our

fact that this morning there was clear Government spin that there would
be a statement in the House on the serious issue of immigration from
Romania and Bulgaria into this country, in light of their accession to
the European Union on 1 January 2007? You will be aware that there has

Mark Lancaster (North-East Milton Keynes) (Con):</b> I beg to
move,</p><a name="61024-0004.htmbrev_1"><a name="06102455000415"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be
given to bring in a Bill to require that toughened plastic be used for
drinking vessels in late night bars, public houses and clubs; and for
connected
purposes.</p></ul><p><a name="06102455000174">My
Bill is an attempt to reduce the number of people who are seriously
injured during alcohol-related violence. In a nutshell, it would enable
local authorities to designate, if required, &#147;drinking
districts&#148; in town and city centres where it would be mandatory
for alcohol served after 11 pm to be served in plastic or toughened
glass. I wish to make it clear from the start that my Bill would have a
relatively narrow impact on selected licensed premises&#151;namely,
late-night venues in busy town and city centres. It is certainly not
intended that it should have an impact on the many traditional
stand-alone pubs and private members&#146; clubs in towns and rural
communities that keep more traditional
hours.</p><p><a name="06102455000175">In Milton
Keynes, we are only too aware of the dangers of glass bottles and
glasses. In the early hours of Christmas morning 2004, a constituent of
mine, Blake Golding, was the victim of a brutal attack while working as
doorman. At the age of 22, he was shockingly scarred for life while he
went to the aid of a female colleague. The sad fact is that that
horrendous incident could have been prevented had Blake&#146;s
attacker not had access to a glass bottle.</p><p><a name="06102455000176">The terrifying truth is that
bars and clubs have extremely dangerous weapons at arm&#146;s reach.
A glass or bottle is potentially lethal in anybody&#146;s hands.
On 14 June 2005, a campaign was set up by the Golding family.
As a result, more than 18,000 people, including hundreds of police
officers and bar managers, have signed a petition calling for a ban on
glass drinking vessels in late-night clubs and bars. The success of the
campaign is a testament to the determination of the Golding family and
the support shown by the local press and institutions.</p><p><a name="06102455000177">Unfortunately, the problem of
annealed bottles and glasses being used as violent weapons has largely
remained unaddressed. I am not the first to raise the issue on the
Floor of the House, and I fear that if we do not make changes soon, I
will not be the last. These are readily available weapons with the
potential to kill or cause great harm, as Blake&#146;s case
demonstrates. Hon. Members may be surprised to learn that glass bottles
and glasses are the most common weapons used in violent assaults in the
United Kingdom. That is not unexpected when we consider how many drinks
are served in glass containers each year. In the UK alone, more than
5.6 billion pints are served in bars, pubs and clubs, along
with almost 6.8 million bottles of beer, 4.2 million bottles of
alcopops and 313,000 bottles of wine. Research shows that there is a
strong correlation between alcohol consumption and violent behaviour. A
study by the Prime Minister&#146;s strategy unit found that 1.2
million incidents of alcohol-induced violence are reported every year.
The 2005 British crime survey points out that in 44 per cent. of all
violent incidents reported, the victim described the assailant as being
under the influence of alcohol at the time of the

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1386</b><br>assault. Everyone is aware of the associated risks of glass drinking
vessels. Unfortunately, it takes a tragic event such as that involving
Blake to shock people into supporting a proposed change to the
law.</p><p><a name="06102455000178">I must take
this opportunity to congratulate Bar Mee in Milton Keynes. It became
the first bar in the city to serve drinks solely in safe plastic
glasses and bottles, in an attempt to reduce the number of bottle
attacks. I also praise the policy of Yates&#146;s wine bars, which
has already made the switch to using shatterproof plastic glass in all
its establishments nation wide. It is our job to support such
initiatives, and to make multilayered plastic bottles and glasses the
norm in bars and clubs throughout the country which operate late at
night and in the early hours of the morning.</p><p><a name="06102455000179">Many other towns and cities
across the United Kingdom are experiencing a rapid expansion of their
night-time entertainment districts. Although many communities enjoy the
economic benefits that that brings, unfortunately such expansion is
often accompanied by an increase in crime and disorder owing to the
concentration of pubs and clubs and the large amounts of alcohol that
are consumed. In 2003 in Glasgow city centre, there were 313 serious
assaults, 81 of which involved glass bottles, and similar
statistics apply in any part of the country where a central drinking
quarter has sprung up. In Glasgow, steps were taken to replace glass
with plastic and that, combined with other measures taken by the
police, has helped to result in a reduction in the number of serious
injuries in the city centre.</p><p><a name="06102455000180">Clearly, we
have to accept that if someone really wants to act in a violent manner,
a weapon will invariably be found. Although I do not believe for one
second that this Bill will eradicate all violent behaviour, I do
believe that, by reducing the number of weapons available to violent
people, the Bill will make a major contribution to increasing public
safety. If the glass used to attack Blake Golding in Milton Keynes had
been multilayered plastic or polycarbonated glass, he would not have
suffered the degree of injury that he did.</p><p><a name="06102455000181">More than
half of the reported incidents of alcohol-related violence result in
some form of injury. In a fifth of those incidents, the perpetrator of
the attack had a weapon that they had threatened to use&#151;usually
a glass or bottle. Steps have been taken across the country to reduce
that, and I would like to praise the work of Cardiff council and
Cardiff police for the dramatic 70 per cent. reduction in
altercations involving glass bottles and glasses that they have
produced through their proactive work in stopping people carrying glass
drinking vessels on the streets of
Cardiff.</p><p><a name="06102455000182">I shall now
turn to the need for the Bill. The Licensing Act 2003 does not allow
licensing authorities to add a condition to a premises licence unless
an application for review of the licence is made or, during the
application process for a new or varied licence, a representation is
made by a responsible authority such as the police or another
interested party. With all premises licenses issued and valid
indefinitely, the opportunity to consider whether a glass condition
could be added to a licence now only arises if a review is sought or
the licence is
varied.</p><p><a name="06102455000183">To use Milton
Keynes as an example, Thames Valley police have been making
representations where variations have been sought, and approximately a 
<br>

<meta name="Date" content="24 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1387</b><br>dozen premises now have the condition. But for existing unchanging
premises, conditions can only be imposed if a review has been
requested&#151;for example, by the police as a responsible authority.
There appears to be some difficulty in obtaining evidence against
individual premises in city centre locations, particularly when
incidents occur in the street. The local publicity that Blake
Golding&#146;s campaign received did lead to voluntary compliance by
pubs and clubs being achieved, but management and ownership do change,
and without a condition on the premises, licence enforcement is simply
not possible.</p><p><a name="06102455000184">The
pepper-potting of premises with conditions alongside those without
conditions in the city centre area also gives rise to problems,
particularly in respect of external drinking areas, and such problems
will, no doubt, increase with the implementation of the smoking ban
next summer. Even where a premises is subject to a condition, it is
easy to see how a situation can develop where people take glasses and
bottles to use as weapons from tables outside adjacent premises where
there is no restriction.</p><p><a name="06102455000185">A typical drinking
establishment found in many city and town centres usually operates as
a</p><a name="61024-0004.htmbrev_2"><a name="06102455000416"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;high volume vertical
drinking
premises&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102455000186">&#151;a high
turnover establishment where the vast majority of people are standing
to drink, not sitting down. Although often not the fault of management,
it is in these establishments that violence can erupt as young adults
are encouraged to drink in a crowded environment. For that reason,
local councils should have the power to establish, where necessary,
&#147;drinking districts&#148; in which it would be mandatory for
any licence holder serving alcohol after 11 pm to use multilayered
plastic drinking vessels. Village and stand-alone town and city pubs
not in a designated drinking district would not be forced to serve
their local customers with plastic drinking vessels. However, the
current laws would allow councils to place mandatory regulations on
these premises, should the police deem their safety record
poor.</p><p><a name="06102455000187">Although the
Bill&#146;s scope is relatively narrow, it is clear that plastic
bottles and glasses would allow for a safer drinking and social
environment, lessen insurance premiums for pubs and clubs and provide a
safer working environment for bar staff to operate in. However, these
are just small benefits compared with the opportunity to save lives and
to prevent serious injuries.</p><p><a name="06102455000188"><i> Question put and agreed

extradition enabled the UK to extradite without prima facie evidence.
Since 1991, when it came into force, scores of people who were wanted
for very serious offences have been extradited from this country
without prima facie evidence. I have no doubt that the world, including
this island, is a safer place because of that convention. In the same
way, the UK has been able to bring people back here to face justice in
our own courts. I salute those on the Opposition Benches who were
members of the Government at that time for their foresight and common
sense. Sadly, however, some of those same Members and others on those
Benches thought that the decision to extend those provisions to our
arrangements with the United States&#151;a decision that the official
Opposition did not oppose in 2003&#151;should be reversed. Why?
People have been extradited from here to the United States, and vice
versa, for more than 100 years. We trust the United States&#146;
system just as it trusts ours&#151;it is as trustworthy as that of
our neighbours in Europe&#151;and its Bill of Rights safeguards
defendants&#146; rights in its courts just as our convention on human
rights does in ours. So, what could be the
problem?</p><p><a name="06102455000214"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew151"><a name="06102455000616">David
Howarth (Cambridge) (LD):</b> Is not the real difference
between evidence on the one side and information on the other? Does not
that mean that, in the United States, it is possible for someone to
challenge the evidence on the substance of the case against them, in
terms of whether it is believable and whether it could be
negated&#151;or, to use the American term, obliterated&#151;by
other evidence? In this country, however, that is not possible. That is
an important difference, and the Minister should recognise that that is
the difference that she is talking about.</p><p><a name="06102455000215"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew152"><a name="06102455000617">Joan

asked. What could be the problem? Why do Opposition Members want the US
not to be in this relationship with us? Could it be something to do
with the new extradition treaty that our countries signed in 2003? That
treaty was under discussion, by the way, before the terrible events of
September 2001. The treaty was necessary to bring our extradition
arrangements with the United States up to date, to enable us to
co-operate with each other effectively, and to fight the ever-changing
threats of 21st century crime.

entitled to some kind of exemption. There is no such thing as a
victimless crime. The victims of fraud have no choice about being
victims, whereas the person who perpetrates fraud makes a choice. The
victims of fraud often lose their savings and their pensions. The fact
that people can subsequently be convicted does not restore to victims
what they have lost. These are therefore very serious matters. The
right hon. Gentleman will know that when the effects of a crime are
judged to be primarily in another state, where the evidence and
witnesses are based, our independent prosecutor system decides whether

able to achieve ratification in the US Senate, but Baroness Scotland
went to the United States and persuaded the Senate that ratification
was right. The measures in this treaty, which bring great benefits to
British citizens in terms of delivering justice, are worthy of a little
attention. It saddens me that Opposition Members do not want to talk
about what is actually in the treaty, but are entirely focused on the
points in the Extradition Act 2003, which we have discussed ad
infinitum. I ask them to address some of the issues in the

speciality protection could be very important.
&#147;Speciality&#148; means that when someone is extradited they
can be tried only for the conduct on the extradition warrant. That is
an obvious protection of their rights, but what if our police
found&#151;after the person had been returned here&#151;that he was
also the prime suspect in a completely separate crime? And what if it
was a very serious crime, such as a sexual attack on a child or a
terrorist offence? It has happened in real cases that such offences
have come to light after extradition. Would it not be in the interests
of justice and the victims of the crime to be able to prosecute those
offences as well? Waiver of speciality enables that to happen where
appropriate. It is essential that we have that measure in our
arrangements with the United
States.</p><p><a name="06102455000260"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew187"><a name="06102455000652">Emily

Ryan:</b> As I said, I want to move on and deal with each of
the three Lords amendments in
turn.</p><p><a name="06102455000283">The first of the
amendments restores the prima facie evidence requirement in US
requests, to which I referred earlier. Much has been said about claimed
differences in the standards of evidence required by the US system and
ours. The fourth amendment to the US constitution refers to
&#147;probable cause&#148;, stating that</p><a name="61024-0004.htmbrev_14"><a name="06102455000443"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;no warrants shall issue, but upon
probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly
describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be
seized.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102455000284">In the UK, the
law that applies is section 71(4) of the Extradition Act, which states
that</p><a name="61024-0004.htmbrev_15"><a name="06102455000444"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the judge may issue
a warrant...if the judge has reasonable grounds for believing
that...there is information that would justify the issue of a
warrant for the arrest of a
person&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102455000285">Clearly,
those standards are not exact replicas&#151;of course not; our system
is not exactly replicated in any other country&#151;but they are very
similar, and much closer than before. I remind Members that other
robust safeguards in our extradition law can, and do, prevent unjust
extradition, and they have been upheld in several cases taken to the
High
Court.</p><p><a name="06102455000286"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew205"><a name="06102455000670">Lynne
Jones:</b> On the point about rough reciprocity, in previous
debates in this and the other place Ministers stated that probable
cause is a lower cause than prima facie, but a higher threshold than we
ask of the US. Ministers have, therefore, acknowledged that lack of
reciprocity, although I agree with my hon. Friend that it is not
reciprocity that is important, but
justice.</p><p><a name="06102455000287"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew206"><a name="06102455000671">Joan
Ryan:</b> I think I have covered that point more than once
this afternoon, and we shall no doubt come back to it more than once as
the debate continues. Rough parity is all that is possible unless we
harmonise our legislation, which we do not propose to do. Rough parity
means that we are as close as we can get to having the same standard of
evidence required in the US or the UK for an extradition request to be
confirmed.</p><p><a name="06102455000288">The second
amendment from the other place requires the judge who is considering
the request to refuse it if any of the conduct was carried out in the
UK, unless it would be in the interests of justice to extradite the
person. I understand that some Members attended a briefing this
afternoon by the supporters of the amendment, so I shall explain why
amendments Nos. 81 to 84 will not solve the problem as they see it. We
cannot remedy one problem&#151;real or perceived&#151;by
substituting another.</p><p><a name="06102455000289">There are
several reasons why these amendments are wrong. The first is the
difficulty that they would impose on the judge in coming to a
reasonable decision on a case without having access to all the
evidence, which may itself not be in the interests of justice and could
lead to the person being tried twice. Alternatively, it could result in
someone accused of serious cross-border offences escaping justice
altogether. Where prosecutors have decided that a case should be tried
in country A, rather than country B or C, it is not proper for a judge
to second-guess that. If a person is requested for extradition, the
Extradition Act in any case&#151;right now&#151;provides for the
extradition to be halted if the prosecutors here decide to take
proceedings. So the amendment is both unnecessary in the interests of
justice, and wrong.</p><br>

Prosecution Service seriously consider whether there should be a
prosecution in this country? Is it not just as likely that the

look seriously at such matters. I refer him back to the answer that I
gave my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore): of
course these issues have been raised, and the Attorney-General and the
Home Secretary are having conversations with the Attorney-General of
the United States about the system. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) said, this is not just about the
United States&#151;although I am afraid that in this instance it is,
because those are the amendments before us. Perhaps he, like me, is
thinking that there are 50 countries in this category. I can reassure
him that one of the strengths of our prosecution system is that it is
independent of the judiciary. We do not wish to discard that, and the
amendment would mean that we had to discard it.</p><p><a name="06102455000292">Our prosecutors do consider the
cases. As I have said&#151;I hope that this reassures my hon. Friend,
because we have seen cases in which this has happened&#151;if the
prosecutors, such as the Crown Prosecution Service, the Serious
Organised Crime Agency and the Financial Services Authority, decide
that there is a case to answer here, that takes precedence. That is why
the amendment is both unnecessary and wrong. However, the Government
recognise that much concern has been expressed about the fairness of
our provisions&#151;rightly or wrongly&#151;and that there is a
widespread perception that there is a lack of clarity. In view of that,
as I have said, the Attorney-General has already raised the issue with
his counterparts in the United States.</p><p><a name="06102455000293">As I also said in response to
my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, the proposed procedures envisage
early consultation on any case which it appears to a prosecutor in one
country that there is a real possibility of a prosecutor in the other
country having an interest in prosecuting. That does not need to be
repeated further. Reassurance has been provided on that point. These
proposals would not contain the serious flaws of the
Opposition&#146;s forum amendments, and would, I am sure, provide
business people and others with reassurance that the Government have
listened to their concerns and taken action. My right hon. Friend the
Home Secretary will meet the Attorney-General in the next few days to
discuss these matters, to take that
forward.</p><p><a name="06102455000294"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew209"><a name="06102455000674">Several

want to tackle head on a mistake that the Minister allowed to emerge
from her speech when she cited section 71 of the Extradition Act 2003
and tried to gain support from that provision for the assertion that
the concepts of information and evidence were precisely the same.
Either she does not understand section 71, or she has misread it. A
careful or, indeed, cursory reading of the provision makes it clear
that evidence and information are wholly different concepts and that
they are applicable in different jurisdictions. Evidence is what we
have to show to the United States, while information is what the United
States has to provide to our courts. The two concepts are not the same
and the 2003 Act does not say that they are, so it was wrong of the
Minister to mislead the House, albeit unwittingly, by saying that they
were similar
concepts.</p><p><a name="06102455000300"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew212"><a name="06102455000677">Tony

been ratified by the United States Senate, it is not yet clear whether
the President of the United States has signed the relevant legislation
into law. In a sense, that might not matter to the argument that I will
make against the Government&#146;s conduct of the treaty and their
acceptance of its
contents.</p><p><a name="06102455000303">My complaint
is that in March 2003 our Government, through the then Home Secretary,
the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr.
Blunkett), reached an agreement with the then United States
Attorney-General, Mr. John Ashcroft, that replaced the 1972
British-American extradition treaty and, in doing so, did not protect
our national interest. The new treaty is neither fair nor based in
justice. The 1972 treaty set out each country&#146;s obligations to
the other. It was fair, just, balanced and transparent. The treaty
allowed for the extradition of people from here to the United States if
a prima facie case of criminal conduct could be shown in America that
matched, or was similar to, a crime in this jurisdiction. We could
extradite from the United States to Britain if we could show probable
cause. I accept that there was a difference in wording, but, in all
practical terms, the treaty demanded an equal legal test. In short, we
had a treaty that honoured the doctrine of reciprocity. Each country
had to show that there was evidence in the hands of the prosecution
that, if uncontradicted by evidence from the accused, would be
sufficient to justify conviction or demonstrate reasonable grounds for
a suspicion of
guilt.</p><p><a name="06102455000304">The 2003 treaty
was signed by the two Governments without prior notice to the House. It
was negotiated and signed behind our backs. We can speculate on the
reason why the Government chose not to let us in on the secret, but
until the former Home Secretary writes that part of his diaries, it can
only be speculation. Was it part of some side deal on Iraq, or
something to do with advancing the peace process in Northern Ireland?
Was it because he did not know what he was doing, or because he was
under such domestic pressure that he could not think straight? Who
knows?</p><p><a name="06102455000305">We know,
however, that the secret treaty of 2003 upset the balance of the 1972
treaty. The Americans need no longer demonstrate a prima facie case,
but we must still show probable cause. They need only provide
information, but we must have evidence, and the two are by no means
identical concepts in law. That is what is fundamentally wrong with the
current treaty. Even though the United States ratified it during our
summer recess&#151;all of us would accept that it took far too long
to do so&#151;it is a treaty to which the Government should not have
agreed. Indeed, they would not have been allowed to agree to it if they
had asked Parliament&#146;s permission before signing
it.</p><p><a name="06102455000306">The Government
have never given any good reason for the provisions in the treaty that
set a lower test for the United States than for the United Kingdom and
which were made law in this country by the Extradition Act 2003. Nor
has any good reason been given for the Home Secretary excluding the
United States from the list of countries required to show a prima facie
case under the designation order of November 2003. Why has the United
States been removed, by Government order, from the list of countries in
category 2 that have to show a prima facie case?</p><br>

the interests of justice to do so&#151;a point made by my hon. Friend
the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry). It is the judges who make the
orders, not the prosecutors. The 1991 European convention on

The hon. Gentleman should understand that there is no reciprocity
between the obligations imposed upon the United States as a requesting
jurisdiction to Britain, as compared with Britain&#146;s obligations
when requesting extradition from the United States. So internally,
within the treaty, there is no reciprocity. There is no balance. There
is no meeting of obligations. That is point 1.

was no identical reciprocity. I accept that. The Home Secretary is
mumbling again. Let me explain to him, too, as he is listening. It is
very good of him to turn up. Under the 1973 treaty, we had to
demonstrate probable cause in the United States; the US had to
demonstrate a prima facie case in this country. We all
accept&#151;there is no controversy about this&#151;that those were
not exactly equal terms, but to all intents and purposes the courts on
both sides of the Atlantic treated them as equal tests. They were both
based on evidence. Now we have a different test.
<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> We still have to demonstrate
probable cause. That essentially means evidence that can be tested and
which, if uncontradicted, allows a court to reach the conclusion that
there is a good case to answer and that the person who is under the
request is suspected of being guilty. The United States merely has to
lodge with our courts information that comprises essentially untested
allegations.</p><p><a name="06102455000323"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew222"><a name="06102455000687">The

of the issues that we are addressing. It is important that we make that
distinction, and also that we record some proper concerns about the
process that has led to where we are
today.</p><p><a name="06102455000347">Let
me give some key dates. On 28 November 2002, the Home Affairs
Committee&#151;chaired by my predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member
for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin)&#151;reported on the
Extradition Bill. Its Second Reading took place on December 2002, the
treaty was agreed at the end of March 2003, and the
legislation was enacted at the end of that session. The USA was added
to list 2 of the legislation at the end of 2003, and, by that, the
unilateral decision was taken to drop the evidence requirements on the
USA. The Senate has only now ratified the treaty.</p><p><a name="06102455000348">There should be some concerns
about the speed at which those events took place. When&#151;before I
chaired it&#151;the Committee reported on the Extradition Bill in
2002, it reported the Home Office position at that time. The Home
Office had stated
that</p><a name="61024-0004.htmbrev_19"><a name="06102455000448"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there is a case for
removing the prima facie evidential requirement from certain
Commonwealth countries and bilateral treaty
partners&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102455000349">but</p><a name="61024-0004.htmbrev_20"><a name="06102455000449"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there
are no current plans to negotiate bilateral extradition treaties with
any new countries&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102455000350">That
was reported in November 2002, and the treaty was finalised and agreed
at the end of March 2003&#151;a very short period later.</p><br>

Extradition Act has always worried me because I was the Minister of
State who moved the Bill&#146;s Second Reading on 9 December 2002.
Since that time I have been unable to remember anything that was under
way with the USA in respect of these matters. Short-term memory loss is
always a possible explanation in this place, but parliamentary protocol
requires that if a Bill is not introduced by a Secretary of State, it
is introduced by a Minister of State rather than an Under-Secretary of
State, so I was not the sponsor-Minister of the Bill; I picked it up,
as it were, at the last moment, to move it.</p><p><a name="06102455000352">There was almost no reference
at all in that debate to the United States of America. Indeed, about
the only one I can find was made by the right hon. Member for Witney
(Mr. Cameron), who asked for an assurance. He
said:</p><a name="61024-0004.htmbrev_21"><a name="06102455000450"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As the
Minister is aware, many important extraditions have not gone ahead

rights&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06102455000353">and he referred
to</p><a name="61024-0004.htmbrev_22"><a name="06102455000451"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Soering
judgment, in which someone accused of murder could not be extradited to
the United
States&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102455000354">because of that
convention, and he
asked:</p><a name="61024-0004.htmbrev_23"><a name="06102455000452"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;What
will the Bill do to try to streamline such cases and make the

40.]</p></ul><p><a name="06102455000355">So to the extent that any
interest was shown in the United States in that debate, it concerned
speeding up extraditions from this country to the USA, and the point
was made by the right hon. Member for Witney, who is now the Leader of
the Opposition. That was the tone of the
discussion.</p><p><a name="06102455000356"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew240"><a name="06102455000705">Mr.

time that I wrote to the permanent secretary of the Home Office during
the summer asking for a copy of the briefing pack that Ministers get on
such occasions&#151;such packs can ruin many a weekend for Ministers.
I simply put on the record that the briefing that I received as the
Minister handling that Bill contained no reference to treaty
negotiations being under way with the USA, or to any specific
plans&#151;other than the reference to other bilateral treaty
partners&#151;to include the USA in list 2.</p><p><a name="06102455000359">It seems inconceivable that
civil servants would have provided me with a briefing that made no
reference to treaty negotiations unless none were under way, and I can
only conclude that the treaty signed on 31 March 2003 had not even
started the negotiation process when the Extradition Bill was debated
in December 2002. That worries me greatly. There is every reason for
modernising our extradition arrangements with the USA, who are our most
important extradition partner. But our going from a standing start to
an entire treaty in about three months, given the many controversial
issues that have then followed, explains an awful lot about why we are
where we are. I cannot see any basis

for the decision to move ahead with the change of evidence
requirements, ahead of agreeing the treaty on both sides of the
Atlantic.</p><p><a name="06102455000360">There
was a problem with the extradition system, but it was almost entirely
to do with our failure to extradite criminals to the USA, rather than
the other way round. The USA had everything to gain from the new treaty
arrangement; we, in practice, had relatively little to gain. Most of
the people we wanted were here, and despite the key categories of sex
offenders to which my hon. Friend the Minister referred, and one or two

timetable and copies of draft treaties from the Home Office, so that we
could see the treaty&#146;s evolution and pin down its timing.
Understandably, the Home Office could not provide draft treaties,
because doing so would have breached our diplomatic relations with a
foreign country, so I have been unable to pin down the timing. I
therefore do not know why the treaty was agreed so rapidly. I merely
make the point that if that had been avoided, what is a now a very
emotive discussion could have taken place on a more rational

and I have occasionally had cause to be not entirely satisfied with the
quality of the briefing that one gets. But if a treaty had been under
negotiation, it is extraordinarily unlikely that the Home Office would
have told my predecessor Committee that there were no plans
to negotiate a further treaty, or that I, as a Minister, would not have
had something of that sort drawn to my attention in the background

has overshadowed the debate.</p><p><a name="06102455000367">I believe that we should resist
the Lords amendments on the substance of the issue. I shall make three
brief points and outline one aspect to which the Government need to
give much greater attention. Reciprocity is important but it has never
been an absolute principle in our law. For a long time after
introducing the Extradition Act 1870, we extradited people to many
countries that, on constitutional grounds, never extradited anyone back
to us. Parliament took the view that it was better to serve the
interests of justice in one direction even if they were not served in
the other. Reciprocity is not an absolute
principle.</p><p><a name="06102455000368">Whatever
concerns most of us have about many other justice systems, there is no
doubt that, if the United States did not have a constitutional bar to
dropping the requirement for prima facie evidence, it would, like the
other 50 countries on the list, be a country with which we had an
agreement not to require prima facie evidence. I accept that, as
Baroness Scotland said, there is no absolute parity in the test. Her
comments were accurate and the right hon. and learned Member for
Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) referred to them earlier.
However, is the difference so great that it creates genuine injustice
or are we pursuing a difference because we do not like the US at this
time in politics?</p><p><a name="06102455000369">Without the constitutional bar
in the US to dropping the requirement for prima facie evidence and with
a requirement for information on both sides, we would show little
hesitation in reaching an agreement. In that case, people would be
extradited from the US on exactly the same basis as people are
extradited from this country under the treaty. The big question is,
therefore, whether the difference is so great that we should support
the Lords amendment. I do not believe that it
is.</p><p><a name="06102455000370">My second point is
about &#147;forum&#148;, which the Lords amendments cover. If the
process had been more open and the treaty had been up for a longer
period of discussion and debate, we could have sorted out many such
matters. Determining the appropriate jurisdiction is complicated. There
were genuine concerns about the European arrest warrant when one of
those accused of taking part in the 21 July attempted bombings fled to
Italy. We were worried that demands could be made to try him in Italy
because it was suggested that he might have committed offences there.
We said that that would be wrong and that he must return here, where
the major crime took place. There are matters of judgment, and I am
unclear from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary&#146;s comments about
the exact criteria that the Crown Prosecution Service is expected to
use when judging whether someone should be tried here, if that is
possible, or in the US, if that is possible. Those criteria should be
made explicit. They do not form part of the treaty arrangements and
that is why we should not support the amendments, but the Government
need to set out more clearly the basis on which we expect the CPS to
make such
decisions.</p><p><a name="06102455000371"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew246"><a name="06102455000711">Mr.

point. These matters need to be made much clearer. Decisions are being
made about whether to prosecute and about where to prosecute, and they
get tangled up together. Judge Workman, in his judgment of 17 May 2005
in the case of Babar Ahmad, commented that this was</p><a name="61024-0004.htmbrev_24"><a name="06102455000453"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a difficult and troubling

British subject who is alleged to have committed offences which, if the
evidence were available, could have been prosecuted in this
country&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102455000374">It is not clear
to me whether the Crown Prosecution Service made a decision that that
case was not prosecutable in this country, but that Babar Ahmad could
still be extradited, or whether it decided that he could be prosecuted
but&#151;we must allow for this possibility&#151;that it would be
more appropriate for him to be prosecuted in another jurisdiction. The
criteria by which that important set of judgments was made should be
made much more public than they are at the moment.</p><p><a name="06102455000375">This whole story suggests that
there is a great deal that is not really very good about the way in
which we conclude treaties and scrutinise them in this place.
[Hon. Members: &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;] The
hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) has made
this point a number of times. Equally, we should not seek fundamentally
to amend the Extradition Act 2003 on the basis of an individual concern
about an individual treaty. Perhaps we need to step back from this
process and examine how we could do these things better in the future,

kind. We have not resiled from that position in any way since
then.</p><p><a name="06102455000378">Listening to
the debate on the issues, however, I have detected three convenient
fictions that have been propagated since that time. The first is that
those who oppose the treaty&#151;and, therefore, the unequal
provisions&#151;are doing so in response to an expensive public
relations campaign mounted on behalf of certain individuals, and that
this is all a matter of the guilt or innocence, presumed or otherwise,
of the NatWest three or, now, the chief executive of Morgan Crucible.
That is emphatically not the case. My colleagues and I opposed this
measure long before any of those cases were being considered, because
we believed in the justice of the case that we were putting
forward.</p><p><a name="06102455000379">I obviously
hope that those British citizens are found not to have been guilty of
the crimes of which they have been accused, but I have no way of
knowing the guilt or innocence of those individuals. That is not for me
to say; it is for a court to determine guilt or innocence. My job, and
the job of all parliamentarians, is to consider the process by which
our citizens face a court in a foreign land thousands of miles away on
charges of questionable validity in this
country.</p><p><a name="06102455000380"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew249"><a name="06102455000714">Tony
Baldry:</b> Is not it a particular concern that a number of
matters that are offences in the United States are not offences here?
The issue that all Members of the House must address is how they would
deal with a constituent who, like one of my constituents, has a brother
or sister who is subject to extradition to the United States for having
sold computer software to a university in Iran, which is not an offence
in the United Kingdom but appears to be an offence under US
jurisdiction. Someone is therefore threatened with extradition to the
US on a matter that is not an offence under UK law, which must be a
matter of concern for us all.</p><p><a name="06102455000381"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew250"><a name="06102455000715">Mr.

criminality in a moment, as it is extremely important.</p><p><a name="06102455000382">The second
convenient fiction is that those of us who have opposed the measure
from the beginning were doing so largely on the basis that it remained
unratified by the United States Administration. That is absolutely not
the case. Indeed, many of us have argued that ratification is almost
irrelevant because of the Government&#146;s pre-emptive action of
putting the measure into effect in British law a full three years
before it was ratified by the United States Senate&#151;we understand
that, although it has been passed by the Senate, it is still on the
President&#146;s desk, and the instruments of ratification have not
yet been exchanged. If the treaty is unfair and unequal, ratification
is irrelevant, as it is still not in the interests of the United
Kingdom and its citizens. That is our point.</p><p><a name="06102455000383">There is a slightly erudite
point, which ought at least to be mentioned, as to whether ratification
is possible if the amendments are retained in the legislation.

international treaties if we have legislation in contradiction of the

not for the House, which can only legislate on the basis of the
measures before it, and their implications for British citizens. It is
an illustration of the folly of using secondary legislation to put into
law provisions that were not subject to proper consideration by the

denunciation of what is undoubtedly an unequal treaty, with which no
one would disagree. The point with which I am struggling, which my
right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr.
Denham) articulated, is that we would undoubtedly have entered into a
fast-track treaty with the United States in any event. If that is the
case, and we have fast-track procedures with the United States, how are
our citizens any worse off because, on the other side, we must work
harder to get citizens out of that country? That is what I do not
understand.</p><p><a name="06102455000385"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew252"><a name="06102455000717">Mr.
Heath:</b> That is a fair comment but not a genuine concern.
We can expect from our Government due protection of British citizens,
which should take the form of prima facie evidence, except where there
are genuinely reciprocal arrangements for another standard of proof,
which we have with several countries. I agree with the comment of the
right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen that, had the matter been
approached properly through a sensible debate and negotiation on the
treaty, we could have arrived at a satisfactory conclusion. I also
agree that, prior to the latest treaty, we had an imbalance in the
other direction. I believe that the American authorities had a
marginally higher hurdle to overcome than the British authorities, and
I have always made that plain. But I think there was a greater
similarity between probable-cause and prima facie evidence, in that
both required evidence to be produced and an opportunity for the person
accused to refute that evidence before a court of law. That is the
difference between the situation then and the situation now: the
imbalance is now in the opposite direction. That evidence is not
required.</p><p><a name="06102455000386">The Minister
got into a bit of a muddle when trying to distinguish between evidence
and information in this context, but British citizens are clearly at a
disadvantage by comparison with United States citizens. I am arguing
first that they should not be at that disadvantage, and secondly that
the British Government should not have put them in a position in which
they could be at that disadvantage, because it is the duty of the
British Government to protect the interests of British citizens.
Perhaps the &#147;process&#148; point mentioned by the right hon.

explains the extraordinary neglect on the Government&#146;s part in
consideration of the treaty in the first

convenient fiction has been implied and not stated today, but it has
been current in the press. It is that somehow it is in the greater
interests of justice for this imbalance to occur, because of the
inadequacy of prosecution for white-collar offences in this country.
That was almost made explicit by Margaret Cole, director of enforcement
of the Financial Services Authority, who pointed out recently that
British criminal convictions were &#147;sparse&#148;. She
attributed that to greater public support for convictions for
white-collar crime in the United States, and therefore presumably a
greater predisposition of an American jury to convict by comparison
with a British
jury.</p><p><a name="06102455000390">I
have to say first that I consider that an entirely spurious argument,
and secondly that, if it is correct, what it suggests is that we have
inadequate prosecuting authorities in this area, not that we should
send people&#151;effectively under a sub-contracting
arrangement&#151;to stand trial in the United States. If there is a
perceived inadequacy in this area, the Government should be clear about
it, and should ensure that our prosecution authorities and our laws on
white-collar crime are as robust as those in the United
States.</p><p><a name="06102455000391">We come back
to the issue of parity. It has already been pointed out&#151;but I
shall do so again, because it is important&#151;that what the
Minister told us today is completely at odds with what was said by a
Minister of State in the other place during the passage of the original
order, and with what a House of Commons Minister, the hon. Member for
Don Valley (Caroline Flint), said in this Chamber: namely, that there
is now a lower requirement for the United States than there is for
Britain.</p><p><a name="06102455000392">It is
nonsense to say that there is rough parity when there is not&#151;for
all the reasons that we have already given&#151;and that there is no
difference between having to provide evidence and having to have it
questioned in court, and not being subject to that requirement. I hope
that that position will not be pursued. Let us be open and honest about
it and acknowledge that a lower standard of proof is required, but say
that it is in the best interests of the justice systems of the western
world, even if it is not equivalent to that of the
UK.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61024-0004.htmordayhd_9"><a name="06102455000464">5.30

Baldry) made the point, though he is no longer in his place. A relevant

helpful to rehearse in the House arguments for or against a particular

categorically could not happen is now happening as a consequence of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102455000397">Right from the
start, I rejected the view that this was all somehow necessary to deal
with terrorism and that something had to be rushed through because of
the need to deal with terrorist suspects. It was quite clear that the
scope was always wider than that. It was always applicable across the
whole range of potential criminal activity. Frankly, it appals me that
it was ever suggested that this was a limited treaty of extradition. It
was never that, as is now clear from current cases.</p><p><a name="06102455000398">We now face
circumstances in which the US has bilateral extradition arrangements
with 132 states and territories around the world. As the hon. and
learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) pointed out
earlier, there are just three countries with which the arrangements are
not fully reciprocated. The first is France, as no French citizen is
allowed to be extradited to stand trial in a foreign country. Those who
are not French citizens are happily exported, but not French citizens.
Secondly, there is the Republic of Ireland, where a forum
position&#151;similar to the Lords amendment&#151;ensures that, in
the interests of justice, the appropriate place for a trial is
considered. Then there is the UK, where we have sold the pass and are
prepared to act with supine acquiescence in everything that the
Americans want, simply rolling over and doing as we are told.</p><p><a name="06102455000399">The right

negotiation. The then Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for
Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), went across to
Washington and had this treaty presented to him. He was told that it
would be very helpful to the US authorities if he would just sign his
name at the bottom&#151;&#147;Thank you very much, Mr.
Home Secretary, that gives us exactly what we want&#148;. Simply
reading the treaty is enough to make the point: it is written in

is written in American English. It is as though it were dictated by the

clear that the Extradition Act 2003 and the treaty applied to all
crime, not just to terrorism. However serious a crime terrorism
is&#151;and it is very serious&#151;our extradition arrangements
apply across the board. The hon. Gentleman also talked about France not
extraditing its citizens, but he will&#151;I am sure&#151;be aware
that it has signed up to the European arrest warrant, so the situation
has changed. Crime changes and extradition arrangements need to change
as well. This is about modernising our extradition
arrangements.</p><p><a name="06102455000401"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew258"><a name="06102455000723">Mr.

thoroughly modern white flag and saluting it. I accept the
Minister&#146;s first proposition, because I said at the time that
the treaty was always intended to cover every crime. Some may have
changed their position on that, but I have not. She also mentioned
France&#146;s arrangements with regard to Council of Europe members
and the European arrest warrant. I did not deny that, but I was talking
about the bilateral arrangements between France and the US. It is a
fact that not a single other country or territory, not even Gibraltar
or the Channel islands, has the same unreciprocated arrangements as we
have with the US&#151;fact. That is not bluster: it is outrage on
behalf of our citizens that any Home Secretary should have signed such
an unequal
proposition.</p><p><a name="06102455000402"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew259"><a name="06102455000724">Robert

is also worth observing that in the case of French citizens and the
European arrest warrant, they will still have the convention
protections, which do not apply in the case of the US. The hon.
Gentleman also highlighted the problem with forum, which I have noticed
as a member of both the English Bar and the Irish Bar. In Ireland, the
very existence of the forum provision enables one to deal with a
situation in which one has to deal not only with offences that may not
have existed in law in the state from which extradition is sought, but
with massive disparities in sentence. For example, someone might be
chargeable with an offence that in Ireland or the UK carries a maximum
punishment of five years, but is extradited&#151;under a slightly
stretched analogy&#151;to the US, where it is punishable by 25 years
imprisonment. The forum provision provides some safeguard that is not
present in the Government&#146;s
proposals.</p><p><a name="06102455000403"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew260"><a name="06102455000725">Mr.

that can be left to the prosecuting authorities. It is an absurd
contention that somehow it is in the interests of justice for the
prosecuting authorities of the UK and the US to get together to decide
who would like first shot at a British subject. That is a matter for a
court to determine in the interests of justice. That is what is at
issue in these amendments.</p><br>

process of negotiation of the treaty. I suggest that the situation he
presented was mere speculation, but what is more troubling is the fact
that we have no means of knowing whether it is speculation or truth. We
congratulate ourselves on our parliamentary democracy, but we are very
bad at scrutinising treaty procedure. Surely there must be a way to
improve that so that we do our duty better by our
citizens.</p><p><a name="06102455000406"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew262"><a name="06102455000727">Mr.
Heath:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right on that last
point.</p><p><a name="06102455000407">What should we
do with this hopeless treaty? The short answer is that the Government
must renegotiate it to ensure that there is a genuine rough parity,
rather than an entirely imaginary one. In those negotiations, or even
before them, the Government could consider whether the provisions offer
latitude for courts to consider matters of forum. I think that that
would be entirely
appropriate.</p><p><a name="06102455000408">Earlier,
the Minister had no response to my earlier question about clause 4 of
article 2 in the treaty. It gives our Executive discretion to ensure
that justice is done in matters where the Americans claim universal
jurisdiction and we do not, but it is not contained in the Extradition
Act 2003 or the relevant statutory instruments. I do not understand how
the Government can have ignored the treaty&#146;s one bit of
discretion for preserving British citizens&#146;
interests.</p><p><a name="06102455000409">As a
legislator in this House, I am entitled to ask why the Government are
ratifying a treaty when one of its key provisions in respect of British
citizens has not been incorporated into British law. I do not believe
that the articles of ratification can be exchanged until the Executive
address that gap.</p><p><a name="06102455000410">We
are told that other matters to do with protocol and the use of the
extradition treaty will be negotiated. I hope that they are reported in
full to the House, and that the Government will give us a clear
exposition before the Bill finishes its passage through the House. If
the amendments are knocked out tonight, I am sure that we will have
another opportunity to discuss these matters, so there will be time for
the Attorney-General to report back on the progress of his discussions
with the
Americans.</p><p><a name="06102455000411">Finally,
I agree with the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) that our
process for dealing with treaties is disgraceful. It takes us back to
the problem of the royal prerogative, which is a relic of a previous
age and inconsistent with a modern legislature. Executives should
report back to this House on treaty negotiations, and seek its assent
on treaties that they have signed. Treaties should be subject to proper
scrutiny: never again should unequal provisions of a treaty be put into
British law, unilaterally and three years before the other party even
considers them for
ratification.</p><p><a name="06102455000412">That is
an outrage, and an example of the supine acquiescence that has

injury without loss. Injured we most certainly have been&#151;as a
Parliament and as a nation&#151;by the signing of the treaty. It is
manifestly not reciprocal, in any sense of that word. If we were to
persuade ourselves that there was any reciprocity in it, we would have
to relearn the alphabet, let alone the English language. That
distresses me for two reasons.</p><p><a name="06102463000004">First, it distresses me to hear
a Minister attempt to argue what is manifestly and plainly casuistry. I
do not blame her; a completely untenable brief has been served up to
her&#151;but it is a great pity that she did not say so at the time.
The second reason for my distress is that I dislike treaties that are
not reciprocal; in particular, I dislike treaties that are not
reciprocal with the United States of America. This is a very bad time
to appear to be subservient to the United States of America&#151;on
any basis&#151;and the extradition treaty is meat and drink to those
who allege that this Government are the lackey and cat&#146;s-paw of
the United States, and in particular of the neo-cons of America.
Speaking as someone who has frequently made that allegation, I am very
sorry indeed that I shall be unable to attempt to inflict a further

call it&#151;between our arrangements and the American arrangements,
with the result that 45 of our nationals, or citizens, go to America

estrangement from their circumstances and so on. There is a cost; it is

enormous respect for him&#151;and of course there can be loss in
individual extradition cases. Indeed, if people are extradited, there
is always loss in some way or another. I respect that, and we must
ensure that people are not extradited when there is no due process.
What has happened to extradition law over the last 10 years is that we
have fast-tracked our extradition process with regard to many
countries, not just an individual country, so as to keep pace with the
fast track in the movement of people. Old extradition laws increasingly
could not keep pace with the amount of extradition that was
required&#151;not from the United States, but elsewhere.</p><p><a name="06102463000011">The
fast-track procedure, which I do not particularly enjoy, whereby the
prima facie evidence is not exhaustively analysed, is now commonplace,
and undoubtedly would have been put into place in respect of the United
States of America. There is no doubt about that. As far as the United
States was concerned, we would have precisely the same burden as we
have in any event; the difficulty lies in reciprocity. The
Americans&#151;as may be their right, as they have said&#151;could
not, or would not, sign up to a treaty because of their constitutional
inhibitions. The answer is that we are no worse off than we would have
been, and they, arguably, may be a little better off. In those
circumstances, I find it difficult to make myself part of the

There almost certainly will be a vote on amendment No. 81 as well as
amendment No. 36. That is my information. It is a great joy to be able
to inform him of these things.</p><p><a name="06102463000014">Of course, the water in this
whole extradition matter has been muddied by one recent case, which I
will not name. The extradition of three people to the United States was
sought. If I may say so, those representing them did a wonderful job in
enlisting extra-judicial support against their extradition. I can
remember newspapers never before seen in the pantheon of civil liberty
that were practically singing the Marseillaise, and printing it,
because of the pain that they envisaged in those three cases. One
newspaper had an entire page showing the prisons in which those people
were likely to be incarcerated and describing the type of
regime&#151;involving the very worst mediaeval
conditions&#151;under which they were to be held. There were pictures
of the shackles into which they were to be put. Of course, when the
people concerned arrived in America, the first thing they did was to
appear in front of a judge, who gave them bail. Secondly, they were
told that if they wanted to go home they could certainly do so, as long
as they turned up for their trial. That is not unusual in this country,
either.</p><p><a name="06102463000015">So, with a
heavy heart, because I thoroughly dislike this
treaty&#151;non-reciprocity is always wrong, and the treaty should
not have been negotiated&#151;I cannot bring myself to support
amendment No. 36. Amendment No. 81 is completely different. The forum
provision is a completely different matter, because there could be
real, serious and dangerous consequences if we allow the measure on to
the statute book unamended by the Lords amendment.</p><p><a name="06102463000016">There is one simple perception
of what will happen&#151;not if we decide to prosecute, but if we
decide not to prosecute in this country. If we are dealing with a
terrorist case or a high-profile case, so much the worse. If the
prosecuting authorities here make that decision, which they frequently
do, and communicate it to the person they have held, saying, &#147;We
have decided that we will not prosecute you on these charges,&#148;
and then a fast-track procedure, without a hearing by a judge, is
initiated to extradite that person to another
country&#151;particularly the United States&#151;the social
backwash is likely to be terrible. That will be particularly true if it
is a Muslim or a terrorist case. We have to understand that.</p><p><a name="06102463000017">If a crime is tried or is said
to be committed partly in this country, the judgment as to whether this
country extradites to another country must be made on its merits by a
tribunal. That is what amendment No. 81 would provide. I hope that
enough of my colleagues will join me in the Lobby&#151;with the
Opposition&#151;to pass this amendment, which will eradicate those
problems.</p><p><a name="06102463000018"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew272"><a name="06102463000052">Mr.

to have been done to us in that regard. However, let us consider the
damage that has actually been done. If the standard of protection that
we are affording to our citizens is the same as that which we are
perfectly content to give to them in respect of many other countries in

question of reciprocity itself. When the Government and Parliament of
the United Kingdom assess the protection that they afford their
citizens on extradition, it is reasonable for them to insist on
comparable&#151;I would argue identical&#151;protection from the
countries to which extradition is contemplated under the
arrangements.</p><p><a name="06102463000028">The
second answer to the question asked by the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#151;I am astonished that it is not clearly apparent to
him, of all people&#151;is that the European convention on human
rights applies to the other countries with which we have made the
arrangements to which he refers. The convention affords a degree of
protection on extradition to and from those countries that is wholly
absent from our arrangements with the United States. For those two
reasons, we are discussing not simply a lack of reciprocity, but a lack
of reciprocity that has serious consequences for the liberty of the
subjects of the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06102463000029"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew279"><a name="06102463000059">Chris

principle. However, I wonder whether there is a higher principle than
that. According to his argument, France provides more protection for
its citizens than we do. However, surely we believe that the French are
wrong to do
so.</p><p><a name="06102463000030"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew280"><a name="06102463000060">Mr.

liberty of their citizens. I am concerned about the liberty of the
subjects of the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06102463000031">Despite
the quality of the analysis that the right hon. Member for Southampton,
Itchen gave to the House, he seemed reluctant to support the Lords
amendments because he said that it would be inappropriate to do
fundamental damage to the statute dealing with extradition. Whatever
the rights and wrongs of that argument, it does not apply to Lords
amendment No. 36, which would simply de-designate the United States and
cause no fundamental damage to the statute at all. I hope that he will
take that point into account when he ultimately decides how to vote on
Lords amendment No. 36, at least.</p><br>

the right hon. Gentleman of its merits.</p><p><a name="06102463000034">I will make only one other
point, because much of the ground that we have covered has been
canvassed before. The response of the Government, unlike that of the
right hon. Gentleman, to the arguments that have been put against them
has been thoroughly wretched, inconsistent, contradictory and
increasingly desperate. Despite the words of Baroness Scotland that are
on record, they have refused to acknowledge that there is no
reciprocity. Indeed, the Prime Minister is on record as having denied
in the House that there was any difference at all in the evidential
arrangements applying to this country and to the United States.
Sometimes the Government say that there is reciprocity, yet sometimes
they say, as the Home Secretary seems to have done, that perhaps there
is not reciprocity, but that it does not
matter.</p><p><a name="06102463000035">When it suits
Ministers, however, they are only too happy to rely on the importance
of reciprocity. On 11 July, Baroness Scotland resisted an
Opposition amendment that would have required a judge deciding on
extradition to take account of the fact that the United Kingdom
authorities had decided not to prosecute&#151;that is the forum
argument that we have been discussing&#151;by
saying:</p><a name="61024-0004.htmbrev_27"><a name="06102463000039"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In the
interests of justice, the United Kingdom took the view...that
extradition could proceed where the person was wanted for conduct
committed at least partly in the United Kingdom, providing that the UK
had the same jurisdiction to try the conduct if it had occurred outside
the UK.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 11 July
2006; Vol. 684, c. 654.]</p></ul><p><a name="06102463000036">When it
suits the Government, the argument for reciprocity is important,
convincing and compelling, but when reciprocity is inconvenient to
them, it can be dismissed with a wave of a peremptory
hand.</p><p><a name="06102463000037">The
injustice of the present arrangements has been the subject of
widespread comment and concern inside and outside the House. In the
<i> Financial Times</i> last Wednesday, Sir Martin Jacomb, a former
chairman of the Prudential insurance company and a highly respected
figure in the business community, drew attention to their unfairness.
He said:</p><a name="61024-0004.htmbrev_28"><a name="06102463000040"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;parliament has

and the Bill&#146;s provisions were such that we had failed to stand
up to prevent bankers from facing serious charges of criminal
misconduct, albeit just because the UK&#146;s legislative framework

harmonising international law on financial misconduct, one of the
lessons that we should have learned from the Enron scandal is the case
for toughening up our domestic legislation. We should not say that we

if I thought that it precluded the prospect of a hearing taking place
in this country, in which the court could come to the view that there
was a compelling case for extraditing people who faced charges to an
area where a proper trial could take place, for crimes committed
against our citizens or others. What is important is the
process&#151;the hearing&#151;that the amendment allows.</p><p><a name="06102465000004">It saddens me
that in all our discussion there has not been a single reference to the
very important starting point of this debate&#151;the treatment of
Gary McKinnon, who hacked into US computers and posted a note on a
website saying that the US was guilty of state terrorism. He was
arrested in the UK but was not charged&#151;if he had been charged,
he would probably have got community service. He faces extradition for
an offence that may be punished with a prison sentence of up to 60
years. It is absolutely right that the Lords amendment should
specifically give the right to a hearing in this country, in which the
test will be whether extradition is in the interests of
justice.</p><p><a name="06102465000005">We could
make heavy weather of Lords amendment No. 36. I have considered it and
Labour Members have discussed it a great deal, and in the end I have
decided that there is no loss or damage done by including it. It is a
belt-and-braces provision that means that the agreement will come into
place when it is fully signed.

been waged to get the Government&#146;s attention. Rather than

debate, Mr. Deputy Speaker?</p><p><a name="06102465000031">We have had a useful debate.
The right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe
(Mr. Howard) is correct that I have said that we have had
this debate ad infinitum. However, I am happy to do so because, like
other right hon. and hon. Members, the issues are of great importance
so it is right to discuss them. I was struck by what my right hon.
Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) said
about justice, and I concur with him. This is a matter of justice, not
reciprocity, although as far as possible we have achieved reciprocity
on reasonable suspicion and probable cause. He asked whether the
difference between reasonable suspicion and probable cause was so great
that it created an injustice. The answer is no. At the risk of
repeating myself, we have achieved rough parity. My noble Friend
Baroness Scotland, my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline
Flint), now a Health Minister, and I never said that those things are
identical&#151;rough parity is what we have achieved.</p><p><a name="06102465000032">May I say a
word about forum provision, which has figured largely in our debate?
The key issue is ensuring that offences are dealt with in the place
where they can be prosecuted most effectively. The proposed procedures
envisage early consultation in any case in which it appears to a
prosecutor in one country that there is a serious possibility that a
prosecutor in the other country may have an interest in prosecution. We
are alive to concerns about the matter, but we reject the Lords
amendment. However, I reassure right hon. and hon. Members that we will
take a further look at the issue.</p><p><a name="06102465000033">The proposed arrangements
provide for a three-step approach to decisions on
jurisdiction&#151;first, the early exchange of information
between relevant jurisdictions; secondly, prosecutors consulting on
those

consultation and involvement. We will consider the issues that have
been raised.</p><p><a name="06102465000034">In the
interests of justice, in the interests of victims of crime and in the
interests of making the world a safer place, I urge hon. Members to
support the Government and reject the Lords
amendments.</p><p><a name="06102465000035"><i> Question

McNulty:</b> The amendment would alter the process for making
changes to police force areas. There are already perfectly adequate
provisions for revising police areas; indeed, those very provisions
were substantially revised by the last Administration in the Police and
Magistrates&#146; Courts Act 1994. Under the current arrangements, a
merger may take place either if the police authorities concerned have
volunteered or if the Home Secretary considers that a merger would be
in the interests of the efficiency or effectiveness of policing. In the
latter case, the Home Secretary must give notice of his intention to
merge forces to the affected police and local authorities, and give
them a minimum of four months to submit any objections. The Home
Secretary must then consider those objections and respond to them
before an order is made. Moreover, with Home Secretary-initiated
mergers, the necessary order is subject to the affirmative procedure,
so there must be a debate and vote in both Houses.</p><p><a name="06102512000610">The new clause that the
amendment would insert removes those two routes, and instead requires
both that the police authorities volunteer and that the Home Secretary
considers the change to be in the interests of efficiency or
effectiveness. I appreciate the value of requiring that the Home
Secretary must be satisfied that a voluntary merger would promote the
efficient or effective policing of the affected area. But the amendment
also removes the ability of the Home Secretary to initiate changes to
police areas. It is the function of the Home Secretary to take
strategic decisions about policing&#151;that is his traditional role
in the tripartite relationship. Decisions about police areas are
clearly strategic in nature. Therefore, it is right that the Home
Secretary should be able to alter police areas, after proper
consultation and with due parliamentary scrutiny. A provision for the
Home Secretary to initiate mergers has long been on the statute
book&#151;going back to the Police Act 1964, and, indeed, before
that, and rightly so. There remains a place for such a provision in the
future.</p><p><a name="06102512000611">In making the
case for retaining the existing provisions in the Police Act 1996, I
can do no better than refer the House to the police reform White Paper
of June 1993. It contains the following passage, which rings as true
today as it did 13 years
ago:</p><a name="61024-0004.htmbrev_29"><a name="06102512001342"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Government considers that...it may be desirable in the long term to
reduce the number of police forces...The Government intends to
ensure...that it will be possible to implement a programme of police
force amalgamations in the future when the time is right...Where

things come to that.</p><p><a name="06102512000613">I
know that the amendment was agreed to in the other place during the
controversy over the police merger programme initiated by the previous
Home Secretary in response to a report of Her Majesty&#146;s
inspectorate of constabulary, &#147;Closing the Gap&#148;. That
might have skewed its judgement in this matter. I therefore think that
it is appropriate to take this opportunity to update the House on where
we are now in respect of addressing the gap in forces&#146; capacity
and capability to tackle terrorism, serious and organised crime, other
threats to public safety and what are generally called level 2, or
protective,
services.</p><p><a name="06102512000614">On 19 June,
my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made it clear that he was not
going to force through mergers where they were not wanted. As a
corollary to that clear statement, the notices of intention to merge
that were issued on 3 March and 11 April were withdrawn on 13
July. That is not to say that the problems of providing adequate
protective services in a 43-force model have gone away. There is
widespread recognition that the status quo is not an option. We need to
make progress in enhancing forces&#146; capacity and capability to
protect the public from the threats posed by terrorism, serious and
organised crime, civil emergencies and similar matters. But we are now
more focused on the outcomes we want to achieve, and less on structural
questions. I have said before on the public record that I think that in
the past we got to a stage where the concerns in the strategic forces
and merger debates were more about structure and process than about
policing.</p><p><a name="06102512000615">I have
written to all chief constables and police authorities, seeking their
views on how best to proceed in the absence of mergers. I have followed
up that letter with a series of constructive meetings with chief
constables and chairs of police authorities, out in the country as well
as in London, to hear their views at first hand. As part of that
dialogue with the service, we have made it clear that we are open to
all possibilities, ranging from collaboration to federation and the
lead-force model, and all other permutations. We are ready to do what
we can to facilitate any innovative solutions to this issue. There is a
real appetite for that debate out in the country in the service, and a
recognition that the gaps indicated in O&#146;Connor&#146;s report
still exist.</p><p><a name="06102512000616">What
matters is delivering real improvements in the quality of protective
services while protecting neighbourhood policing. That is what we all
want to achieve. It is not a culmination, but just next week I shall
see all the chief constables and chairs of police authorities in the
Home Office for a day that will be spent principally on this matter,
although also on other matters to do with policing. The public want
their local force to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. They also
want, and deserve, to be properly protected from threats posed by
serious organised crime and terrorism, and I am heartened by the
willingness that there is among forces and authorities to tackle that
issue.</p><p><a name="06102512000617">Accordingly,
while we have made it clear that we have no plans to return to the
issue of forced force mergers in the foreseeable future, we
cannot&#151;and I contend that no responsible Government
could&#151;rule out entirely the option of Home Secretary-initiated

that would be in the public&#146;s best interests because it would
enhance their protection. Therefore, I ask the House to reject Lords
amendment No. 1.</p><p><a name="06102512000618">Lords
amendment No. 71 relates to the Home Secretary&#146;s powers to
intervene where serious and persistent police performance concerns have
arisen. We have listened to the concerns expressed in the other place,
and we are bringing forward two changes to our original proposals,
which we believe address those worries. Policing is a service that
should be delivered and governed locally, but it should also be
delivered to a consistent and acceptable standard to all our
communities. The responsibility for ensuring that such a service is
provided rightly resides with the chief constable and the police
authority. But there might be occasions when it becomes clear that a
particular local area is receiving an unacceptable standard of policing
and the local force and authority have been unable to take the
necessary steps to address
that.</p><p><a name="06102512000619">Beyond choosing
where to live, local people have no effective choice about the police
service they receive. For that reason, the Government need to have
reserve powers to intervene in those cases where policing has fallen
below an acceptable level and other non-statutory resolutions to
performance issues have proved insufficient. Our proposals in the Bill
as passed by this House modify the reserve powers to intervene in an
underperforming force or police authority. I should stress that we are
not taking new powers; in the case of police authorities,
these powers have existed since 1994, and in the case of police forces,
they have existed since
2002.</p><p><a name="06102512000620"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew307"><a name="06102512001954">Mr.

the House of Lords has come up

ensures that these existing intervention powers are fit for purpose.
The changes that will be made by the Bill draw on our experience over
the past four years in supporting forces to embed a performance
culture, and on our work helping underperforming forces to turn around
their performance.</p><p><a name="06102512000625">The
Bill widens the sources of information that the Home Secretary can
consider in deciding whether to exercise his powers. At present,
intervention can only be triggered by an adverse report from HMIC, but
there might well be other relevant sources of

germane recent case in that respect being the Bichard
inquiry.</p><p><a name="06102512000626">Secondly, the
Bill streamlines the intervention process. In all but the most
exceptional cases, statutory intervention will be considered at the
point when all other means of collaboration and support have been
attempted, but performance has failed to improve. In such
circumstances, it may be that it is taking too long to show an
acceptable level of performance improvement; that the force in question
simply does not have the capability itself to address its problems; or,
in the most extreme and unusual cases, that it refuses to co-operate to
remedy its failings. In these circumstances, it is only right that we
be able to act decisively and swiftly to address problems that are
failing the communities whom the force and the police authority
serve.</p><p><a name="06102512000627">It is
interesting to note that the debate on intervention powers has moved on
from that of five years ago. There seems to be more of an acceptance
that the Home Secretary should have the powers to take action where the
circumstances necessitate, and we have debated instead the right
safeguards and the most appropriate path for their use. We recognise
the strong feelings expressed about the changes, which would allow the
Secretary of State&#151;on some occasions&#151;to direct a chief
constable on performance matters, and not require him to route such
direction through the police authority first. That is an entirely fair
point.</p><p><a name="06102512000628">The provisions
were by no means developed to shift the balance of power, and it has
always been our intention that the usual route for intervention be
directed through the police authority. The ability to direct the chief
officer had been developed in the light of experience, which shows that
there could be occasions when a police authority might not feel
able&#151;or, indeed, be able&#151;to take the necessary steps. It
was in such circumstances that we proposed direct intervention with the
force, to enable us to get to the heart of the problem quickly and to
take the necessary remedial action. We listened to the concerns raised
in debates about this issue, and our amendments restore the position
under the Police Reform Act 2002, which routes the intervention power
through the police authority on all occasions. The amendments recognise
that the police authority is primarily charged with holding the chief
constable of a force to
account.</p><p><a name="06102512000629">The second
main concern has focused on what we feel is a misrepresentation of the
intention behind these powers&#151;namely, that the Secretary of
State could use them on a whim or for trivial purposes, which he
clearly would not. We have made it clear throughout that they are
intended to be used only where serious and persistent performance
concerns have arisen and other attempts to address them have failed.
However, to provide further reassurance we are introducing an amendment
that requires the Secretary of State to consult the inspectorate of
constabulary when he proposes to use these powers and imposes a duty to
publish the inspectorate&#146;s opinion on the evidence leading to
the proposed course of action.</p><p><a name="06102512000630">The intention is to ensure that
the inspectorate&#146;s professional and independent advice is
available to the Secretary of State on whether the use of the powers
is, in its opinion, the right course of action. That should

view when deciding whether to invoke the powers. The Government agreed
on Report in the other place that it is right that this safeguard also
be extended to include police authorities, and our amendments make such
provision accordingly. So our amendments are intended to provide the
Government with effective but proportionate intervention powers. We
have listened to the concerns expressed about how those powers might be
interpreted or used, and we have responded accordingly with some
specific
safeguards.</p><p><a name="06102512000631">These
amendments need to be seen in the context of a series of Government
amendments tabled in the other place that rightly reflected the
concerns expressed there, and by the Association of Chief Police
Officers, the Association of Police Authorities and others over the
summer. We have sought to listen and to get this right, so it is almost
with regret that I ask the House to reject amendment No. 1. It is
important that the Home Secretary retain this reserve power, regardless
of what party and Government he represents. I believe that we have
moved sufficiently to deal with the concerns expressed about the extent
of the Home Secretary&#146;s intervention powers. Routing the process
through the inspectorate and taking full account of the police
authority, in the way outlined in our amendments, is the way forward
and addresses those concerns. I therefore ask the House to accept our
amendments and to reject the Lords
amendments.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61024-0004.htmordayhd_14"><a name="06102512001353">7.15

fully now with the question that the hon. Member for Broxbourne
(Mr. Walker) asked earlier. Regarding the powers that have
been in place since 2002, the answer to his question is none. As yet,
intervention of that sort has not been required. But that is not to say
that the police standards unit, as was&#151;the Home Office changes
its name all the time; I cannot remember what it is called
now&#151;has not engaged with constabularies in need of assistance in
a largely informal, supportive and professional way to try to turn them
round. The baseline assessments published by HMIC and the Home Office
today show that such engagement does work. In the past couple of years,
some eight forces have been engaged in such a fashion. As of today, the
figure is only three, and their baseline assessments show a significant
improvement compared with last year and that everything is moving in
the right direction. I do not have to hand the figures on the use of
the powers since 1994, about which the hon. Member for Broxbourne also
asked. If I do not get some inspiration by the time the debate
finishes, I shall write to
him.</p><p><a name="06102512000633">I therefore ask

uncomfortable fact for the Government is that they tried to drive
through the biggest reorganisation of the police for 40 years with
minimal debate and consultation. They dismissed the concerns of police
authorities, many chief constables and councillors, and were frankly
contemptuous of opinion in this House. They did their level best to
avoid parliamentary debate, and when we finally secured a debate just

I have spent all day on TV and radio saying that league tables are

amalgamations. However, that does not reflect the view of the people of
Staffordshire, for whom my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield
(Michael Fabricant) spoke. They greatly opposed the merger, as every
opinion poll showed and the Minister knows. Local people opposed
amalgamations. Not a single police force area showed a majority of the
public&#151;the people who experience the policing&#151;in favour
of the
mergers.</p><p><a name="06102512000641"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew316"><a name="06102512001963">Michael

left behind in the reorganisation of public services&#151;the police
are not alone in being reorganised. The public have not been properly
consulted about health service and police changes. We tried to draw
that major point to the Government&#146;s attention when the
proposals were considered.</p><p><a name="06102512000643">Before the
interventions, I was considering the absence of parliamentary debate.
Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members always initiated discussion
and the Government tried to avoid parliamentary debate. That was one of
the worst aspects of their proposals for mergers. They drove the
process to an absurdly tight timetable, giving police authorities only
three months to prepare their cases before Christmas, and ignored the
offer that we made in February to allow a year for proper consultation.
They gravely damaged the perceived independence of Her Majesty&#146;s
inspectorate of constabulary, and many Conservative Members fear that
the inspectorate&#146;s reputation was unnecessarily undermined by
the Government&#146;s pressing for early publication of an inadequate
report. The Government proceeded regardless of the financial
implications, and before they had secured adequate financing from the
Treasury to make even the first voluntary merger, between Cumbria and
Lancashire, work.</p><p><a name="06102512000644">As
the Home Office director general of crime, policing and
counter-terrorism said last month, the process
was</p><a name="61024-0004.htmbrev_30"><a name="06102512001343"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;not well enough
planned... not well enough
managed&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102512000645">That is a
masterpiece of official understatement. What did the Government
achieve? They secured a delay in voluntary co-operation, which we and
the Association of Police Authorities had urged, to strengthen
protective services, and a bill of more than &#163;10 million that
police authorities incurred in preparation for amalgamation. The
Government have had to pay compensation for that&#151;money that will
come from the police budget.</p><p><a name="06102512000646">The expensive waste of police
time has made us wary of potential abuse of the power to force mergers
in future. The Minister said that my right hon. and learned Friend the
Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) had originally
proposed that power, but I could as easily have quoted the then shadow
Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr.
Blair), who opposed it and warned that forcing police mergers without
proper process would be</p><a name="61024-0004.htmbrev_31"><a name="06102512001344"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a denial of constitutional
principle&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102512000647">We cannot
support the retention of that power unless the Government reassure the
House that it will be exercised properly.</p><p><a name="06102512000648">I therefore request five key
reassurances. If the Minister can provide them, we will feel more
comfortable about allowing the power to remain the Bill. First, we need
to be confident that other options for improving protective services or
otherwise enhancing force co-operation have been exhausted before the
Government resort to amalgamation. The Minister has told the press that
the power will be used as &#147;absolutely&#148; the &#147;last
resort&#148;. Similarly, Baroness Scotland said that it would be used
only as a &#147;last resort&#148; and a &#147;back-stop&#148;.
It would be helpful if the Minister repeated that assurance in those
words today.</p><br>

made for amalgamations with robust, costed and preferably independent
evaluation of the options. Many of us believed that the O&#146;Connor
report&#151;the report of Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of
constabulary&#151;on which the Government relied to pursue
amalgamations fulfilled none of those
criteria.</p><p><a name="06102512000650">Thirdly,
adequate public consultation must take place, and not only during the
statutory period of four months&#146; consultation once the Home
Secretary has decided to press ahead with a force merger. There must be
proper consultation with local people, police authorities, police
forces and hon. Members before
then.</p><p><a name="06102512000651">Fourthly, the
Minister mentioned due parliamentary scrutiny, which I welcome.
However, there must be proper parliamentary consultation&#151;not
simply a short debate on any order that is laid, but proper debate on
all the issues relevant to a compulsory merger, which, as Her
Majesty&#146;s inspector of constabulary conceded in the report, has
constitutional
significance.</p><p><a name="06102512000652">Fifthly,
we must have an assurance that the financial implications have been
tackled, not least precept equalisation, which effectively sank the
merger between Cumbria and Lancashire.</p><p><a name="06102512000653">I hope that
the Minister accepts that those requirements are reasonable. Let me
repeat them, because I am serious about our offer. First, we must be
confident that all the options for improving services have been
exhausted and that the power will be used as a last resort. Secondly, a
proper case for amalgamation must be made. Thirdly, there should be
genuine public consultation. Fourthly, proper parliamentary
consultation and scrutiny must take place. Fifthly, we need an
assurance about the financial
implications.</p><p><a name="06102512000654">We
previously sought a local referendum on force mergers and an
independent cost-benefit analysis of the proposals. We do not request
those checks today. We simply ask the Government to assure us that, if
force mergers become necessary&#151;in the main, Conservative Members
hope that they do not&#151;they will conduct the process properly and
thoroughly. I hope that the Minister can give us the reassurances that
we seek about the process. If so, we will not try to oppose him when he
asks the House to retain the power for force mergers as a last resort.
We dislike the power, but the reassurances will give us the knowledge
that the House and, importantly, the other place, can hold the
Government to them should we and they consider and vote on a proposed
merger in future.</p><p><a name="06102512000655">I
welcome the Minister&#146;s acknowledgement that there should be a
debate on outcomes rather than structures. We will support him in
encouraging voluntary co-operation between forces to strengthen
protective services. We accept that the gap needs to be closed and that
the issue is important. We urge police authorities to be serious and to
take forward as robustly as possible the proposals to make savings,
which they can reinvest in protective services. Such savings should be
achievable through sharing, for example, back-office functions. We
support the Government on
that.</p><p><a name="06102512000656">Despite the

Herbert:</b> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. The
powers are not circumscribed at all. It is not clear how they could be
used, and there appears to be no limit on their use. The judgment as to
whether a police force or authority is failing is largely a judgment
for the Home Secretary, and there could indeed be a conflict between
the way in which a police force was responding to local demands and the
Home Secretary&#146;s desire for some other aspect of policing. I
will return to that point in a moment.</p><p><a name="06102512000660">During the passage of the Bill,
Ministers have claimed that these powers of intervention will be used
only as a last resort. That explanation appeared in the notes that
accompanied the publication of the original Bill. However, Ministers
have consistently refused to put the expression &#147;last
resort&#148;&#151;or a similar check&#151;into the Bill. It was
in the explanatory notes, but it has never been in the Bill. The power
that the Government are now seeking to take is not circumscribed; it is
entirely open-ended.</p><p><a name="06102512000661">The Minister said that he had
made a concession to the Association of Police Authorities and to ACPO,
and indeed he has. We need to examine the extent of that concession,
however, and ask whether it really addresses the concern about the
centralisation of power. Part of the concession is that the Government
can now make a direction only through a police authority. But what that
means is that it will be the police authority that is directed, rather
than the force. If the police authority is so directed, it is not clear
that it will have the discretion to do anything other than obey the
direction. That change might preserve the amour propre of the
Association of Police Authorities,

said that the Secretary of State would now have to consult the
inspectorate of constabulary about an intervention, but the Bill does
not use the word &#147;consult&#148;. It simply says that the
Secretary of State has to inform the inspectorate, and that the
inspectorate can then make its own views known. I am not sure that that
amounts to consultation. It certainly does not resemble the existing
power that the inspectorate has to initiate the intervention of the
Secretary of State. The Secretary of State is now taking that power to
himself.</p><p><a name="06102512000663"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew320"><a name="06102512001967">Mr.

be obliged under the amendment to inform the inspectorate of the
grounds of any intervention. It would then be obliged to put in writing
to us any concerns that it had about the matter, and we would be
obliged fully to publish the result of the inspectorate&#146;s

me.</p><p><a name="06102512000664"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew321"><a name="06102512001968">Nick

Government, but I do not think that it is meaningful consultation at
all. The Government would simply inform the inspectorate of what they
intended to do, and allow the inspectorate to publish its views. That
is not the same as consultation, and it is certainly a major shift from
the present situation, in which the request for an intervention comes
from the inspectorate. That power is effectively being taken away from
the inspectorate and accrued by the Secretary of State.</p><p><a name="06102512000665">It is not clear why the
Government are seeking this power. Throughout the passage of the Bill,
we have never been given an explanation of what the Government are
seeking to direct. When will they want to intervene? It has been
difficult for us to accept this open-ended power when we have no
understanding of the circumstances in which it might be used. The

Every statute in this area, and in many others, is littered with such

using exhortation or motivation, for example. I would also ask the hon.

I was quoting the Minister in the other place, who referred to five
years. Now, however, it appears that the existing powers have not been
used for 12 years. This is quite bizarre, and the more I hear about
this power, the more I become convinced that it is unnecessary for the
Government to take it, and the more I distrust them for seeking to do
so. The Government&#146;s m&#233;tier has been to accrue power to
the centre and to direct public services from the centre. We are
particularly worried that that is what they are now attempting to do in
relation to the police. They attempted to do it in relation to the
proposed amalgamations, and they are now attempting to do it
again.</p><p><a name="06102512000671">The history of
attempted interventions in the affairs of police forces has not been an
entirely happy one for the Government. In February 2002, the then Home
Secretary, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside
(Mr. Blunkett), warned the then Metropolitan Police
Commissioner, Sir John Stevens, that unless the Metropolitan police cut
violent street crime levels within six months, he would send in his own
management hit squad. Presumably, he intended to machine-gun
recalcitrant officers in Scotland Yard. In June 2004, the then Home
Secretary took on Humberside police authority and eventually succeeded
in having the chief constable, David Westwood, sacked, against the
wishes of the authority. In the new diaries of the right hon. Member
for Sheffield, Brightside, which I am sure the Minister has read, he
says:</p><a name="61024-0004.htmbrev_33"><a name="06102512001346"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In
thinking back on it, my desire to see speedy action and to be decisive
probably coloured my judgement...The spat between the Home
Secretary and David Westwood was not in the interests either of
improvement in the service or myself. It simply prolonged the
problem.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102512000672">We are
worried that there is a danger of politicising policing. There is a
fundamental difference in perspective between our approach and the
Government&#146;s proposals. To whom should police forces ultimately
be accountable? We believe that accountability should be primarily to
the local community, and that policing should respond to the wishes and
demands of local people, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham
(Mrs. Lait) pointed out earlier. The Government, by
contrast, have a mantra of double devolution, but will not let go of
the strings and, in this case, are attempting to tighten their grip on
policing. Our primary concern about the powers is the danger of central
political direction leading to politicisation of policing. In 2002, the

Featherstone:</b> It will come as no surprise that the Liberal
Democrats will seek to retain both Lords amendments.</p><p><a name="06102512000675">First, the extremely hostile
reaction by police forces and local people up and down the land to the
Government&#146;s impossibly bullying and prescriptive&#151;not to
mention rushed and expensive&#151;merger proposals was hardly
surprising. The reaction was compelling, because it was a challenge not
just to the future shape of our police forces but to the improper haste
of the proposal, the consultation process, the cost and the
consequences. In addition, the proposal to merge police forces
threatened a double whammy for local communities. Undoubtedly, people
recognised that they would be expected to fork out more council tax for
the funding gap and for harmonisation between different councils, while
having less of a say as to how their police force was run.</p><p><a name="06102512000676">All hon. Members understood
that there was a need to address gaps in the service, particularly with
regard to level 2 crime, and recognised that smaller forces sometimes
struggle with complex cases. Forcing a construct on them, however, was
not the answer. The not so subtle carrot of the Government
bribe&#151;a share in the &#163;125 million on offer for the good
boys who volunteered to merge&#151;was somewhat distasteful. The
Government say that they are in favour of neighbourhood policing and
local accountability. We support them in that. They say that they want
a police service that is fit for purpose in the 21st century. We
support them in that. Those are both laudable objectives. But then the
Government&#146;s merger proposals zoomed off in a direction that
would not deliver those objectives.</p><p><a name="06102512000677">The insistence that police
forces should merge even where local opinion was firmly against that,
where the results could have been damaging for effective policing, and
when the Government had not given any alternatives an opportunity to be
debated let alone trialled, resulted in forces that did not want to
merge in the way prescribed by the Government, and some rebelled to the
point of legal action. I welcome the move to discussing outcomes rather
than structures, which I have always felt was a more productive
approach, and the Lords amendment cleverly puts the decision to merge
or reconfigure police forces back into the hands of police authorities.
As the royal commission took two years to produce a report, and
legislation took a further year, I also welcome the Minister&#146;s
statement that he is open to all suggestions and will take his time to
talk to people about the future.

amendment No. 71 concerns intervention in a failing police force. When
a police force is failing, people will indeed want to be protected by
Government intervention to ensure that they are safe and have a police
force that delivers. There is no dispute about that. However, although
the Government talk of localism and local policing, the Bill proposes
to centralise power in the hands of the Home Secretary by empowering
him to intervene directly in any police force that he believes is
failing, or&#151;even more scarily&#151;any police force that he
believes may fail in the
future.</p><p><a name="06102512000693">The critical
issue for us is the lack of objective criteria by which such a power
would be invoked. I acknowledge that the Minister has made some moves,
but there is no actual commitment or specific detail. Gone is the need
for a negative report cataloguing and evidencing failure, although
there has been a marginal concession in that consultation, or the
opinions of the inspectorate, will be published. The Government have
gone a little way towards limiting the powers. The changes mean that an
authority must be failing before the Home Secretary can intervene, or
the authority must first request an intervention. However, the new
relationship will change the tripartite balance, and given the
constitutional implications, I do not think that the Minister&#146;s

safeguards.</p><p><a name="06102512000694">The Home

of the performance and operational ability of a force. We are told that
the triggers for intervention will be broadened, because the Home

opinion. I hope that that would happen in any case, but I am not

contradictory forces pull me in different directions. In Hertfordshire
there is a drive for local accountability; meanwhile, understandably,

country. The Government clearly need to be protected from persistent
failure. I am delighted that since 1994 the Home Office has not felt
the need to intervene in the running of a police force, and I hope that
that continues for a long time, but I am sure that if a reason for
intervention arose in the future, we who are here in the

fiction&#151;we see many policemen making their careers by chasing
international criminal masterminds, pulling down Mr. Big,
securing an audience with the Prime Minister and having well-deserved
medals pinned on their chests. However, although it is important,
international crime does not keep my constituents awake at night. What
keeps them awake at night is the fear of low-level thuggery and
persistent antisocial behaviour. Let me add, at the risk of sounding
repetitive, that they feared that a more &#147;global&#148; police
force would view issues on a global rather than a local
basis.</p><p><a name="06102512000705">That is not to

indefinitely on future police mergers if a good case could be made, but
I hope that if the circumstance arose there would be full and proper
local consultation: not a three-month consultation, but a consultation
allowing a period of reflection and consideration, allowing the Home
Secretary and his Ministers to devise a cogent argument and allowing
us, the elected representatives of Hertfordshire and the local people,
to respond.</p><p><a name="06102512000706">I hope
that as the Bill proceeds, the Minister will keep in mind the need for

reflective debate, rightly looking at some of the contextual issues
around mergers in the summer. I do not deprecate that&#151;it is
perfectly reasonable in that context. It seems rather strange that I
have prayed in aid the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and
Hythe (Mr. Howard) and the hon. Member for Arundel and South
Downs (Nick Herbert) has prayed in aid my right hon. Friend the Prime
Minister&#151;and long may that continue in one way or another. I
take seriously the points raised and also some of the offers suggesting
what I need to do to resist a vote, at least on the first set of
amendments. First, though, I shall look at the general context of the
points raised by hon.
Members.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61024-0004.htmordayhd_17"><a name="06102512001356">8
pm</h5><p><a name="06102512000709">I commend the
hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) for his honesty. He
said&#151;and I think that it would resonate with all of
us&#151;that his local constituents could not care less about
protective services and level 2 crime. I accept that and it is part of
our difficulty&#151;mine as Minister with responsibility for
policing, hon. Members&#146; as responsible MPs, and the police
forces. The only time they have concerns about level 2 provision is
when it is needed but is not there. Beyond that, their immediate
concern is volume crime, neighbourhood policing and whether local
police are visible and accountable, as they should be, on our streets.
I commend the hon. Gentleman for his honesty, and it goes to the heart
of the debate&#151;a debate that we are not planning to have in the
near future, but one that I have had since I assumed this role last
May, at the tail end of the mergers debate. I have certainly tried to
deal with those matters since July when the mergers fell away&#151;or
whatever description people want to use. We then got into seriously
discussions about wither public protective services, if not through the
mergers route. It is one of the dilemmas that we
face.</p><p><a name="06102512000710"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew336"><a name="06102512001983">Mr.
Philip Dunne (Ludlow) (Con):</b> On level 2 protective
services, does the Minister agree that one of the benefits of closing
the gap was raising the focus within all constabularies on the need to
provide such services? One of the perverse benefits of the decision not
to proceed with mergers was that many forces&#151;my own of West
Mercia included&#151;have gone a long way towards addressing the
perceived shortfalls in providing those services and are now, of their
own volition, putting in even greater resources in order to meet those
shortcomings.</p><p><a name="06102512000711"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew337"><a name="06102512001984">Mr.
McNulty:</b> I certainly agree with the thrust of what the
hon. Gentleman says, although if I were pedantic I might dispute the
notion of it being perverse. Some hon. Members have suggested today
that all the effort put into the discussions over mergers were a
complete distraction, a complete waste of time and got in the way of
seriously trying to address the problems raised by O&#146;Connor,
among others. I am with the hon. Gentleman, however. If we leave
perversity to one side, most forces seriously engaged with those
discussions during the merger process and since its demise.</p><p><a name="06102512000712">I have also said to many forces
that, perhaps because of a shorthand&#151;the speed of it
all&#151;much of the merger debate was carried out on the premise

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1456</b><br>collaborations and discussions had not happened beforehand. There had
not been enough, but there certainly had been some, so there was no
total vacuum in respect of discussions, collaborations or
actions.</p><p><a name="06102512000713"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew338"><a name="06102512001985">Mr.
Heath:</b> The Minister is absolutely right that
collaborations and discussions did happen. It seems to me that what has
emerged from the merger process is a realisation of how
multi-dimensional these relationships have to be. If we take the
example of my own force, Avon and Somerset, it was looking into
collaborating not just with other police forces, but with other local
government agencies and even the private sector in respect of the
provision of some back-room services. The Avon and Somerset force was
looking to collaborate with neighbouring forces on some provisions, not
just within the region but, for example, with those in proximity such
as Gwent across the Bristol channel, which is part of the same crime
pattern area, and also with West Midlands, Merseyside and other forces
that have the same sort of crime problems and are facing the same enemy
and need to
co-operate.</p><p><a name="06102512000714"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew339"><a name="06102512001986">Mr.
McNulty:</b> Much of that work is at least under way, if not
developed, in some parts of the country. Avon and Somerset force is
developing a very interesting model that does not go the strategic or
operational service level, but to back-office services, as the hon.
Gentleman mentioned. It is looking across the public sector to secure
some degree of rationalisation. That makes perfect sense, whether it be
about pay, human resources&#151;perhaps not IT, which goes to the
operational sector of policing&#151;and generic business, back-office
functions. Why should the local health authority, the local council and
local police forces have different and distinct systems with all the
incumbent directives? Avon and Somerset will be first, and part of the
model of investigation may be broadened out to the public sector across
the south-west region. I commend that as it is worth pursuing. I take
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the other dimensions, both
operational and strategic.</p><p><a name="06102512000715"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew340"><a name="06102512001987">Mrs.
Lait:</b> Moving on slightly from that point, does the
Minister accept that the mergers discussion postponed precisely the
sort of&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I do not wish to disagree with
the Minister while he is still sitting, but I have to declare an
interest here as my husband is the chairman of the Sussex police
authority, so I am aware that before the mergers debates started the
sort of process mentioned by the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)
had already been discussed by police authorities, and even some local
authorities. The mergers discussions postponed it all for a long time
and it cost people, including the Home Office,
money.</p><p><a name="06102512000716"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew341"><a name="06102512001988">Mr.
McNulty:</b> No, I disagree with that, and I think that the
hon. Lady will find that she meant to refer to the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), not the hon. Member for
Northavon (Steve Webb). I believe that I have met the hon.
Lady&#146;s spouse and he is doing a very good job, too. She is right
to the extent that Sussex was doing much of that with Surrey, but not
much beyond&#151;just partly, but not terribly much, with Kent.
People are right to point out that a huge matrix is emerging, which is

service sharing.</p><p><a name="06102512000717">Where we are
at now is that most forces recognise, as we recognise across the House,
that counter-terrorism operations are probably not best done at the
local basic command unit level. The substance and strategic nature of
terrorism suggests that. Most forces recognise, merger aside, that a
degree of authority needs to be ceded up to the regions at least, and
in some cases up to the national level. It is still an issue to see how
local level neighbourhood policing and BCU commanders are folded into
the counter-terrorist effort, as they have a role to play from top to
bottom. There is recognition of the need to cede some authority and
sovereignty up the chain of command to the regional and national level.
That is recognised in respect of expertise. I believe that Sussex has
an excellent reputation and teaches many other forces about firearms.
Why reinvent that wheel, assuming that we can talk about wheels and
firearms at the same time, of
course?</p><p><a name="06102512000718"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew342"><a name="06102512001989">Mr.
Walker:</b> I hope that the Minister accepts that it was not
my intention in my brief speech to diminish organised crime. Clearly,
people trafficking, international terrorism and drug dealing are hugely
important. Is the Home Office looking at a different formula for
tackling those issues beyond the idea of merging police forces? It may
be slightly off the point, but I would grateful if the Minister
answered that question.</p><a name="06102512001339"><p><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew343"><a name="06102512001990">Mr.
McNulty:</b> I want to make two points on that issue. First,
what I said on counter-terrorism rightly does not prevail in respect of
serious and organised crime, which belongs more readily at the regional
or more localised level, albeit under the umbrella of the Serious
Organised Crime Agency. However, we have taken out of that, almost
sideways, our centre for human trafficking&#151;although the hon.
Gentleman will understand that we are against such trafficking rather
than promoting it&#151;and other elements such as the European action
plan, so that runs alongside, though very much with the grain, what
police forces are doing locally and nationally.</p><a name="06102512001340"><p>I repeat that I am hugely
impressed and enthused by the co-operation and enthusiasm of police
forces, services and authorities in taking this matter
forward. I give a little to the hon. Member for
Beckenham (Mrs Lait) in allowing that Sussex is ahead of the
game&#151;as are some other forces&#151;but others are way behind
in even thinking about filling the gap or protecting services. They
have come on in leaps and bounds&#151;perversely or otherwise, to
pick up on the point made by the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr.
Dunne)&#151;and we are already in a healthier position in terms of
filling the gap that O&#146;Connor recognised than we were before
mergers were contemplated. We can argue cause and effect, but that
would be like counting the angels dancing on the head of a
pin.</p><p><a name="06102512000719">Even given
that context, it is right and proper that we have the ability to
enforce merger if necessary. The hon. Member for Arundel and South
Downs (Nick Herbert) mentioned five tests and I shall answer as
sincerely as possible. He asked whether amalgamations would be a

<meta name="Date" content="24 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1458</b><br>last resort, and I confirm that they would. My colleague in the other
place has already made that clear and I am happy to do so, too. His
second question was whether a proper case would have to be made for
amalgamation, and the answer is of course yes. The Bill requires the
Home Secretary to set out the case for merger and, having learned the
lessons from the summer, we recognise that the case would have to be
made very clearly.</p><p><a name="06102512000720">The
hon. Gentleman asked about adequate public consultation beyond the
statutory period. That is what we tried last time, perhaps feebly. The
four-month statutory period came right at the tail end of the process,
which started last September and finished in July, which is somewhat
more than four months. We will learn the lessons about the method of
consultation. As a democrat, I would resist the call for local
plebiscites, because I do not think that they are very
democratic.</p><p><a name="06102512000721">On the
point made by the hon. Member for Broxbourne, Hertfordshire was
enthusiastic about a merger, just not with Essex. It would have been
happy to merge with Bedfordshire and there is still a strong desire for
the two to work strongly together. Naturally, they look more to Thames
Valley than to Essex for further help, assistance and collaboration.
The picture that has been painted of the Government on one side and 43
forces railing against merger on the other is not accurate.</p><p><a name="06102512000722">Any merger order would be
subject to the affirmative procedure, and we have learned the lessons
about exploring options for additional parliamentary debate and
scrutiny above and beyond the orders at the end of the process. We must
of course carefully consider the financial implications and have a
proper resolution of issues such as precept equalisation, capping and
others. Therefore, with a skip in my heart and in all humility, I think
that I may give a broad yes to all five of the points raised by the
hon. Member for Arundel and South
Downs.</p><p><a name="06102512000723"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew344"><a name="06102512001991">Nick
Herbert:</b> I thank the Minister for the reassurances that he
has given on four points. I also asked about the issue of proper
parliamentary scrutiny and consultation. In that context, can he tell
us whether the Government will set out any compulsory mergers before
the end of this Parliament? Or will the issue of protecting services be
settled by voluntary
co-operation?</p><p><a name="06102512000724"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew345"><a name="06102512001992">Mr.
McNulty:</b> I am sorry if the hon. Gentleman missed it, but I
did say that any merger order would be subject to affirmative
procedure. I will ensure that we learn the lessons of the summer in
terms of exploring options for additional parliamentary debate and
scrutiny. I will do all I can, working with ACPO, the Association of
Police Authorities and the forces, to ensure that the present process
fills the gaps and obviates the need for compulsory merger. After that
process has finished, I cannot promise that some forces&#151;not just
Lancashire and Cumbria&#151;will not decide that the only way forward
is merger. If forces want to merge voluntarily, that is fine, but given
the present situation I can confidently say that no enforced mergers
are on the agenda in the near future. I cannot give an absolute
guarantee, however, and I suspect that

retain the ability to compel mergers just in
case.</p><p><a name="06102512000725">People have the
wrong end of the stick on intervention. The Bill is not meant to
introduce a centralising regime. Some of the contributions made me dig
out my parliamentary pass to check whether it read Honecker or
Ceausescu instead of McNulty. The 2002 legislation provides that forces
must comply with direction, and the changes in the Bill involve
broadening the source of information so that the Home Secretary can
draw on HMIC and bring police authorities into his scope.</p><p><a name="06102512000726">If we may uncouple the Bill
from the bad faith in the merger debate, I ask hon. Members to judge us
by our actions, not policy or legislation changes. Even though we had
the powers to intervene, from both the 1994 and 2002 legislation, we
have not done so in all the years since 1997. That is not to say that
there have not been opportunities to do so or even the need to do
so&#151;I have mentioned the eight forces we have dealt with, three
of which we are still working with&#151;but we have taken
non-statutory, voluntary measures, working alongside the chief
constable and the force involved. As a last resort, however, we need
the ability to intervene in a failing force or police authority. There
is no malice aforethought in the provisions. It is not in the interests
of the Home Office or the Home Secretary to force or cajole
intervention in a police force. We want to reach a stage at which we
can work alongside police forces, in the interests of local council tax
payers. The Bill is not Stalinist or government by a big stick.
Statutory intervention would be a last resort, if fundamentally
necessary in the case of an irresponsible or capricious chief constable
or police authority&#151;none of which we have at
present.</p><a name="06102512001341"><p><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew346"><a name="06102512001993">Nick
Herbert:</b> Why will not the Government put the words
&#147;in the last resort&#148; into the
Bill?</p><p><a name="06102512000727"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew347"><a name="06102512001994">Mr.
McNulty:</b> Because that is not necessary, and has not been
since 1994&#151;that is, over the course of two Governments.
Ironically, the undue specificity involved in defining &#147;last
resort&#148; or &#147;failure&#148; means that statutory
intervention may be triggered sooner than people want. The more vague
the definitions, the more scope there is for non-statutory
intervention.</p><p><a name="06102512000728">I want
to make two more points. First, the Government have made some movement
on these matters, so I hope that the House will accept the words that
we propose in lieu in respect of Lords amendment No. 71, and reject the
amendment itself. Secondly, people can be flippant or gloating about
the mergers, but the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs
implied&#151;and the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne
Featherstone) said so more explicitly&#151;that there had been a
diminution in the independence or integrity of HMIC as a result of the
O&#146;Connor report or what happened during the course of the
mergers. I will have none of that: it is very important that the House
understands that HMIC remains full of integrity and utterly
independent. It is not appropriate to make sharp and unnecessarily
party political points attacking the inspectorate&#146;s integrity
and independence, and both hon. Members should feel duly
admonished.</p><br>

Solicitor-General (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</b> I beg to
move, That this House disagrees with the Lords in the said
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102512001268">The
amendment removes clause 15, which would allow punitive conditions such
as a fine to be attached to a conditional
caution.</p><p><a name="06102512001269">Conditional
cautions have been operating in a number of areas and have been
successful in dealing with offenders who would otherwise have had to be
prosecuted in the courts. The scheme&#146;s merit in dealing with
petty offenders has been recognised both in this House and in another
place. However, the usefulness of the conditional caution has been
limited by the requirement for conditions that are either to make
reparation or for some form of rehabilitation. They cannot at present
punish the offender. The Government believe that there are considerable
advantages in extending the scheme to allow punitive conditions,
including fines, to be attached. That is why we want to remove the
amendment agreed in the other
place.</p><p><a name="06102512001270">The
conditional caution scheme was introduced in the Criminal Justice Act
2003 as a way of dealing quickly with low-risk offenders who admit
committing relatively less serious offences. They will be diverted from
prosecution, subject to certain important conditions. The first is that
the conditional caution can be offered only when there is sufficient
evidence to charge a person with an offence and when the prosecution
has decided that that offence could be prosecuted in the public
interest. Those criteria must be
fulfilled.</p><p><a name="06102512001271">Secondly,
the offence itself must be appropriate for a conditional caution. The
caution is offered by the Crown Prosecution Service, in consultation
with the police, in cases where the offender would probably have
received a fine, been ordered to pay compensation or given a
conditional discharge if the matter were prosecuted in a magistrates
court.</p><p><a name="06102512001272">Thirdly,
the defendant must admit the offence. Fourthly, they must agree to be
cautioned. Crucially, at no time does the defendant lose the right, if
he wishes, to have his case dealt with by the magistrates court in the
normal way. He can go to the magistrates court, enter his plea and
receive a sentence in the normal way. That right remains open to him at
all times until he has agreed. Indeed, he may wish in due course to go
back to that court. The defendant will also need to agree to fulfil the
conditions attached to the conditional
caution.</p><p><a name="06102512001273">All those
conditions must be complied with. If they are not, the defendant will
be brought back and sent to the magistrates court, which will deal with
the

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1465</b><br>defendant for the original offence. No extra penalty will be offered for
the failure to comply with the conditional caution. That is the
process.</p><p><a name="06102512001274">The
scheme will help to free up capacity in the magistrates courts so that
they can deal with more serious and contested cases. I am a great
believer in the idea that the magistrates court is a forum in which
contested cases can best be determined, and also in which serious cases
can be dealt with well. A programme of conditional cautions has been
running already in a number implementation areas and we are now ready
to roll it out across the country.</p><p><a name="06102512001275">The magistrates courts&#146;
own statistics show that the average time taken for a non-motoring
guilty plea to be dealt with is 113 days&#151;that is three and a
half months. In addition, the court normally gives further time to pay
a fine or compensation. Some guilty pleas can require four hearings.
Conditional cautions can be much quicker in most cases, although not
all. It is sometimes necessary, for example, to identify whether a
condition to attend a drug rehabilitation centre can be complied with,
and so various reports and agreements to take someone may have to be
undertaken or addressed. So, it can take more time to deal with a
conditional caution, on occasion. However, the aim is that, by and
large, when the scheme is properly rolled out, we should be able to
deal with most conditional cautions within about 48 hours. In many
cases, the time may be much shorter than that. In those circumstances,
the outcome should enable compensation to be paid much more quickly,
for example.</p><p><a name="06102512001276"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew349"><a name="06102512002520">Mr.
Walker:</b> I apologise&#151;I was not present in
Committee&#151;but what is the incentive for someone to choose a
conditional caution over appearing before the magistrates
court?</p><p><a name="06102512001277"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew350"><a name="06102512002521">The
Solicitor-General:</b> There are a number of incentives. One
is that the matter will usually be dealt with much more quickly. An
offer is made and, in a sense, the defendant then has to choose whether
to accept that offer or to take the matter to the magistrates court,
with all the time that that may take. There is a greater degree of
certainty, because the defendant knows what the offer is, whereas he
does not really know what the magistrates court may do. He will be able
to determine whether he can afford to pay the fine&#151;or whatever
it is&#151;there and then. There are also limitations on the level of
fine that can be imposed as a result of a conditional caution. The
limitation is about a quarter of the maximum in a particular case or
&#163;500. The penalties will be constrained, in terms of what can be
done, if we get all the proposals that we want through. So, there are
some advantages to the defendant in choosing a conditional caution. He
will get free legal advice.</p><p><a name="06102512001278">Let me take
the hon. Gentleman through what would happen. Let us say that a
defendant has just been arrested, is brought to the police station and
is being charged with driving away from a garage without paying for the
petrol. He has got a few previous convictions, but nothing major. He is
not a long-term recidivist offender. I will describe how we would like
to see things operate. They have not always operated in this way in the
pilot areas, because we have been looking at how we

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1466</b><br>can get things to develop, but the aim is that the
scheme would operate in the following way. The offence would be
considered and a decision would be made about whether this was an
appropriate matter to be dealt with by a conditional caution. The
police would telephone the Crown prosecutor, or the Crown prosecutor
may well be in the police station in some of the charging centres. The
question would then be the conditions that needed to be imposed. When
the conditions were agreed by the prosecutor, an offer would be made to
the defendant. In such circumstances, it would be of key importance
that the defendant had admitted the offence and that there was no doubt
about his
culpability.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61024-0004.htmordayhd_18"><a name="06102512001357">8.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06102512001279">After the
prosecutor made the offer, the defendant could ask for free legal
advice. He would then decide whether to accept the offer, and a number
of things could then happen. For example, it might take a short time to
find out how much compensation should be paid. In the example that I
cited, for instance, it could be straightforward to calculate the
compensation, if the cost of the petrol was known, but if the offence
was a form of criminal damage, it might take some time to obtain quotes
to determine what the value of the compensation should be. If the
defendant did not agree to comply with the conditions, he would end up
going back to the magistrates court to be dealt with in the normal
way.</p><p><a name="06102512001280"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew351"><a name="06102512002522">Mr.
Hogg: </b>The Solicitor-General has described how the system
will apply to an offence of dishonesty. Will he remind the House of the
classes of offence to which the conditional caution may apply? For
example, I would be very concerned if it applied to classes of
burglary.</p><p><a name="06102512001281"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew352"><a name="06102512002523">The
Solicitor-General:</b> Essentially we are looking at petty
offences, although some of them, such as theft, concern people a great
deal. We are certainly considering shoplifting and some aspects of
criminal damage. We are also considering disorderly and antisocial
behaviour.</p><p><a name="06102512001282"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew353"><a name="06102512002524">Mr.

Burglary?</p><p><a name="06102512001283"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew354"><a name="06102512002525">The
Solicitor-General:</b> It would not be our intention that
burglary, especially residential burglary, would be dealt with by way
of a conditional caution. My view, for what it is worth, is that
residential burglaries deserve custodial sentences, although the courts
do not always impose them. The conditional caution would thus be
singularly inappropriate in such circumstances. At this stage at least,
we do not think that a conditional caution would be an appropriate way
of dealing with offences such as actual bodily harm, carrying a knife
and causing knife
injuries.</p><p><a name="06102512001284">The
system would be used to deal with the 75 per cent. of cases that are
dealt with in the magistrates court by way of a fine. Sometimes such
fines are relatively small&#151;&#163;25, &#163;50, &#163;100,
or perhaps &#163;150. Of course, costs can be claimed against a
defendant, but it can take a long time to get that money out of them.
We are looking for a way of ensuring that the magistrates court, which
is one of the best ways of dealing with petty offences, is able to deal
with contested cases&#151;when someone disputes their
guilt&#151;and more serious cases.</p><br>

Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> The Solicitor-General
outlines the way in which the police will contact the CPS and how the
CPS will make decisions. It seems ambitious to think that that will all
be done in 48 hours. Have the pilots achieved
that?</p><p><a name="06102512001286"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew356"><a name="06102512002527">The
Solicitor-General:</b> By and large, the pilots have not been
an attempt to achieve that. The pilots have allowed us to test various
ways of doing things. Several of the pilots have shown that it can
sometimes take about 14 days for the process to be completed and a
conditional caution agreed. The negotiation process between the police
and the CPS has been a learning exercise. The aim is to move beyond
that. As the hon. Gentleman will know, prosecutors often work in police
stations, and particularly in charging centres, so they are certainly
available during the day. It is envisaged that they will be able to
make decisions about conditional cautions, there and then. It is also
envisaged that, in due course, there will be a telephone system so that
the prosecutor can be telephoned for a decision on what the conditions
should be. That will speed up the decision-making
process.</p><p><a name="06102512001287">Where
conditional cautions have been granted, the response of victims has, by
and large, been positive. Their compensation was paid quickly, and they
found that the matter was dealt with much more expeditiously than it
would have been by the court system. By and large, the system works
well, but there are some problems. Before discussing them, I want to
make one further point to the hon. Member for Broxbourne
(Mr. Walker), who asked about the advantages of the scheme.
One advantage, of course, is that such cautions are not registered as a
conviction, which can be a considerable advantage for particular
individuals.</p><p><a name="06102512001288"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew357"><a name="06102512002528">Tony

scheme has worked well, as I said, but the conditions that can be
attached must have the objective of either rehabilitating the offender,
or ensuring that he makes reparation&#151;for example, by paying
compensation for the offence. The petrol thief would pay compensation
for the cost of the petrol, or could do something by way of
rehabilitation, such as writing a letter of apology.

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1468</b><br>Such conditions are undoubtedly useful, as they provide the offender
with an opportunity to take part in rehabilitative programmes,
especially to deal with alcohol or drug abuse. For example, a
drug-using prostitute might be given the condition of attending a drug
clinic, and that might help them to deal with the real cause of some of
their
problems.</p><p><a name="06102512001292">Offenders
have widely accepted the opportunity to pay compensation to the victim
for the damage caused by their offending behaviour. The important
result is that the victim typically receives compensation without
experiencing the usual delay associated with the court process.
However, that restricts the scheme only to those cases in which there
is an identifiable victim who has suffered quantifiable loss, or in
which the offending is linked to an underlying personal problem that
can be the subject of an order. A fine or punishment, such as some form
of work in the community, is not currently allowed. The petrol thief,
for example, could benefit from learning a lesson by having to pay a
fine as a deterrent, but at the moment we have to go to the expense of
going to court to ensure that that
happens.</p><p><a name="06102512001293">During the
implementation and operation of the scheme, we identified some
limitations in the legislation. For example, the term
&#147;reparation&#148; implies putting right the specific harm or
damage that the offender caused, but there are occasions when that is
not possible. The harm may have already been put right by the
victim&#151;he may have repaired what was damaged&#151;or it may be
impossible to identify the specific damage caused by the
offender.</p><p><a name="06102512001294">Punitive
conditions would allow the offender to make another contribution
towards paying for the damage caused, such as undertaking work in the
community that is not directly related to the offence. Not all offences
will involve quantifiable loss, but they may still disadvantage the
local community. Punitive conditions that form part of a conditional
caution could allow an offender to undertake unpaid work that benefits
the local community and its residents to make good the harm caused by
antisocial or disorderly behaviour&#151;in other words, it would
allow community
payback.</p><p><a name="06102512001295">Another type
of condition that the provision would enable is fines. Three quarters
of the wide range of cases that come before the magistrates court are
dealt with by way of a fine&#151;sometimes a small one, as I
indicated. Although the main objectives of the conditional caution
scheme are to ensure that reparation or rehabilitation takes place, the
availability of a condition that the offender pay a fine would improve
the ability of the scheme to provide a tailored response to offending.
This condition would not be at the expense of other, more suitable
conditions.</p><p><a name="06102512001296">Currently
the police can issue a penalty notice to punish the offender, and the
CPS can give a conditional caution where the object is to compensate
the victim. There may be cases where the appropriate response is to
include both of these measures. Prosecutors will also need to ensure
that where a financial penalty condition is imposed, it is
proportionate, appropriate and achievable. So, in the case of the
defendant who drove off without paying for petrol, a fine could be
imposed as well as a requirement to make compensation and perhaps write
a letter of apology. All those penalties would have to be
proportionate, appropriate and achievable.</p><br>

with the aims of a fair, equitable and proportionate scheme to provide
prosecutors with a limited amount of discretion to impose a condition
of payment of a fine, and to allow mitigating factors and the means of
the offender to be taken into account in assessing the size of that
fine.</p><p><a name="06102512001298">As I said,
there are a number of safeguards built into the scheme to protect the
rights of the offender. It is important to reiterate those. They
include the opportunity for free legal advice, the requirement of an
admittance of guilt by the offender, and acceptance of the conditional
caution in writing. Again, I emphasise that an offender can always
choose to reject the offer of a conditional caution and instead go to
court, so the offender always has a choice. In the event of
non-compliance with a conditional caution, the offender can be
prosecuted for the original offence. There is no additional
sanction.</p><p><a name="06102512001299">I have
already referred to the safeguards that we have built into the scheme,
but I am aware that there are still some concerns. I will listen with
care to the concerns that are likely to be expressed from the
Opposition Benches and we will consider them. We want to ensure that we
can consider punitive penalties, as well as rehabilitative and
reparational ones. An extension of the scheme to include punitive
conditions will require a revision of the conditional cautions code of
practice and would be subject to public consultation and to the
affirmative resolution procedure in the House. This will ensure
transparency and provide both Houses with an opportunity for further
discussion on more detailed aspects of the
scheme.</p><p><a name="06102512001300">In conclusion,
the Government believe that the clause allowing for punitive conditions
is a sensible and considered addition to the conditional cautions
scheme. It provides the opportunity to deal fairly with offenders
willing to admit their guilt. It also allows a swift and proportionate
response that is effective and has adequate safeguards. I urge the
House to overturn Lords Amendment No.

When one has fixed penalties, one has at least got an adjudication of
guilt, which, although it flows from what is effectively a guilty plea,
is instigated by the prosecution&#151;the police. I am not sure
whether I can see a difference in principle between a conditional

Friend&#146;s point, but I think that there is a difference in
principle, because the fixed penalty is statutorily prescribed, whereas
this procedure requires an offender to admit their guilt and then
accept a caution, which will be decided by the prosecutor according to
a variable measure. That potential variation turns the prosecutor into
a sentencer, whereas a fixed penalty is fixed by this House and known
in advance. The procedure will confuse the roles of sentencer and
prosecutor, which lies at the heart of the concern expressed by the
Magistrates Association and
others.</p><p><a name="06102512001310">The Government
have said that offenders can choose to refuse a caution, but the
concern is that people will feel pressured to accept a caution and the
administrative punishment that follows rather than going through a
prosecution, even if they are innocent, either because they fear what
the prosecution might involve or because they do not feel well

Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman has said that he
supports conditional cautions, but now he is trying to advance other
arguments. Why does that point apply to fines, but not to the other
rehabilitative or reparative conditions? He is arguing against the
whole principle. Again, I remind him that the system in Scotland does
not require the admittance of guilt, but it enables the procurator
fiscal to impose a series of penalties on individuals. As I understand
it, an increase in the penalties is being considered in Scotland,
because the scheme has proved to be so popular in the past 20
years.</p><p><a name="06102512001314"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew368"><a name="06102512002539">Nick
Herbert:</b> It is one thing for an offender voluntarily to
accept rehabilitation or reparation, but it is quite another thing to
accept a punishment. The difference of degree makes this development
alarming. </p><p><a name="06102512001315">Our second
concern is that punitive cautions will lead to two-tier justice. Those
without the means to pay the fine attached to a caution will have
little choice but to face prosecution, while somebody who can afford to
pay the fine will avoid conviction by
paying.</p><p><a name="06102512001316">Our third
concern is that conditional cautions might amount to soft justice. The
Government have claimed that their purpose is to extend the means of
delivering justice to low-level offenders. The Prime Minister has said
that summary justice will be tough and hard, but the maximum fine will
be &#163;500&#151;in practice, the figure may be less than that,
because it will be no more than one quarter of the maximum fine which
could have been imposed, if the offence had gone to a magistrates
court. Lower penalties are built into the architecture of punitive
cautions. Ordinary police cautions are already employed for serious
offences. In 2004, 400 cautions were handed out for wounding or other
acts of endangering life, and 451 were handed out for robbery. However,
there is apparently no statutory limit to the offences to which
punitive cautions could be applied. We do not know for what offences
they might be available. That will be decided on the basis of guidance,
which we have yet to see, from the Director of Public Prosecutions,
approved by the Attorney-General.</p><p><a name="06102512001317">The current national guidelines
for non-punitive conditional cautions allow for cautions to be used for
serious offences that are triable even on indictment only, albeit in
rare cases. That could include serious assaults. The danger is that
once a punitive element is attached to conditional cautions, they will
be used increasingly to deal with more serious offences that should be
dealt with in the courts. That would follow the pattern of moves to
summary justice that we are now seeing. The Government envisage that
30,000 cases will be dealt with by conditional cautions and a further
250,000 by the extension of fixed penalties. That extension could mean
that serious crimes such as assaulting a police officer and mugging are
punished by instant fines of up to &#163;100. Conservative Members
regard that as completely
inappropriate.</p><p><a name="06102512001318">In

Safety, the right hon. Member for Salford (Hazel Blears), conceded that
punitive cautions are a radical departure from the current law. So they

wholly inadequate. She

reason to reform the magistrates courts, not to shut courts out of the
criminal justice process altogether. What is proposed is a fundamental
transfer of sentencing responsibility from magistrates, and possibly
even judges, where it properly belongs, to prosecutors. The development
of summary justice has barely been debated in this House and should not
be accelerated by a single, highly controversial clause in a Bill that
has received little scrutiny because of the way in which the Bill has
been timetabled.</p><p><a name="06102512001320">Conservative Members do not
wish to support summary justice if it becomes soft justice, but the
whole House should be concerned about supporting fast justice if it
comes at the price of injustice. That is why we believe that the other
place was right to strike conditional cautions from the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102512001321"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew369"><a name="06102512002540">Lynne

will elaborate. I was referring not to prosecutors but to the people

purpose of conditional cautions may be transmuted from the original
purpose&#151;that is, to offer the criminal the chance of not having
to go to court on condition of changing their behaviour. For a
Government who are so keen on changing antisocial behaviour, that, with
reparation, should remain the purpose. If a fine is used as a
punishment, the original purpose will not be served and behaviour will
not be
changed.</p><p><a name="06102512001326">First,
let me put on the record the sorts of crimes for which a conditional
caution might, according to the Magistrates Association, be given;
although I heard the Solicitor-General say that it was not the
intention for such crimes to be included, there is no exclusion in the

include actual bodily harm, affray, criminal damage, possession of
class A or class B drugs, having a bladed article in public, carrying

black and ethnic minority populations often come from areas of
deprivation and are likely to fall into the category of those unable to
pay. That is an issue. I see that the Solicitor-General looks puzzled,
so I will pursue it now. The racism issue is simple. The evidence shows
that where the police have discretionary powers in respect of how to
enforce rules, they are often enforced in a disproportionate manner. We
know that more of the black and ethnic minority population are

clause as it currently stands sets out the right to give conditional
cautions with the sole objective of punishing the offender. Punishment
such as a fine by itself allows the offender to walk away from the
reality of what he has done. Without an element of rehabilitation and
reparation, it will do nothing to address the underlying reasons why
the criminal or disorderly act was committed in the first place. My
concern is that the imposition of fines will become easier. As the
Solicitor-General said himself, even when a magistrates court imposes
fines, chasing the money is a real issue, so I cannot see how this
approach will prove an advantage in such circumstances. It will
entirely miss out the criminal justice system, which is at least able
to give the public the confidence of knowing that the person in

Democrats think that the current principle of conditional
cautions&#151;that only conditions that facilitate rehabilitation of
the offender, or which ensure that they make reparation for the
offence, may be applied&#151;is a very good thing and the right
approach to those who have admitted guilt. It is very important that we
find ways of diverting people from offending at the earliest possible
stage, which is why the conditional caution is such a constructive
tool. The extension of conditional cautions to wider punitive
conditions will do nothing to address the underlying problems, the
rising prison population or the 60 per cent. reoffending rate. I
recognise that calls for due process and the involvement of lawyers,
juries and judges do not make for the most exciting of rallying cries,
but if we take the inappropriate step of cutting them out of the legal
system, the quality of justice and the cause of communal harmony may
well suffer.</p><p><a name="06102512001338">Someone
interviewed on TV might say, &#147;The big problem with our criminal
justice system is that it takes so long and it costs so much to deal
with so many crimes. We need to speed up punishment for minor crimes,
so that people can be punished quickly and we can move on and spend
more time on serious crimes.&#148; Essentially, that is the
Government&#146;s justification for the proposed new police powers.
They will undoubtedly speed things up, but at the serious cost of
omitting due legal
process.</p><p><a name="06102517000001"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew378"><a name="06102517000551">Mr.

principle between fixed penalties and conditional cautions. They are
the same. I agree that the sentence&#151;if that is the word that my
hon. Friend used&#151;is variable in conditional cautions, but the
general proposition is identical in each case. The prosecution, in the
case of fixed penalties, is creating a situation whereby there is an
adjudication of guilt, and the sentence is less important than the
adjudication of guilt. So I am afraid that, as to the matter of
principle, I cannot support my hon.
Friend.</p><p><a name="06102517000002">I
turn, however, to an issue where I am on the same side as my hon.
Friend. Listening to the Solicitor-General, it became plain to me that,
although he himself might not wish conditional cautions to be extended
to a range of offences that you and I would class as serious, Madam
Deputy Speaker, that remains a possibility. I accept that he spoke of
an unwillingness on his part to see them extended to burglary, but it
is clearly possible that, over time, they could be. The hon. Member for
Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone) referred to class A drugs
and the carrying of a knife, as, indeed, did the Solicitor-General. My
own feeling is that conditional cautions would be wholly inappropriate
to those classes of offence.</p><p><a name="06102517000003">We have
identified the possibility that conditional cautions will be extended
much further than we are presently contemplating. We all know that the
parliamentary controls on extending the range of offences to which such
a penalty can apply are very limited. I assume&#151;I have not
checked&#151;that it is done by statutory instrument. We all know
that the order-making powers confer on the Executive very large
discretion, and that we have very limited ability to constrain them. So
for that reason, if the Lords amendment is put to the vote, I shall
support it. I do not wish to see conditional cautions extended to, for
example, burglary, carrying a knife or actual bodily
harm.</p><p><a name="06102517000004"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew379"><a name="06102517000552">The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Member for Arundel and South
Downs (Nick Herbert) described the proposals as alarming. Hyperbole has
been employed on many occasions, but that description constitutes
substantial hyperbole. We plan an extension of conditional cautions,
which will enable us to achieve proportionality and an appropriate
response to minor criminal behaviour. Such behaviour is often tackled
through fines in magistrates courts throughout the land.</p><p><a name="06102517000005">The hon. Gentleman presented
three arguments. The first was one of principle, the second covered
magistrates courts and the objections of the Magistrates Association
and the third suggested that the proposals constituted soft law.
However, I note that Conservative Members oppose imposing fines, while
Labour Members want to ensure that criminals are properly tackled and
that the condition of a fine can apply to those who accept a
conditional
caution.</p><p><a name="06102517000006">In
considering the issue of principle, the key element is that the
defendant must always consent to the conditional caution. That
safeguard will always exist. The issue of principle that the hon.
Gentleman identified was the court&#146;s need to impose a
discretionary penalty. In Scotland, the procurator fiscal has imposed
penalties for several years, including a series of fixed penalties.
They can be &#163;25, &#163;50, &#163;75 or &#163;100.

higher figure is being considered.</p><p><a name="06102517000007">There have
been elements of discretion in the criminal justice system for as long
as it has existed. For example, the police have discretion over whether
to arrest someone for a minor offence. There is also discretion over
whether to prosecute, within specific limitations. Again, it is
important that no defendant has such a punishment imposed on him. If he
rejects the conditional caution, he simply goes to court. He gets free
legal advice about whether to accept the conditional
caution.</p><p><a name="06102517000008">The hon.
Gentleman suggested that some sort of pressure or coercion could be
exerted. Again, as always with a caution, the question arises of
whether someone wants to go to court and risk its verdict or admit
guilt and accept the caution. That applies now. We want to ensure that
there are appropriate ways in which the penalties are considered. When
the Joint Committee on Human Rights considered the conditional cautions
in the 2003 Act, it was satisfied that the safeguards attached to the
caution were sufficient to ensure that consent would be truly voluntary
and that undue coercion would not be applied.</p><p><a name="06102517000009">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
second argument applied to the magistrates court. I am a great
supporter of the magistrates court, which is a fine way of doing
justice. However, much work is going through the magistrates court and
some of it is fairly low level, involving, for example, petty offences.
That, especially given current high arrest rates, means that work has
crowded into magistrates courts, leading to substantial delays. A few
weeks ago I was in Hertfordshire, where it can take eight months to put
on a trial. That time has been reduced, through the work of the
magistrates court. In February, it was listing trials for
2007.</p><p><a name="06102517000010">Magistrates
courts are good at contested cases and serious cases. We should give
them the credit that they deserve for the serious cases, rather than
making them deal with many low-level petty offences, most of which they
tackle through a standard fine. A conditional caution could deal
successfully with many such offences. When conditional cautions have
been tried in the pilot areas, victims&#146; response to a fairly
quick result and getting the compensation paid has been positive. Many
of the Magistrates Association&#146;s objections are therefore
without genuine foundation, because there is no attempt to devalue
magistrates courts. On the contrary, the aim is to increase the value
of their
work.</p><p><a name="06102517000011"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew380"><a name="06102517000553">Mr.
Walker:</b> In July the Home Secretary caught the mood of the
House when he talked about doubling the prison sentence for carrying a
knife. Will the Solicitor-General assure us that conditional cautions
will not be used for people carrying knives, just as they will not be
used in cases of
burglary?</p><p><a name="06102517000012"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew381"><a name="06102517000554">The
Solicitor-General:</b> As I understand it, the Home Secretary
said that the aim was to increase the maximum sentence. The courts must
determine the appropriate sentence for each case. We take the view that
when knives have been involved in an offence, it would not be
appropriate to issue a conditional caution. We need to recognise,
however, that some cases in which young people have been carrying
knives are not dealt with by heavy penalties in the court system. A
degree of proportion is needed when dealing with these
matters.</p><br>

Herbert:</b> If the Solicitor-General has no objection in
principle to transferring the responsibility for sentencing from
magistrates to the prosecutors, where does he think that that should
end? Why has he drawn the line where he has? Why not extend the
principle by taking more cases out of the magistrates courts and
dealing with them by issuing conditional cautions? Where does he
propose to draw the
line?</p><p><a name="06102517000014"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew383"><a name="06102517000556">The
Solicitor-General:</b> We have looked at the ways in which
these cases could be determined, and at where the line should be drawn.
Having looked at the approach taken in the pilot areas, we concluded
that some of the cases that we thought might be the subject of
conditional cautions were probably not appropriate for them at the
moment. We need to look at all the facts and see how things develop.
Clearly, contested cases could never be dealt with using conditional
cautions; that would be nonsense. Similarly, the more serious cases in
which someone was being considered for a custodial sentence would
obviously be singularly inappropriate, because we would effectively be
taking that option out of the process. So there are natural barriers to
some cases being dealt with by issuing a conditional caution.</p><p><a name="06102517000015">There is also a range of cases
that would be appropriate, however, and when we can deal with such
cases appropriately by introducing elements of reparation and
rehabilitation as well as a penalty, it will be the victims who will
benefit. It will be the victims who will get their compensation
earlier, who will see justice done, and who will see the criminal
justice system operating for them. It is the victims who ought to be at
the heart of the criminal justice system, and that is what the
Government are in the process of doing. The Conservatives do not seem
to be worried about that, but we want to see those who are dealt with
by conditional cautions being properly fined. The Conservatives are
opposed to fining. They seem to be proposing to allow conditional
cautions to be restricted to a group of people who could have only
rehabilitative or reparative conditions attached to them. We want to
see proper justice being delivered for victims much more quickly. We
are doing that, but the Conservatives have failed to do it. I want to
ensure that the Lords amendment that would damage the process of
helping victims more is reversed.</p><p><a name="06102517000016"><i> Question put, </i>That this

that issue on Report or Third Reading. The Bill then went to the other

withdrew on Third Reading by giving the Secretary of State powers of
intervention and direction.</p><br>

turn to the Opposition amendments. We have largely dispatched much of
part 4, which dealt with the compulsory amalgamation of the five
inspectorates, not least because of some of the concerns expressed in
the House, in the other place and in campaigns outside the House. I am
happy to report that the five inspectorates have come together and, as
a result of discussions, reaffirmed a series of matters that meet the
policy points that we sought to implement through a

<meta name="Date" content="24 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1483</b><br>compulsory amalgamation. However, I shall come to that after I have
dealt with the amendments.</p><p><a name="06102523000018">The first of the amendments
would make provision, in a voluntary rather than compulsory context,
for the chief inspectors to consult Ministers and other inspectorates
only if they wish to do so. I recognise the spirit in which the
amendments were tabled&#151;the wish to dispense with additional
bureaucracy created by the original provision of the merging of the
five inspectorates&#151;but I do not consider it proper for a chief
inspector to have a discretionary rather than mandatory requirement to
consult Ministers or inspectorates. That would risk the chief
inspectors being detached from the priorities that Ministers properly
set. I emphasise that the duty is only to consult: the Ministers may
not in any way direct or control the inspection programme. That is
right and proper. Nor would it give them any mandatory duty to deal
with or consult other inspectorates.</p><p><a name="06102523000019">9.45
pm</p><p><a name="06102523000020">I am confident that
the Government amendments will remove the burden that was complained of
in terms of the broader requirement to consult other inspectorates, and
the inspectorates have said that that is something that they would do
as a matter of course anyway. The additional benefit of the Government
amendment is that it ensures that both parties agree when consultation
is not necessary, thus obviating the need for that layer of
bureaucracy. One cannot expect a single inspectorate to be aware of the
interests of all other inspection bodies. The consensual element guards
against the danger of one inspectorate unilaterally deciding that
another inspection body does not have an interest in a particular
matter. Much of the force behind all that the Government are doing with
inspectorates is the fact that we live in an ever more complex world.
It is important that inspectorates talk to each about inspection
processes.</p><p><a name="06102523000021">The second
Opposition amendment would remove the power of Ministers, in the case
of HMIP, to specify the form that the inspection programmes and
frameworks are to take. I know that my reassurance will not work, but I
will try anyway. I assure the House that the power is an administrative
provision that relates only to the form of the documents in question.
That is necessary for consistency and ease of planning. It could not be
used to specify the content of the programmes or frameworks. I
hope&#151;but I doubt it&#151;that that assurance and the
amendments that we have tabled meet the concerns raised.</p><p><a name="06102523000022">The inspectorates have met and
said to the Government, in terms, that they reaffirm their commitment
to the streamlined and modernised inspection programme as set out in
the policy statement of November 2005, and to the Government&#146;s
10 principles of public service inspection. They have agreed to develop
a joint business planning process to provide a framework for joint
inspection work to be developed from priorities indicated by the three
Ministers concerned with the five inspectorates. They will produce a
first joint plan for 2007-08.</p><p><a name="06102523000023">The
inspectorates have also agreed to review the use of resources and back
office support to identify any efficiency gains which can be redeployed
to joint working. They have agreed to report quarterly on the progress
of those arrangements to Ministers. Those proposals have

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1484</b><br>convinced the Government that we can achieve our objectives in relation
to the criminal justice system more quickly by focusing our efforts on
strengthening and improving joint working across the inspectorates,
rather than on proposals for organisational merger at this time. That
is underpinned by the clear commitments of each of the chief inspectors
to deliver real improvements in joint
working.</p><p><a name="06102523000024">The two
Opposition amendments were tabled in the context of the original part 4
of the Bill which laid out an enforced merger, rather than a voluntary
process&#151;a dispute we have just had in relation to police forces.
Because of pressure from the inspectorates, we have reflected and agree
that a voluntary arrangement is more likely to achieve the policy
outcomes that we both desire. We have removed the compulsory
dimension.</p><p><a name="06102523000025">We have
assurances from the five inspectorates about the way in which they will
achieve those policy outcomes voluntarily, and therefore the amendments
are not necessary. We have withdrawn the bulk of part 4 of the Bill. In
its place we have applied to each of the existing inspectorates the
provisions in part 4 for delegation of functions, inspection programmes
and frameworks, &#147;gatekeeping&#148; in respect of inspections
by other inspectorates, co-operation, joint action and assistance for
other public
authorities.</p><p><a name="06102523000026">The
bulk of our amendments provide the statutory underpinning for the more
efficient and effective joint working to which the inspectorates are
committed. They do not change the existing remits of the respective
inspectors, but the additional responsibilities originally provided for
in the Bill no longer obtain. The amendments simply provide ways for
each inspector to exercise his current functions more co-operatively
and flexibly. There can be no doubt that that is a desirable aim, and
it is shared by the inspectorates and the
Government.</p><p><a name="06102523000027">The other
Government amendments in this group simply fine tune those processes. I
accept that serious concerns have been expressed about the prisons
inspectorate, and to a lesser extent the HMIC, but it has been accepted
that the three criminal justice inspectorates could come together and
work better. The Government are not aiming to pursue the enforced route
originally laid out in the Bill; instead, we have listened to the
inspectorates and both Houses and come up with a compromise. That
compromise, which has been commended by the inspectorates involved,
achieves our ultimate policy aim to secure greater working efficiencies
in the five inspectorates, but in a way that is both voluntary and
faster.</p><p><a name="06102523000028">I urge the
House to accept the Government
amendments.</p><p><a name="06102523000029"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew392"><a name="06102523000654">Mr.
Garnier:</b> The Minister is, as ever, disarming. He said that
he had listened to both Houses of Parliament, but this House has not
had an opportunity to say anything. My hon. Friend the Member for
Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) tells me that the inspectorate
question was barely discussed in Committee because of the guillotine
and you, Mr. Speaker, will recall that it was not reached on
Report or Third Reading in this House. As a result, we had to rely on
the unelected House to do our work of scrutinising the
Government&#146;s policy on the
inspectorate.</p><p><a name="06102523000030">I am
happy to say that, just the other day&#151;on 10
October&#151;the other place defeated by 109 votes the

speakers in that debate supported the Government, and members of the
Government&#151;whom I will not identify&#151;told me in private
conversation that they considered the proposals to be dreadful. They
were ashamed of them and could not understand why they had been pushed
through. Luckily, Lord Ramsbotham was able to have his way and persuade
the other place that an independent inspectorate was essential and that
the Government&#146;s proposals were wrong.</p><p><a name="06102523000031">That was
fine, but something else happened on 18 October. Just five
minutes before the end of the time in which amendments could be tabled
for the Third Reading debate in the other place, the Government tabled
20 pages of them. That is not a sensible way to construct
legislation, and it is certainly not likely to convince this House of
the Government&#146;s ability to produce well-thought-out
proposals.</p><p><a name="06102523000032">The
Minister has just spoken for eight minutes, which leaves the rest of us
about 10 minutes before the guillotine comes down. It is an example of
the sort of constitutional outrage that the Opposition have to face.
The Government appeared to concede the case put forward by Lord
Ramsbotham and Lady Anelay in respect of separate inspectorates but, in
a way that I consider to be cynical and intellectually and politically
dishonest, at the last moment they inserted the 20 pages of amendments
to which I have referred. Those amendments completely destroyed the
value of the concession made by Lady Scotland on behalf of the
Government.</p><p><a name="06102523000033">Of
course, the Government now say that there will be an independent
prisons inspectorate, but those 20 pages of amendments make it clear
that the chief inspector of prisons will be under ministerial
direction. So they promise to give us something with one hand, but they
take it away with the other and then give us only 10 minutes to
complain about it.</p><p><a name="06102523000034">It is utterly
absurd&#151;indeed, it is worse than absurd, it is
dangerous&#151;to make legislation on such an important matter in
this way. I urge the Government not to treat the issue lightly. Our
amendments restore, in some small measure, the independence of action
and discretion of the chief inspector. Without our amendments, the
Government, who have made a concession and cynically withdrawn it, will
have destroyed a day&#146;s work in the other place and will have
undermined all that the noble Lords did. That is
appalling.</p><p><a name="06102523000035">I
have nothing further to say, other than to express the hope that not
only my right hon. and hon. Friends but Labour Members will consider
carefully what they are doing. Are Labour Members prepared to allow
themselves to be sucked into the Government Lobby on a false
prospectus, which is designed to demonstrate that the Government are
giving back to the chief inspector of prisons complete independence and
discretion of action, when in fact by turning down our amendments they
will be removing
it?</p><p><a name="06102523000036"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew393"><a name="06102523000655">Tony

place on 10 October; we can read in the <i> Official Report.</i> Lord
Ramsbotham was pleading with the Minister&#151;he used the words
&#147;I beg&#148;. This is a retired four-star general, not a man
who is much in the business of begging. This is the former chief
inspector of prisons, a man of great integrity and experience, yet he
begged Baroness Scotland to think again. She did, but somebody got hold
of her and made her think yet further, to the detriment of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102523000038"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew395"><a name="06102523000657">Mr.

enormous weight on the independence of the inspector of prisons. None
of us has access to independent advice about the conditions in prisons,
other than what comes from the prisons inspectorate. If we lose that
independence, we shall all be uninformed about what is happening in
prisons, which is often
scandalous.</p><p><a name="06102523000039"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew396"><a name="06102523000658">Mr.

so.</p><p><a name="06102523000040">The Government are
attempting by sleight of hand&#151;by procedural
shenanigans&#151;to micro-manage the inspectorate. That is
constitutionally wrong; it is immoral and it ought to be rejected. I
urge my right hon. and hon. Friends and other people of good will to
vote with us to support the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102523000041"><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew397"><a name="06102523000659">Lynne
Featherstone:</b> The proposal to merge the prisons
inspectorate and create a combined inspectorate rightly caused great
furore. My noble Friends in the other place made a cogent case against
the proposal, which we have not been allowed to do in this place
because the Government prevented debate by not allowing adequate time
on Report. That was a shameful avoidance of proper scrutiny in the
House. The Government are clearly without scruples about the democratic
process.</p><p><a name="06102523000042">Were it not
for the Lords amendment, we would be faced with an unscrutinised and
damaging programme for a combined, slapped-together inspectorate,
steamrollered through. It is typical of the Government to try to use
their brute strength of numbers rather than force of argument to get
their way. Their seriously misguided proposal was, thankfully, averted,
except that, as the hon. and learned Member for Harborough
(Mr. Garnier) said, despite the Government&#146;s apparent
volte face we are now presented with a restoration of power to the
Secretary of State.</p><p><a name="06102523000043">It
cannot be right for the Secretary of State to be able, by order, to
specify the form that inspection programmes or inspection frameworks
are to take. That goes against the necessary independent nature of the
inspection regime and its purpose. Neither should the chief inspector
have to consult the Secretary of State before preparing such a regime.
Each of the amendments that changes the word &#147;shall&#148; to
&#147;may&#148; puts back independence&#151;</p><br>

Brian H. Donohoe (Central Ayrshire) (Lab):</b> I welcome the
debate this evening on the regulation of the franchise
industry.</p><p><a name="06102523000599">As you know,
Mr. Speaker, you and I have similar backgrounds&#151;you
were an apprentice at Rolls-Royce Hillington, and I was an apprentice
at Ailsa Shipbuilding in Troon. We both had jobs which were fairly
secure, but others went into business, which is, perhaps, more
difficult. I thought that there was some security in the franchise
industry, but I have been proven wrong, as have a number of people,
which is why I welcome this debate. Business people take risks to
succeed in setting up businesses, but tonight I want to explode the
myth that the franchise industry is a relatively safe industry in
comparison with fully fledged business.</p><p><a name="06102523000600">I want to mention the case of a
business man in my constituency, Andy Walker, who has been
self-employed for some 30 years, during 15 of which he operated a
furniture company in Kilmarnock. He looked into the new venture to see
exactly where it would lead him. He took his life savings, sold his
furniture business and made his house available as collateral for
setting up the business, which shows that he did not take the decision
lightly. He researched the company involved long and hard by using the
internet; he held discussions with the British Franchise Association;
and he went to his bank. They all let him down, but those examples show
the robust approach taken by Mr. Walker in trying to
establish whether the concern would be supported.</p><p><a name="06102523000601">The business was trading as 24
Self Video Ltd., but somewhere along the line that changed to RAS
Partnership, which was part of a franchise network for renting DVDs.
There were initially three directors of 24 Self Video Ltd.,
two of whom have subsequently been disqualified having hidden behind
the front man&#151;Michael Duffy, who was the managing director. He
has a clear record and has intimated to me and to others that he took
no part in the business. In other words, as I said, he was being used
as a front man. The second director was one Tony Sacco, who, as
Mr. Walker and I have subsequently discovered, has been
disqualified from holding a directorship until 2009.</p><p><a name="06102523000602">A third individual, Martin
Reilly, has been disqualified as a director until at least the middle
of 2007. The interesting fact about Mr. Reilly is that he
changed the spelling of his name from Reilly to Riley for the purposes
of the company. That is significant, because it is a first indication
of evasion in the setting up of the franchise and the company itself.
My first question for the Minister, whom I am glad to see in his place,
is this: other than that disqualification, was any further action ever
taken against Mr. Reilly? For instance, has he ever ended up
in court on a matter related to this directorship or to the many more
directorships that he has held, all of which ended over a period of
years?</p><p><a name="06102523000603">In the period
from February 2003 to December 2005, some 30 outlets in the industry
opened, 15 of which

<meta name="Date" content="24 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1494</b><br>have closed with a loss in each case of some &#163;120,000. That adds
up to some &#163;2 million that people have invested and lost. RAS
Partnership has accrued an income, almost exclusively profit, of almost
&#163;4 million, yet of the 15 outlets remaining, none has reported
any profits of any description. All those people thought that they were
protected through the British Franchise Association, but all were let
down. I say to the Minister and to those in the industry that it is
time that much tighter regulation was
considered.</p><p><a name="06102523000604">The bank
involved has also failed and is guilty of clouding the issue of the
assistance that it gave when the franchise was being set up. It seems
to me, to Mr. Walker and to the others involved that all the
bank seems to care about is that the money loaned to the
individuals&#151;some &#163;70,000&#151;is repaid in full, and
that it does not matter what form that repayment takes, even if it
leads to an individual&#146;s house being taken from them. The bank
involved is the Royal Bank of Scotland and its associated bank in
England, NatWest. Those banks, and their branches, lent money to the
franchise although no other bank in the United Kingdom would do so,
believing that something was wrong. Indeed, it is alleged that a
Mr. Johnson of NatWest, who was a senior financial adviser
in Warrington, was a drinking buddy of Mr. Martin Reilly. It
so happened that the loan was subsequently arranged by the Royal Bank
of Scotland.</p><p><a name="06102523000605">What has
been done by Mr. Walker and by my office? Mr.
Walker has written to the Royal Bank of Scotland&#146;s chief
executive, Sir Fred Goodwin, who has sent three letters in response. He
says that the bank takes absolutely no responsibility as it is not
deemed to have given any advice on this occasion. What else are the
banks there for in relation to this industry? We have also written to
the BFA, which was initially most unhelpful in responding to any of my
requests in connection with this case. It states that it takes no
responsibility whatsoever and that</p><a name="61024-0005.htmbrev_52"><a name="06102523000642"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the fact a franchiser is or was
in the BFA offers only assurance that the business concerned succeeded
in meeting our accreditation criteria at the time they were
assessed.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102523000606">That is
outrageous. The association should have regulations in place so that,
at the very least, these companies are investigated and their financial
returns examined; it should also be established that the directors have
not been disqualified.</p><p><a name="06102523000607">The fact remains that my
constituent Andy Walker&#151;and others, it has to be
said&#151;have been badly let down by the company, which bears a
degree of responsibility, and the BFA. The bank has done nothing of any
use whatsoever for the individuals concerned, who stand to lose
everything. The process needs to be examined and reshaped, so that
individuals are in some way protected. If a more severe form of
self-regulation cannot be introduced, the Government must introduce
regulations. It must be mandatory that the BFA be advised of any
franchisee closures, in order that prospective franchisers can be
notified. According to my research, that is the system in the United
States. I ask the Minister to look into
that.</p><p><a name="06102523000608">The BFA must
make much more rigorous checks of its franchises and ensure that they
are reviewed far more frequently. It is plainly wrong for an individual
to be able to form a partnership while disqualified from being a
director. Even the BFA was sufficiently

company investigation team about this issue. If the Minister cannot
tell me tonight what the likelihood is of overcoming this problem, I
would like him to write to me. I want the bank seriously to consider
its position regarding the outstanding loans, and I want the BFA to be
far more proactive, or to face imposed regulations. I look forward to
hearing the Minister&#146;s
response.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61024-0005.htmordayhd_25"><a name="06102523000647">10.32

Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):</b> I commend my hon.
Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe) for
securing this short debate and for the clarity with which he expressed
his concerns, which arise from the sad experience of one of his
constituents. It is worth setting out the context of those concerns,
which is the practice of franchising.</p><p><a name="06102523000610">Franchising, which is of course
a well known form of relationship between businesses, is essentially a
matter of packaging an existing brand or business identity. The brand
owner licenses the use of the brand, trademarks and know-how to another
person, in return for payment. The franchising model is extensively
used; indeed, the <i> Financial Times </i>has estimated that if sales by
US franchise businesses were translated into national product, they
would rank as the seventh largest economy in the world. That gives some
idea of the scale. It is estimated that some 330,000 people are
employed in the United Kingdom as a direct result of franchising, and
the turnover of these businesses is in excess of &#163;10
billion.</p><p><a name="06102523000611">From the
brand owner&#146;s point of view, franchising offers the opportunity
to develop the business more rapidly than they could with their own
resources. For the prospective franchisee, there are some clear
advantages. Buying a franchise offers the benefits of an established
brand and a proven business model, rather than having to build a
business from scratch. The franchisee benefits from the brand
owner&#146;s own promotion of the brand, and the brand owner provides
support in the form of training, marketing assistance and know-how of
various kinds. Given that the business concept is already proven, it
can be easier to raise finance.</p><p><a name="06102523000612">However, there are of course
disadvantages, too. There are payments to be made to the brand owner,
which reduce the potential profits. The franchisee is obliged to adhere
to the established model and obtain approval for any changes. The
business can be sold only to someone approved by the brand owner, who
can go out of business.</p><p><a name="06102523000613">On balance&#151;of course, I
generalise&#151;franchising appears to offer an effective way of
starting a business. The annual franchise survey by NatWest shows that
a large majority of franchisees are satisfied with the business
relationship and would recommend it to someone who was considering
buying a franchise. It is often claimed that the failure rate for new
franchise businesses is less than that for new businesses generally.
There is some economic evidence for this, although I am cautious about
it because it is not conclusive.</p><p><a name="06102523000614">We have all however learned the
lesson that, where there are opportunities, there are also risks.
Anyone considering buying a franchise needs to assess the

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1496</b><br>opportunities and the risks with as much care as if he were buying an
independent business. There is a good deal of help available for that.
The Business Link network, which the Department supports, offers
helpful advice to anyone who is starting a business, including specific
advice on buying a franchise. However, that and any other general
advice is not enough on its own. Anyone considering a franchise
opportunity is strongly advised to take independent professional advice
on the specific opportunity in relation to his particular circumstances
before making financial commitments.</p><p><a name="06102523000615">It appears that my hon.
Friend&#146;s constituent took the plunge, and that things have gone
very wrong. I heard the constituent&#146;s story with much sadness,
as anyone else would. Many factors may, of course, be involved, but one
point in my hon. Friend&#146;s speech is of immediate concern to me.
He said that two people closely connected with the brand owner are
disqualified directors. That is, of course, a serious matter. Anyone
disqualified from acting as a director is also disqualified from any
direct or indirect involvement in the management of a company or
limited liability partnership. Any breach of those restrictions is a
criminal offence. The Department maintains an enforcement hotline so
that anyone can report evidence of such breaches promptly. I assure my
hon. Friend that those matters are treated very seriously. I hope that
he will encourage his constituent to report the evidence as soon as
possible so that it can be investigated. He could help facilitate
that.</p><p><a name="06102523000616">I am happy to
discuss the specific case further with my hon. Friend, but let us move
beyond it today. My hon. Friend suggests that there is a need for some
specific regulation of franchising. I have to say that I am not at this
stage convinced that that is necessary or desirable. A franchise
business is, in most respects, a business like any other. If the brand
owner has a sufficiently attractive business offer in the first place,
and conducts his affairs well, he may prosper. If his franchisees are
prudent and conduct their businesses competently, they may prosper,
too.</p><p><a name="06102523000617">To be sure,
things will not always work out. If businesses are to be allowed the
freedom to prosper, it follows that they are also free to fail. In a
dynamic market economy, the Government cannot insure businesses against
the possibilities of failure. Of course, my hon. Friend does not ask us
to do that. We can and should maintain controls against fraud,
deception, anti-competitive practices and irresponsible behaviour by
those who manage companies. I have already mentioned the controls that
exist on disqualified directors.</p><p><a name="06102523000618">To go beyond those general
regimes and institute special controls on franchising, however, it
would have to be shown that those businesses are especially risky or
hazardous. There are undoubtedly risks, and some are specific to
franchising. Anyone who considers buying a franchise needs to consider
them carefully and seek advice, as I have stressed. As I have also
said, our Business Link website provides helpful advice to anyone who
is starting a business, including specific advice on buying a
franchise. That highlights the advantages and disadvantages of
franchising, and points to further sources of advice, including the
banks and the BFA.</p><br>

special controls on franchising, however, it would have to be shown
that those businesses are especially risky or hazardous. The evidence,
such as it is, does not support that idea. Although it is not
conclusive, it does not suggest that franchises are more risky than
other forms of business start-ups. Of course, any deception or fraud
must be properly tackled, and it will be. But at the end of the day,
the Government cannot insure businesses against the possibility of
failure. I hope that this evening&#146;s short debate, and the
painful experience of my hon. Friend&#146;s constituent, will serve
to draw attention to some of the downside risks involved, and those
should not be underplayed. I do not want to end on such a downbeat
note, however. We should not lose sight of the fact that new business
start-ups are a vital seed bed for future growth and prosperity in our
economy. They are a source of innovation, competition and new ideas,
and they create more jobs than established business at all points of
the economic cycle.</p><p><a name="06102523000620">The Department of Trade and
