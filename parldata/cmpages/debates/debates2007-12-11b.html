 My hon. Friend is exactly right that employment is one of the keys to the prevention of reoffending.

We have put many resources into the prison system, and he will know that this year some 24,500 drug users are benefiting from clinical services in prison.

There was none up to 1998, when the Neill Committee on Standards in Public Life reported.

I admire his mimicry, if nothing else. I also say to him, yet again, that when we asked the Electoral Commission whether it had any evidence of a failure to comply with the spirit and the letter of the law in respect of trade union contributions, it said that it had none.

Does he also agree that that trade union money was clean in 1998 when the drug baron in China gave $1 million to the Tory party for a printing press in Reading&#151;money that was never given back?

 My hon. Friend, as ever, is entirely accurate. The simple truth is that whatever smokescreen the Conservative party now wishes to erect around the issue of trade union money, it was the Conservative party, as he, I and others in this House recall, that sought time after time during the 1980s to change those laws to make it more difficult for trade unions to make contributions to the Labour party.

 There is absolutely no comparison between anything that happens, or will happen, in the Prison Service in England and Wales and the appalling situation faced by the Californian prison system, where hundreds of prisoners are currently packed into gymnasiums. The Californian state now spends more on the prison service than on education. I can reassure the hon. Gentleman in that respect. Lord Carter bases his proposals on cost-effectiveness, and on his view on the effectiveness of such large prisons. As to whether the prisons will be local, yes, they can be. For example, there is an urgent need for more prison accommodation in London and the south-east, particularly to the east of the great conurbation. I see no reason why a local prison cannot be provided within a very large establishment, as with three smaller ones. Finally, it is perfectly possible within the perimeters of a large establishment to operate different regimes, so that one has the benefits of scale as well as the benefits of smaller prisons and better regimes.</p>

 The purpose of prisons has improved dramatically, as has the reality in the past decade. We do not have warehousing of prisoners. That is an easy thing for the hon.

He should look at the riots that took place in prisons and the continual inquiries that had to take place. He should take note, too, of the fact that there has been a 997 per cent. increase in drug treatment in prisons since 1996-97, with record numbers engaged in such treatment.

 My hon. Friend asked me a very specific question, so I shall write to him. However, a great effort has been put into education in secure establishments for young people as well as in establishments for adults. Ultimately, the responsibility for cutting offending rests with criminals, but we can provide facilities and support, as we have done for young offenders and their families. However, offenders must make a decision&#151;it is their responsibility, as it was their decision to get involved in crime&#151;to get out of crime.

We are currently running a consultation on &#147;Convicting Rapists&#148;, which was published in the spring, which is looking at all sorts of detail in the process, including whether to allow adult victims of rape to give video-recorded evidence at trial, whether to define in law a rape complainant&#146;s capacity to give consent to sex where drink or drugs are involved and many other matters, because we are all of the same view: we have to improve the conviction rate for this terrible crime.</p>

 The first ever children&#146;s plan, which we are publishing today, follows months of consultation with parents, teachers, professionals and children and young people up and down the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07121141000145">Over the past 10 years, the lives of children have improved. School standards are up, child poverty is down, and we have many more outstanding schools and many fewer failing schools. However, following our detailed consultations, the results of which I have laid before the House, I have concluded that we need further reforms to deliver a world-class education for every child and that we must do more to prevent children from falling behind or failing to fulfil their potential because of learning difficulties, poverty or disadvantage. I have also concluded that, although there are many more opportunities for young people today than ever before, families want more help to manage the new pressures that they face: balancing work and family life; dealing with the internet and modern commercialism; and letting children play while staying safe. The children&#146;s plan is our response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07121141000146">Let me deal first with the new measures to support the learning of every child. The early years are critical; so as we raise the entitlement to free nursery care for all three and four-year-olds from 12 to 15 hours, we will allocate more than &#163;200 million over the next three years, to ensure that young children receive the highest quality care in their early years, with at least two graduates in nurseries in the most disadvantaged areas, and to extend the offer of free nursery places to 20,000 two-year-olds in the most disadvantaged communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07121141000147">School standards are rising, but I want to accelerate the improvement. I have therefore asked Sir Jim Rose to undertake a root and branch review of the primary curriculum to create more space for teaching the basics&#151;English and maths, and a foreign language&#151;in all primary schools, and also to ensure all children start secondary school with the personal skills to succeed. If our making good progress trials are successful, we will implement age not stage testing nationally, which will represent the biggest reform to national curriculum assessment since its creation. To back our teachers, I am today allocating &#163;44 million over the next three years so that all new teachers will be able to study for a masters-level qualification and to establish a new future leaders programme to bring even more talented people into teaching.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07121141000148">Supporting parents is central to this children&#146;s plan. In future, every parent will have a record of their child&#146;s development and education through the early years and into primary school. The Minister for Schools and Learners will consult parents and schools over the next few months&#151;and legislate, if necessary&#151;to ensure that every child has a personal tutor who stays with them as they progress through secondary school; that every parent receives up-to-date information about their child&#146;s progress, attendance and behaviour, using real-time reporting and new technologies such as mobile phones or the internet; and that every secondary school has a parents&#146; council, so that parents know what they can expect, how they will be consulted and how they can express concerns and complaints.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07121141000149">Parents also want earlier intervention if their child falls behind. Alongside one-to-one support for reading and maths at primary school and our new every child a writer programme, I am allocating &#163;18 million over the next three years to improve initial teacher training about special educational needs and to find new ways to identify dyslexia earlier. Following the Bercow review, Ofsted will lead a review into our special educational needs provision in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07121141000150">In our consultation, head teachers told us that schools needed more support from other services to tackle all barriers to learning. Today, one in 10 children have a diagnosed mental health problem, but schools repeatedly say how hard it is to get the child and adolescent mental health services&#151;CAMHS&#151;to engage with them early enough. So I have agreed with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health that we will launch a review of CAMHS, to investigate how it can work better with schools and to identify where early support is most needed. Our two Departments will also produce the first ever child health strategy in the spring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07121141000151">We will also enhance inspection across schools and children&#146;s services, and examine whether children&#146;s trust arrangements need to be strengthened, including through further legislation if necessary. To improve services for parents further, and to enable better early intervention, we will publish new guidance for the building schools for the future programme, to ensure that where possible schools are designed to be co-located with other services&#151;health, police, social care, advice and welfare services. Furthermore, because schools must be sustainable for our children, and their children, we will set a new ambition that all new schools be zero carbon by 2016.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07121141000152">With the reforms that I have already announced to the House to tackle failing and coasting schools, to expand the academies and trusts programme, to raise the education leaving age to 18 and to introduce new diplomas, this children&#146;s plan will set us on course to deliver ambitious long-term goals for a world-class education for every child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07121141000153">Discipline in schools is essential for raising standards. We have given teachers new powers to tackle bad behaviour, and 97 per cent. of schools are now in behaviour partnerships, co-ordinating behaviour and exclusions policy, which Sir Alan Steer recommended should include all schools by 2008. I am minded to implement that recommendation in 2008, and I am asking Sir Alan to assess progress on all his proposals and to make recommendations in the spring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07121141000154">We will also strengthen the regulation of pupil referral units, improve the quality of provision and pilot a range of alternatives; that could be one role for studio schools. To break cycles of reoffending among young people, the Home Secretary and I are together allocating &#163;66 million over the next three years to target support at the young people most at risk of getting into crime. As we prepare our youth crime action plan, we will reform the education and resettlement of young offenders and pilot the use of restorative justice from April 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07121141000155">Our consultation reports that, while parents are clear that it is their job to bring up their families, they want more information and support to help them keep their children safe and healthy.

We will make proposals on young people and alcohol in the spring and investigate how the huge increase in commercial activity, advertising and marketing aimed specifically at children and young people is affecting their well-being.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07121141000157">I have two further announcements. In our consultation, children and young people told us that they wanted more places to play, interesting things to do outside school and recognition for their achievements. Earlier this year, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children, Young People and Families set out our 10-year strategy for young people, with an ambition to have new youth facilities and places for young people to go to in every constituency of the country. It will be funded by proceeds from unclaimed assets and new investment from my Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07121141000158">I want us to start to transform youth services now, so, before the unclaimed assets legislation takes effect we will invest an additional &#163;160 million over the next two years to develop high-quality youth facilities for young people, shaped by young people. That could mean 50 new state-of-the-art youth centres, 500 refurbished youth centres or more than 2,000 smaller centres, including mobile units. The funding will be available for every part of the country, and that will start in April. I urge all hon. Members to start working with young people, the voluntary sector and their local community to draw up local plans and prepare to bid for that money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07121141000159">Finally, to help parents to keep their children safe while playing outside, I can also announce that we will launch a new national play strategy early next year. To make that a reality, from next April we will build 30 safe and supervised adventure play parks in disadvantaged areas. With a total investment of &#163;225 million over the next three years we will also be able to build or upgrade more than 3,500 play areas across the country. There will be an average of 23 per local authority area and seven per constituency. That will be the largest Government investment in children&#146;s play in our history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07121141000160">With schools, children&#146;s services, the voluntary sector and Government all playing their part and meeting their responsibilities, and with the &#163;1 billion over the next three years we are allocating today to meet our children&#146;s plan commitments, we can unlock the talents and promote the health and happiness of all children, and not just some; back parents as they meet their responsibilities to bring up their children; and intervene early so that no child or young person is left to fall behind. We will make our country the best place in the world for children to grow up. That is the mission of this Government and the children&#146;s plan, which I commend to the House.</p>

circumstances. I also commend the Secretary of State for his work on special needs and his plans to improve the provision of respite care for the families of children who are living with disabilities&#151;a cause that is close to his heart, which he has consistently championed. It does him credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07121141000162">The Secretary of State is right that our children face a world that is full of greater opportunities and greater risks than ever before. However, the background to the children&#146;s plan, sadly, is a world in which our children are falling behind those of other nations. Last week, we discovered that we have fallen from fourth to 14th in the international league tables for science, from seventh to 17th for reading, and from eighth to 24th for maths. How does the Secretary of State explain why we were in the top 10 for all those subjects when the children sitting the tests had the majority of their education under a Conservative Government, whereas we plummeted down the rankings, relegated to the second division, when those sitting the tests had all their education under a Labour Government? Is not every external audit of our education system a story of Labour failure? Is not it time to acknowledge the limitations of the top-down micro-management and political interference of the old Labour approach and embrace genuine reform?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07121141000163">Today, the Secretary of State announces a review of the primary curriculum to clear away the clutter. It sounds attractive. However, at the same time, the Department is pressing ahead with a pre-primary school curriculum, with 576 different targets for professionals, which prescribes exactly how toddlers should</p>
<a name="71211-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="07121141000371"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;rub a rusk around the tray of a feeding chair... show delight by kicking and waving... use gloop&#148;,</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para19"><a name="07121141000165">How can the Secretary of State credibly say that he is clearing away the clutter and empowering professionals when he is sticking his fingers into everything and generating gloop on an industrial scale?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07121141000166">The Secretary of State says that he wants parents to be more involved in their children&#146;s education. Does not he realise that that involves trusting, not lecturing parents? Only last week, Ministers blamed parents for our slide in the literacy league tables. Parents should read more to their children, the Department dictated. However, did not the report that showed us falling behind contain no survey of how often English parents read to their children? Ministers criticised mums and dads on the basis of no hard evidence. When it comes to delivering on reading, do not Ministers bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that every child who can is reading by the age of six? Should not we ensure a more concerted drive to hold accountable those schools that do not use tried and tested methods by holding a simple test after two years to ensure that our children are being taught properly?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07121141000167">The Secretary of State accepts that there are flaws in the current test regime, but will his plans for a changed regime, with children taking tests at several different stages in primary school, mean that new tests are shorter than the current key stage 2 tests? If so, how can we ensure that they are not made less rigorous? With independent research from Durham university showing that literacy levels have scarcely improved in a decade, surely we cannot afford any less rigour.</p>

Instead of a clear picture for our children&#146;s future, we have an underwhelming collage, with items stuck on any old how and no underlying vision. Why are there no proposals to give parents the right to take their children from a failing school and place them in a good new school? Why is there no determination to give teachers the power to impose effective discipline by excluding disruptive pupils without having teachers second-guessed by those outside the school? Why, instead of giving more schools academy-style freedoms to innovate and drive up standards, is the Secretary of State still restricting the freedoms of existing academies?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para23"><a name="07121141000169">Is not it the case that, ultimately, instead of a broad and deep vision, we have a disappointingly hesitant and patchy programme, which betrays an itch to intervene but no grasp of the genuine problems? Is not it clear that, unless we learn from abroad and reform our education system to meet the challenge of global competition, we will fall further behind and the Government will fail future generations?</p>

 I was disappointed that the hon. Gentleman was not as funny as normal. However, to be fair to him, behind the usual scripted gags and froth, there were some serious questions, which I shall tackle. I thank him for his support for the Bercow review and our work to strengthen the provision of SEN support for parents and children. I agree that that is a priority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para24"><a name="07121141000171">I disagree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s reading of the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study&#151;PIRLS&#151;report, which made it clear that there was a responsibility on Government, teachers and parents to ensure that all our children are reading. If he reads the report, he will realise that it is clear that the brightest children are reading less at home. We all&#151;that includes us, as parents&#151;bear a responsibility for getting our children to read more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para25"><a name="07121141000172">The hon. Gentleman suggested that we are plummeting down league tables and that standards are falling. I remind him that, in 1997, when the Conservatives left power, 63 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved the key level in English and that that has now increased to 80 per cent. The figure for maths was 62 per cent. and it is now up to 77 per cent. For English and maths, the figure was 53 per cent. and it is now up to 71 per cent. The number of failing schools has fallen from above 600 to fewer than 30. This Government have delivered rising standards year on year through our reforms&#151;reforms that we take forward and strengthen in this report, so that we can be world class. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para26"><a name="07121141000173">The hon. Gentleman asked me about our new making progress assessment. Yes, the tests will be shorter; and no, despite his accusations, there will not be dumbing down, because we are introducing the reform of an independent standards regulator to give parents, teachers and schools the confidence that standards will not fall. As for his charge that we are going backwards on reform and academies, I am accelerating the academies programme, as I say to him every time he makes that accusation. The reform of the primary curriculum in this report is a good reform that will drive up standards in our schools.</p>

I have had a representation that we should re-impose tests, externally marked, on six-year-olds. I reject that proposal, as do parents and schools, as it would be the wrong thing to do. I have also received a representation that we should hold back for a further year children who do not make the grade in primary schools, but that was rejected in our consultation by teachers, head teachers and parents, because we do not want larger class sizes at 11. We do not want those children who do not make the grade to be held back in primary school; we want them to be helped as they move into secondary school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="71211-0004.htm_para30"><a name="07121141000177">I have also received representations that we should abolish appeals on exclusions as that would somehow reduce legalism, but the head teachers tell us that they want to keep the appeals as that would prevent them from being mired in the courts. I have also received representations that we should not go ahead with increasing the education leaving age to 18; I reject those representations. I have had a proposal that we should not introduce new diplomas; I reject that representation. I have also had a proposal that we should cut &#163;4.5 billion from the building schools for the future programme, and therefore put thousands of schools at risk in 76 authorities. Once again, in my consultation on the children&#146;s plan, I reject that representation.</p>

After all, if we set it alongside the conclusions of the UNICEF report published earlier this year, which put Britain bottom of the league table of 21 developed countries in respect of child poverty and child well-being, today&#146;s plan emerges as a mouse of a plan to deal with what is, frankly, a mountain of a problem. Even where new policies have been announced, they are tiny in their effect: 20,000 places for two-year-olds set against 650,000 youngsters in that cohort. What we have heard today is not, by anybody&#146;s independent judgment, a serious 10-year plan for children, but a hotch-potch of reviews, recycled announcements from earlier Secretaries of State, one or two gimmicks and a unifying theme that is a belief only in top-down big government solutions.</p>

Does not that indicate that Martin Narey of Barnardo&#146;s was correct to say yesterday that the Government now seem to be managing the failure to meet the 2010 target? Does it not also underline this Government&#146;s foolishness in deciding in the pre-Budget report to allocate &#163;3.7 billion towards the reduction of inheritance tax, set alongside the &#163;120 million&#151;an almost trivial amount&#151;found for child poverty? Why has the Secretary of State with responsibility for children failed to mention anything forward looking about what used to be one of this Government&#146;s great ambitions? Why do we continue to find that 1.5 million children&#151;almost of half of whom are living in relative poverty&#151;live in households that pay full council tax when the Government have been reviewing and reviewing that unfair tax for years and doing precisely nothing about it?</p>

the Government had fixed in their first term in office. We now find that apparently it has not and that we need another review. What is the review designed to achieve? According to the Secretary of State, it is to allow more time for literacy and numeracy studies, but we already know that 51 per cent. of time in primary schools is spent on those two subjects. Rather than have another pointless review of primary education, why does not the Secretary of State just devolve powers to schools to make those decisions? Is it really necessary for the Whitehall screwdriver to reach into every school in the country, directing schools on how to communicate with parents and even fixing the number of graduates in early years settings? How on earth can it be right for central Government to fix those policies? Why is there nothing in the statement to target extra money on pupils through a pupil premium that would target deprivation?

Surely it will make it much more difficult for parents to know whether their children have reached the standards expected of their age level, much more difficult for people to have confidence in the quality of the standards being described, and almost impossible for parents and the public to make meaningful comparisons between the performances of different schools.</p>

 I know that the right hon. and learned Gentleman takes these issues seriously and studies such matters closely. He will be reassured when he studies the detail of the proposals. I have listened to people, including those from the teaching profession, who have put it to me that we should move away from collecting information that allows school-by-school comparisons of performance to be made. I reject that approach&#151;it does not reflect the consensus in this country, including the consensus among parents. That information is essential in order to drive up standards in our schools and to ensure that we tackle schools that are coasting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="71211-0005.htm_para12"><a name="07121141000199">That is fully consistent with what we are talking about now&#151;a move towards a more stage-based approach to testing. Such an approach allows children to be tested according to their ability and the level that they have reached. It allows schools to stretch the best pupils further, while ensuring that children who are falling behind are still tested at a level appropriate to them. The information can then be used to make proper comparisons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="71211-0005.htm_para13"><a name="07121141000200">I shall give an example in order to explain the approach. If we were to say that all children who are learning a musical instrument, the violin for example, should be tested at 11, in year 6, it would be ridiculous to say that every child would have to take the grade 5 music exam regardless of whether they had started to learn a few years before and were at grade 1 or they were a good musician and at grade 8. It makes much more sense for the music test&#151;the tests will build on this principle&#151;to be based on the progress that the child has made. That in no way makes it difficult for us to compare schools in terms of the attainment levels that children reach. We will ensure that, under our pilots, we test carefully so that we provide information that allows comparisons to be made both between schools and with the past. Our independent standards regulator will ensure that we do that properly.</p>

of schools. We must ensure that where Ofsted highlights failures in provision, we act. One of the more general themes of the children&#146;s plan is that we need Ofsted to inspect across schools and children&#146;s services, in relation to the range of every child matters objectives and all the measures of well-being, including the way in which schools and children&#146;s services work together. That includes looked-after children.</p>

 I have read the children&#146;s plan, but I do not remember a proposal for police stations with cells.

We will take that forward, and I hope that every school will belong to one of those partnerships in which the police work with schools. If the right hon.

 When we conducted our review of the life chances of disabled children and their families, and allocated extra money for respite care and other services, we consulted across the country. Welsh and Scottish MPs were active in those consultations. In fact, my right hon. Friend led our parliamentary consultation with my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble). There was widespread expectation that the money would be spent not only in England but elsewhere, and that the Barnett consequentials would be spent on disabled children in other parts of the United Kingdom. That is happening in Wales but, to my knowledge, it has not happened in Scotland, where the funds have been diverted to cut council tax. I am very disappointed indeed that the needs of disabled children and their families are not a priority for the Scottish Executive.</p>

 We are addressing that issue in two ways&#151;first, through the extra work that we are doing through Sure Start to reach out to the families that the hon. Lady describes to ensure that they take advantage of the services on offer. Sure Start has a continual obligation to keep reaching out further into those communities to find parents who need help and are not getting it. The second way is through the investment that we are making in the early years work force. More quality and more graduates in the early years is the best way to persuade parents to take up their entitlement and to do the best by their children.

Can my right hon. Friend assure me that councils will have some accountability to ensure that they consult young people on the delivery and progression of the children&#146;s plan?</p>

 I can reassure my hon. Friend that the &#163;160 million spent on youth services through our Department and the Big Lottery Fund will be conditional not only on consultation with but on the active engagement of young people in drawing up proposals and their future management. Through her leadership in the all-party group on youth affairs, my hon. Friend has highlighted the importance of engaging young people in the design and implementation of policy, and this is a good example of an area where we will ensure that that happens case by case across the country.</p>

 This is an excellent plan. I particularly welcome the youth service proposals and the adventure playgrounds. Will my right hon. Friend say something about the eight-to- 13 age group, who are often neglected in this respect? What will be in it for them?</p>

 I mentioned the 30 adventure playgrounds, which will be particularly for that age group. However, the more general point is that many parents are concerned about the transition from primary to secondary school, and many teachers are concerned that some children are not making as much progress as they should in the first and second years of secondary school. We aim for parental engagement in that transition and in the early years of secondary school, and we will be able to address both those issues through these proposals, plus age not stage&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Stage not age&#148;]&#151;thank you&#151;stage not age testing and the making good progress pilots. That will help to support the age group that my hon. Friend mentions.</p>

 In children&#146;s first years of life, their main educators are usually their parents, not school teachers, and the professionals to whom those parents usually turn for support are not teachers but health visitors.

 Health visitors and midwives are playing a central role in many areas, and we envisage their doing so in future in the implementation of this plan. It is very important to bring together education, schools, children&#146;s services and health policy in local areas. We are expanding the family fund to support parents in supporting their children&#146;s learning at home, including in the earliest years. We also want to ensure that co-location of services includes health services in the earliest years. When I was at Cardwell school yesterday, I met people from the PCT and midwives who were doing that for children and families in that part of south-east London. We can make this happen across the country.</p>

The responsibilities of the EU, which I discussed with Foreign Ministers in Brussels yesterday, are critical to stability in the western Balkans, and I say the whole of the western Balkans advisedly&#151;Kosovo, Serbia and the other parts of the region together. The written ministerial statement that I laid before the House this morning sets out the Government&#146;s approach. The origins of the problem are ancient. They date right back to the battle of Kosovo Polje in 1389. However, the immediate context is set by the terrible experience of the people of Bosnia in the mid-1990s and of Kosovo at the end of the 1990s. Then, ethnic nationalism overwhelmed the forces of moderation and humanity. This time it needs to be different. Kosovo Albanians and Serbs need to know that restraint and due process will be honoured, and extremism and violence confronted.</p>

These efforts have been unstinting. I want especially to recognise the efforts of Wolfgang Ischinger, the German ambassador to the UK and the European troika representative over the past four months. I met Ambassador Ischinger again yesterday to hear his latest views. The basic fact is that despite the effort at mediation, there remains a wide gulf between the sides which further mediation will not close; so they have to choose and so do we.</p>

 I should like to address the three or four points that the right hon. and learned Gentleman has raised. First, the French Foreign Minister and I said in September that if the mediation process could not close the gap between the sides, the Ahtisaari plan for supervised independence was on the table and should represent the basis on which to move forward. To answer the third point that the right hon. and learned Gentleman hinted at, we also said that the Ahtisaari plan should be seen as a basis. If there is a way we can add to the guarantees that are offered&#151;to the Serbs in northern Kosovo, for example&#151;we should look to do so within a new constitutional settlement, recognising that Serbs are to be found not only in northern Kosovo but in other parts of Kosovo as well. </p>

We do not support the partition of Kosovo. The mediation team has been talking to both sides over the past four months, and that suggestion has been floated. Both sides have addressed the question, but we have been clear that partition is not the way to create a viable, stable constitutional settlement in Kosovo. We do not support that proposal. </p>

the north. I should like to ask the right hon. Gentleman two questions. First, what are his plans for the Serb enclaves further south? Secondly, what access can he guarantee for Serbs trying to reach the cultural sites, such as monasteries, that are extremely important for the Serb position?</p>

<p><a name="st_o181"><a name="07121141000293"><a name="71211-0007.htm_spnew25"><a name="07121141000584"><b>David Miliband:</b>
 The situation in Kosovo is unique, as I think the official Opposition have recognised all along. It is unique because Kosovo is the subject of the terrible tragedies of the 1990s; because it has been a UN protectorate within a country for the past eight years, since the 1999 UN Security Council resolution; and because it has been the subject of a political process that emanates directly from a UN Security Council resolution with the attributes that I have described. This unique situation circumscribes the boundaries of a new Kosovo in a very clear way. Any state needs to be viable, to be able to fend for itself and to organise itself, and I do not believe that partition would meet those criteria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="71211-0007.htm_para8"><a name="07121141000294">In answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question about protection for Serb minorities outside the north, I would say they need precisely the kind of security presence that the NATO KFOR force provides. There are 16,000 NATO troops there at the moment. That is in start contrast to the situation when the terrible events took place in the 1990s. He also asked a reasonable question about access to religious sites. The precise purpose of a supervised independence&#151;I emphasise the word &#147;supervised&#148;&#151;is to ensure that there is proper respect for minority rights, and that the kind of access he has described is properly organised and policed.</p>

 Does the Foreign Secretary accept that there is considerable unhappiness on the Kosovar side, not least because of the long-standing obduracy by Serbians over the handing over of indicted war criminals? There are four still remaining, and Carla del Ponte&#151;the United Nations war crimes prosecutor, who retires in a week&#146;s time&#151;has made it absolutely clear that she is certain that the Government in Belgrade knew exactly where two of them were two years ago.

 I strongly agree with my hon. Friend. Carla del Ponte made a presentation to the European Foreign Ministers in October. Of the 36&#151;I think&#151;indictees, 32 have been returned, and it is very important that the last four should be returned as well. It is also important to recognise that the Serbian Government have now put up $1 million as a reward. It is perhaps a little late in the day, but the reward is now there, and we now need to see 100 per cent. conclusion to the process, with all the indictees being returned.</p>

First, resolution 1244 provides a legal base for international activity, and the decision by NATO Foreign Ministers on Friday to confirm the presence of KFOR is vital in that regard. Secondly, the Ahtisaari proposal for supervised independence continues to provide the best basis for moving forward in the absence of agreement between the parties. Thirdly, the EU needs to take responsibility for the problem in its own backyard. Inaction means something worse than continued limbo; it means a festering problem that will become dangerous if there is  <br>

no way forward. Fourthly, there needs to be a European security and defence policy mission working in close co-ordination with NATO forces. Fifthly, there needs to be the significant outreach that I have described, to the Serbs in Kosovo, to guarantee their rights, and to Serbia. That position can command consensus in the EU in the months ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="71211-0008.htm_para1"><a name="07121141000298">The second major foreign policy issue for discussion on Friday will be Iran. I hope that there is consensus across the House on that issue. Iran has every right to be a proud, respected member of the international community; it does not have a right to set off a nuclear weapons race in the middle east. Last week&#146;s US national intelligence estimate&#151;the NIE&#151;judged that Iran had a nuclear weapons programme up until 2003, when it halted one aspect of it. If true, that is good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="71211-0008.htm_para2"><a name="07121141000299">However, the report does not answer the questions of the international community, which have been expressed in successive UN Security Council resolutions, about Iran&#146;s activities and intentions. That is why it is so important for Iran to come clean on its past activities, including on the nature of any weaponisation programme, past or present, that would be a serious breach of the non-proliferation treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="71211-0008.htm_para3"><a name="07121141000300">The facts remain stark. Despite demands from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the UN Security Council, Iran is still pursuing an enrichment programme that has no apparent civilian application, but which could produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon. Iran is still denying the IAEA inspectors sufficient access to enable them to verify whether the nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes. The head of the IAEA, Dr. el-Baradei, whom I shall meet on 7 January, has said that the IAEA&#146;s knowledge of Iran&#146;s nuclear programme is actually diminishing. Dr. Solana has reported on behalf of the E3 plus 3 that his talks with Iran&#146;s nuclear negotiator failed to produce a positive outcome. As a result, we will be pressing for further action in the UN Security Council.</p>

Either it can co-operate with the IAEA and comply with the demands of the UN Security Council, paving the way for a genuine transformation of its relationship with the whole international community, including the US, or it can continue on its path of confrontation, resulting in further sanctions and isolation.</p>

 Can the Foreign Secretary tell us whether, in the UK Government&#146;s assessment, Iran already has the capacity to deliver nuclear weapons? Is it only Iran&#146;s ability to produce them that is the problem, or do we doubt whether it has the ability to deliver, as well as whether it possesses such weapons?</p>

 We all know that the action that the European Council could take to which the Foreign Secretary refers is the imposition of sanctions to match the American sanctions. He is signing a treaty that elevates the prospect of a European common foreign policy yet further in the EU, but what is the possibility of getting agreement on this vital issue among the member states of the EU&#151;least of all Germany, which seems extremely reluctant to sign up to any sanctions against Iran?</p>

 The prospects are reasonably good. The leaders of the EU countries will send a clear message on Friday. Of course, existing EU sanctions involve Germany. I think I am right&#151;and if I am not, I shall be happy to write to the hon. Gentleman to correct myself&#151;to say that EU trade with Iran in the year up until May 2007 fell by 34 per cent. That is one consequence of the sanctions regime, in which Germany is playing a part. I am happy to try to find a breakdown of countries&#146; contributions to that 34 per cent. reduction. I had a conversation with Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German Foreign Minister and Vice-Chancellor, at last week&#146;s meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers, which also took place in Brussels. From that conversation, I know that there is a strong German commitment to being part of a sanctions package.</p>

If the millennium development goal targets are to be met, it needs to act as a driving force. Following his call for action in July, the Prime Minister is determined to use this and future Councils to push forward EU action to achieve the millennium development goals. We want the Commission to produce a full account of progress so far, and to make recommendations on how the EU can accelerate its efforts. If that work begins now, the EU will be able to lead the rest of the world by example.</p>

The EU-Africa summit agreed an action plan with trade at its heart. We are working hard for a conclusion to the Doha trade round, and economic partnership agreements have an important role to play. A significant number of African countries have signed EPAs, and I hope others will follow before the end of the year, providing better access to EU markets and helping Africa trade its way out of poverty.</p>

Why was the sanction lifted, allowing Mugabe to strut into Lisbon and swan around listening to one or two mild criticisms when the media were not present?

Does he think that the Council at the very least should discuss the nonsense that was the lifting of that ban, and that all the leaders should have followed the example set by my right hon.

 As the right hon. Gentleman knows, that is another issue close to my heart.

Denmark is a very small European country; it is not the fourth largest economy in the world, with a huge military presence.

 I begin by joining the Foreign Secretary in condemning the bomb attacks in Algeria that we have heard about in recent hours. I also echo what he said about our thoughts being with those who have lost their lives or been injured in those attacks. It may be too early to know who caused them, but the manner and choice of the targets seem to be compatible with the north African branch of al-Qaeda. We will no doubt know more in due course, but I hope that the Foreign Secretary will keep the House informed, particularly about any British citizens who may have been caught up in the events.</p>

Gentleman said about Iran and the importance of discussing it at this weekend&#146;s Council meeting. There is a need for increased European pressure on Iran over its continuing defiance of UN Security Council resolutions and its enrichment of uranium.

Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)&#151;that European leaders will reflect on what happened last weekend in relation to Zimbabwe and Robert Mugabe&#146;s attendance at the European Union-African Union summit. It did the European Union no good at all, and has done nothing to lessen the desperate plight of the people of Zimbabwe. I hope, too, that the long list of foreign affairs&#151;global affairs&#151;that need to be discussed this week will include the never-ending tragedy of the people of Darfur. The Prime Minister and the President of France have attached great importance to major progress there, but progress is not materialising on the scale that was hoped for earlier this year, and new momentum is required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="71211-0009.htm_para4"><a name="07121148000004">There is also the situation in the Balkans, to which the Foreign Secretary referred in some detail both in his speech and in his written statement to the House today. Tension is again high in the area. The Foreign Secretary has indicated, rightly in my view, that Britain will recognise an independent Kosovo, but I hope he will also ensure that any future recognition of Kosovo&#146;s independence by our Government will be based on a commitment by the Kosovo-Albanian leadership to implement all relevant provisions of the Ahtisaari plan&#151;he now indicates his assent to that&#151;particularly the provisions relating to the status of ethnic minorities in Kosovo.</p>

 It may well be necessary to raise that issue, and I suspect that the United Nations and the African Union will need to address it, but I think that the prospective size of the peacekeeping force is of greater concern. It was meant to be 26,000-strong, but nothing like that number have come forward so far.</p>

This debate is traditional, but it is disappointing that the Government have offered no separate debate on the recent report of the European Scrutiny Committee, which resulted in the Committee&#146;s exceptional decision to exercise its scrutiny reserve on a treaty and to call for a debate specifically on the document before it was signed.

my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) has already quoted, but I believe it to be true. Even now it is unclear just how much debate there will be in the House of this far-ranging treaty. Ministers have told the press that there will be 20 days of debate, although it would not be difficult to fill far more than that. However, they have not so far been forthcoming on the matter in the House and we look forward to hearing how many days of debate there will be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="71211-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07121148000035">The treaty will bring about a profound change in the EU&#146;s structures and powers, with major consequences for Britain. One way to illustrate to the House the scale of what is proposed is to look at the wide range of proposals in the treaty to which the Government were themselves opposed in recent years, and even in recent months. As recently as June this year, the Government argued that the high representative or Foreign Minister should not be able to chair the regular meetings of Foreign Ministers or take over the resources of the European Commissioner responsible for external affairs, but both of those things are to happen.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that if the Government have negotiated such a marvellous deal they have nothing to fear from putting it to a referendum of the British people?

This is the 13th year that the Court of Auditors has refused to sign off the EU&#146;s accounts. Year after year, the European Union fails to look after taxpayers&#146; money to the standard that taxpayers have every right to expect.

It is astonishing that Ministers are so blithe about it when they are even now fighting a desperate rearguard action on the temporary workers directive, whose red tape would, according to the CBI, endanger 250,000 jobs. The Government are finding it very hard to keep a blocking minority together, but they need a blocking minority only because this area is an EU competence and subject to qualified majority voting, both of which are a direct consequence of the abandonment of our opt-out from the social chapter in 1997.</p>

All three main parties stood on manifestos promising the British people a referendum on the constitution. No one&#146;s manifesto said that there would be a referendum on the EU constitution, but if another country voted no in their referendum the British referendum would be scrapped, the Constitution would be given a new name and a few tweaks, and the treaty would be shoved through without the British people being given any say on it at all. But that is the extraordinary thing that Ministers are proposing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="71211-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07121148000109">The whole story of the treaty has been of the Government&#146;s failure of leadership, in Europe and in Britain. If Ministers are to be believed, they never wanted the constitution or the treaty. They were defeated time and again in the negotiations. Of the 275 amendments that the Government tried to make to the original constitution text, only 27 were accepted. Now they have accepted a treaty that practically the whole of Europe agrees is only cosmetically different from the constitution, and which they dare not put to the British people.</p>

After the October summit he told European newspapers that</p>

Once again they are happy to treat the people of this country like fools, and the British people deserve better than that. Trust and confidence in the Government are draining away. There remains one notable way for the Prime Minister to repair some of the damage&#151;to honour his promise of a referendum. We will see if he has the courage to admit that he was wrong, act like a statesman and give the British people the chance to have the say that we all promised them.</p>

 In one way I am disappointed that we are having another general debate on European affairs and not being given a full debate on the reform treaty.

that really is at this moment at the heart of Europe. We have a term for it in Scotland, which the Minister for Europe will recognise, and that is &#147;feart&#148;. I cannot understand why the Government are in that position: it is clear that a reform treaty debate would have allowed the Government and people such as myself who have looked at the treaty to talk about its contents and structure, but again to argue on the front foot for a European treaty that takes us where that treaty will take us. We could agree on what the treaty will do, and still debate whether it is a good or a bad thing. But in the context of a general debate on European affairs, it becomes somewhat lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="71211-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07121153000002">However, at least we are having a debate on European affairs, and I make no apology to the House for raising an issue that is not the reform treaty as my first point today. We should have debates such as this on general matters going to the European Council, but we should also have had a formal debate, as the Lords were brave enough to do on the reform treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="71211-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07121153000003">The issue that I wish to raise first is the working time directive and the temporary agency workers directive, which will be reported to the European Council as a failure. This was a chance for the working people of Europe to see advances in their terms and conditions of employment and for protection to be brought in for the poorest and most exploited workers in Europe. In my analysis as a Labour party member, the UK Government are found wanting on the working time directive. We did not want the abolition of the opt-out after three years, as originally proposed, and we did not want to have an absolute cap on the working week of 55 hours, but negotiations broke down in 2006. The matter came back to the Portuguese presidency on 5 December with the proposal that there be no expiry date for the opt-out, which would have been beneficial to the Government and possibly to the Opposition, who have not been to the fore defending workers&#146; rights either when they were in government or in opposition. But there would be an absolute cap on the working week of 60 hours, which is a long week for anyone to work, but is a regular working period for many in the poorest sections of our community, in the hospitality industry and elsewhere in Britain. So there was no agreement on that, and that is disappointing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="71211-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07121153000004">With regard to the temporary agency workers directive, the Lisbon agenda said that there would be freedom and liberalisation of the markets and in the private sector, and there would also be liberalisation of labour markets. We have exploited that and used it to our advantage, and we have low unemployment because of it. The problem, however, is that people who work in agencies, not just under gangmasters but for any agency, find that they do not have the same terms and conditions of employment as people working alongside them. The worst example is in the telecoms industry, where members of the union of which I am the secretary in the House&#151;although not a member of because I took that interest on from my predecessor who was a postman&#151;tells me that people from agencies working alongside its members in call centres have not had a pay rise in five years, whereas those who work on a proper contract with an employer, whether it be an agency, BT or other call centre organisations, have regularly negotiated wage rises and all the other benefits that come with that.</p>

We have seen people coming by invitation, particularly from the A8 countries, to join our work force, and being offered agency work status, and then British workers being told that if they wished to work in a certain place of employment they would be made redundant but could then join the agency under the same terms and conditions of employment as those people coming into the country, without the benefits of organised trade unions.

 I will come back to the charter of fundamental rights, because there are lessons there for the trade union movement. I will also have some comments to make that may be read by senior members of the trade unions who appear not to be listening to any other avenue through which I have spoken to them about the charter of fundamental rights, despite my long history of trade union membership, and some leadership positions in trade unions in Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="71211-0011.htm_para17"><a name="07121153000008">The temporary agency workers directive would have required employers to give agency workers equal treatment and created a framework for the use of temporary workers that would be conducive to job creation and contribute to the development of flexible working.

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="71211-0011.htm_para18"><a name="07121153000009">The great problem was how long it would take for the EU Governments to implement the directive. The derogation asked for by the UK Government was five years. The UK also wanted one of the longest periods for a sunrise clause. Temporary agency workers would have to work for 12 months before they had these rights. Other proposals, including that of the Portuguese Government, whose people have been exploited on entering the EU, were for six weeks.</p>

Of the EU reform treaty Bill referred to in the Queen&#146;s Speech, it has been said that Parliament would have full opportunity to scrutinise the treaty in detail&#151;not yet, it would appear, but that was the promise&#151;that the treaty would move the European debate on from inward-looking institutional questions to focus on real issues that actually matter to the people who live in the member states, and that the treaty would set in place a series of sensible institutional changes to help make the EU of 27 member states work more effectively.</p>

That is encapsulated in the treaty; it is fundamental, and I do not think that anyone would disagree about it. Whether it had to be contained in this treaty is probably a major issue. Will it move us to the point where we will focus on real issues?</p>

Sometimes we send them for debate; we are trying to sort out the structure for the European Standing Committees so that the debates are back on the agendas of the private sector and civil society of this country. Just last week I spoke to a group of business people through the Industry and Parliament Trust. They said, &#147;We no longer know who to write to.

We could have got beyond the institutional structures and argued, as I may later, that having some of the changes opposed by the Opposition, such as qualified majority voting on different areas, and accepting that the European Court of Justice and the Commission will be given final jurisdiction over the implementation of European laws, will have the benefit of those laws being implemented throughout Europe&#151;not being denied by any part of Europe, but being available to all our businesses and citizens and all citizens of Europe when they come to this country. However, we will never get beyond certain issues because the Government appear to be hiding among a maze of red lines and superstructures that they have constructed above them. That is a great disappointment.</p>

 I cannot think of a stronger advocate for more powers for the Committee. At the moment, the Government and their Ministers just see us as a bit of an annoyance. We have been crawling all over them and doing our job properly and that can sometimes be tedious. Someone said to me recently, &#147;I&#146;m fed up with writing you letters.&#148; I should say that it was said jovially, but underneath it there was a bit of truth. We do not apologise for that or anything that enhances scrutiny. I shall come later to questions of to deal with the opting-in process; that must be discussed on the Floor of the House if the process is to have any credibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="71211-0011.htm_para25"><a name="07121153000018">Let us look at the Lisbon treaty from the perspective of the European Parliament&#146;s Constitutional Affairs Committee&#146;s report on it. First, there was the statement made at the conference on the future of Europe that I attended last week: let us accept the fact that 95 per cent. of European laws and decisions will be made under the European co-decision making process. That will give the European Parliament a say and the power to amend in 95 per cent. of cases. That is a fundamental, massive change, and I might argue positively for it. The one thing that used to worry me about Europe was that it involved a Commission and a group of bureaucrats and that there was no democratic say. The Parliament had the right to speak but no right to change, amend and have any power. If the conference statement is a good thing, it should be argued for.</p>

It states that the treaty will provide more democratic accountability, including greater scrutiny powers for the European Parliament, and that Council meetings will be in public, the new budgetary process will require Council and European Parliament approval, and that future revision of the treaties will be carried out by a convention. That means, of course, that the passerelle clause will be used in a number of cases.

The latter point is important; the EU would suddenly become controlled by the convention. The EU itself has not been, although Governments have. The report also introduces the idea of a European citizens initiative; I heard that debated at length last Monday and Tuesday but still do not know what it means. How would citizens get together so pressurise that great bureaucracy? Last week, I also heard statements again and again&#151;including from the rapporteur Richard Corbett, of the Party of European Socialists, and a member of the Labour party. He did not think that the yellow and orange cards would be workable; he said that they would never be used, and many echoed that in last week&#146;s debate. So according to European  <br>

 Does my hon.

 The dialogue was interesting. Some members, particularly people from the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe&#151;and particularly Mr. Duff, who chaired and steered the sitting every way, as long as it was his way&#151;said that the national Parliaments should focus on telling the European Parliament what they thought, and that it would then try to tell the Commission and the Council.

 That will depend on the Government&#146;s attitude to the role of Parliament. When the Government go to the Council, the European Scrutiny Committee is involved, and European Standing Committees can be involved if they can get the interest of Members of Parliament. However, at the moment I do not think there is a mechanism for Parliament to tell the Government what to do. My hon.

 The fluidity of the British constitution is such that what appears to be a system of persuasion and cajoling can be more effective than the concept of mandating. Governments find ways to get round the mandate; we have seen that on a number of occasions in those rigid forums.</p>

It also said that the EU would be able to act as one in external relations and that the pillar structure would be abandoned.

As I believe that we have shown in the annex to our 35th report, every provision of the constitutional treaty, apart from the flags, mottos and anthems, is to be found in the reform treaty. We think that they are fundamentally the same, and the Government have not produced a table to contradict our position.</p>

The concept of the opt-in that we have is an odd trap that the Government have set for themselves.

We still have final jurisdiction over how the system is applied in the British courts.

We are told in article 10 of protocol 10 that over five years there are 70 or 80 areas&#151;I do not know whether they will all be put together in a bundle&#151;where we will have to make a decision whether to give up the right of the British courts to judge these matters, and opt into them when they are changed into what is now called the Community method&#151;qualified majority voting.</p>

Every time they want to give up protecting the civil and criminal justice system, as they put it, they must present it to this House. Sometimes I might say that I would like to stay in an area that we have opted into&#151;for example, the European arrest warrant, which worked very well when we got back, within three or four days, one of the people who perpetrated the 7 July bombing.</p>

ECJ jurisdiction will apply, and if anyone breaks that, the Commission will decide to take infraction against them. On other issues, we might decide that we want them to remain within the jurisdiction of the British courts. As we showed, that is also a consequence of articles 62 to 69, which are all new areas that we can choose to opt into. That also applies to every amendment. There have been amendments to previous agreements, and we have had the right to choose whether to opt into them.

They had an agreement whereby they could keep what they had or choose the new arrangement. We could not understand why our Government did not get the same agreement, and we said so in our report.

 That is a factual statement. The previous Minister for Europe, who is now our Chief Whip, has said that that is how deals are done. I do not know whether other Members who were in previous negotiations accepted that that was how Europe works&#151;that sometimes people give in to something that they are not quite happy with on the basis that they are storing up good will for something coming down the line.

It said that under article 8, Parliament &#147;shall&#148; participate in institutions of the European Union. We objected to that and asked why the Government did not negotiate to put in the word &#147;may&#148;. They said that the French word, &#147;contribuant&#148;, means that the action is ongoing, but we talked to French Members, who said, &#147;No, that means, &#145;You will contribute&#146;&#148;. We understand that France took a strong position on this. They did not want to take out the word &#147;shall&#148; and put in the word &#147;may&#148;. The wording now is that Parliaments shall &#147;contribute to&#148; or &#147;participate in&#148;. The legal judgment of our officials is that that will be used by the ECJ to say that the Commission, if it wishes to in future, can take infraction against any Parliament that refuses to participate in any part of the EU&#146;s institutions. That is a very negative aspect. We expressed that view to the Government and suggested that they seek that amendment, but they did not secure it. On Monday, I asked President Barroso why we should not insert the word &#147;may&#148;, and he gave the same interpretation as the Portuguese Foreign Minister&#151;that the article imposes no obligation on national Parliaments and is purely declaratory in nature.

When we did not get the agency workers directive, the TUC said that it was a bad day for workers throughout Europe. It was also a bad day when the TUC concluded that the charter of fundamental rights would not be applicable because of the Government&#146;s assertion that it was tied up in the agreements, opt-outs and red lines, so working people would not be able to gain in their terms and conditions of employment or in any other matters related to the charter.</p>

I cannot understand a movement of working class solidarity that uses such a technique, and says, &#147;If I can&#146;t have it, I&#146;m taking their ball and going off the park, and you can&#146;t play.&#148;</p>

 Possibly, because I am not a Eurosceptic. I voted yes in the original referendum on Europe. I had more insight than the Minister for Europe who did not vote. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> He was too young. On his behalf, and on behalf of future generations, I voted yes, because I believed&#151;and still believe&#151;that the European project brings more for the people of this country, alongside the other peoples of Europe than it loses. I have absolutely no doubt about that, and I cannot understand a labour and trade union movement so churlish that it spitefully decides it will turn its back on solidarity across Europe because it wants a scrap with the Government,.

Even though I have differences of opinion about implementation and about the impact of each section of the red lines, I have no doubt that the treaty should go through the parliamentary process. It is a difficult treaty. It has 150 clauses and it will have a deep and fundamental impact on the people of Britain. We are elected to represent those people, and it is our job to ratify it.

Self-evidently, we face a world in which more and more challenges have an international dimension. Climate change, terrorism and the international drug trade are just a few of the major international issues that affect the everyday lives of people in the UK.

We are certainly not blind to its faults; we simply believe that we are better off in than out. All too often, the positive benefits that the EU has delivered go unmentioned by politicians and unnoticed by the public. For too long, the Eurosceptics have controlled the agenda on Europe. Those of us in this House who are pro-European, whether present today or not, need to reassert our arguments and make the positive case for Europe. In that context, the recent relaunch of the European Movement under the presidency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr. Kennedy) is a very good thing indeed.</p>

Although I do not intend to spend too long on this issue, because I am sure that it will be discussed at great length in January and I hope to be part of that debate&#151;reshuffle aside&#151;I want to say a few words about the institutional changes proposed in the EU reform treaty.</p>

The EU&#146;s policies will be fully discussed and scrutinised in Parliament, which I hope we would all agree is a welcome development for the UK. That said, we on the Liberal Democrat Benches will, as we have indicated previously, seek to table an amendment to the Bill when it is put before Parliament next year calling for a referendum, albeit not on the dry, technical detail of the treaty, but on the real issue, namely whether it is a good idea for the UK to stay in Europe or not. In or out&#151;it is time that we sort it out.</p>

 I am delighted to answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question. I will mention just three things that have gone from the constitutional treaty. The first is the constitutional concept. The European Council has stated that the constitutional concept has been &#147;abandoned&#148; and that, rather than replacing previous treaties, the reform treaty will amend previous treaties, principally the treaties establishing the European Community and the European Union.

The third thing that is different&#151;I will move on after this&#151;is that there is no explicit mention of the primacy of EU law. At UK insistence, mention of the primacy of EU law will be relegated to a declaration noting the case law of the European Court of Justice.

 I thank the hon.

I beg to differ; I think that it is, and I intend to proceed with my remarks on the subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="71211-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07121161000037">In our opinion, the only solution to the crisis in Kosovo is the supervised independence plan proposed by Martti Ahtisaari. His proposal envisages that the EU will play an oversight role while Kosovo develops the institutions and stable economy that it needs to enable full independence. We welcome today&#146;s written statement from the Foreign Secretary on his desire for rapid discussions on a new Security Council resolution before the end of the year. His statement also recognises the slim prospects of securing a deal, however. If Russia remains the sole obstacle to achieving a new resolution at the Security Council, the EU and the US must swiftly take the lead in recognising Kosovo under the terms of the Ahtisaari plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="71211-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07121161000038">This issue cannot be circumvented or ignored for much longer. We believe that Kosovo should eventually obtain its independence, but it must do so peacefully and under EU supervision. The Ahtisaari plan would facilitate that, and the EU should do all that it can to ensure that it is adopted as soon as possible. We have known that this day was coming for some time, and the EU must now come to a common position if it is to remain a credible player in the process. I hope that the Government will do all that they can to ensure that they get an EU agreement on this issue during the summit.</p>

The former high representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, my friend and colleague the noble Lord Ashdown, has rightly said that the prospect of joining Europe and NATO is the glue that holds the Balkan states on the path to reform. While I would not suggest that they would immediately revert to conflict if we took that glue away, they would certainly retreat into dissolution and the black hole of lawlessness. Sadly, recent events in Bosnia and Herzegovina have proved that to be all too true.</p>

 I am still unclear about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party&#146;s position on the issue of a referendum. As I understand it, the Liberal Democrats wish to have a referendum on the in or out question. If the proposal for such a referendum were successfully passed by the House, I would have no difficulty in saying that I would campaign for Britain to remain in the European Union. However, that need not preclude the holding of a referendum on the European reform treaty. It is entirely possible for lots of people to adopt my position&#151;namely, to support Britain&#146;s remaining in the EU while voting against the reform treaty. Where do the Liberals stand on the question of the treaty? Whether they win or lose on the in or out question, what is their position on the reform treaty? Surely we can have honesty from the Liberals on that question&#151;</p>

I hope that, during the summit, time will be given to a discussion on the situation in the middle east and, in particular, on what role the EU can play in the wake of the Annapolis conference and how it can help the parties involved to reach a conclusion before the end of 2008. The process will not be easy, and I am sure that there will be moments when negotiations will stall. However, it is the only hope for the region. It is also essential that the EU explore ways to ensure that the aid to the region really does reach the innocent civilians who need it, both in the west bank and in Gaza.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="71211-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07121161000048">Similarly, I hope that there will be a discussion on how the EU can improve its collective impact in Afghanistan. EU member states play a critical role in strengthening governance, delivering aid and, in some cases, fighting to improve security in Afghanistan as part of the NATO ISAF mission. Too often, however, effectiveness is hampered by poor co-ordination and caveats on military engagement. I am sure that the Secretary of State will agree with us that a stable, peaceful and secure Afghanistan is in the European as well as the British interest.</p>

Africa and most of the European Union agree that decisions about the future of the EU-Africa relationship need to be Africa-centred. It would be folly to imagine that we should be imposing solutions on Africa from our positions of post-colonial comfort, and I hope that the change in direction that the EU-Africa summit was meant to bring will be borne out in practice. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that, when brutal dictators such as Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe wilfully mistreat and abuse their own people on such a massive scale, we have a right and a duty to speak out. That is why we urged the Portuguese not to invite him to the EU-Africa summit, and why we supported the Prime Minister&#146;s position of boycotting the summit once it became clear that Mugabe would attend in person.</p>

We fully support proposals to remove restrictions on goods and services coming into the EU from Africa. Indeed, allowing greater trade from African countries and businesses will undoubtedly do more to change the trajectory of development than a generation of aid hand-outs. However, Africa nations must be allowed reasonably to protect themselves against the influx of imports from the EU countries, which is likely to have a devastating effect on the least developed  <br>

We need to carry on working to ensure that the EU is doing what is right and is doing it well. Only by playing a central role in shaping the future of the EU can the UK ensure that that is the case.

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter). I should like to pursue one point that he raised.</p>

I would like a different one.&#148; That is what the democratic process is all about. If a referendum on the question of being in or out should ever be put to the people, I could just about envisage a scenario in which two questions were posed and people were asked whether they wanted the treaty or not.

 Just to be serious for a brief moment, my hon. Friend was right to say that we want a choice. Does she not think that we, as parliamentarians, could propose some serious practical alternatives for Europe&#151;not for this Europe, but for a much better Europe?</p>

 Indeed. Let me return to the treaty. I ask the House to bear with me for a few moments, because one problem with most of these debates is that we do not pick up one issue and think it through logically to its conclusion. We tend to switch from institutions to policies and to make one case by using the other argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="71211-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07121165000012">I want to remind everybody of the difference between EFTA, the European Free Trade Association, and the EEC, the European Economic Community. EFTA was a free trading area&#151;something for which I think the Conservatives still hanker. The EEC, as it then was, introduced the freedom of movement of labour, which was very important, because the minute that people are moved between countries, the mechanisms are created that will eventually lead to deeper political integration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="71211-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07121165000013">The original institutions of the then EEC&#151;the legal mechanisms of directives, the European Court of Justice, which had a mandate for achieving deeper political integration, judicial interventions or qualified majority voting, which came in later&#151;have led to an EU with a range of tools, all of which were designed in one way or another to further political integration. The argument about the use of QMV, for example, is always, &#147;We cannot hold up progress by allowing Malta to stop us.&#148; I am afraid that if we are to have a union of nation states, there will be issues on which one member can say no. The minute we remove that right, we become federal states. If that is what people want, that is fine. I am one of those few people who are utterly agnostic about that because, having spent half my life in a federal state, I do not mind what people want, I just think that they need to know what they are getting, and it is no good pretending otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="71211-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07121165000014">The UK likes QMV occasionally, but I want to draw attention to something very different, because not only was the movement of labour significant, but there was another tool&#151;the internal market. Although the rest of Europe, by and large, always prayed the internal market in aid of deeper political integration and was little concerned with whether it was fulfilled or not, Britain always liked the internal market as an end in  <br>

itself rather than a tool. We were therefore much more focused on that notion, but those are the type of tools that the Germans put on the negotiating table that cause us a problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="71211-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07121165000015">The next problem is the time span during which things happen. The working time directive began to be debated in the early 1990s, but did not start to cause us political problems in this country until 18 years later when we realised that allowing the training of junior doctors to comply with the directive meant that many of our increased number of doctors were used up. As for the voters, they could no longer hold anybody responsible because they had all gone from office. People said, &#147;The pass has been sold.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="71211-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07121165000016">At this point, I want to consider something that is currently on the table. When I became a Health Minister in 1999, one of the first things that I had to do was to go to Europe&#151;I was the foreigner on the team, so they said, &#147;She can do abroad.&#148; There was a Health Ministers&#146; lunch, at which we all got together. A junior official came up and said, &#147;There&#146;s a case which you may want to raise over lunch. It does not really bother anybody apart from us, but the Dutch are sympathetic to us.&#148; The case was called Kohll <i> v.</i> Decker and it related to a Luxembourg national who went to Germany for dental treatment, and it was asked whether that was part of the internal market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="71211-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07121165000017">I remember that the position taken at that lunch was quite eccentric. Only the Dutch Health Minister, who had been around for a long time, realised that there might be a problem, but the case was seen as a peculiarly British obsession. At that stage, we were waiting for another court ruling on the costs related to that case. To argue that, three or four court rulings down the road, we would have a problem with running the national health service, because we were the only country whose health system was completely funded by taxation and based on residency, with no controls&#151;unlike other countries&#151;was seen as the product of an eccentric lawyer&#146;s imagination running wild. It was argued that I did not have to worry because health was not an EU competence. Health is now becoming an EU competence, albeit only on the public health side.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="71211-0014.htm_para13"><a name="07121165000018">This is not a debate on the EU health directive or the court cases, but we had a succession of court cases that ended with a British case in 2006, where the ECJ pushed it to the limit and applied the internal market as a mechanism to allow people to travel from one country to another and claim health expenses without prior authorisation. We reached the point where Ministers were saying, &#147;Thus far and no further. We now want a political input.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="71211-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07121165000019">That political input is now in a draft EU directive on health, to be published, I understand, on 19 December&#151; politically, an extremely active date. I know exactly what will happen. We will get the directive and will be told not to be paranoid, as it is all perfectly all right. An early-day motion has been tabled that states that the logical conclusion of that directive is that it will undermine the way in which we run the NHS. What is so sad is that almost the only mechanism open to Members to raise that issue is an early-day motion. If we are honest, we all know the political significance of early-day motions. We might as well spray graffiti outside Big Ben&#151;it would probably have more effect, because at least the cameras would catch it.</p>

This House is no longer in charge of all our legislation, so we must now find the areas in which we remain supreme. It can be argued that even matters to do with defence and foreign affairs can be circumvented. Over the decades, and step by step, the presumption as to where legislative power lies has moved away from this place.

Secondly, the political parties must stop playing silly games about matters such as the new health directive&#151;which incidentally looks suspiciously like the Tory policy on patients&#146; rights&#151;and be more open about what they believe.</p>

 I agree that there are dangers associated with referendums. Some countries have banned them, for very good reasons, but two points are worth making. First, in mature democracies, referendums are part of the democratic process. Secondly, when people in Wales and Scotland voted in referendums in the way that we wanted, I did not hear anyone on this side of the House say, &#147;They voted on devolution but they did not know what it was about.&#148; The Labour party has used referendums more than any other, and I must repeat that we promised one on the treaty in our election manifesto.

 The hon. Gentleman was in favour of a referendum in 1975, and so was I. May I draw to his attention the fact that the Liberals were also in favour of a referendum at that time? In contrast, we do not really know what they think now. They may be waiting for a reshuffle or something. Does he anticipate that the time will come when the Liberals will be able to decide whether they are in favour of a referendum on this matter?</p>

 I have the gravest doubts as to whether the Liberal party has any clear idea about where it is going with any policy, but an important point about the in or out question is being overlooked: that the proposed treaty is in fact a merger, through binding mandate, of all the treaties on the European Community and the European Union. It is also substantially equivalent to the original constitutional treaty, and that combination means that any referendum on a yes or no question would effectively come down to asking whether or not the British people wanted all those treaties. That is as close as I can get to asking whether we should be in or out, and I believe that some people may be underestimating the extent to which any referendum on the reform treaty would turn out to be one on all the treaties, as a whole.</p>

 Like the hon. Gentleman, I am in favour of a referendum. If one were to be held, it would be very popular and might well result in a no vote.

 I do, especially given what happened with the referendums in France and the Netherlands, and before those in Ireland and Denmark. We could have a referendum on this treaty, or on its ratification; I do not mind, and my motion on that subject has received strong support from members of my party. As I said earlier&#151;and my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) suggested the same thing&#151;I agree with the report from the European Scrutiny Committee stating that Parliament has been bypassed in a deceitful manner. That process was quite intentional, and our cross-examination of the Foreign Secretary has given us a more than sound reason for holding a post-ratification referendum.</p>

In the same way, this treaty has brought together all existing treaties and now presents us with a similar problem. That is a not a proper way for this Parliament to behave. In my opinion, the Government&#146;s approach has been dishonest and lacking in integrity. The most recent opinion poll was conducted in the past few days by Global Vision, and it found that 82 per cent. of people would like there to be movement towards an association of nation states through renegotiation&#151;something that I have long advocated. If those negotiations failed because the other member states simply refused to accept them, the question of whether to withdraw from the European Union would arise.</p>

I have never said that that is my explicit objective. However, I believe that we have passed thresholds. In my opinion, we did that on Maastricht and then on Nice and Amsterdam. I tabled hundreds of amendments to all those treaties. Indeed, on the European Union constitutional treaty, I think that I managed to reach 400. However, the bottom line is that we should have a referendum, as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston said. I echo others&#146; comments that we must preserve the right to legislate in this House for the electorate who elected us to represent them.</p>

I demand to know why the Government have not made the wording crystal clear so that there could be no question of a legal obligation on this Parliament. That raises the question of what lies at the heart of the European Communities Act 1972.

That remains the key issue; our entire democracy depends on it. People fought and died for it over the centuries and especially in the past 60 or so years.

The constitutional position of the European Court of Justice is that we are under an obligation to give effect to whatever emerges from the European Union, whether it affects our constitution or not.

It has been an interesting experience. I watched the whole process and, yes, fought aspects of it. In my own mind, I am not anti-European. It is pro-European to be pro-democracy.

 The trade union position has been somewhat variable. As I said to the hon.

That is not a theoretical abstract; we are dealing with a decision about whether we legislate properly on behalf of the people whom we represent. The answer is simple: it is my &#147;notwithstanding formula&#148;. If we include in our own legislation the words &#147;notwithstanding the European Communities Act 1972&#148; as a prelude to legislation that emanates from the European Union when we enact it in this place, that would require the judiciary to obey the latest, inconsistent, expressly stated measure from Westminster. They have no option. I think that we have reached that point, and I think specifically&#151;although I would take this on a far more general footing&#151;with regard to the Government claiming that they do not want the charter to apply to this country in the legally binding way I have described, the fact that, according to the ESC, they cannot guarantee that leaves them with only one option: to apply the &#147;notwithstanding formula&#148; in their proposals for the Bill to make certain that it does not apply. I am deeply disappointed and disturbed by the clap-trap put forward by the Foreign Secretary in the Government&#146;s replies to the ESC report, because they know that that was not only a threadbare but a non-existent argument.

have been all-pervasive in that they have gone into almost every other field. Members might or might not know about the so-called doctrine of the occupied field. I do not wish to explain it in detail other than to say that according to that doctrine if the EU has been granted competence in a particular field, a country could not legislate in its own Parliament. Furthermore, with the self-amending text point, which has already been discussed, the reality is that neither can it have any referendums in respect of those areas; a national Government would not be in a position to say that they were able to go to the people because they would have already made the textual changes internally within the framework of existing competences. Huge issues arise in relation to the treaty, which need to be not only carefully considered, but rejected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="71211-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07121176000023">The Prime Minister has been talking about the governance of Britain and the fact that he thinks treaties should be approved by Parliament. This debate should have been on a substantive motion. The hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk, Chairman of the ESC, made that point. Although the debate is taking place on the Floor of the House, it should also be subject to a vote. Not many Members are here but there are a variety of reasons for that, and I think the Government stand condemned by virtue of their failure to have a proper debate on a substantive motion before the treaty is signed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="71211-0015.htm_para10"><a name="07121176000024">There have been deceitful circumstances, and also obscure and opaque circumstances, as we discovered from our cross-examination; some of them have not been entirely resolved even today. At some point between about 15 and 23 June&#151;I cannot be exact&#151;things were going on. The German presidency produced papers; it bounced people, and papers emerged. There are also question marks over whether there was more discussion than was being disclosed. I simply make this point: against that background, it is fundamental to the integrity of this House that we make certain that the Government are forced into a position in which during the course of the debates that take place next year, not only do we have a referendum&#151;that is entirely justified in the interests of the British people&#151;but they are made to explain how it was that the poisoned chalice of the reform treaty was passed by the former Prime Minister within what appears to have been a period of approximately just one week before he gave up office and the new Prime Minister came in. I cannot believe that the new Prime Minister did not know exactly what he was taking on. Therefore, in the light of what I saw when I watched the former Prime Minister in &#147;The Blair Years&#148; on television, I was bound to conclude that in fact the incoming Prime Minister in part took on his job on an understanding that he would not disrupt the smooth passage of that poisoned chalice which he received from the outgoing Prime Minister. I think that that is the real reason we are not being given a referendum; I cannot prove it, but I believe it is the case.</p>

Is it not absolutely shocking that, 13 years on, no one has signed off the EU accounts? Where else would that be allowed to happen?

 I will not rub salt into the wounds of the Liberal Democrats&#151;[Hon.

I know from my own constituency, as I am sure will many other Members, that it is of real importance to the average member of the public. Many people are concerned about the European Union, as they have seen it encroaching, encroaching and encroaching on their lives, yet since 1975 they have had no opportunity to say what they think. I can put down the Government&#146;s reticence about having a referendum only to the fact that they know, deep down, that the chances are that the European constitution would be defeated in any such referendum. If they are so proud of it and think it such a great deal, there is no reason why they should not have that referendum.</p>

 My hon. Friend knows that I respect her stands&#151;they tend to be principled stands&#151;on a number of issues. Given her inability, however, to enter into the detail of the treaty and her tendency to keep wandering around the outside of it, we need to remember that it has 150 clauses. Reducing that complexity to a simplistic referendum run in the press&#151;mainly the Murdoch press, owned by an Australian with an American involvement, although I believe that Murdoch is handing it over to his son now&#151;would not be helpful. Any such campaign would be run on the basis of anti-European bitterness, and would have more to do with Murdoch&#146;s interest in the United States than anything to do with the European Union. Surely the detail&#151;of the European arrest warrant, for example&#151;should be debated in this Chamber line by line, not given over to some simplistic referendum campaign.

The treaty/constitution is a major step towards the superstate&#151;it is the topping-out ceremony of that superstate. We should have a quiz in schools and for the public. What does one call an entity that has an army, a defence policy, a foreign policy, an economic policy, a currency, a president, a public prosecutor, a Bill of Rights, an immigration policy and a trade policy?</p>

 Exactly. We are being asked to enter a federal state whose policies we cannot control and to which we are forced to hand over powers. We have to do as the majority in that federal state decides. It is a state to which we are subordinate. That is what the treaty creates.</p>

If a series of amendments were to be agreed by the House, which is not inconceivable, is it not possible that a proposal may emerge that is so diluted that it is not worth putting in a referendum? The logic of trying to amend the legislation is to bring it to such a point that it no longer changes the constitutional nature of the UK and its relationship to the European Union. At that point, a referendum is not needed. My hon. Friend suggests that he wants a referendum come what may.</p>

 In politics, we all stand on our heads from time to time. I came into a party in the 1970s that was sceptical about Europe. In the 1980s, the party was totally hostile to Europe and said that it wanted to come out of it in the 1983 manifesto. The party then grew warmer towards Europe, and under the previous Prime Minister it was positively enthusiastic about Europe. I have remained true and consistent.

After 2013, contributions will go up to &#163;20 billion gross, and &#163;6 billion net&#151;a doubling of the net contribution. That is a burden on our gross domestic product. It is a burden of about 0.5 per cent. on growth, and growth is cumulative.

It is, of course, not a reform treaty; it was never seriously intended to reform the European Union institutions. It was intended to strengthen them. I also agree with the hon.

Our democracy is not being replaced in any sense by a European democracy. There is no such thing as a supranational democracy, and it certainly does not exist in Europe. People have no sense of involvement in, or ownership of, the decisions made in their name in Brussels, and that is dangerous, particularly as issues such as criminal justice are now being involved. People assent to laws under which they may be imprisoned or fined if, in every sense, they are their laws, if they have a real and immediate opportunity to vote for or against them, and if they can talk to and consult the people who pass them. All that is absent in the European Union, and it will get worse, not better, if the treaty is passed.</p>

I sat one seat away from the right hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), who was representing the Government. An unfortunate, rather bemused but charming Romanian sat between us and kept us apart, but I watched the Government representative. He tabled scores, perhaps hundreds, of amendments on behalf of the British Government, only a handful of which were ever accepted. That is on the record, and we know from that that the British Government did not like the European constitution and much of what was in it, although they accepted and signed it.

On 19 June, the German presidency produced a draft text of the revived treaty. Two days later, it was agreed at the European Council summit in Brussels. The Council agreed the text politically, and since then there have been no substantive amendments. It has become a little bit worse for the United Kingdom, but essentially the matter was all over at that Council meeting. For those crucial two days between 19 and 21 June, a text was available. It went around Whitehall, although we do not know to what extent. We have asked the Government which Departments were consulted, but they have not told us.

It is extraordinary that the European Scrutiny Committee, of which I am a member, should meet in secret. We must ventilate the whole system and let light in.</p>

Now, it is all too late: the European Scrutiny Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee are conducting inquiries, or have already done so&#151;the ESC has produced two very good reports&#151;but essentially we are auditing something that has already happened. The Government persisted with their crime. An English text was not available for nearly a month and a half after the June summit concluded and the House had gone into recess. Remarkably, there is still no consolidated version of the text. There is only a confusing document with cross-references, which is completely inaccessible to the public.</p>

of the obligation of having to explain themselves to a Parliament or to a people, the Government acceded to a text that was, and remains, completely incomprehensible. Secretive and incomprehensible behaviour is the EU&#146;s besetting sin, and instead of curing that disease, we have reinforced it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="71211-0017.htm_para17"><a name="07121181000096">As for the text that was produced, it is clear from today&#146;s debate that the reform treaty&#151;or the Lisbon treaty, as it is to be called&#151;is not the son of the constitutional treaty but its twin, and probably its identical twin. If anyone is in the slightest doubt, I refer them to the table in the first of the two reports by the European Scrutiny Committee, which helpfully sets out all the articles in the constitutional treaty and all the articles in the reform treaty so that a comparison can be made. The Government were asked to do that, but they refused, so a Committee of the House undertook that laborious but important process. Anyone looking at that table would conclude that the reform treaty is almost identical to the constitutional treaty or, in the words of the report, &#147;equivalent&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="71211-0017.htm_para18"><a name="07121181000097">There are a few differences, for instance, on symbols. The hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter), in his truly dire contribution, advanced the proposition that it was a completely different treaty, because the symbols had been removed. He is right to the extent that the articles that mandate the stars on the flag and the anthem have been removed. However, they have been in use for 20 years, and they will not stop being used just because they are not in the Lisbon treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="71211-0017.htm_para19"><a name="07121181000098">Also, I am glad to say, 9 May is no longer to be the day on which happy European citizens are all to be on the streets thanking everybody for how lucky they are to be in the European Union. That has been dropped. Is it seriously the position of the Liberal Democrats that the dropping of the symbols in a treaty is such an epic event as to mean that we need not have a referendum on it now?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="71211-0017.htm_para20"><a name="07121181000099">As the text is identical, the only real difference is that the structure has changed. It is only in that sense that the constitutional concept is abandoned. The constitutional treaty unified the two main European treaties into a single text. The Lisbon treaty does not do so. Only in that respect can we say that the constitutional concept is abandoned. So when the Prime Minister repeats that phrase from the conclusions of the European Council, and the Liberal Democrat spokesman did it to try and strengthen his case, they are referring only to the form&#151;the packaging&#151;of the treaty. In substance and legal effect, the treaties are virtually the same.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="71211-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07121181000100">We are concerned about legal effect. The transfer of powers upwards from the House to the EU, the vast extension of majority voting, and the fact that EU goes into new areas such as criminal justice and a great deal further in foreign affairs and security&#151;all that is the same. There are a few name changes. The Europe Minister is to be called High Representative. People impressed by names and cap badges will think that the treaty is different, but in substance, it is the same. The referendum promise that was made by the previous Prime Minister is as valid now as when he made it.</p>

When the High Representative is conducting foreign policy on our behalf, how can the House or its Select Committees scrutinise that foreign policy? Our powers are going, and that calls into question our very democracy. What will be the point of having elections, when the people elected to the House do not control matters such as criminal justice, asylum policy or immigration policy?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07121181000102">The &#147;Why vote?&#148; question becomes virtually unanswerable. The Government are anxious to get people to vote. The Mayor of London thinks that we should all have lottery tickets instead of ballot papers to try and persuade everybody to vote. People will lose interest, not just in the House, but in general elections themselves if the issues that they are being called on to decide are decided, after a general election, not in the House but in another jurisdiction, in the European Union, over which they have only the most vestigial control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07121181000103">There is a pretence that our loss of powers is somehow offset by new abilities to question EU measures on grounds of subsidiarity. That is an illusion. We can already object to measures on grounds of subsidiarity&#151;our Select Committees do that&#151;and the European Commission can go on ignoring our objections, as they will be able to do under the new treaty. It is a total sham to suppose that the House has its powers strengthened in any way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07121181000104">The only remaining fig leaf is the red lines, on which the Government are increasingly trying to rely. They are supposed to salvage some powers of self-government, but the European Scrutiny Committee reports show how very flimsy these are. I shall not go into the details to show how the red lines are vulnerable. Those are available in the reports, and hon. Members should read them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para4"><a name="07121181000105">I shall make the general point that if and when the treaty is ratified and takes effect, lined up against the Government on the question will be most other member states, the European Commission and the European Parliament, all of which strongly disapprove of the red lines. They do not like them, they will try and undermine them, they will try and erode their legal powers, and they will have an ally&#151;the European Court of Justice. That court will be the arbiter and there is no appeal against it. The European Court is protective of European Union power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para5"><a name="07121181000106">That was illustrated recently in an interesting case about a man called Tillack, who was a journalist working for <i> Stern</i> magazine. He reported on European Union corruption&#151;not a difficult thing to do, given how widespread it is. Great offence was taken by OLAF, which, unbelievably, is the anti-fraud office reporting to the European Commission. It resented the work done by the journalist, so it reported him to the Belgian police and asked them to raid his home and office in order to try to get at his sources. That was done and they took away his papers and his computer, which they refused to give back. Eventually, the European convention on human rights was invoked and the Strasbourg Court found for the journalist, compensated him financially and awarded him costs.</p>

powers and privileges of the EU. That is reinforced by the new treaty. Again, I am staggered that the Government did not mind about that. Article 9 of the new treaty says:</p>
<a name="71211-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="07121181000121"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The institutions shall practise mutual sincere co-operation&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para7"><a name="07121181000108">and it lists the institutions. They include the European Council, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Court of Justice. So, in future, when another Member State or the Commission tries to undermine our red lines, we will be up against a Court that is enjoined by treaty law to practise sincere mutual co-operation with an institution that is trying to undermine our powers. It is not an independent body in that sense and the Government never raised any objections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para8"><a name="07121181000109">The whole process of so-called reform started in December 2001 with the Laeken declaration when Heads of Government meeting at Laeken realised that the game was up for the old Europe. People were rejecting it in referendums, turnout in European Parliament elections was declining and there was a general feeling of malaise. So it instructed Europe to democratise and it set up the Convention on the Future of Europe with a mission to simplify and bring Europe &#147;closer to its citizens&#148;&#151;that was the phrase used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para9"><a name="07121181000110">I have mentioned how I and the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston had the honour to represent the House in those negotiations, and they failed. They produced a constitution that was turned down. I predicted that and it came as no surprise to me. But we have now resurrected the same legal powers and given the outcome another name, and it deserves to be rejected again. The instructions given to the process in the Laeken declaration were not just ignored, they were contradicted. We have not simplified, we have made matters more complicated. We have not made Europe democratic, we have made it less democratic. We have not brought it closer to the citizens, we have taken decisions further from the citizens. More powers are taken away from the citizens and their national Parliaments and are to be decided further away in the EU over more areas of policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para10"><a name="07121181000111">The only way to resolve this is by referendum. With respect to some of the remarks made&#151;indeed by the Chairman of my Committee&#151;this is not simply a policy matter. I am against government by referendum. I am glad that I do not live in Switzerland. I would spend my time going down to the polling station to vote on everything and I do not believe in that. We have a representative democracy. So policy matters are fought out in Parliament. But the rules of that Parliament, and the framework in which this process takes place, must be set not by politicians but by the people. We are talking here about the rules of the game; about the powers of that Parliament. It is about who takes the decisions. Who are those people accountable to? Are they elected? Can they be removed? These are constitutional matters. They cannot be decided by Parliaments but by the people in a referendum.</p>

might have reflected the views of the Russian people, they were in no sense fair and free. Throughout the election period, 80 per cent. of the airtime on television and radio was devoted to the Government line. Every single independent television and radio station has been closed down by the Government, always for spurious reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para14"><a name="0712122000024">Journalists, particularly those critical of the regime, have been murdered in large numbers. One can imagine the row that there would be if a single journalist critical of the Government in this country had been murdered. The fact that there have been many such murders in Russia, without a single person having been brought to justice, is a sign of the repression of the media there. There is not only direct but indirect repression&#151;there is an air of bullying around the Russian media. Free elections cannot take place without free media; they cannot be held without a pluralist media environment, and that does not exist in Russia at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para15"><a name="0712122000025">Political parties in Russia have also been repressed. One of the requirements that Putin introduced was that a new party had to have 50,000 members before it could be started. The Liberal Democrats may not get 50,000 people voting in their elections this week, so they should look at what is happening in Russia and be fearful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para16"><a name="0712122000026">On top of that, the Government introduced a new law that increased the threshold that parties had to cross in order to gain seats in the lower house of the Duma from 5 to 7 per cent., thereby again limiting the power of smaller parties to be represented there. Non-governmental organisations have been repressed, including independent organisations such as Amnesty International, the British Council and others that were not founded originally in Russia by Russians, as well as Russian organisations themselves. That is very dangerous for civil society in Russia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para17"><a name="0712122000027">One interesting aspect that has not been much commented on is the fact that if a party secures a certain percentage of the vote in the election, it is forced afterwards to pay for the airtime that it had during the pre-election period. For instance, the Democratic Party of Russia secured only 0.13 per cent. of the vote in the elections and yet will now have to pay $6.1 million. As it is a very small party, that will almost certainly make it go bust in the next few weeks. Likewise, the Russian Social Justice party got 0.22 per cent. of the vote and will now have to pay $8.2 million. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para18"><a name="0712122000028">For British interests, perhaps one of the most worrying factors of the elections was that Andrei Lugovoi was elected on the Liberal Democratic party list&#151;not this country&#146;s Liberal Democrat party but the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. That gives him yet further immunity from prosecution, which makes it even more difficult for the British Government to secure justice for the family of Alexander Litvinenko. It seems entirely possible that he will now be made Deputy Speaker in the Russian Duma. That would be a gross insult not only to that family living in this country but to justice in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para19"><a name="0712122000029">The results showed that the United Russia party&#151;Mr. Putin&#146;s party&#151;secured 64.3 per cent. of the vote. On top of that, the Liberal Democratic party, which is allied to the Kremlin, got 8.14 per cent. of the vote and A Just Russia, another Kremlin-aligned party, secured 7.74 per cent. of the vote. How do we know that those  <br>

parties are aligned with the Kremlin? WE know because they have already declared that they will support whoever Mr. Putin supports to be president in next year&#146;s presidential elections. In other words, more than 80 per cent. of the vote and more than 80 per cent. of the seats for the 450-seat Duma have basically gone to one conglomerated party&#151;the presidential party. That is worrying.</p>

Having said last year that he would not anoint anybody as his successor but would leave it to the people of Russia and his party to decide who the candidate should be, Mr. Putin has decided that Dmitry Medvedev should be the candidate, thereby almost certainly securing the election for him. On top of that, we heard today that Mr. Medvedev has anointed Mr. Putin as the new Prime Minister. That example of Kremlin musical chairs is nothing other than despotic, and we should be worried about it. It might be that all this does not matter, but I believe that it does.</p>

Amnesty International&#146;s report last year made it clear that torture was endemic throughout the whole of Russia, despite the fact that the Russian Federation&#146;s constitution prohibits its use. It is also clear that there is a culture of violence in the police service and the security services, which means that many new entrants to those services have to go through acts of humiliation that inculcate yet further the process of violence.</p>

 As ever, my hon. Friend makes an important and telling point. Indeed, I am particularly worried about Russia&#146;s suspension of its membership of the treaty on conventional armed forces in Europe, which was the cornerstone of the end of the cold war. It is absolutely vital that Russia returns to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para24"><a name="0712122000038">I believe that the Russian Federation is now using, on a fairly systematic basis, enforced psychiatric treatment as a means of repression, much as the Soviet Union did. Indeed, sometimes it is using the very scientists who did it in the past. For instance, last year, Nikolai Skachkov, who protested against police brutality and official corruption in the Omsk region of Siberia, was ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation because investigators said they suspected he was suffering&#151;this is a direct quote&#151;from an &#147;acute sense of justice&#148;. He subsequently spent six months in a closed psychiatric facility with a diagnosis of paranoia. An independent evaluation that was subsequently undertaken&#151;not by the state psychiatric services&#151;concluded that he was completely and utterly healthy. Indeed, I would suggest that an acute sense of justice is a sign of sanity, not insanity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para25"><a name="0712122000039">In addition, there has been a significant rise in the number of racist and xenophobic attacks in the Russian Federation, and threatening attitudes have been adopted by the Government towards neighbouring countries, most notably Ukraine, Georgia and Estonia. I believe, and I worry, that Russia under President Putin&#151;however he rearranges the chairs in which all the various members of his inner Cabinet are sitting&#151;is steadily, inexorably, ineluctably and quite determinedly becoming a totalitarian state, and we shall regret it if we do not say so clearly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para26"><a name="0712122000040">Having made those remarks about Russia, I would like to move on to issues relating to the European Union and how they impact on British policy. There are two countervailing pressures in European politics at the moment. On the one hand, there is a push towards greater segregation, and I am conscious of that as a Welsh Member of Parliament. There are those in Wales who want to see further moves to greater devolution, or indeed, separation, and that is true of some people in Scotland. It is also seen in many parts of Europe. Sometimes there is a strong local, regional or national urge for segregation and separation, which can be accompanied by quite aggressive forms of xenophobia. We have seen that in many countries in Europe in recent years. Sometimes there are specific attacks on migrants or, more indirectly, on the whole concept of inward migration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="71211-0018.htm_para27"><a name="0712122000041">Sometimes there are two specific ideological accompaniments to that belief in further segregation. One is a kind of Manichaeism, dividing the world into good and evil&#151;we being the good, they being the evil. The other is a wholly partisan understanding of history. In a casual way, that sometimes plays itself out when it comes to voting in the Eurovision song contest, where people feel able to vote only for the countries whose views most closely resemble their view of the world.</p>

because there will be Zara and a branch of The Body Shop. Many of the elements of the economic future that everybody can enjoy are shared throughout the European Union. One of the results of the single European currency is that most countries that share the euro now have almost identical prices for large numbers of goods. The economic move towards integration across Europe is quite acute and often led by consumers.</p>

<p><a name="st_o424"><a name="0712122000043"><a name="71211-0019.htm_spnew0"><a name="0712122000555"><b>Mr. Drew:</b>
 There are still some of us who think that the euro has not been an unalloyed success. Indeed, many parts of Europe have faced economic depression because of the problems associated with it. Thankfully we stayed out and we have not faced those problems, so I wonder whether my hon. Friend is still in favour of joining the euro.</p>

<p><a name="st_o425"><a name="0712122000044"><a name="71211-0019.htm_spnew1"><a name="0712122000556"><b>Chris Bryant:</b>
 My hon. Friend knows that I am an ardent supporter of the euro. Whether I think we should join today, tomorrow, next week or in the next couple of months is quite another matter. For many countries in Europe, the situation is not quite as he suggested. For instance, the economic problems that Germany experienced, with high levels of unemployment, were far more to do with the integration of east and west than they were to do with German&#146;s membership of the euro. Spain has enjoyed an economic resurgence over the past few years, thanks in no small measure to its membership of the euro.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="71211-0019.htm_para1"><a name="0712122000045">There are other respects in which we can see a move towards integration. For instance, I do not believe that a single European country now believes it will go to war on its own. That is certainly true of this country&#151;we will never go to war on our own, unless there is an exceptional occurrence. That is quite a change from anything that has happened in the past. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West has a bad leg and is perhaps unable to get to his feet, but if he wants to make a sedentary comment&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> No, he does not; good. The final reason for the growing trend towards integration is the effect of economies such as those of India and China, which are pushing us towards integration so that we survive economically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="71211-0019.htm_para2"><a name="0712122000046">Those pressures play themselves out in different ways. In Spain, there is a drive towards integration, because of the passionate support in Spain for further integration in Europe, and at the same time a drive towards devolution and separatism, in Catalonia, Galicia, the Basque country and elsewhere. In Belgium, the position is exactly the same. Belgium is passionately supportive of its membership of the European Union and proud to have many of its institutions in Brussels, yet is currently unable to form a Government because of the separatism between the French-speaking and Flemish-speaking communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="71211-0019.htm_para3"><a name="0712122000047">In Serbia, the situation is exactly the same. Some 70 per cent. of Serbians want Serbia to be a member of the European Union, but Serbian nationalism is as ardent as it ever has been. However, it would be wholly wrong to suggest that EU membership for Serbia should be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations on Kosovan independence. Even more importantly, we should not say that the four indicted war criminals&#151;as opposed to others who have been accused of war crimes&#151;should be used as a bargaining chip. It is essential that Serbia should surrender them to the United Nations war crimes tribunal so that they can see justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="71211-0019.htm_para4"><a name="0712122000048">I want briefly to consider the position advanced by the shadow Foreign Secretary, the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague). As I understand it, his neo-conservative position on Europe tries to bridge those two strands in European thinking by focusing primarily on the need for a referendum. I have known the right hon. Gentleman for a long time. We were at university together and I even went to his 21st birthday party&#151;that was a thing to recall. He has been a passionate and influential member of the Conservative party since he was 16, or however old he was when he gave that famous speech to Mrs. Thatcher. Despite his current position, I never remember him militating for a referendum on the Single European Act or offering to tender his resignation if no referendum was called on the Maastricht treaty; yet now a referendum is convenient for him, so he proclaims it.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s policy, and that of his leader, is the desire to repatriate the social chapter and the ability to form employment and social legislation. In March this year, the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) said:</p>

<a name="71211-0019.htm_brev1"><a name="0712122000483"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The powers we particularly want back are over social and employment laws because we have seen many of those affecting the laws of this country, the employment laws of this country, the European countries trying to impose their social model, as it is called, on Britain.

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="71211-0019.htm_para8"><a name="0712122000052">I would say that that was a fair point from whoever was interviewing the right hon. Gentleman, who then replied:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="71211-0019.htm_para9"><a name="0712122000053">The truth, however, is that not a single country in either the east or the centre of Europe shares that perspective. Not a single one has signed up to the suggestion that there should be a renegotiation of the existing treaties, let alone of the new treaty that is to come before us in the new year. Not a single party in any other country in Europe has suggested that that should happen. What the right hon. Gentleman is saying is that he believes that a British Government should, by definition, be a lone voice crying in the wilderness in Europe. I put it to him that that is a recipe for disaster and for isolationism in Britain. It might be a neo-conservative view, but it would be wholly impractical, wholly impracticable, and absolutely wrong for this country. If the Conservatives were to form a Government&#151;that is a very big &#147;if&#148;&#151;and to make a unilateral declaration of independence in that way, the courts would immediately want to take a view on what Britain was doing to its legislation.

 And possibly a British one. All of them would do far more damage to Africa and other countries around the world. Furthermore, hon. Members often say that they dislike the fact that the European Union has been unable to sign off its books every year, yet they know full well that the area where there is most fraud is not the spending of the Commission but the spending of the member states. They are the same people who refuse to allow the Commission the power to insist on seeing the books of the member states so that that fraud can be tackled.

Twenty-six of the 27 EU leaders attended the conference. The only one who was missing was, of course, our own Prime Minister. I should like to congratulate the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, on her stance. She attended the conference and used the opportunity to berate Mugabe and to highlight the anger that we Europeans feel towards him about what he is doing to his own country. It is a difficult situation, of course, because no one would want to shake the hand of Mugabe. Nevertheless, the conference was extremely important. Issues of immigration, aid, security, climate change and trade were all discussed.</p>

Mugabe is awful, but he must not be allowed to stop important countries such as Great Britain from attending major international conferences. After all, billions of pounds of British taxpayers&#146; money goes in aid to Africa, and it is vital for us to take part in those talks.</p>

take the opportunity to speak out against it. I want to explain why. I feel passionately about the Helsinki agreement, which represented the first steps in the liberation of the eastern European countries. The great politicians of the west engaged for the first time with the dictators and oppressors of eastern Europe. It must have been difficult for Harold Wilson and his colleagues to meet people like Ceausescu, Brezhnev and other oppressors and dictators, but it was an important first step in securing freedom for that region. News of the discussions and the west&#146;s determination to get better human rights for the people of eastern Europe filtered through to those people on the BBC world news and through other media. I, for one, believe that the Prime Minister should have attended the conference, and I regret that he did not.</p>

I met the Foreign Secretary of Serbia a few weeks ago and he impressed me greatly. He was one of the many young political activists who fought against the brutal dictatorship of Milosevic. Like many others, he put his life on the line because of his determination to fight that dictator and oppressor. Who can forget the terrible struggles of 2000, when we saw on television the courage of those people who fought the oppression and brutality of Milosevic? Of course, someone like the Serbian Foreign Minister, who is a democrat and a decent, honourable man&#151;</p>

 I am glad that the Minister nods in agreement. The Serbian Foreign Minister, obviously, is under a great deal of pressure from the Serbian people. The prospect of losing 12 per cent. of their sovereign territory will whip up many people in his country into deep frustration and concern.

Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty), some of the dangerous sanctions that the new treaty puts on national Parliaments have not been properly drawn out. Our Parliament will have a duty to contribute actively to the good functioning of the Union. Nobody can predict accurately what that will mean in practice, but criticism by elected representatives in our Parliament of the European Commission and its decisions might be out of order. National Parliaments, unlike the European Parliament, were not creations of the treaties, and our rights do not depend on them. The new treaty proposes for the first time that national Parliaments be subservient to the Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="71211-0019.htm_para28"><a name="0712122000079">I had an interesting exchange with the Foreign Secretary at an evidence-taking sitting of the European Scrutiny Committee. I was amazed that he did not know the original French wording of the treaty and its provisions about national Parliaments. It was surprising, given that he said that he wanted to change it, that he did not know the original words. The treaty states that</p>
<a name="71211-0019.htm_brev4"><a name="0712122000486"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;National Parliaments contribute to the good functioning of the Union.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="71211-0019.htm_para29"><a name="0712122000080">However, the French original makes it clear that national Parliaments should contribute&#151;and have a duty to contribute&#151;to the functioning of the Union. The treaty also provides that national Parliaments must &#147;see to it&#148; that subsidiarity is respected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="71211-0019.htm_para30"><a name="0712122000081">Our report of 27 November, which did not get so much publicity, states that the phrase,</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="71211-0019.htm_para31"><a name="0712122000082">is one from which an obligation can be inferred. The Committee report continued:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para0"><a name="0712122000083">The Government have not fulfilled that undertaking&#151;but I should be delighted to hear otherwise from the Minister for Europe in his winding-up speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para1"><a name="0712122000084">A few weeks ago, the European Scrutiny Committee made interesting visits to two former Yugoslav republics of approximately the same size. I refer to the size deliberately, and also to the fact that they are completely or largely landlocked. They are the republics of Slovenia and Macedonia. The contrast is incredible. Slovenia is doing well. I had last visited Ljubljana in August 1991, when there was graffiti saying, &#147;Slovenia will rise again&#148;. It was shortly after the Jugoslovenska narodna armija&#151;JNA&#151;had trashed most of the city. Slovenia has risen again, and is doing incredibly well. It recently overtook Portugal and Greece and it is about to overtake Spain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para2"><a name="0712122000085">The other landlocked former Yugoslav republic of approximately 2 million people is Macedonia, which is not doing as well. It has an excellent Prime Minister, Nikola Gruevski. We also met the Deputy Minister for European Affairs, Gabriela Konevska-Trajkovska. They are impressive people, who are taking their country slowly but surely in the right direction. I believe that things will get done there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para3"><a name="0712122000086">I have mentioned two former Yugoslav republics of 2 million people that are both doing pretty well in different ways and can stand on their own two feet, because there is a third part of the former Yugoslavia, which also has a population of 2 million and is landlocked and mountainous: Kosovo. There is no reason why Kosovo could not go it alone. I believe that it can. It has far bigger problems than Slovenia or even Macedonia, but if we believe in self-determination, we must have some principles when we approach foreign policy. If a country of that size can go it alone, we should support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para4"><a name="0712122000087">There are some problems in terms of guaranteeing access for Serbs, and concerning the Serbian enclaves that are left&#151;which have been dangerously ignored by our Government and by other European Governments. We must engage a lot more there. There should, perhaps, be a plebiscite for the Serbs living in the north of the country so that they can determine their own future. We also need to guarantee access for the Serbian people to the cultural sites that they find of such value to their culture, and, as I have said, we must do something significant about the Serbian enclaves. If we can do those three things, I cannot see any real reason why we should oppose Kosovan independence. I look forward to seeing that day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para6"><a name="0712122000090">Members of all parties will appreciate that we face a potentially serious situation in the Balkans. Several Members have touched on that. As the shadow Foreign Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), said only yesterday:</p>
<a name="71211-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="0712122000489"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;While Kosovo is entitled to have its status resolved, this must be done in a way that avoids damaging repercussions for Bosnia-Herzegovina, for Macedonia and the region.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para7"><a name="0712122000091">The Ahtisaari plan represents a fair and sensible way forward. It is the result of careful and exhaustive discussions with all sides, and we must hope it can be brought peacefully to fruition in the months ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para8"><a name="0712122000092">Although we have touched on several themes this evening, the issue that has dominated the debate has been the revived EU constitution. That document has presented the Prime Minister with a considerable dilemma. He could have stood up for Britain&#146;s interests and vetoed the treaty, but instead he lacked the courage to do so and decided to go along with it. However, in order to avoid the crystal-clear manifesto commitment to hold a referendum on the constitution, he has forced his entire Government to go through the charade of pretending that the two documents are different, when everyone can plainly see that they are effectively the same. So let us nail this crucial point once and for all. Ministers are fond of quoting the sentence from the intergovernmental conference mandate which states:</p>
<a name="71211-0020.htm_brev1"><a name="0712122000490"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The constitutional concept...is abandoned&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para9"><a name="0712122000093">However, they very rarely read out the exact following sentence, which might be characterised in the current context as the missing sentence, and which states:</p>
<a name="71211-0020.htm_brev2"><a name="0712122000491"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As far as the content of the amendments to the existing Treaties is concerned, the innovations resulting from the 2004 IGC will be integrated into the TEU&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para10"><a name="0712122000094">the treaty on the European Union&#151;</p>
<a name="71211-0020.htm_brev3"><a name="0712122000492"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;and the Treaty on the Functioning of the Union, as specified in this mandate.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para11"><a name="0712122000095">In other words, the constitution is effectively revived wholesale with just a few minor exceptions, which the mandate subsequently points out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para12"><a name="0712122000096">Other EU leaders have accepted that point almost without argument. Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said that the two documents are 90 per cent. the same. The Spanish Foreign Minister said that they are 98 per cent. the same. The Spanish Prime Minister, perhaps seeking to outdo his Foreign Secretary&#151;I am pleased that our Foreign Secretary has just now returned to the Chamber, as being outdone by the Prime Minister is something he is not entirely unfamiliar with&#151;said that they are 99 per cent. the same. Valery Giscard D&#146;Estaing, who chaired the convention on the original constitution and about whom the Foreign Secretary was rather dismissive, says:</p>
<a name="71211-0020.htm_brev4"><a name="0712122000493"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;lift the lid and look in the toolbox and all the same innovative tools are there.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para13"><a name="0712122000097">In fact, Giscard has been berating EU leaders for their lack of courage in explaining to their people what is really going on. He summed up his frustration in <i> Le Monde </i>back in June in the following words:</p>
<a name="71211-0020.htm_brev5"><a name="0712122000494"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the public are being led, without knowing it, to adopt the proposals we dare not put to them directly.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para14"><a name="0712122000098">That is an extremely succinct exposition of this Government&#146;s position with regard to the people of Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para15"><a name="0712122000099">Not only has the Government&#146;s line been exposed as patently false by EU leaders abroad; the Prime Minister&#146;s argument has been betrayed by allies back home. Digby Jones&#151;or Lord Jones of Birmingham, as we must learn to call him&#151;let the cat out of the bag when he said:</p>
<a name="71211-0020.htm_brev6"><a name="0712122000495"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This is a con to call this a Treaty. It&#146;s not, it&#146;s exactly the same, it is a constitution.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para16"><a name="0712122000100">Shortly after that, the Government promoted him, but it is difficult to blame Lord Jones when even the Prime Minister cannot keep to the script himself. After an Anglo-Irish summit with Bertie Ahern in July, when asked at a press conference what had been discussed that morning the Prime Minister replied that they had been discussing the EU constitution and how they could take it forward over the next few months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para17"><a name="0712122000101">Then, after months of detailed examination of the two texts, the Labour-led European Scrutiny Committee, whose Chairman made a good and detailed speech this evening, and which must be commended for its vigilance in these matters, concluded that the two documents were &#147;substantially equivalent&#148; and that to argue otherwise would be &#147;misleading&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para18"><a name="0712122000102"><i> The Economist</i>, which is not exactly known for its Euroscepticism, concluded that trying to sustain the Government&#146;s position was &#147;a farce&#148;. Is it any wonder, then, that a poll in yesterday&#146;s <i> Daily Mail </i>reported&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>This was a Global Vision poll in the <i> Daily Mail&#151;[Interruption.] </i>Labour Members may laugh, but what matters is not where it was published, but what the poll said&#151;and the poll reported that almost three quarters of the British people want a referendum and that only 9 per cent. of the public believe that the two documents are different. Before any other Labour Members mock, they should remember the tremendous amount of time that the Prime Minister has spent sidling up to the editor of the <i> Daily Mail. </i>I have some good news for the Government, however. Although only 9 per cent. of the people believe that the two documents are different, that is actually up from a previous poll of a month ago when only 6 per cent. of the people believed that. Perhaps by the end of the process, if the Government work really hard, they might be able to sneak into double figures.</p>

 I am not sure whether my hon. Friend intends to come to this point later in his speech, but does he agree with me how baffling it has been to listen to the Liberal Democrats in this debate, in the sense that they want a referendum on whether we should be members of the EU, but they are not prepared to say whether they want a referendum on this constitution?</p>

 I have some sympathy with my hon. Friend, as it is often baffling to listen to Liberal Democrats as a point of principle.

 I just wanted to say that I hope that Conservative Back Benchers will not seek in any way to take advantage of the innocence and naivety of the Liberal Democrats in not having a position on this matter.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I believe that he intervened at least five times, if I counted correctly, on the Liberal Democrat spokesman; he persisted, in the words of Peter Mandelson, in &#147;punching the bruise&#148;. We will most certainly hold every Liberal Democrat MP to account in their constituencies for how they vote, as indeed we will hold every Labour MP to account in their constituencies for how they vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para20"><a name="0712122000110">Under pressure, the Government fall back on their much vaunted red lines, which are largely red herrings designed principally to distract attention from what is really being given up without a referendum. However, the European Scrutiny Committee in two very detailed reports picked apart the Government&#146;s red lines. The Labour Chairman of the Committee, the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty) told the BBC &#147;Today&#148; programme that the red lines would, in his words, &#147;leak like a sieve&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para27"><a name="0712122000117">We have a clear pattern of confident assertion followed by internal confusion in the face of detailed examination followed by retreat, and we suspect that that pattern will be continued when we debate the ratification Bill in detail next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para28"><a name="0712122000118">I expect the Minister for Europe to get to his feet in a few moments and tell us that the constitutional concept has been abandoned, and that there is therefore nothing to worry about. Perhaps he will also tell us that there is excellent data security at HM Revenue and Customs, that there is plenty of room in our prisons, and that the former Prime Minister and the current Prime Minister have always been best mates. All that would be about as honest as the Government&#146;s position on the reform treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para29"><a name="0712122000119">The Labour party&#146;s manifesto at the 2005 general election was very clear about the EU constitution. It said:</p>
<a name="71211-0020.htm_brev12"><a name="0712122000501"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We will put it to the British people in a referendum and campaign whole-heartedly for a &#145;Yes&#146; vote&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para31"><a name="0712122000121">The Government continue to tell us that the two documents are different when they know full well&#151;the Foreign Secretary knows, the Minister for Europe knows, other Ministers know&#151;that they are effectively the same. Even the Prime Minister has admitted as much, in a memorable Freudian slip&#151;and that from a Prime Minister who stated that one of his key objectives was to restore &#147;trust&#148; in politics, which, as he told the BBC specifically, included honouring Labour&#146;s 2005 election manifesto. That same Prime Minister is now doing precisely the opposite, and treating the British people like fools along the way. The Prime Minister once famously told his predecessor &#147;There is nothing you could say to me now that I could possibly believe.&#148; The risk that he faces is that if he continues on this course, much the same will eventually be said of him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="71211-0020.htm_para32"><a name="0712122000122">I remind Ministers that three quarters of the British people want a referendum. Most of the national press want a referendum. The trade unions want a referendum: indeed, they voted for it by a margin of nine to one at the TUC conference. Many Labour MPs privately concede that there should be a referendum, and some of them have had the moral courage to voice their concerns in the Chamber today. Included on that roll of honour are the hon.

 I am delighted to have the opportunity to respond to this evening&#146;s debate. Before I do so, I wish to update the House on the matter that has concerned us all this evening&#151;the terrorist attacks in Algeria. It is important to inform the House that al-Qaeda North Africa is claiming responsibility, according to a number of press agencies. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office website has been updated to take account of today&#146;s tragic, grotesque and brutal murders. I encourage all those who are considering travelling to Algeria, for whatever purpose, to take account of the information on that website. The whole House will rightly appreciate that the Foreign Secretary has written to the Secretary-General of the United Nations regarding this dreadful loss of life, which potentially includes some UN staff.</p>

Friend the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty), who is no longer in his place&#151;uncharacteristically, because he takes his role as Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee very seriously. We also heard a contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart), who has taken a great deal of care and interest in these issues for longer than she and I would care to remember.</p>

 My hon. Friend was not just threatened; she actually lost her job. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby joked, in a humorous speech, about potentially or actually losing his job as a shadow Minister for the cones hotline. Europe is blamed for many travesties, but those are two new heinous crimes. Never have so many cones died for a false purpose and never have so many charter mark ambitions been unfulfilled, as we have heard this evening.</p>

and possibly one of the most thoughtful, particularly on the issue of Russia. A number of interventions were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson)&#151;my very good friend&#151;despite his current physical condition. On behalf of everyone in the Government, may I say that I hope that it is nothing trivial? He informs me that he fell, but an investigation is taking place into whether he was pushed.</p>

Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) was passionate, but he was, on occasion, unnecessarily and gratuitously personally offensive. That is a choice for him, because he must design his own debating style.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="71211-0021.htm_para2"><a name="0712122000137">The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) was fair in his point about the need to find additional ways to scrutinise European legislation. As I have said before, I had the fantastic opportunity to serve on European Standing Committees A, B and C for 18 months, and there has to be a more effective way to scrutinise. It is not for the Government to design the process, but based on my experience of scrutinising European legislation, I think that there must be a better way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="71211-0021.htm_para3"><a name="0712122000138">We also heard from the hon. Members for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski), for Harwich (Mr. Carswell) and for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands), who spoke about a European neighbourhood policy. The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham spoke about his views on Zimbabwe, which are held dearly, although occupants of all three Front Benches disagree strongly with his view on engagement with that country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="71211-0021.htm_para4"><a name="0712122000139">My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda spoke with great clarity about the dynamic in Russian politics today, the fact that the democratic space there has shrunk and the opportunities for civic society and the freedom of the media have been curtailed in a way that many of us would have thought unimaginable a few years ago. We all celebrated the remarkable changes in Russia with the collapse of communism, but the trends that my hon. Friend mentioned are worrying, especially when one considers how important Russia is on issues of energy, international terrorism and non-proliferation. It is significant that we should do as much as we can in our relationship with Russia through the European Union, because 27 voices&#151;albeit with different accents and at times in different languages&#151;can be much more effective than one lone voice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="71211-0021.htm_para5"><a name="0712122000142">Kosovo was mentioned by several right hon. and hon. Members. In the past, the international community has had good intentions on Kosovo, but that will not be enough in the next few weeks and months. When we reflect on what happened in the 1990s, we must say, &#147;Never again.&#148; In the autumn of 1993, the European Council was debating how to send aid to Bosnia, and how to distribute it for the brutal Balkan winter. By the time Europe had agreed to a package of measures, the snow had melted in Sarajevo and spring had arrived. That should never be repeated in international diplomacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="71211-0021.htm_para6"><a name="0712122000143">Several other important issues are debated at European Councils and we need to work on them multilaterally and bilaterally with our European colleagues.

 While my hon. Friend is on the subject of political and intellectual incoherence, may I ask him about the Liberals and their position?

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="71211-0021.htm_para11"><a name="0712122000150">On the high representative, the point that I wish to make is that the modest changes to current procedures are a sensible improvement. A Conservative Back Bencher&#151;I think that it was one of the Better Off Out gang&#151;suggested that we would no longer be able to speak at the United Nations; our seat would be under threat. That ignores all recent history. As the Foreign Secretary said, during the German presidency of the EU, we spoke on eight separate occasions on which the EU representative also spoke. We also spoke at the UN during the Portuguese presidency. Javier Solana spoke at the UN on five separate occasions since 2002, and the UK spoke on each and every one of those occasions. It is important that there be a European Union effort, and that we exert our energy and influence on the international stage. Being able to speak at the United Nations is an important part of that, whether it be on Kosovo, Zimbabwe, Burma, the millennium development goals or other matters. The Conservative Opposition often seem to will the end&#151;a more vocal, effective European policy on foreign issues&#151;but strongly oppose the means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="71211-0021.htm_para12"><a name="0712122000151">On the points raised about the abandonment of the previous constitution, the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) rightly predicted that I would again announce this evening that the constitutional approach has been abandoned&#151;indeed, he might have written this part of my speech. All 27 member states have agreed that the constitutional approach has been abandoned, as have many others. The ODS party, in government in the Czech Republic&#151;the lone voice that the Conservative party claim as an ally in the European Union&#151;has said that there is no constitution anymore. That is the Conservatives&#146; one voice of friendship in the European Union. The French Secretary of State has said so. The Conservative President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pttering, has said so. The Danish Prime Minister, Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso, Lord Brittan, the Dutch Prime Minister, the Dutch Council of State, eminent professors of European law, the Italian Interior Minister, the Portuguese Prime Minister, the chairman of BP and many others have added their voice to the clear statement by all 27 Governments that the constitutional approach has been abandoned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="71211-0021.htm_para13"><a name="0712122000152">On the specific deal that the UK has, all countries have moved away from the previous constitution, but the UK has moved further away than any other member state. Again, that view is supported by Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso, who has said:</p>
<a name="71211-0021.htm_brev2"><a name="0712122000504"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is clearly different, the arrangement for Britain, than the arrangement for all the other countries.&#148;</p>

 Madam Deputy Speaker, I should like to begin by thanking Mr. Speaker and you for granting me this debate. Since I was first elected in 1997, I have attempted to bring to the Government&#146;s attention the problems and costs of delivering public services in a thinly populated rural county. Shropshire is one of the largest inland counties, but with 289,000 inhabitants it is one of the least populated areas of the United Kingdom. It has some of Britain&#146;s most stunning scenery, but the long distances between its small towns and villages make the delivery of public services costly and difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="71211-0022.htm_para10"><a name="0712125000004">Despite the geographical challenges, Shropshire county council is to be congratulated on being one of the best performing counties in England; it is judged to be a four-star council. It is one of only two children&#146;s services authorities to have consistently received top grades against all headings under Ofsted&#146;s annual performance assessment process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="71211-0022.htm_para11"><a name="0712125000005">Shropshire has 141 primary schools, 22 secondary schools and two special schools. In 2007, Shropshire performed ahead of the national average on all 11 indicators for seven-year-olds. The pattern of results in Shropshire has largely mirrored or exceeded national changes. This year, we again secured top grades against the five every child matters outcomes. Shropshire&#146;s performance has remained ahead of the national average for 11-year-olds in English, mathematics and science. Its performance has also remained ahead of the national average on eight of the nine available indicators for 14-year-olds and has moved further ahead in the key level 5-plus indicator in English and mathematics. For 16-year-olds, the indications are that the results for GCSE or equivalent are likely to be the best ever recorded in the county. All results of the seven available indicators have improved over the 2006 county figures, and they have moved further ahead of the equivalent national figures in six of the seven indicators. Shropshire is ranked either first or second on all the main indicators. Attendance in Shropshire continues to be over the national average, and Shropshire&#146;s permanent exclusion rates remain low in comparison with other authorities in the west midlands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="71211-0022.htm_para12"><a name="0712125000006">That splendid track record is all the more remarkable when one considers that Shropshire is the second lowest funded of all 34 England upper-tier authorities. Shropshire&#146;s guaranteed unit of funding per pupil for 2007-08 is &#163;3,551. Based on 39,218 pupils as at January 2007, that delivers &#163;139.3 million in dedicated schools grant to Shropshire. All-England average funding is &#163;3,888 per pupil, leaving Shropshire with &#163;337 less per pupil. If Shropshire received the funding of an average local authority, there would be &#163;13.23 million more to spend on Shropshire&#146;s children.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. Coleham primary school in Shrewsbury receives, on average, &#163;711 less per pupil than the national average. That equates to a deficit of &#163;300,000 for just one school.  <br>

The headmistress has asked to meet the Minister to discuss how on earth she will cope with that massive deficit.</p>

<p><a name="st_o459"><a name="0712125000008"><a name="71211-0022.htm_spnew5"><a name="0712125000069"><b>Mr. Paterson:</b>
 I am most grateful to my hon. Friend and neighbour for that support, but I am afraid to have to tell him that the position is going to get worse, because in 2010-11 the gap increases to &#163;385, leaving Shropshire&#146;s children &#163;15.1 million behind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="71211-0022.htm_para13"><a name="0712125000009">Let me address this particularly to the Minister: I am not calling for a single penny more in taxation to be levied for education. Shropshire&#146;s hard-working taxpayers are already taxed quite enough. My criticism is of the formula that distributes so much less taxpayers&#146; money back to Shropshire per pupil from Whitehall. The City of London receives &#163;7,089 per pupil and Tower Hamlets receives &#163;6,028, as against Shropshire&#146;s &#163;3,551. Perhaps a direct comparison would be with Ealing, which, with an almost identical number of pupils&#151;39,250&#151;receives &#163;4,634 per pupil but in a much less sparse area. If Shropshire&#146;s children received Ealing&#146;s funding per pupil, they would have an incredible &#163;42,486,428 extra. I repeat that I do not want a penny extra to be raised in tax, but I would like the Minister to explain how these extraordinary disparities come about. Does he believe that it is fair that a child in the City of London should receive back from general taxation twice what a child in Shropshire receives?</p>

<p><a name="st_o460"><a name="0712125000010"><a name="71211-0022.htm_spnew6"><a name="0712125000070"><b>Mr. Philip Dunne (Ludlow) (Con):</b>
 Following on from my hon. Friend&#146;s excellent point, the comprehensive spending review has just locked in funding per pupil for the next three years. In Shropshire and other rural authorities in the neighbouring area, we are now locked into well below average settlements because the Government have decided to abandon the previous formula, which was at least transparent and based on deprivation indices and others. That has been swept aside, and for the period of the CSR they are looking solely at increases based on percentages. That means that authorities at the bottom of the league table, such as Shropshire, which is sixth from bottom&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> ]</i><i> &#151;</i>and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) says, Lincolnshire, will now be locked into that disparity, which will widen over the next few years.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a very good point, and I am most grateful to him for coming with me to see the county council. I think that we have been there three times in the past three weeks. But again, the position is worse than he said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="71211-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0712125000012">Shropshire&#146;s excellent education system is facing a major crisis that is wholly avoidable. Shropshire county council is predicting significant demographic change. There is a rising population with a relatively higher concentration of older people, and there is currently a decrease in the number of children under five, and in primary education. According to the county council&#146;s figures, there will be 3,400 fewer pupils on the roll from 2001 to 2012. There are currently 2,500 unfilled primary school places, which will rise to 5,450 by 2012. That is predicted to lead to a cumulative shortfall of &#163;3.8 million by 2010-11.</p>

(Mr. Dunne) and I have discussed that, and my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) saw the council only last Thursday. I have great sympathy for the position of the council, which faces the dilemma of receiving less from central taxation than the vast majority of other authorities, while trying to deliver high-quality education in the face of current falling rolls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="71211-0022.htm_para16"><a name="0712125000014">However, the fall in primary school numbers is hard to understand in the light of the extensive new building that has occurred in Shropshire recently, and the dramatic increases planned for future years. It is also worth noting that live births in Shropshire bottomed out in 2001, at 2,628, rising to 2,767 in 2005. Another factor that should be borne in mind is that women are choosing to have children later, so nationally, fertility rates for women aged 30 to 34 rose from 78.2 births per 1,000 women in 1986 to 104.6 per 1,000 in 2006. Current research suggests that the trend towards later maternity is strongest among women with better educational qualifications, with some postponing child rearing to pursue their careers. That could well be the case in Shropshire, where there has been an unprecedented increase in mid-range housing with an average age of occupants that conforms more with higher birth trends, which may, therefore, fuel an unexpected surge in the school-age population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="71211-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0712125000015">Another factor that is almost impossible for the council to estimate is the increase in population owing due to the Government&#146;s abject loss of control of immigration. The most graphic example of that was the Government&#146;s prediction, when Poland acceded to the EU, of 13,000 Polish immigrants working in this country, whereas the actual figure was well over 600,000. Ironically, 13,000 babies have been born to Polish women in this country since EU accession. Population estimates assume inward migration contributing nearly 6 million to the projected rise of 7.2 million in the UK&#146;s population between 2004 and 2031&#151;equivalent to six cities the size of Birmingham over the 27-year period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="71211-0022.htm_para18"><a name="0712125000016">Poles have always been welcome in my constituency thanks to a significant Polish community in Penley, just over the Welsh border, who stayed on after the second world war because, tragically, it was too dangerous for them to return to socialist Poland. Vans with names dominated by consonants are common in the area. Following Poland&#146;s accession to the EU, a significant population of Polish people has built up in nearby Wrexham and Crewe. Road signs near Whitchurch written in Polish attracted national attention earlier this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="71211-0022.htm_para19"><a name="0712125000017">Advantage West Midlands commissioned the university of Warwick to write a paper on the economic impact of migrant workers in the west midlands, which reported in November 2007. It said:</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) on securing this debate. I welcome this early opportunity to bring the issue of school funding to the House following the recent announcement of the revenue and capital settlements for the next three years. I would first like to congratulate the teachers and pupils in the hon. Member&#146;s constituency, and in the whole of Shropshire, on their continuing hard work and achievements. He referred to some of those achievements in his speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="71211-0023.htm_para5"><a name="0712125000035">This year, 82 per cent. of Shropshire pupils aged 14 reached the required standard in English, and 79 per cent. did so in mathematics. That is 2 percentage points above the national average in each subject. Meanwhile, the number of 15-year-olds in Shropshire achieving five higher GCSE passes or the equivalent continues to be well above the national average. In all subjects, including English and maths, young people in Shropshire achieved 5 percentage points above the national average at GCSE last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="71211-0023.htm_para6"><a name="0712125000036">Let me turn now to school funding. It is important to remember that all local authorities have seen substantial increases in funding under this Government, and that is the context in which we should consider this evening&#146;s debate. Total revenue funding per pupil for education in Shropshire went up by &#163;1,120 in real terms between 1997 and 2005. That is an increase in real terms of 38 per cent. From 2006, we introduced the dedicated schools grant and a two-year school funding settlement. This gave Shropshire increases in core funding for schools of 6.6 per cent. per pupil last year, compared with their spending the year before, and a further 6.4 per cent. per pupil this year. What has the increased investment bought? Since 1999, Shropshire schools have been able to employ 160 more teachers and 820 more support staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="71211-0023.htm_para7"><a name="0712125000037">Spending on school buildings has also increased dramatically. Ten years ago, the allocation for Shropshire was &#163;5.1 million. For the years 2005-06 to 2007-08, we have allocated &#163;37.4 million of capital to Shropshire council and its schools. This includes more than &#163;7 million of targeted capital funding, following the council&#146;s successful bids for support for two major capital projects.</p>

The settlement allows for continued real-terms growth in school funding over the next three years, although at a more modest rate than in recent years. Across the country, total school revenue funding will rise from &#163;36.5 billion this year to &#163;41.9 billion in 2010&#151;an average year-on-year increase of 2 per cent. in real terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="71211-0023.htm_para9"><a name="0712125000041">This settlement allows us to target money on our priorities. Those include making available by 2010 &#163;912 million to support the extension of a personalised offer to all pupils, including those with special educational needs, and &#163;315 million to help to improve the rate at which children progress, ensuring that all children can meet their potential, and that those who are behind expectations, or are falling behind, get back on track. We will also make available &#163;340 million by 2010 to support the extension of the entitlement to free nursery education for three and four-year-olds from twelve and a half to 15 hours, and &#163;490 million by 2010-11 to support the development of extended services in our schools.</p>

So by 2010, Shropshire&#146;s guaranteed funding per pupil through the dedicated school grant will be &#163;4,013, up &#163;462 per pupil on this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="71211-0023.htm_para12"><a name="0712125000044">First, though, I should like to explain the reasons behind the differences in funding in different areas of the country. We need to ensure that we have an appropriate balance between basic funding and funding that recognises the different needs of each area. As the hon. Member for North Shropshire noted, some parts of the country&#151;especially London and the other conurbations, such as Birmingham, that have inner-city areas&#151;receive additional funding. That is because it costs schools more to recruit and retain teachers and other members of staff in those areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="71211-0023.htm_para13"><a name="0712125000045">Other areas, including Shropshire, receive additional funding because, as the hon. Member for North Shropshire mentioned, they are sparsely populated and have many small rural primary schools that are more expensive to run. However, the main reason for differences in the level of funding that we provide to different local authorities is the emphasis that we place on targeting funding on disadvantaged pupils. Such pupils are likely to need extra support if they are to have an equal chance to succeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="71211-0023.htm_para14"><a name="0712125000046">There have been improvements in attainment at all levels of education in recent years. Schools in the most disadvantaged areas have improved most of all, but  <br>

there is still a major gap between the outcomes for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and for other pupils. In 2007, 36 per cent. of young people receiving free school meals achieved five good GCSE passes, compared with 63 per cent. of their peers. Closing that gap is critical to our aim of promoting a fair, prosperous and inclusive society, so we believe that it is right and just to invest our resources where they will make the most difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="71211-0023.htm_para15"><a name="0712125000047">Shropshire has significantly fewer pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds than many other areas, and that is reflected in the level of school funding that the authority receives. Next year, 7.3 per cent. of Shropshire&#146;s funding through the dedicated schools grant will be for disadvantaged pupils, compared with 12.1 per cent. nationally. For the first time, however, money for pockets of deprivation is being included in this funding. An extra &#163;300,000 pounds is included for Shropshire next year, targeted on schools that have high numbers of pupils from deprived neighbourhoods compared with the rest of the county. I am sure that the hon. Member for North Shropshire will talk to his colleagues on the county council to make certain that that funding gets through to the pupils in those deprived areas.</p>

good quality education in the most cost-effective way. However, surplus places can represent poor use of resources, which can often be used more effectively to support schools in raising standards. With current surpluses in Shropshire as a whole, it must be right that the authority has considered a reduction in surplus places as part of its planning strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="71211-0023.htm_para20"><a name="0712125000054">I know that local schools are important in rural communities, and we accept that in order to let young children attend a school closer to home, there may have to be more empty places in schools in rural areas than in those in urban areas. Our guidance to decision makers makes it clear that that must be taken into account, and that the presumption against closing rural schools continues. However, even in a rural authority there may be a case for redeploying resources that are tied up in surplus places, to provide a richer educational experience for all young people in a more efficient system. Let me deal with our plans for capital funding. We are investing &#163;21.9 billion in schools nationally over the next three years. That is a sevenfold increase since 1996. For 2008-10, we have allocated &#163;57.3 million for capital investment to Shropshire and its schools to improve their buildings and facilities. That includes &#163;3 million through the new primary capital programme in 2009 and a further &#163;5.4 million in 2010. We aim to renew at least half of all primary school buildings in the country under the programme in the next 14 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="71211-0023.htm_para21"><a name="0712125000055">The hon. Gentleman asked about the building schools for the future programme, which aims to renew all  <br>

secondary schools in England in 15 waves of investment, which started in 2005-06. The hon. Gentleman may wish to discuss with his hon. Friends plans to dig into and cut from the plans for the future in the case of Shropshire. Because of the late prioritisation, Shropshire is getting money up front. It has been allocated &#163;20.5 million now to renew its neediest school, the William Brooke school in Much Wenlock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="71211-0023.htm_para22"><a name="0712125000056">In the meantime, the authority and its schools continue to receive substantial amounts of capital each year to address their priority needs. Allocations of funding to the authority reflect the fact that it has not benefited from modernising schools through building schools for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="71211-0023.htm_para23"><a name="0712125000057">Our plans for revenue and capital investment in schools provide for continued growth over the next three years, building on the substantial increases of the last decade. I know that the hon. Gentleman shares my ambition for continually improving outcomes for all our pupils for the taxpayer&#146;s considerable investment. I am sure that he will want to raise some of the points with which I have had not time to deal in his meeting with my hon. Friend the Minister for Schools and Learners in the near future.</p>
