It is therefore important that we ensure that the investment in new technologies is continued; there are, for example, integrated gasification combined cycle and carbon capture and storage projects. The Government are going to help with a demonstration plant, but we need more such plants if we are to ensure that such technology will be available to tackle climate change.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Alongside the difficult closures that are taking place, the Post Office is developing valuable outreach services. I had the pleasure of seeing them in his constituency last week, in the village of Twynholm, for example, where a member of staff from the neighbouring post office visits several days a week for several hours. The hours are well known to local people and the service has been up and running for two years. From talking to members of staff and the customers who use the service, I found that it was extremely popular.

 I declare an interest as a member of a multi-generation sub-post office family in the village where I live. Has the Minister had a chance to read the National Consumer Council report, &#147;Post office closures 2002 to 2006&#148;, which was critical of the closures in that period? The post office closures that were announced then did not produce a strategic reshaping of the network; rather, they hit the poorest and most vulnerable members of society. The NCC does not believe that the 95 per cent. requirement for people in rural areas to be within three miles of a post office will be adequate to prevent the chances of that from happening again. Would the Minister care to comment on that?</p>

 I have indeed read the report to which my hon. Friend refers. He is right that there are lessons to be learned from post office closures. The access criteria are important to ensure national coverage even after the change, which is why we are compensating the hard-working sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses for their efforts. The process does the right thing by them, but also ensures that closures do not happen in an ad hoc way, on a first come, first serve basis that leaves holes in the network without trying to ensure national coverage.</p>

 Does the Minister not recognise that, once closed, a post office is lost for ever to the community? Those vital services, which are so valued by the community, require the community&#146;s input, to ensure that no unnecessary closures are made and that decisions are not made that do the same damage as the urban reinvention programme did to the post office network in urban areas. Will he therefore extend the consultation period, once the Post Office has made its proposals, so that it can be meaningful for local communities and so that any mistakes made by the Post Office can be corrected?</p>

 As the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs has made clear, there is an obvious case for pressing ahead with these changes. The post office network must find a long-term and sustainable basis for going forward and it has to reflect changing customer preferences, which are visible to all of us in our constituencies. It is inconceivable that any sensible Government could follow the advice of the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) and find up to another &#163;1 billion to subsidise the post office network, which I understand is now his policy.

FSB surveys conducted between 2000 and 2006 show quite a large reduction in the proportion of FSB members dissatisfied with the volume of legislation, and other evidence shows a fall in the number of businesses citing regulations as an obstacle to success. Nevertheless, there is no room for complacency. We need to go further. That is why we are committed to reducing the burden of regulation on businesses by 25 per cent. by 2010, and why the second round of departmental simplification plans will be published in December.</p>

 The Government have looked carefully at the implications for both men and women when developing our pensions reform proposals. An extensive gender impact assessment was published late last year alongside the Pensions Bill, now the Pensions Act 2007, which mainly focused on state pension reforms.

 It is a scandal that, despite the fact that women are caring for children and elderly relatives as well as going out to work, there is a 20 per cent. gap between their income in retirement and that of men.

 It is important that women who have not qualified for basic state pension contributions, either because they took time out of the world of work to care for their families or because they have been in low paid work below the national insurance threshold, know that if they have the money they can make up up to six years with additional voluntary contributions. We are concerned about the low take-up of that provision, and we intend to take further action on it. That provision is an attempt to remedy a past unfairness. What is important is that we have put in place structures that ensure that the unfairness that marked the old system is not in the current system. We need to make sure that people are rewarded for going out to work, but also that they are rewarded for staying at home and caring for their families.</p>

Will the Leader of the House go back to the Prime Minister and Ministers and make it clear that it is not acceptable that statements are made in the recess, willy-nilly, whatever the subject, when they could wait to be made in Parliament.

 Hospital-acquired infections, the subject of the report published this morning, have been an absolute tragedy and a scandal. Lessons must be learnt, not only in the three hospitals involved but more widely in the NHS. That is why yesterday the Secretary of State for Health said that he was announcing more investment in provision for isolation, so that when the disease is identified, the relevant patients can be isolated. He also said that there should be an annual deep clean in every hospital, improved cleaning throughout the year and extra screening.

May we please have a debate on that?</p>

 I have friends and relatives who work for Royal Mail as postal workers and on the management side. I am therefore under no illusions about the complexity of the issues involved or the difficulty of the negotiations.

<a name="ordayhd_1"><a name="71011-0006.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="07101129001270"><h5 align="left">12.22 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o176"><a name="07101129000284"><a name="71011-0006.htm_spmin0"><a name="07101129001477"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Alistair Darling):</b>
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on Northern Rock plc. Before I start, however, I draw the House&#146;s attention to the fact that I have informed both the Register of Members&#146; Interests and the Treasury&#146;s permanent secretary that, like many others, my wife and I have a mortgage with Northern Rock, but no savings or deposits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para2"><a name="07101129000285">As I said in my written statement on Monday, Northern Rock got into difficulty following the problems triggered in the US mortgage market, which have gone on to affect the financial markets in countries all around the world. In early August, when the markets realised the extent of the problems in the US sub-prime market, they also began to have doubts about the value of other asset-backed securities. Uncertainty over which institutions were exposed and to what extent meant that institutions lent to each other at much higher rates, and in some cases stopped lending to each other altogether. The result was a large reduction of money in the market generally and an increase in the cost of borrowing, not just for those with exposure to the sub-prime market, but for all institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para3"><a name="07101129000286">Those developments have had a global impact, affecting major US mortgage lenders, a major French bank and banks in Germany. The availability of credit has increased the past few weeks, so we can be more confident, but we cannot be certain when the current instability will end. Britain entered the global turbulence with a stable economy and a strong banking sector, which has experienced rapid growth, with well capitalised balance sheets. British institutions have less direct exposure to sub-prime assets and our sub-prime market share&#151;5 per cent.&#151;is much lower than that of the US. However, because of its business model, Northern Rock faced a particular problem. It has a large share of Britain&#146;s mortgages, but they are primarily financed through the wholesale markets, including a significant proportion from securitisation. That meant that Northern Rock was particularly vulnerable to the virtual closing of that market over the summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para4"><a name="07101129000287">On 14 August, the Financial Services Authority told the Bank of England and the Treasury about its concerns about Northern Rock and its vulnerability in the current market circumstances. During August it became increasingly clear that Northern Rock was having difficulty getting access to the financing that it needed and that the cost of doing so was increasing. The general situation and Northern Rock&#146;s position in particular were monitored on a daily basis. On 5 September, the Bank announced &#163;4 billion of extra support to provide increased liquidity to the wider market. As Northern Rock&#146;s position deteriorated, it became clear that specific support was likely to be needed for it. On 13 September the Governor and the chairman of the FSA recommended that I authorise the Bank to provide special liquidity support. I agreed because I believed that that was justified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para5"><a name="07101129000288">There are clear principles governing such support, which are set out in the memorandum of understanding between the Treasury, the Bank and the FSA that was  <br>

first signed in 1997. Such support should be undertaken only when there is a genuine threat to the stability of the financial system and in order to avoid a serious disturbance in the wider economy. That was the case here. The provision of support was announced on 14 September. Although the FSA had assured the public that Northern Rock was solvent and that if depositors wanted to get their money out, they could do so, it became clear that further assurance was needed. Therefore, on 17 September, again on the advice and with the agreement of the FSA and the Bank of England, I announced that during the current instability in the financial markets, and should it prove necessary, I would put in place arrangements that would guarantee all the existing deposits in Northern Rock. That undertaking was extended on 20 and 21 September.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07101129000289">The Treasury, the Bank and the FSA continue to work intensively with Northern Rock with a view to helping it to resolve the situation. Any future solution must lie with the company, but the Government have provided appropriate help and will continue to do so. As I reported to the House on Tuesday, I have extended the Government&#146;s guarantee arrangements to all new retail deposits for which Northern Rock will pay a fee, while the Bank has provided an additional loan facility, which has replaced that of lender of last resort. I have today written to the Chairman of the Select Committee on Treasury and the Select Committee on Public Accounts setting out more details. I am also publishing that letter and placing a copy in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07101129000290">There are clearly lessons to be learned from what happened to Northern Rock and the wider instability across the world. The responsibility to minimise risks and prevent problems from happening in a particular bank lies first and foremost with the directors acting on behalf of its shareholders. That is their clear duty. It is the job of the financial authorities to set the policy and the regulatory framework in which institutions and markets work. Let me remind the House of those responsibilities. As the House knows, the Bank of England has complete independence in monetary policy. Its second core purpose is financial stability, a role that it discharges on a daily basis. The FSA, also independent, is responsible for the supervision of individual firms such as Northern Rock. Because of the importance of the financial system for the stability of the economy as a whole and because of the potential impact on the Exchequer in ensuring stability, the Government are rightly also involved. The Treasury is responsible for the overall legislative framework and I am accountable to Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07101129000291">It is right that the Bank and FSA should continue with those responsibilities. The model is one that others around the world are now following, but we need to review how the framework has operated and put in place whatever practical improvements are needed. As the FSA has said, it is reviewing its own lessons for itself. I look forward to its conclusions early next year. We need to make more reforms to prevent problems from happening internationally and in Britain. First, when the financial stability forum reports to Finance Ministers at the G7 in Washington next week, I will urge faster rapid implementation of international agreements on solvency, accelerated work on international standards for regulating liquidity, more transparent  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="11 Oct 2007">

information on credit ratings and action to improve the transparency of off-balance sheet vehicles. Secondly, I will propose an International Monetary Fund and Financial Stability Forum early warning system to strengthen financial sector surveillance and to identify risks to stability and co-ordinated regulatory responses to them. Thirdly, I can report a European agreement this week to strengthen arrangements for ensuring financial stability in Europe and increase cross-border management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para9"><a name="07101129000292">It is important that regulators focus on liquidity as well solvency. Here at home, the FSA will shortly set out proposals for a review of the UK liquidity regime. As the Governor has said, all central banks face problems in providing support to banks in difficulty in a world where markets rightly expect high levels of disclosure and transparency. I can therefore confirm that if it proves necessary to clarify in Europe the legal and practical issues surrounding the way in which such support is provided and disclosed to protect financial stability, we will work with other European countries to provide that certainty. We will now review whether rules about swift takeovers of banks need to be changed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para10"><a name="07101129000293">When problems occur, however, we need to have a system in place that is clear and which reassures depositors. We will introduce legislation in the next Session to establish a new regime. With the FSA and the Bank, I am proposing the principles for the new regime in a discussion document published today. The new regime would mean that depositors would be insulated from a bank that had failed and would provide them with both greater compensation and certainty that their compensation could be paid out quickly. As a first stage, the FSA has decided that the financial services compensation scheme covers 100 per cent. of deposits up to &#163;35,000, but I have made it clear that that is just an initial step towards a more comprehensive change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para11"><a name="07101129000295">We will continue to work closely with the banking industry, consumer groups and others to agree the new regime, and I hope that there will be cross-party consensus on it. We must all, internationally and domestically, consider what lessons there are to be learned from the summer&#146;s events, and if needed I will take action. The changes that we will make will strengthen our reputation as the world&#146;s leading international financial centre, and will be founded on our commitment to maintain a strong and stable economy. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

 Let us be clear why the Chancellor is making this statement today. This country has seen its first run on a bank for 140 years, and while as he has pointed out the credit problems have been global, it is only in Britain that we have seen people queuing to withdraw their savings. That is because the system set up by the Prime Minister to prevent precisely such a crisis has failed its first serious test.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para13"><a name="07101129000298">Why did the Chancellor choose to give an interview to the press on 12 September&#151;the day before it emerged that Northern Rock was seeking emergency help&#151;in which he attacked the banks and said that they should be more honest? Did he know that, within 48 hours, he would be trying to reassure the public about the honesty of the banking system? Was he not undermined by his own spin?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para14"><a name="07101129000299">Will the Chancellor release the letters that he received from the Bank and the FSA? The Bank Governor has told the Select Committee that he is happy for them to be released, and I am surprised that they have not been released today. When the Chancellor was forced to offer the general guarantee to existing Northern Rock savers, he said that it would be &#147;unfair to other banks&#148; to extend it to new savers. Why has he changed his mind this week and done just that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para15"><a name="07101129000300">The second accusation facing the Chancellor is that, when the crunch came, no one knew who was in charge. The Bank Governor confirmed this in an answer to the Select Committee, which I praise for the work that it has done on this matter. When the Bank Governor was asked who was in charge, he answered:</p>
<a name="71011-0006.htm_brev1"><a name="07101129001236"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;What do you mean by &#145;in charge&#146;? Would you like to define that?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para17"><a name="07101129000302">For example, the FSA says that it saw its job as simply reporting Northern Rock&#146;s liquidity problems to the Bank. However, the Bank says that it sees its job as looking at the liquidity of the whole financial system rather than that of individual institutions. Frankly, it is a bit late for the Chancellor to stand at the Dispatch Box and say that we need to review the liquidity regime. Who is in charge? The answer is that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was supposed to be in charge, but he was not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para18"><a name="07101129000303">The third and final accusation against the Chancellor is that he does not yet seem prepared to take strong and decisive action to prevent such a disaster happening again. He says that he wants cross-party consensus. I wrote to him on 20 September offering the full co-operation of the Opposition in making the legislative changes necessary to protect depositors and to allow the Bank to do its job. He has not bothered to reply to me, but I can tell him that we will work with the Treasury on this to create an oversight system that works.</p>

monitoring liquidity and to ensure that regulation does not prevent us from dealing with a liquidity crisis when it arises. We need to be clear whether the regulation is European or has been gold-plated by the British Government. We need to reinforce the independence of the Bank so that there can never again be any suspicion of political pressure. We also need to insist that any new system, while protecting savers, does not stifle financial innovation or protect investors when that innovation goes wrong.</p>

It was not mentioned in his statement or in the consultation document, yet he chose to mention it to a newspaper. We also need to take steps now to tackle the growing personal and public debt that leaves Britain&#146;s economy more exposed than others to financial turbulence, and we need to be clear about who is ultimately in charge.</p>

The Government&#146;s boasts about stability and financial competence will now ring hollow. We will work with the Government on the changes that are needed, but the first thing that the Chancellor needs to do is to take responsibility for this mess. It is about time he provided the leadership and the decisive action that his high office demands.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for what I take it was meant to be helpful advice, at least in respect of some of his comments. Let me deal with the points that he has raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para22"><a name="07101129000308">As I told the House in my statement, it first became apparent to the FSA and the Bank in the middle of August that Northern Rock had difficulties. Between then and Northern Rock formally asking the Bank for facilities, a great deal of effort was made to try to help Northern Rock to resolve the position. The position was monitored on a daily basis, and Northern Rock was in close contact with the FSA, the Bank and the Treasury. During that period, a number of alternative courses of action were looked at, but unfortunately they did not work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="71011-0006.htm_para23"><a name="07101129000309">The problem that Northern Rock faced was that, because it had to get new financing facilities on a pretty regular basis and because the market could spot that fairly quickly, it became apparent that it was in difficulties. It could not therefore get access to funds, and the price that it was being charged was going up. I can tell the hon. Gentleman, however, that we did everything that we could to try to resolve the situation without special support becoming necessary. Eventually, however, it became obvious that unless special facilities were made available, the bank would be in very great difficulty indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="71011-0007.htm_para0"><a name="07101129000310">That brings me to the second point that the hon. Gentleman raised, on help for banks. The Governor did not say that the Bank was unable to help Northern Rock because of current legislation. What he was talking about was whether that help could be given in a covert way as opposed to being completely open about it. I am bound to say to the House that this is a real problem. In this country&#151;and perhaps right across the world&#151;we have been moving towards more  <br>

transparency and openness, which is generally a pretty good thing. The difficulty was that, because Northern Rock&#146;s trading position had deteriorated so rapidly, it was advised by its own legal advisers&#151;for perfectly understandable reasons&#151;that it would have to issue a profits warning. It was also coming to the view that, because of its listing requirements, the fact that it was about to get facilities from the Bank of England would probably have to be disclosed. The Governor was also saying that the current legislation might require that disclosure. In addition, he made the point that, if it had been possible to arrange for another bank to come in, part of the takeover code might make that difficult over a weekend. I am looking at all these things, and if we need to change the legislation, we certainly will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="71011-0007.htm_para1"><a name="07101129000311">When we were discussing these matters prior to the Bank&#146;s support being made available, I was pretty sure that it would get leaked, and I was absolutely right. The House will know that the story was broadcast by the BBC the night before the formal announcement was made, which is what led to the difficulties over the next few days. We need to look at that, because it is in the interests of the financial system not only in this country but across the world that, if central banks need to intervene, they should be able to do so in a way that is sensible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="71011-0007.htm_para2"><a name="07101129000312">The hon. Gentleman raised a number of other points. The Chairman of the Treasury Committee has written to me asking about the letters that I have received from the Governor and the FSA, and I will respond to my right hon. Friend before I appear before the Select Committee later this month. Yes, we have extended the guarantee, because I believe that it is right to help Northern Rock to have a period in which it can explore the options available to it, with a view to resolving these difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="71011-0007.htm_para3"><a name="07101129000313">On arrangements between the Bank, the FSA and the Treasury, ultimately, I am responsible to this House for whatever they do; that is part of being Chancellor. I hesitate to agree, however, if the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that we should move towards a situation in which the Bank or the FSA were merged, which would not be the right thing to do, as the institution would become unmanageable. If the question is whether I think that improvements should be made and that we should look further into the arrangements between the Treasury, the Bank and the FSA, of course that is the case. We do need to learn the lessons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="71011-0007.htm_para4"><a name="07101129000314">Finally, I am consulting on the protection of consumers. Having had some experience with courts in relation to consultation, I put out some general principles because the law appears to be that, if Ministers consult and then go on to close off or close down some of the options, we have to start all over again&#151;and I do not want to get myself into that position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="71011-0007.htm_para5"><a name="07101129000315">In conclusion, there are clearly lessons to be learned from what happened with Northern Rock, but as I have said on many occasions over the past few weeks, we benefit from having a strong economy and a generally strong banking sector, which I believe will enable us to get through these difficulties and maintain our reputation as the world&#146;s leading financial centre.</p>

doing so in a wider context. The point that he raised about covert operations brings into question the concept of the lender of last resort, which is an issue that the Treasury Committee will be looking into. The real issue is how we help to protect depositors. Is the &#163;35,000 figure correct? I would suggest that the key is consumer confidence. If consumers do not have confidence, the figure will be incorrect and it is important that we have the widest consultation on that. Another lesson is that depositors need easy and immediate access to their savings. Given that more than a quarter of global assets are now internationally owned, we need to address these problems in an international context. Will the Chancellor tell us exactly what he intends to do in that particular area?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="71011-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07101129000318">My right hon. Friend is absolutely right that this matter needs to be addressed internationally as well as here at home. I said in my statement that I thought that a number of steps were necessary internationally. We have to ensure that regulators look not just into the solvency of institutions but into any liquidity problems that they might have. That also means ensuring that current rules as they apply internationally as well as domestically allow regulators and institutions to focus on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="71011-0007.htm_para7"><a name="07101129000319">My right hon. Friend is quite right too about the deposit protection scheme. A number of steps are necessary to reassure people. If a bank fails, it should be possible immediately to remove the depositors&#146; money from it and run it separately, and ensure that it can be paid out as quickly as is reasonably possible. I have made it clear that the &#163;35,000 is a first step; that is all that the FSA can do at the moment. I think that we need to go beyond that. That is precisely why I am consulting, because, of course, the scheme is financed by banks and other financial institutions. International action, as well as action to protect depositors, is absolutely essential.</p>

 I thank the Chancellor for making his statement. He could have hidden behind his Tuesday written statement and the pre-Budget report, but he has come before the House now, which is good. I am afraid that that is the only positive thing that I want to say, because this statement reeks of complacency. Frankly, the Government have become complicit in large-scale irresponsible lending by the same management&#151;and it continues even today&#151;in what amounts to little short of a banking scam.</p>

This was a bank that was doubling its mortgage lending in six months and taking 20 per cent. of the market, on the back not of depositors but of large-scale rapid securitisation into markets, which became discriminating and pulled the plug on it.</p>

market directly, but is he aware that, indirectly, it was forced to issue a statement on 14 September acknowledging that &#163;600 million of its assets&#151;30 per cent. of its shareholders&#146; funds&#151;were of questionable provenance? I know that there has been a postal strike, but why was that information not communicated to the Treasury, which seemed to be unaware of it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="71011-0007.htm_para10"><a name="07101129000323">Worse, is the Chancellor aware that the same lending practices are continuing today? A member of my Treasury team, Lord Oakeshott, rang the bank yesterday and made inquiries about its mortgage opportunities. As we would expect, he is someone of good credit standing, but the terms that he was offered were quite extraordinary. He was offered 127 per cent. of the value of the house, including the roll-up of the arrangement fee&#151;five to six times his income&#151;and 30 per cent. of the loan was to be unsecured. I do not know whether that is what the Chancellor meant when he talked about a return to old-fashioned lending practices. In the current economic circumstances and the warnings about house prices from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, most reasonably cautious bankers would say that that borders on the insane. It is happening because the Government are underwriting the bank. That is precisely what the Governor of the Bank of England warned of when he talked about moral hazard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="71011-0007.htm_para11"><a name="07101129000324">Will the Chancellor tell us how much taxpayers&#146; money is exposed to this bank? I believe that there is &#163;11 billion in lending and &#163;23 billion in guarantees, so we are talking about a sum of money in one bank that is roughly equivalent to annual spending on the armed forces. When the Chancellor agreed to the effective nationalisation of the liabilities of this bank, why was the management&#151;including the chief executive, who has been paid &#163;10 million in five years for taking his bank on to the rocks, and the directors, including the ubiquitous Wanless&#151;not sacked? I would include the FSA, which has admitted that in 18 months it did nothing to check the bank.</p>

Does that not encourage irresponsible lending and is it not unfair on other banks that are acting responsibly? Is it not even more unfair on pensions institutions, which, as the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) reminded us yesterday, do not have such a guarantee?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="71011-0007.htm_para13"><a name="07101129000326">My concluding point is that this is not just a passing embarrassment.

 First, the hon. Gentleman suggested that I should have sacked all the directors of the Northern Rock bank, but I do not have the power to go around sacking the directors of any company. The company is owned by its shareholders and the directors are responsible for the running of it. The decisions taken by Northern Rock in respect of its business model and its lending&#151;whether generally or to the noble Lord Oakeshott in particular&#151;are a matter for the bank and not for any Minister. The hon. Gentleman seems to be confused about that. The bank belongs to its shareholders and is run by the directors. If the directors are to be changed, it is a matter for the shareholders.</p>

People who work at Northern Rock in my constituency have made the point to me that the business is viable, and if it is kept together as an entity it will continue to be viable and the jobs of 4,000 people in my constituency and 1,500 people in the constituency of my hon.

affair was handled. In particular, what provoked the Bank of England to announce that Northern Rock was looking for help? The European Central Bank manage to rescue&#151;I think&#151;two German banks and a French bank without a similar panic. I am at least grateful that the Chancellor appreciates the importance of the bank to the north-east economy and to many of my constituents, who, like those of the hon.

 As I said in reply to the shadow Chancellor, the difficulty with the announcement that the Northern Rock bank would get specific help from the Bank of England was that, as I always suspected, somebody told the BBC about it. In the light of that, the information could not have been kept private. That is a problem not just in this country but across the world. We want to be as open and transparent as possible, but there will be circumstances in which support may be necessary for one or a group of institutions, and if someone chooses to go and tell the BBC or another outlet about it, the whole thing becomes public. That is the reason why the decision was ultimately taken to make an announcement. Unfortunately, just a few hours before that announcement was made, a highly damaging story appeared on the BBC that caused huge problems for the Northern Rock bank. That is a problem, and we will have to consider how to resolve such problems in future. I agree with the hon.

I also remind him that 10 years ago, no fewer than seven different regulators operated in the market: the Bank of England; the Securities and Investment Board; the Building Societies Commission; the Register of Friendly Societies; the insurance division of the Department of Trade and Industry; and three self-regulating organisations&#151;the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation, the Securities and Futures Authority and the Personal Investment Authority.

Having the central bank responsible for the stability of financial markets, and one organisation responsible for the supervision of institutions, is the right way to go, and most countries are moving towards that model, not towards the regime that was around many years ago, which would not work in today&#146;s markets.</p>

 I agree with the shadow Chancellor&#146;s analysis: a lack of liquidity was central to the problem.

That decision was reiterated a week before the event, and in full knowledge of the Northern Rock position, in a three-page letter which was made public and sent to the Treasury Select Committee, and was reversed after the Northern Rock fiasco. A good, sound bank was brought down by strange decisions, and I think that the House should know whether the Chancellor has spoken to the Governor and received an adequate explanation.</p>

As I said in reply to the shadow Chancellor, the market quickly became aware that Northern Rock had a problem which meant that it was finding it difficult to obtain funds, and the price of the funds that it did obtain was rising.

 My hon. Friend has made some very good points, especially about credit-rating agencies. I agree that international action is needed to ensure that reforms are implemented. It should also be borne in mind that information from a credit-rating agency is just one piece of advice on which directors draw. Ultimately, the directors of an institution must form their own judgment on whether the lending into which they are entering is sound, or&#151;if they are buying pieces of commercial paper&#151;whether they know what lies behind them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="71011-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07101129000400">I welcome the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) to the Front Bench and to the Dispatch Box again after last night. During consideration of the Bill, he has moved from the Back Benches to the Front Bench and has seen it through every stage, as has the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake). They have lived with the Bill for longer than I have and I look forward to their contributions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="71011-0009.htm_para4"><a name="07101129000401">Lords Amendment No. 1 would amend section 21 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999, to disqualify a person from being the Mayor or an assembly member if they had been Mayor twice before. This would have the effect of restricting the Mayor to two terms of office. The purpose is clear; they cannot beat Ken Livingstone at the ballot box, so they are trying to bar him from standing at all. It should be for Londoners to decide whether they want Ken Livingstone to continue to serve as their London Mayor, not MPs from all parts of the UK and certainly not members of the unelected House in another place. We do not agree with the Tories and the Liberal Democrats on this and we will not accept the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="71011-0009.htm_para5"><a name="07101129000402">The amendment goes right to the heart of the GLA&#146;s constitution and its key principle of a strong executive Mayor whose democratic mandate and political legitimacy is derived from direct elections. The amendment and the change, as put together by an alliance of Tories and Liberals in the other place, challenges one of the underlying constitutional principles of British political life, namely, that there should be no term limits on any elected representatives to any political office. That applies to MPs, councillors and members of the devolved Administrations, all of whom can serve for as long as the electorate lets them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="71011-0009.htm_para6"><a name="07101129000403">I am not alone in arguing this. In Committee, the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) argued forcefully that</p>

They have argued that term limits would provide an important check on an office-holder who yields considerable executive power when in office. They have argued also that it would help the office to be refreshed and reinvigorated regularly, but these arguments do not stand up when subject to scrutiny.</p>

But the electoral arrangements for the office of Mayor of London need to reflect both London&#146;s particular circumstances and the wider political and democratic culture in this country. I strongly believe that the regular elections for Mayor every four years under the GLA Act already provide a strong check on an incumbent Mayor. Furthermore, unlike some American cities, London is not a one-party city where a favoured candidate can be shoed into office and remain Mayor for life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="71011-0009.htm_para9"><a name="07101129000407">First, the electoral arrangements in place for the Mayor under the GLA Act require that a successful candidate have the support of the majority of voters. Secondly, politics in London is and always has been highly competitive. Finally, given the high national profile of the Mayor of London, all major political parties would naturally and normally want to ensure that they have at least a credible candidate standing on their behalf. These factors together ensure that each mayoral election campaign is hard fought and each campaign gives a fresh mandate to the post of mayor, whether or not it goes to the incumbent.</p>

 No, I am simply trying to do justice to some of the arguments that were made in debates during previous stages of the Bill.

of the debates in the other place is that their Lordships were not only concerned about the term limits issue itself&#151;about which there is legitimate widespread debate, particularly in academic circles&#151;but many of them were driven by a sense of frustration at the lack of internal checks and balances in the operation of the Greater London authority. I have sympathy with their Lordships on the symptoms that they identified but, for reasons that I will come on to, I do not think that the cure proposed is appropriate.</p>

I should add that it is ironic that the Government were unable to muster enough of their own supporters to carry the day, and I hope that the Government will address&#151;they have not done so thus far&#151;the underlying sense of frustration that too much power is concentrated in the hands of the Mayor.</p>

We wanted to readdress the checks and balances within the structures of the GLA, to give the assembly more hold over the Mayor, the ability to amend the budget and strategies and greater power to call in mayoral directions. That alternative would, perhaps, have sat more easily with our traditions.</p>

should be a two-tier strategy to address that, by devolving more strategic powers from central Government to London governance&#151;by getting rid of the Government office for London, for example&#151;and by redressing the balance between the Mayor and the assembly to create a more constructive partnership.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. It is important to remember that the boroughs are a third key part of the equation. London governance now rightly consists of a tripartite arrangement between the Mayor, the assembly and the boroughs, and we should be seeking structures that allow those three key elements of London to work constructively together.

There is the introduction of confirmation hearings and the requirement for the Mayor to have regard to the responses that the assembly may make to consultations and strategies that the Mayor proposes. There is the capacity to amend the budget, which we shall discuss before too long.

It is reasonable to say that to a detached observer it may seem only fair that an assembly should be able to exercise its power to amend the Mayor&#146;s final draft consolidated budget by simple majority rather than the two-thirds majority currently required. However, the principle of the two thirds majority goes to the heart of the governance of the GLA&#151;a governance and a model that has served London well since its introduction. I shall explain to the House why that principle is so important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="71011-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07101129000471">The amendment cuts directly across the principle of a strong executive Mayor and an assembly holding him to account for his actions through effective scrutiny. The budget plays a central role in this model. It allows the Mayor to propose a funding package to implement his policies, priorities and proposals. It allows the assembly to amend only if a broad consensus&#151;in other words, two thirds of assembly members&#151;are minded to do so. It is an important check and balance on the Mayor. It ensures that he cannot take the assembly for granted in proposing his annual budget, but it is also a clear signal to the assembly that it must work together to amend the Mayor&#146;s budget proposals formally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="71011-0010.htm_para15"><a name="07101129000472">I was glad to see that that approach was endorsed by Lord Heseltine in his recent taskforce reports published in June. He recommended that city Mayors</p>
<a name="71011-0010.htm_brev3"><a name="07101129001244"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;should be subject to loose scrutiny by the Assembly, who would require a two thirds majority to block executive actions.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="71011-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07101129000473">The GLA budget-making process is based exactly on that principle and approach. The Mayor first presents the assembly with a draft budget, which it may amend by a simple majority, and then a final draft budget, which it can amend by a two-thirds majority. That allows the assembly to exert real influence over the Mayor in terms of his budget priorities&#151;influence which the GLA itself acknowledges has saved more than &#163;125 million by reining in, in their terms, the Mayor&#146;s budget proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="71011-0010.htm_para17"><a name="07101129000474">In contrast, to allow the assembly to amend the final budget by a simply majority would in effect mean the assembly, not the Mayor, would routinely set the GLA budget. It would fundamentally weaken the Mayor&#146;s position, which may indeed be the hidden purpose of the amendment, and it risks a complete disconnect, therefore, between the budget and the Mayor&#146;s priorities. If hon. Members pause and consider such a position, it is clear that that risks deadlock between the assembly and the Mayor. It risks conflict and an impasse which would be bad for the GLA, for London and for Londoners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="71011-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07101129000475">The debate in the other place has been helpful. It has shed important light on how the budget process has been handled in city hall to date, and on two commonly held misconceptions about the role of the assembly in the budget-making process. The first misconception is that assembly members cannot vote in favour of specific amendments because in doing so they would be voting to accept other parts of the Mayor&#146;s final draft budget with which they might disagree. That argument fails to take sufficient account of the provisions of the original Greater London Authority Act 1999. Schedule 6 of the Act makes it clear that the assembly must approve the Mayor&#146;s final draft budget, with or without amendment, with a two-thirds majority needed to make any amendment. The Act could not be clearer about the assembly&#146;s statutory duties in setting the annual budget. Assembly members have no option to &#147;reject&#148; the Mayor&#146;s final draft.</p>

or more of the final draft component budgets&#151;the budgets of the Mayor, the assembly and the four functional bodies. In so doing, it can amend the final draft GLA consolidated budget, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="71011-0010.htm_para20"><a name="07101129000477">Hitherto, the annual GLA budget-setting process has not worked in that way. The assembly has voted instead on broad packages of amendments to the consolidated budget as a whole, proposed by each of the main parties; in effect, the assembly votes to accept or reject an alternative budget rather than seeking to amend the Mayor&#146;s final draft. That approach is perfectly valid, although I think the House appreciates that it is not one that readily lends itself to cross-party agreement. It should come as little surprise, therefore, that the assembly has not, to date, secured a two-thirds majority for change. However, it is open to the assembly to approach its role in that way&#151;differently from how it has approached it in the past&#151;and to make the most of its existing powers by forging coalitions of common interest to amend the budget. Surely that is the right way forward&#151;not making fundamental changes to the successful Greater London Authority model, not blurring the currently clear division between executive and scrutiny functions and not, in effect, allowing the assembly to set the budget, thus risking deadlock between the Mayor and the assembly.</p>

 In our judgment, the other place has clearly and significantly improved the Bill in this case and I hope that we maintain the amendment, because, with every respect to the Minister, he places undue faith in the working of the current model.

That is the type of jiggery-pokery that brings politics into contempt and disrepute.

assembly voted against a budget that was imposed on them anyway. In fact, for the past three years the assembly budget has been cooked up by a back-door cabal. To get the number of votes he required to block any amendment, the Mayor did a backstairs deal with the Green party. So peculiar was that deal that in its first year it involved him buying the support of the Greens by giving their party money to oppose policies that he was asking the assembly to vote him money to pursue. That is about as bizarre as it could be and if it does not bring politics into disrepute, I do not know what does.</p>

It is also far from transparent and hints at another feature of American big-city politics that I hope we do not want to import&#151;pork-barrel politicking. That is the risk we run when a budget can be put together by stitching up backstairs deals as happens at present. We want to bring things transparently on to the floor of the assembly and to have the debate there. That is an entirely comprehensible proposition; it works well everywhere else in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="71011-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07101129000493">A final point that is worth mentioning is that the Minister said that, under a strong model, the budget should be amended only when there is broad support for doing so. First, that is not necessary intellectually for a strong mayoral model to work, as has been demonstrated in the American examples; but in any event, like it or not&#151;I personally do not, but it is a fact of life&#151;the assembly is elected under a proportional representation system. Therefore, in fact, to amend the budget, even by a simple majority, it is necessary in practice for more than one party to come together. So a mayor of one party and a completely dominant opposition party in the assembly could not block each other and get into deadlock. In fact, the assembly would have to work on a consensual basis even to achieve a simple majority. That might be a healthy thing.</p>

That would be an altogether more mature and healthier situation for governance in London.</p>

fact is that the Mayor&#146;s precept of the council tax has increased by 100 per cent. in four years, and most Londoners would say that that does not serve them very well. For that reason, we proposed a measure in Committee that would have increased transparency and allowed separate billing for the Mayor&#146;s precept, so that when people received their council tax bills and complained about the fact that their local councils had put up their council tax by 4 or 5 per cent, or by something above the rate of inflation, they would also receive a bill setting out the Mayor&#146;s precept. They would then be able to see that the Mayor had very generously put up his precept by 25 per cent. or by something of a much larger nature than the local authorities had done. I am afraid that, of course, the Government were not in favour of transparency in billing. Therefore, many people remain in the dark about how generous the Mayor has been with their council tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="71011-0011.htm_para5"><a name="07101129000498">We have reached very strange times when the Minister feels the need to invoke Lord Heseltine&#146;s view as a justification for supporting this budgetary arrangement. It is in fashion for the Government to adopt things, but they are going to the extent of adopting Lord Heseltine&#146;s view in defence of their proposal. As the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has said, no one outside the House or the Mayor&#146;s office will understand a budgetary arrangement whereby a budget can be passed when 16 assembly members vote against it and nine support it. No one would see reason in that sort of arrangement. That is why, if the official Opposition choose to press the motion to a vote today, we will certainly join them. The budget and the Mayor&#146;s ability to push his budget through with minimal support goes to the crux of what is wrong with the present arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="71011-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07101129000499">The Minister said that requiring a majority to support the budget risks conflict and impasse. I do not agree at all. What it risks is the Mayor having to sit down and agree with a majority of assembly members in the different parties that they will support his budget. That arrangement seems to work quite well in local authorities throughout the country, where Conservative and Liberal Democrat administrations, Liberal Democrat and Labour administrations or, quite possibly, Conservative and Labour administrations work together and reach arrangement on budgetary issues and policies. We should not be afraid of that, but it seems as though the idea that the Mayor of London should have to achieve a consensus with assembly members is so appalling and alarming to the Government that they cannot possibly entertain it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="71011-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07101129000500">We think that this is a matter of huge importance. It is probably the most important issue that we need to address to try to make the whole process more democratic, more accountable and more open. We sincerely hope that the motion will be pressed to a vote and that we can command a majority of support against the Government, so that we in the House adopt what was sensibly proposed in the other place to ensure that the budget must be passed by a majority.</p>

about the problems that might arise with deadlock, which would be in no one&#146;s interest, not least the people of London. However, it might have ensured that some of the Mayor&#146;s profligate spending in the past seven years was kept in check. As a number of hon. Members have rightly suggested, the mayoral precept has gone up by well over 100 per cent. In fact, it has almost increased by 180 to 200 per cent. since the mayoralty came into being.</p>

Yet the Mayor is responsible for cleaning not a single street, emptying not a single bin or running not a single school or social services department. That enormous amount of money is spent in what we regard to a large extent as a fairly unaccountable way, because of the nature in which the system works for the GLA.

My own party won nine of the 14 first-past-the-post seats at the last GLA elections and the Labour party won five seats at that juncture, compared to eight and six in the first elections in 2000. As a result, a lock was put in place, with 11 of the members being on a top-up proportional representation basis from the Liberal Democrats, the Green party and UKIP or Veritas. The lock was designed to ensure that no party had a majority, yet the two-thirds arrangements make it almost impossible for a sensible discussion to take place with any Mayor who digs his heels in on budgetary matters.</p>

He cites New York and the budget-making process there, but he knows that there are almost three times as many members of the New York city council.

 The point that I was making is that the New York model does not translate. Instead of all members of the city council, as in New York, having local-only mandates, 11 out of the 25 members in London have a city-wide mandate, without a constituency mandate. In terms of the general approach to mayoral systems, in other parts of the country where they exist, they largely replicate the one that we have in London.</p>

It is reasonable to see the role that the Greens have played as an example of the way in which assembly members can and do effectively influence the Mayor&#146;s budget priority through the budget-making process.</p>

<p><a name="st_o293"><a name="07101129000979"><a name="71011-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="07101129002041"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker (Sylvia Heal):</b>
 With this we may discuss Lords amendments Nos. 4 to 9.</p>

<p><a name="st_o294"><a name="07101129000980"><a name="71011-0012.htm_spnew2"><a name="07101129002042"><b>John Healey:</b>
 We have reached a group of amendments that the Government tabled in the other place in response to the debate that took place there and in this House. The amendments constitute useful additions and, in some places, important strengthening of the provisions. I pay tribute to hon. Members in both Houses who helped us frame them and I look forward to discussing them this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="71011-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07101129000981">I shall deal first with the amendments that relate to health. Amendment No. 3 inserts the London boroughs and the City of London into the list of bodies and persons whose role in implementing the health inequalities strategy the Mayor must describe. Inclusion of the boroughs in the list also results in their being consulted by the Mayor during the early rather than the final stages of developing the strategy. That is sensible, because they have an important role to play in helping pursue the strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="71011-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07101129000982">Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 seek to improve the drafting of the provisions about general health determinants in proposed new section 309F(5).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="71011-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07101129000983">Amendment No. 7 is a minor drafting change, which simplifies the process of consultation on the Mayor&#146;s health inequalities strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="71011-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07101129000984">Let me consider the amendments on housing. The Bill already contains provisions that require the Mayor to consult the London boroughs, the Corporation of London and any other person who is considered appropriate on the London housing strategy. That is in line with arrangements for other London strategies for which the Greater London Authority Act 1999 provides. However, uniquely, delivery of the London housing strategy will be heavily dependent on the Housing Corporation and registered social landlords. Amendment No. 8 therefore introduces an explicit requirement for the Mayor to consult the Housing Corporation and bodies that represent registered social landlords on a new or revised London housing strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="71011-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07101129000985">I hope that the amendments make sense. It is clear to me that they will improve the process of preparing and delivering the strategy and I commend them to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o295"><a name="07101129000986"><a name="71011-0012.htm_spnew3"><a name="07101129002043"><b>Robert Neill:</b>
 The Minister and I are in accord on the amendments and I am grateful to him for the spirit in which he moved them. I agree that they are sensible and improve the Bill. They attracted support from all quarters when they were discussed previously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="71011-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07101129000987">I highlight amendment No. 3 because I especially welcome the recognition of the role of the London boroughs in health matters. As I said in an earlier debate, it is important to stress the importance of partnership between the Mayor and the boroughs from the earliest possible stage. I wish that the Mayor would sometimes recognise that as much the amendments do. However, given the spirit in which the amendments have been moved, we are happy to accept them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o296"><a name="07101129000988"><a name="71011-0012.htm_spnew4"><a name="07101129002044"><b>Tom Brake:</b>
 I, too, support the amendments. If I were being churlish, I would question the reason for missing out local authorities the first time from the health inequalities strategy, given their prominent role  <br>

<p><a name="st_o297"><a name="07101129000989"><a name="71011-0012.htm_spnew5"><a name="07101129002045"><b>Mr. Mark Field:</b>
 Like other hon. Members, I support what the Government are trying to achieve. However, in view of the many planning measures that will be introduced, I hope that there will be a culture of greater transparency, especially on housing-related matters. I speak with a constituency interest in mind about the large-scale development in the Victoria area. There is grave concern among my constituents that a deal has been done between Transport for London, which is under the Mayor&#146;s auspices, and the developer, Land Securities, for some &#163;270 million. Consequently, the current proposal is that there will be no social or affordable housing on the site. All residents in the Victoria area greatly regret that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="71011-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07101129000990">I appreciate that I have raised a specific issue and that we are at an early stage in the process. I wanted to make the simple point to the Minister that, on housing negotiations between the Mayor, housing authorities and the Housing Corporation, greater transparency is vital as far as that is possible. I appreciate that much of the lack of transparency is institutionalised in the planning regime, particularly given the manner in which section 106 agreements operate, which many of us in the House and those who have served as local councillors regret. However, I hope that the point will be borne in mind in this Bill and in other legislation that the Government bring forward.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has spoken with a great deal of common sense in this debate, although we were on opposite sides about the Mayor&#146;s accountability for the budget. He has shown great attention to detail on the Bill, so will he tell the House whether he was overlooked as a candidate for Mayor or whether he was rejected in the selection process? Unfortunately, the Conservative party&#146;s candidate for Mayor does not seem to have a view on anything in the Bill&#151;</p>

 Perhaps I could just say that I want very much to echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) has said.

It further requires the Mayor to prepare and publish a document setting out any other persons from whom he will hear oral representations, the procedures that he will follow for considering oral representations and the arrangements for identifying the factual information that is agreed by the parties.

Indeed, our proposals expressly provide for that. It is important that the Mayor takes only the decisions that it is appropriate for him to take. Lords amendment No. 12 makes an important change to give further effect to that principle. It will provide an express power for the Mayor to pass the decision making back to the relevant borough on subsequent applications for the approval of reserved matters or the approval of details under a listed building consent, where he has already determined the earlier outline application. That new provision, alongside clause 33, will ensure that decisions on all applications are taken at the appropriate level.</p>

 The provisions in the Bill allow for the Mayor to get involved in major developments and applications that might have a wider, strategic significance. In the amendments, and in the Bill, we are keen to ensure that decisions are taken at the appropriate level, and that wherever appropriate local boroughs continue in their role as the planning authority. The amendments in this group, which we passed in the other place, strengthen that principle and put in place for the future a more balanced system that will serve London well.</p>

In our judgment, that is a profoundly anti-localist, anti-devolutionary measure.

Mayor to interfere in planning matters far more than before is a much greater recipe for conflict than any of the issues concerning the budget and the Mayor and the assembly that we have discussed. The history of London government is full of tension and conflict between the upper tier and the boroughs. That was so with the old Greater London council and elsewhere.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that the amendment, however helpful in improving the position, does not lend itself to the task of trying to involve local people in local decisions?

 I agree with my hon. Friend. A regrettable fact of London life is that the Mayor has not approached planning matters with anything like the spirit of reasonableness and restraint that the Minister displays in speaking to these amendments today. I regret to say that I have no confidence that the current Mayor will use these powers with the degree of restraint and sensitivity that the Minister clearly hopes for. Again regrettably, the evidence of the Mayor&#146;s behaviour so far is very much to the contrary.

doing so under any circumstances, or will there still be a safeguard&#151;and perhaps further complication and delay&#151;in the hands of central Government to call in such an application? From the perspective either of developers or of local communities that want a particular development in their area, it would be highly undesirable if the process led to yet another layer of delay and bureaucracy.

The argument was strongly put to us that the advantage of doing so was that that would provide greater stability and focus and help to ensure that the fund was deployed in the best interests of London at all levels. Ultimately, we took the view that that approach had the advantage over a voluntary system, in that it provided a legal certainty for the basis on which the fund is paid and administered.</p>

In that way, it recognises that the vision and strategy for London&#146;s waste is the Mayor&#146;s, and that action will have to take place in accordance with that. I see the hon.

 I am grateful to the Minister for his introduction of the amendment. As he said, I welcome the Government&#146;s approach, as it seems to the Opposition a sensible and pragmatic way forward. I am glad that the Government did not listen to the blandishments of the Mayor of London and some of his supporters who lobbied immensely hard during the passage of the Bill for the creation of a single London waste authority under the Mayor&#146;s control. In our judgment, that would have been a needless level of bureaucracy.

As the Minister will know, and the House should know, the board is to be funded to the tune of &#163;25 million, with &#163;19 million coming from the Government and &#163;6 million from the Greater London authority. If anything more aptly demonstrates the unfitness of the current Mayor for office, it is his childish, arrogant and destructive attitude towards the establishment of the board. He has effectively said, &#147;I don&#146;t like what I&#146;ve been given, and I&#146;m going to take my toys away,&#148; which demonstrates his unwillingness to tackle serious issues. He wanted something that gave him more power, but this is a sensible compromise, as all parties in the House recognise.

I welcome the intention to set up the board and am grateful for the Minister&#146;s confirmation of that. I look forward to hearing the detail of the shadow board in due course. How do the Government propose to deal with the negative impact on waste and recycling in London of the Mayor&#146;s apparent lack of co-operation?

We recognise that the Mayor is likely to want to focus on low carbon technologies. After all, carbon dioxide is the major contributor to climate change, but we want to keep open the possibility that he might also support technologies that are important to other energy goals.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for the way that he has introduced the amendments. We have no issue with them; they are sensible amendments. The point about climate change knowing no boundaries is obviously well made. Various independent bodies have made the valid criticism that some of the other mayoral strategies have been, if anything, too inward looking and have not had enough regard to London's impact on the rest of the south-east. I hope that that sensibly broader approach will be something of a precedent for the way in which the Mayor deals with other statutory strategies that he has. The London plan is one that was criticised for being a bit too London-centric and for not looking enough at the linkages. Therefore, the provision is a step in the right direction in that regard. </p>

In Committee, our concern was that the Mayor was going to be held back in relation to what he could do for climate change because of the linkage with national Government policies. Therefore, I welcome the additional flexibility that the Mayor has been given in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para0"><a name="07101129001083">The Government do not agree with that statement. We believe that there needs to be clarity and certainty about the proposed powers of intervention and, further, that in England they should be exercised by the Learning and Skills Council, as the funding and commissioning body for further education there. In Wales, the proposed powers of intervention would be exercised by Welsh Ministers; there is no equivalent of the LSC in Wales, and Welsh Ministers are responsible for the planning and funding of further education in Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07101129001084">However, we reflected on the valuable debates, and particularly the contributions of those who urged the need to make sure that there are appropriate checks, particularly in the system we are proposing for England. In that context, I would like to express my appreciation of the constructive work that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) has done with us to prepare a robust solution for the sector. I held discussions on the amendments, and he influenced them; that offers a model of how Government and Opposition can, and should, work together where we can. I also pay tribute to the hon.

Statements approved by the Secretary of State will be laid before each House; Welsh Ministers must lay statements of their policy before the National Assembly for Wales. We have also limited the power in relation to dismissal of senior post holders so that it is now to direct a governing body to initiate dismissal proceedings, and we have made a number of non-statutory changes to address concerns that have been raised.</p>

 Yes, I believe that that clarity does exist. One of the bodies that has been particularly pressing us on this issue is the Association of Colleges, which represents colleges throughout the country. The last time we discussed the Bill, it was satisfied with the changes we had made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07101129001088">However, the amendments now proposed by the Government go further still. They propose that the Bill requires the LSC to give notice to the Secretary of State before exercising any of the statutory intervention powers. It would not be appropriate to specify in statute which Secretary of State the LSC should notify, but it is likely that in most circumstances that notice would be given to the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills and, where the education or training of 16 to 19 year olds was affected, the notice would be copied to the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para4"><a name="07101129001089">At that point, if the Secretary of State considered that what the LSC was proposing to do was inappropriate, he would be able to take action using, as appropriate, his powers under either proposed section 56C of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, or section 25 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000. The process for intervention would enable a governing body that considered that the LSC was not following its published statement about how it would exercise its statutory intervention powers to make a complaint to the LSC. If the governing body was not satisfied with the response, it could set out its concerns in writing to the Secretary of State. That gives a significant degree of further reassurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07101129001090">I also want to give the House a commitment today that where the Secretary of State received notice of the LSC&#146;s intention to exercise its statutory intervention powers, he would write to local MPs, notifying them of the situation. That would be done on a personal basis, to protect those institutions where the possibility of intervention was not in the public domain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07101129001091">The amendment that we are proposing and the commitment I have given directly address the issues raised in another place. They enhance the accountability that the LSC already has. They make it clear to Parliament and the further education system that Ministers will be keeping a watching brief on situations where serious action in relation to a particular provider might be necessary, and they ensure that hon. Members will be aware of such situations where particular provision is in, or serves, their constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07101129001092">We have reached a sensible position. We must retain the power to intervene through the LSC in extremis.

We have had a continuing dialogue, which seems to have begun a long time ago. Indeed, the Bill began its passage early in the year, so this has been a long journey but a not entirely tortuous one; it has been more &#147;Three Men in a Boat&#148;&#151;at least, two men and a lady in a boat&#151;than &#147;Heart of Darkness&#148;.

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07101129001097">In part, as the Minister has graciously acknowledged both today and on several previous occasions, that is because of the constructive opposition from the Conservatives and the other parties, which have also played a part in this process. It is also because of the work done in the other place, where a measured and well-informed debate about the Bill has taken place. I pay tribute to Baroness Morris of Bolton for the role that she has played in reminding the Minister that although the other place can, on occasion, be stubborn, it is so in the interests of what is right and appropriate. The House is at its best when Bills are improved by careful scrutiny and when the Opposition are listened to. Throughout the passage of the Bill, that has been the case.</p>

The original version of the Bill would have granted sweeping new powers to the Learning and Skills Council to intervene in further education colleges. I raised that on Second Reading with the then Secretary of State, who has now moved on to other things&#151;I will not say greater things. At that stage the Secretary of State said that he did not think that the powers would be used anyway, as they had not been used in their current form. We did not think that was good enough. Throughout Committee and in the other place we pressed Ministers to mitigate the powers, in the interests both of colleges and of proper parliamentary scrutiny and accountability.</p>

It will mean that to intervene, the LSC must have the express permission of the Secretary of State. That means that people in this House will be accountable for decisions made in that regard, as we feared that, under the original form of the Bill, they might not have been. Moreover, the LSC will report annually on how their intervention powers have been used, and that report will be subject to appropriate scrutiny. Furthermore, the Minister has confirmed that at any stage during the process, if any individual feels that the powers have not been used reasonably or appropriately, the Secretary of State will be able to intervene and stop the process&#151;at its beginning, middle or end. That is, in effect, a right of appeal, and I felt that that was important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para15"><a name="07101129001101">In addition, I am assured by the Minister in private discussions and in writing that the powers are not an extension of existing powers. There was a fear expressed in Committee and elsewhere that the new powers went wider than the current powers of the Secretary of State. The Minister assures me in his letter of 26 September that that is not the case. The provisions merely clarify the existing scope of powers that are in the hands of the Secretary of State. That is a great relief to colleges and others who felt that the provisions might be applied more widely to college managers and others, even college lecturers against whom people took a dislike. I understand that that was never the intention, but it was important that the Minister had the good grace and good sense to put that in writing. We end with an amendment that reassures those in the sector that this is not a plan to impose on them even more micro-management than already exists, which we resist today as we have always resisted it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para16"><a name="07101129001102">We do not want to be too friendly; there must be some theatre and drama in our exchanges. People must know that there is a tangible difference between the Conservative approach to further education and that of the Government. So let me say now that we believe passionately in the independence of colleges. This will reassure colleges that these powers are not as draconian as they once seemed. It will also reassure hon. Members of all political parties that they have the opportunity to hold Ministers to account for the way in which these matters are dealt with. That second issue deserves just as much air time, because this House takes its responsibilities in those regards very seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07101129001103">Taken together, the amendments and the further written assurance of the Minister represent a significant change of direction. They mean, in effect, that the LSC will be unable to intervene without the approval of the Secretary of State. I am grateful to the Minister for his clarification. Finally I quote from his letter:</p>
<a name="71011-0014.htm_brev2"><a name="07101129001259"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Bill does not empower the LSC to intervene in ways the Secretary of State cannot currently do...the LSC would not be able to direct a governing body for example to dismiss a senior post-holder&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para18"><a name="07101129001104">That assurance summarises and typifies the changes that have been made through the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para19"><a name="07101129001105">I know that my colleagues in this place welcome the amendments and the tone that the Minister has adopted in introducing them, and I anticipate, although I have no authority to insist on it, that my colleagues in the other place will take a similar view.</p>

 I rise to support the amendments, and to echo the words of my hon. Friend the Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education and of the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) about the constructive and thoughtful debates in which I and others have taken part both in the House and in Committee. We have probably had a little too much theatre in the House this week, and this debate encapsulates the other aspect of our work, which is, when appropriate, to hold sensible discussions and find agreement whatever our party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para20"><a name="07101129001107">I shall briefly refer to the aspects of the amendments that deal with intervention in Wales and order-making powers for Welsh Ministers. From a Welsh point of view, the Bill has attracted much debate about the procedure for dealing with such amendments and other aspects of the Bill relating to Wales. I make two pleas to my hon. Friend the Minister. The first is to nurture the relationship between his Department and the Welsh Assembly Government. The Minister for Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills, Jane Hutt, is a good Minister, and the relationship between the Assembly Government and the Westminster Government should be one of co-operation rather than confrontation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para21"><a name="07101129001108">My second plea relates to the way in which the House deals with amendments that affect Wales. I am still not convinced that there is good enough scrutiny of such amendments. There is a role for Members of Parliament representing Wales, whether in Committee or on the Floor of the House, that has not yet been properly exploited, so I hope that in the Minister&#146;s discussions with the Secretary of State and the usual channels we can improve the methods whereby we scrutinise such amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07101129001109">There is another debate to be had about the fact that the political scene in Scotland and in Wales has changed dramatically&#151;and, thereby, the relationship between the Government, the Assembly and the Scottish Parliament. However, I would be a most unpopular man were I to pursue that subject at present.</p>

<p><a name="st_o344"><a name="07101129001110"><a name="71011-0014.htm_spnew4"><a name="07101129002092"><b>Sarah Teather (Brent, East) (LD):</b>
 I begin, as other Members have done, by thanking the Minister for the way he has worked through the Bill. I have sat through proceedings on many other Bills in which Ministers trenchantly dug in their heels on irrelevant points, so I pay tribute to his willingness to listen, clarify and amend at all stages, including in Committee. The Bill that left the Committee was a grand improvement on the measure that first came to us from the Lords and the amendments proposed today are a considerable move forward. I thank the Minister, too, for making his civil servants available for meetings to discuss the Bill and for attending such meetings himself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para23"><a name="07101129001111">The Lords were right to reject the clause twice in its previous form. I was concerned that it allowed the Learning and Skills Council&#151;an entirely undemocratic body subject to no form of parliamentary scrutiny&#151;to force a private institution to initiate dismissal proceedings against senior staff, even though the LSC may be but one of the bodies providing funding for the institution concerned. I had grave concerns about that, and I pay tribute to our colleagues in the other place for pressing the Government on the issue, so that we now have an amendment that is a considerable improvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para24"><a name="07101129001112">I continue to question the need for the clause, especially given the fact that the Secretary of State has never used the powers. However, we have moved a long way since the first draft of the provision, and that has met most of my concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para25"><a name="07101129001113">The Minister did not address my principal concern in his opening speech, and I hope that he might clarify it in his winding-up remarks. As I said on Report, after the changes in the machinery of government, we expect the responsibility for funding 16-to-19 education to move to the Department for Children, Schools and Families and local authorities, rather than being channelled through the Learning and Skills Council. Therefore, the LSC will not be the funding body for an enormous number of colleges, so it would be an inappropriate regulator. It would be highly inappropriate to give the LSC the power to intervene in such a way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para26"><a name="07101129001114">The Minister assured me in private that he was willing to make it clear on the record that further legislation would be needed when those changes took place. I hope that he will make it clear not only that further legislation will be needed to ensure that the LSC&#146;s powers do not transfer to another body but that those powers should not remain with the LSC. If the LSC is not funding colleges, it should not be the body regulating colleges either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para27"><a name="07101129001115">The key move, which the Minister made clear, involves democratic accountability and parliamentary scrutiny, and the change in the Secretary of State&#146;s role in that respect is very welcome. The fact that the LSC must notify the Secretary of State of its actions and that the Secretary of State will be given the freedom to change and direct the LSC in a different way, with a loop involving MPs as well, provides the possibility of parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para28"><a name="07101129001116">I wonder whether the Minister will also place on record a point that he raised with me in private. He intends to use section 28(2) of the Learning and Skills Act 2000 to direct the LSC to include details of how it has used those powers in its annual report, thus ensuring not only that parliamentary scrutiny is available to MPs who have had the misfortune of seeing such powers used in their constituencies but that all MPs who have an interest in the issue can question the Secretary of State in his role as the accountable person in the House, where it is appropriate to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para29"><a name="07101129001117">Finally, I am pleased that the Minister has placed on record the role of the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families. I wonder whether he might elaborate on that role. Presumably, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families will become the relevant Secretary of State, once the machinery of government changes are implemented, but will that Secretary of State always be notified if the college involved does a substantial portion of its work in 16-to-19 education? What if all of its work is in the 16-to-19 area?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="71011-0014.htm_para30"><a name="07101129001118">I place it on record that I am grateful to the Minister for being willing to amend the clause. This issue has caused us great concern, rightly. I continue to have concerns about whether the clause is needed. However, as the Minister has moved so far, I shall certainly not oppose it today.</p>

 We have had a genuinely constructive debate, but I tell the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) that to talk of victory is going a tad far. A sensible intention on the part of the Government has been tightened through the scrutiny process. That, frankly, is how the House should operate.

That would include, for example, the type of actions that had been taken, the reason for taking such actions and the outcomes. The form of the statement would be such that it was not possible to identify individual institutions where the fact of intervention was not in the public domain. Nevertheless, I think that that gives the hon. Lady the reassurance that she sought.</p>

At that stage, the Secretary of State can take action, but does not have to do so on receipt of such a notice. It is correct that the Secretary of State has a greater opportunity to scrutinise the LSC as it takes that action, and if he chooses, to stop the LSC taking such action.</p>

Rather, it specifies that the power to give directions may include a direction to make collaboration arrangements. It also specifies that the LSC would not be able to direct a governing body to dismiss a senior postholder. Instead, it would be able to direct the governing body to initiate dismissal proceedings.</p>

Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), the former Secretary of State for Wales, were exceedingly constructive. His point about nurturing the relationship between the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the Welsh Assembly Government is important. Devolution does not mean divorce. There is a continuing need for co-operation and overlap. I entirely take his point about dialogue. The Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy) has recently had discussions with Jane Hutt about some of these matters. My right hon. Friend&#146;s important point about the need for effective scrutiny will have been heard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="71011-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07101129001127">On scrutiny in general, it is important to make it clear that the Bill has been subject to scrutiny and the role of Welsh Ministers has been scrutinised. With reference to the exercise of the powers of intervention, the Welsh Assembly Minister will be subject to scrutiny by the Welsh Assembly. The comments that were made have been extremely constructive and helpful.</p>

 First, it may be helpful to the House if the Minister comments on the ability of the Secretary of State to intervene if any of the parties feel that the intervention has been mishandled or inappropriate. The Minister deals with that in his letter to me, but it might be worth articulating it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="71011-0015.htm_para4"><a name="07101129001129">Secondly, if the powers were transferred at a future point so some other body&#151;we do not know what the future of the LSC would be&#151;would that require further legislation, as opposed to being done in a more slight and unsatisfactory way?</p>

 I thought that I had already made that clear, but I am happy to do so again. If there were changes in future, that would require legislation, which would be open to scrutiny. Will the hon. Gentleman remind me of his first point?</p>

 That is the trouble with making two points. In his letter to me, the Minister makes it clear that if the powers were exercised in a way which the parties concerned felt was inappropriate, or if the process of the exercise of the powers went wrong, the Secretary of State could at any point intervene to deal with the matter and draw it to a conclusion. We spoke about that at a meeting and it is confirmed in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s letter, but it would be useful to have it on the record in this place.</p>

 I am happy to confirm that the Secretary of State has the power to direct the process. If the notification comes from the Learning and Skills Council and if, as a result of his own judgment or as a result of representations, the Secretary of State is not happy for that intervention to proceed, he may stop it.

proposals to transfer the statutory intervention powers to another body, new legislation would be required to enact that transfer. The Bill does not empower the LSC to intervene in ways that the Secretary of State cannot currently. Ministers envisage that the LSC would use its powers to direct a governing body to initiate dismissal proceedings against a senior post holder other than the principal when wider intervention, which included possible dismissal of the principal, was also being considered. That important point has been raised with me before. We intend the power to be used to address unsatisfactory provision, not to decide who should hold a particular appointment in an institution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="71011-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07101129001134">It is important that the House should be clear about such significant matters. In the spirit of our recent work, I hope that we can take forward the point on which the hon. Gentleman pressed me today. Specifically, he asked exactly what the Secretary of State could do if, on receipt of a notice from the LSC that it intended to exercise its statutory intervention powers, he had concerns. I have addressed that point already. However, for the record I say again that, on receipt of a notice of the sort that we propose, it would be open to the Secretary of State, if he was satisfied that the LSC&#146;s proposed intervention was not appropriate, to exercise his powers under proposed section 56C of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 to direct the LSC on the exercise of its statutory intervention powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="71011-0015.htm_para7"><a name="07101129001135">Under section 25 of the 2000 Act, the Secretary of State could also direct the LSC not to act if he was satisfied that the LSC was proposing to act unreasonably in relation to its statutory powers or duties, or if it had failed to discharge a statutory duty. Any such direction by the Secretary of State might be as a result of any failure by the LSC to have regard to its most recently published statement of its intervention policy, so the issue would be framed within the context set out by the LSC. As I explained earlier, the Bill provides that the statement must be approved by the Secretary of State and that he must lay a copy of the approved statement before each House of Parliament. If the Secretary of State directed the LSC under proposed section 56C or section 25 of the 2000 Act, he would be accountable to the House for that decision.</p>

In June of this year, I remember visiting a number of people in my constituency and, by invitation, slightly beyond, to look at the difficulties they had experienced following floods in that month. I visited people who told me that they had lived in their properties for 40 years and never been flooded. There was some kind of warning there, I suppose. The storms were similar, although obviously those in July were a lot worse. There was a warning in June that there was a problem because places flooded that had never flooded before, and it was depressing to me to have to visit those people again in July, when they had been flooded for a second time.</p>

Perhaps it should not have, but it seemed to take us by surprise. The rain continued for a lot of the day, probably all of it, and people&#146;s journeys home became extremely difficult. A journey that should have taken me one hour took me four. The mobile phone network went down completely and it was impossible to phone home or make any arrangements. I was one of the lucky ones: many people did not get home at all. My house is not that far from the M5 motorway, and I know that people slept in their cars on the motorway, including police officers, who had no way of getting away from the situation. People slept in borough council offices, and some slept in public houses, which was probably the preferable option, but not one they would necessarily have chosen. It seemed to get worse.</p>

As things progressed, the town of Tewkesbury got cut off and became an island, as probably the whole world knows&#151;Tewkesbury is now world famous for the wrong reasons. I have to stress that other parts of my constituency were also very badly flooded. Part of the hospital at Tewkesbury had to be evacuated, the doctor&#146;s surgery was flooded and had to be evacuated, meaning that the doctors were displaced, and many  <br>

businesses were closed. Of course, many people had to leave their homes; some of them had to be rescued from their top floor. It was a desperate situation. When we lost the water supply, we had to live off water supplied by bowsers&#151;a word I had never come across before 20 July&#151;and the filling of bowsers and the delivery of bottled water became a major issue. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am glad to welcome the hon.

That was extremely tragic, but it could have been so much worse. We lost our mains water supply&#151;some people lost it for up to three weeks&#151;and as many as 350,000 properties were affected in this way. We very nearly lost our electricity supplies. It was estimated that up to 600,000 households could have lost electricity.</p>

I would like to congratulate the armed forces, Tewkesbury borough council, parish councils and many others&#151;particularly those individuals who helped rescue people and deliver bottled water. It really brought out the very best in 99 per cent. of people. There were no divisions and no party politics; everybody made a tremendous effort. I personally knew many people who worked hard, but there were many others whom I did not know and whom I will probably not meet again.</p>

Far be it from me, as a Conservative Member of Parliament, to try to brighten up the Prime Minister&#146;s week, but I must thank him for what he did. He showed a great deal of interest and I am not prepared to play party politics about the matter. His many interventions were welcome. I also thank and congratulate the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and everybody at every level, including those in Cobra and Gold Command, who tried to help alleviate the disaster. I am told that it was the biggest operation in peacetime Britain, and that is significant.</p>

 I am grateful for that intervention. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right and has made one of the most important points. I shall deal with that a little later, but I emphasise that he is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="71011-0015.htm_para22"><a name="07101129001153">The second part of my speech is about the current position. Tewkesbury and the surrounding areas have recovered well but many people are still living in caravans on their own drives, and will do so for many months. In a discussion with the chief constable this morning, I was reminded that they will have to eat their Christmas dinner in caravans unless they are fortunate enough to be invited elsewhere. Many people remain displaced from their homes. Businesses, especially shops, pubs and restaurants, lost much business. When we lost the water supply, restaurants could not prepare food properly and consequently lost an awful lot of business. However, I want to convey the message that, although some people believe that Tewkesbury was like New Orleans, it was not that bad. Tewkesbury was not affected in quite the same way and it is open for business. I hope that I am allowed to make that plug.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="71011-0015.htm_para23"><a name="07101129001154">Of course, people have still got to get their houses back together and make insurance claims. The process of claiming appears to have gone fairly smoothly&#151;I have not heard many complaints about it&#151;although it took time for assessors and others to come out. Given the scale of the problem, that was understandable, but matters are progressing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="71011-0015.htm_para24"><a name="07101129001155">Concern has been expressed about future insurance premiums and the future availability of insurance. I want to spend some time considering that because, yesterday, the Association of British Insurers made the worrying statement that it could not guarantee insuring people against flooding in future because of the Chancellor&#146;s statement the other day and the lack of money, as the association put it, from him for the alleviation of floods. I hope that the Chancellor will provide enough money to guard against future problems, and I want to discuss shortly some of the things that I hope will be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="71011-0015.htm_para25"><a name="07101129001156">I am also a little concerned about the ABI&#146;s position, although I do not want to be too much against it. I asked the ABI what specific schemes it felt would not be able to go ahead because of the Government&#146;s position that it felt should go ahead. Again, I am not defending the Government at all, but I was a bit concerned this morning to receive an e-mail from the ABI that in answer&#151;or non-answer&#151;to my question said:</p>

available to them, that is a different proposition. I should like the Minister to address that concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="71011-0015.htm_para27"><a name="07101129001158">I come to part three of my speech: what do I think should happen in the future? We live on the confluence of two rivers in Tewkesbury. It is a beautiful place. We have the abbey and we have a lot going for us. The rivers brought a lot of trade in the past, but of course we recognise that Tewkesbury is on a floodplain and that the rivers flood frequently. The fields around Tewkesbury flood probably two, three or four times a year. That is not a problem; what is a problem is the kind of situation that we face currently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="71011-0015.htm_para28"><a name="07101129001159">Although we accept that we live on a floodplain and that sometimes we will be flooded, people&#146;s primary concern now is that we should learn lessons from what happened. It is far too easy for the headlines to disappear, for people to forget about the situation and for nothing to happen. I hope that we will learn the lessons. I make no apology for returning to the fact that three people died in my constituency because of the flooding or that people beyond have suffered. We must learn the lessons. What do I think those lessons are? The biggest one is that we should not build houses or other buildings on or near floodplains. If we do that, the water obviously has nowhere to go or not as many places to go, whereas if the floodplain is a green field, the water can rest on it and eventually disappear. If there are buildings on that field, that cannot happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="71011-0015.htm_para29"><a name="07101129001160">One area of building in my constituency, in a place called Bredon Road, was part built and flooded. That was not a good calculation. In a written answer to my question number 146213, the Minister for Housing quoted planning policy statement 25, with regard to strategic flood risk assessments. That is welcome as far as it goes, but I do not think that it goes far enough. I know that the role of the Environment Agency has to some extent been strengthened on that point&#151;I shall return to that&#151;but the provision does not goes anywhere near far enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="71011-0015.htm_para30"><a name="07101129001161">I am also concerned about how we determine what constitutes a floodplain. When the Environment Secretary came to Tewkesbury he told me that the flooding that had occurred was far worse than the definitive map, which suggested where the flooding might take place if the 1947 floods were repeated. The flooding this time was worse. I had a meeting with somebody from the Environment Agency who suggested that if water lay beneath the surface of land, it was okay to build on. That is profoundly wrong and dangerous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="71011-0015.htm_para31"><a name="07101129001162">There is currently an application, which will be with the Secretary of State any day now, at a village called Longford in my constituency, which is very close to Walham electric works, which almost flooded and which we almost lost. The appeal to the Secretary of State is by Hitchins and is to build some 600 houses on an area that floods and to which the access roads also flood. Surely that application must be turned down when it reaches the Secretary of State&#146;s office, otherwise we will have heard just empty words.</p>

problem now is defining and redefining the floodplain, but also recognising the fact that where building is allowed can sometimes have an impact on other places further downstream. That is very worrying. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that, when an application is proposed, we need to look not only at the impact on the immediate area but at the impact further down the river, the brook or whatever.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para0"><a name="07101129001165">There are areas of Tewkesbury, such as the Wheatpieces estate and the Stonehills estate, of which people said, &#147;Well, there you are, they didn&#146;t flood. It wasn&#146;t a problem.&#148; That misses the point entirely. The next estate, Priors Park estate, was very badly flooded. We are also losing gardens. Houses are being built on gardens, which are defined as brownfield sites, and that land loses the ability to soak up water.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07101129001166">That raises the question of why so many houses are needed. I do not want to go through all the issues. We know about ageing populations, about couples separating, about people wanting more than one house, and about immigration&#151;we have had net immigration of well over a million in the past 10 years. All those factors put pressure on the housing situation, and we have to think about this very sensibly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07101129001167">Unbelievably, there are proposals from the regional spatial strategy in my constituency to build thousands of houses north of Gloucester and north of Cheltenham. That is asking for trouble, and the proposal must be rejected. We must find a better way forward, and better places to put the houses. We cannot build thousands of houses in the areas that have suffered so badly over the past few weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07101129001168">When we have to build houses, the builders should have a greater responsibility to ensure that the drainage system is adequate. In answer to my parliamentary question number 146214, the Minister helpfully replied but his answer was not strong enough. Things need tightening up. We also need to ensure that ditches and drains are cleared regularly, and that they are repaired when necessary. I had some displaced people living with me for a while; they were delightful. They lived much higher up than me, but their house, unlike mine, had flooded because their drains did not work. In fact, they had worked in reverse and thrown the water out into the property. I accept that that was an exceptional time, but in many cases, the drains were simply inadequate and the ditches were not cleaned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07101129001169">We need to draw up a list of priority people and priority buildings, so that we can help more quickly in times of difficulty. I went for a walkabout on the Sunday, and I came across some sheltered accommodation. Nobody had been there, and water was surrounding the buildings. It was coming up through the floors of the flats, and we had to push people out in their wheelchairs to avoid what could have been a terrible situation. We then had to wait for ambulances and police cars to arrive. This place was called Lanes Court in Priors Park, the estate that I mentioned earlier. Nobody had been round to check up on it; it had not registered on anyone&#146;s radar screen. There was no emergency relief for those people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07101129001171">Well, in spite of what I am sure were the best efforts of all involved, that did not happen. It certainly did happen to some extent, but many people, such as those whom I have just mentioned, did not get rescued until they happened to be stumbled across. Many old and disabled people had bottled water brought to their houses, but that did not happen across the board. There were still many vulnerable people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07101129001172">The fire and rescue service made an absolutely tremendous effort, but I do not think that it was quite prepared for a disaster of this scale in terms of the number of its officers who have been trained to carry out rescue operations in water. Some are trained to do that and did an excellent job. Others also did an excellent job, but we need to reflect more on whether there are enough fire rescue officers trained in that particular line of service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07101129001173">I spoke to the chief constable of Gloucestershire this morning about the tri-service centre. It is pity that the hon. Member for Stroud is no longer in his place, as I hoped that he would agree with me about it. On 20 July, the emergency services people were able to talk to each other immediately at the operational level. Nothing needed to be set up: they managed the emergency very well indeed and it would not have been as effective if it had had to be managed regionally. The local emergency people all knew the local council people, people from the utilities, MPs and so forth. It is interesting to note that when the merger of police forces was first discussed, relevant documents observed that a force as small as Gloucestershire&#146;s would not be able to handle an emergency on this scale. In fact, the force handled it very well indeed. I thus make a plea for the tri-service centre to be retained. It is working well and should be allowed to continue to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07101129001174">As to securing water and electricity supplies, which the hon. Member for Stroud mentioned, we have to ensure that the Mythe water works, located close to my home, is protected. We cannot allow hundreds of thousands of people to lose their drinking water again. In respect of the Walham electricity works&#151;one sub-station apparently serves 600,000&#151;it cannot be right to put people into such a vulnerable position. I understand that Hesco bastions, which are protective borders, have been put around the Mythe works on a temporary basis, with the possibility of them becoming permanent, but I have to say that this is not rocket science. It should be simple to provide those protections, which must become permanent at Mythe, Walham and elsewhere.</p>

an old service station, isn&#146;t it?&#148; Well, he had a good point. The plant usually works very well and the people employed there work hard, but so many people&#146;s water should not be dependent on one particular water treatment plant and the same applies to electricity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07101129001176">I want to touch on the role of Severn Trent. It is perhaps understandable that it was totally overwhelmed by what happened. However, it operates&#151;I suppose inevitably&#151;as a monopoly, so it is in a different position. People cannot choose to go elsewhere for their water. A great deal of anger was directed at Severn Trent: some of it may not have been justified, but I can certainly understand quite a lot of it. I suggest that Severn Trent should be more a part of the community and should update its emergency planning. There was a tremendous effort in Tewkesbury to get bowsers and bottles of water to everybody. I believe that we ended up with most of the available bowsers in the country, so what would have happened if there had been a similar emergency somewhere else in the country? All the water companies need to be aware of what can happen and ensure that they can respond to these situations more strongly if they occur again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07101129001177">I come on to the Environment Agency. Some years ago, the Environment Agency was monitoring a chemical treatment plant, operated by Cleansing Service Group and based in Sandhurst in my constituency. It was watching it so closely that the whole thing blew up one day and it simply did not carry out its job properly. I have many criticisms of the Environment Agency and I shall run through a few issues that are linked to it. If they are not currently its responsibility, perhaps they should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07101129001180">The Environment Agency has become a statutory consultee in planning applications. That is not strong enough. It needs to have a much greater say in whether certain planning applications are granted. It needs a better and faster warning system: the Environment Agency claims to have warned many thousands of people, but many people were not warned about what was coming. Farmers were particularly affected, and while I pay tribute to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and National Farmers Union for their excellent work in getting water to many livestock, there was a big problem with the warning system, which needs to be examined.</p>

The Environment Agency needs more responsibility, more powers, adequate funding and more confidence to sort out problems, or else it needs scrapping. As it stands, it serves no useful purpose; we cannot leave it as it is.</p>

 Thank you for your indulgence, Madam Deputy Speaker. I will be very brief. As I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) has covered a number of the matters that I shall raise, I beg your forgiveness if I am repetitive. I apologise for not being present at the start of the debate; I was serving on a Public Bill Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para24"><a name="07101129001192">Given that a number of my constituents were affected by the flooding, I want to record my thanks to all the emergency services, and the armed forces, for the tremendous work that they did. I know my hon. Friend agrees that although the loss of life was tragic for the families and individuals directly concerned, we have the emergency services to thank for the fact that it was not very much greater. The way in which our emergency services in Gloucestershire, with gold command based at the tri-service centre, worked so closely together demonstrated the success of that model, and I hope that the lessons learned inquiry will make recommendations to the Government that will make them think again about the attempt to regionalise fire control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para25"><a name="07101129001193">Those of us whose constituencies were affected by the flooding welcomed the fact that Ministers were responsive throughout the recess and kept Members properly informed. We were able to question them on what was going on, which gave us a valuable opportunity to raise issues and secure action on a number of matters that affected us locally. I also thank Ministers for the &#163;10 million that they have given Gloucestershire county council to help with the repair of roads that were damaged across the county&#151;but having thanked the Minister for the down-payment, I should remind him that another &#163;17 million is needed for further repairs. I know that his colleagues in the Department for Transport are working with officials from the county council to settle the details, and I hope that the money will be forthcoming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para26"><a name="07101129001194">I want to make two more points. The first concerns council tax. I am aware that the Department has provided money for a number of the authorities concerned. Tewkesbury borough council, part of which covers my constituency, has used the money very quickly. Much of it has been used directly to help constituents and to defray some of the cost. The Minister might consider encouraging the Valuation Office Agency to be as flexible as possible where constituents have suffered property damage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para27"><a name="07101129001195">A case in my constituency is being examined, and I hope that the right decision will be made. My constituents have been unable to live in their main residence, but because they are occupying a caravan on the site they are having to pay the full council tax on the property. That is clearly not appropriate. To be fair to the Minister, I should add that the Valuation Office Agency is considering the case. I hope that it will be able to observe the state of the property, and will charge the appropriate council tax for occupation of the caravan. I know that Ministers have been flexible when such issues have arisen in the past, and I hope that they will be so in this instance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para28"><a name="07101129001196">I raise my second point not necessarily in expectation of action in a specific case, but in the hope that Ministers may, as part of their response to the lessons learned inquiry, consider the rules governing utility companies and loss of water supply. In Gloucestershire a number of residents across the county were without mains water for a significant period. Because of the exceptional nature of the event, it has been decided that the compensation scheme, which would normally require Severn Trent Water to compensate both domestic and business users for the loss of their supply, will not take effect. Severn Trent Water has made a payment to local authorities in lieu of that, but it will not surprise the Minister to find out that that amount is significantly less than what would have been due under the scheme. It may be worth looking at whether it is appropriate that the compensation scheme does not operate in a case where a significant number of consumers have been affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para29"><a name="07101129001197">To add insult to injury, Severn Trent Water is not even considering not charging them for water supply during the period for which they were without water. Constituents will have to pay their full annual bill. For a significant period, they were greatly inconvenienced. They would welcome the Government looking again at that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para30"><a name="07101129001198">Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to raise those issues and to put those concerns on the record. I look forward to hearing what the Minister says in reply.</p>

 It is extremely appropriate that we have this Adjournment debate in the first week of the return of Parliament. The last Adjournment debate before the summer recess was on flooding. I was grateful to Mr. Speaker for the opportunity to reply to that debate. I want to put a few, I hope, serious points on the record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para31"><a name="07101129001200">I congratulate the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) and I want to thank him, because my experience throughout the summer, during the many meetings, telephone conference calls and visits, and in reading letters and other correspondence, was that he acted with due diligence on behalf of his constituents. He criticised the Government or the authorities when it was helpful to his constituents and not when it was only helpful to him. He asked for what we could give him but did not ask for things that we could not give him. He behaved as an entirely responsible Member. If I were his constituent, I would be very proud of him. I would not say that I would vote for him, because that would bring party politics into it, but the serious point is that I would like to put that on the record. It says in <i> Dod&#146;s </i><i> Parliamentary Companion</i> that the hon. Gentleman has run six marathons. He must be a Lancastrian to have such stamina. I seriously congratulate him on the role that he played.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="71011-0016.htm_para32"><a name="07101129001201">I said in the Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall that, if ever there was proof of the case for single Member constituency Members of Parliament, it was the flooding events recently. Members of Parliament for constituencies across the political spectrum throughout our country were able to solve problems on behalf of their constituents. I hope that Ministers were able to play their part, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para0"><a name="07101129001202">The Minister for Local Government was appointed as the Minister with responsibility for flood recovery in circumstances that would have made the late Lord Howell proud. He has done a sterling job. He has ensured that the flood recovery effort has carried on. Indeed, I think that we have had seven ministerial meetings, the latest of which was yesterday. Officials and Ministers from across the Whitehall Departments met, long after the national media, although not the local media, had lost interest. I thank also the flood recovery officials group, or FROG&#151;a horrible acronym. It has been working very hard throughout the period; it is still working hard now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para1"><a name="07101129001203">I pay tribute also to the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper). May I, perhaps unusually, answer his points first, because that will form the unscripted bit of my reply? I hope that the hon. Member for Tewkesbury and indeed my hon. Friend the Member for Watford (Claire Ward), the Whip, will allow me to do that, because we have a bit more time than we would otherwise have had.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para2"><a name="07101129001204">The hon. Member for Forest of Dean makes the point about gold command, and he is right. Built into the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 is the philosophy of lessons learned. Part of the approach of the professionals is always to ask for criticism, in order that they can learn from individual circumstances. It has been the endeavour of the Government that support for the civil contingencies procedure should be all-party, which is why we involve Opposition spokespersons in the briefings and so on. It does not work without public resilience and therefore requires an all-party approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para3"><a name="07101129001205">The gold command structure is, on the whole, working. The experience from the floods in June and July was that we were a lot better off with that structure than we would have been without it. That is not to say that we cannot learn lessons, as the hon. Member for Forest of Dean says. I hope that we will be able to persuade him of the virtue of the regional fire control centres. As he knows, 999 is regional already and the idea of the regional centres is to make improvements. The co-ordination of kit and equipment&#151;in this instance, in the floods and at other incidents such as Buncefield&#151;has been made better by the regional control centres. I hope that he will be persuaded over the months of the benefits of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para4"><a name="07101129001206">The hon. Gentleman was gracious enough to thank Ministers for their involvement, and I thank him for that. On the question of money, he again graciously acknowledged the allocation so far. The Minister for Local Government has been incredibly diligent in his approach and is leading the UK request to the EU solidarity fund. We also have the Bellwin scheme&#151;created, I think, by Lord Bellwin. He is the only Minister to have anything complimentary named after him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para5"><a name="07101129001207">The hon. Gentleman made an interesting point about the Valuation Office Agency. That matter came up in one of the conferences with MPs and I shall take it up. If someone is living in a caravan in their own grounds and being charged when they would not be if they were living in a caravan not on their own grounds, that suggests that the hon. Gentleman&#151;I am anxious not to make commitments that I cannot fulfil&#151;has a  <br>

point. The loss of water supply&#151;we discussed that yesterday&#151;is an ongoing issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para6"><a name="07101129001208">The Minister for Local Government, the Secretary of State and other Ministers including myself visited many areas across the country during the unprecedented flooding and saw for ourselves how destructive, distressing and, on many occasions, frightening the flooding has been. The debate gives me the opportunity to echo the words of the hon. Member for Forest of Dean in praising the magnificent response of those affected. No civil resilience planning works without public resilience, which means that having confidence in the authorities is essential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para7"><a name="07101129001209">There are many stories and they will be documented over the years, but I want to put our appreciation on the record. I include in that the utility companies, which have been criticised but whose individual employees went the extra mile, as has been acknowledged. We know that the recovery from the impact of flooding is long and arduous and continues long after the media news reports have finished. I would like to thank BBC local radio&#151;I know that the Secretary of State has done so on record with the BBC&#151;as well as commercial radio, which played an important role. Their compilation of reports was hugely important in giving information, not just in reporting news.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para8"><a name="07101129001210">The good news is that the comprehensive funding package of up to &#163;57 million to assist flood-affected regions and to help those in greatest need, including funding for schools, transport and businesses, has been put in place. Over &#163;2.5 million of flood recovery money has been provided to Gloucestershire and we have given local authorities the flexibility to decide what to do with that money based on local circumstances. That is almost as important as the amount of money given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para9"><a name="07101129001212">In addition, Gloucestershire will be given at least &#163;10 million for highways works and more than &#163;1 million for schools and children&#146;s services affected by the floods. The South West of England Regional Development Agency also has a business recovery scheme. Grants of up to &#163;2,500 are available to small and medium-sized enterprises, and, to date, almost &#163;1m in grants has been allocated to businesses. The generosity of the public and businesses must also be acknowledged; I understand that they have so far donated almost &#163;800,000 to the Gloucestershire flood relief fund, which will help those who have suffered hardship as a result of flooding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para10"><a name="07101129001213">My hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government is leading a co-ordinated effort across Government to ensure that we do as much as we can to assist those in the flooded areas. Our message is that they are not forgotten. A meeting yesterday to look in detail at the problems was attended by officials of more than 25 Departments and agencies, and we continue that work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07101129001214">Let me repeat the point about the exceptional weather. Rainfall in the constituency of the hon. Member for Tewkesbury was the highest since records began in 1766. The flood warning I received in my ministerial box the evening before warned of severe floods in central and southern England, but it is simply not possible to give warnings of conditions of the severity that his constituency suffered&#151;which created dangerous circumstances and, tragically, resulted in loss of life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para12"><a name="07101129001215">Measures are required to respond to and manage sudden increases in water flow: putting in place defences and better drainage; warning of flooding before it happens so people can prepare; and reacting quickly and effectively when it does occur, as it inevitably will from time to time, and our water management infrastructure is overwhelmed beyond its design capacity. We must also have procedures in place to minimise distress, to avoid injury and loss of life, to provide immediate rescue services and help for those whose homes have been made uninhabitable, and to maintain essential services. We witnessed in Gloucestershire the enormous effort people made to operate those procedures successfully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07101129001216">In the longer term, we must look at how we can avoid making the problem worse, especially given the impact climate change will have in terms of rainfall levels and increasing the frequency and intensity of downpours. It is not possible to say that there was a direct causal link between climate change and the events in July in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency, but it is highly likely that there was a connection, and the case for climate change is proven&#151;as, incidentally, the judge in the recent Al Gore film case recognised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para14"><a name="07101129001217">Physical defences will continue to be the most important mechanism that we have for protecting lives and property from the risks of flooding and erosion, but we recognise that building bigger and ever higher is not sustainable. Our cross-Government &#147;Making Space for Water&#148; strategy development programme is looking not only at how we optimise flood management spend, but at other ways in which we can take an in-the-round and sustainable approach to the management of risk from all forms of flooding&#151;from rivers, the sea, groundwater, surface run-off and sewers. We are looking at, and delivering, a broad range of management measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para15"><a name="07101129001218">We are aiming to improve management of the risk nationally by giving the Environment Agency a strategic overview of all forms of flooding in close partnership with local authorities, the water companies and other bodies. The hon. Gentleman made a point about co-ordination. The point is to have co-ordination, rather than the idea&#151;I am not saying that he suggested this&#151;that we give all control and ownership of the problem to one authority. We think better co-ordination is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para16"><a name="07101129001219">We shall look at the review that is being carried out by Sir Michael Pitt.

 I thank the Minister for his generous remarks earlier, which are very much appreciated. On the investigation being carried out by Sir Michael Pitt, will he be able to meet all Gloucestershire Members of Parliament, individually if necessary? The Minister will be aware of the difficulties of getting six Members of Parliament together when it also suits Sir Michael&#146;s diary. He is visiting Gloucestershire next week, when a number of us will not be available to meet him, and it is important that we have a chance to talk to him about the situation.</p>

 If Sir Michael cannot do so, I will listen to the individual Members of Parliament. I will raise this matter with him, and I know that he will be diligent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para17"><a name="07101129001222">The fact that Members of Parliament raised issues with Ministers, whether we are talking about my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) and the Trent basin or the hon. Gentleman and the Severn basin and elsewhere in the country, benefited constituents. Not only were Members able to bring issues of huge importance straight to Ministers&#146; attention, but, more importantly, the team of officials&#151;through the Gold Command structure immediately and through the recovery effort latterly&#151;was able to hear the articulation of people&#146;s frustrations on a range of issues directly from the areas. I was proud of our parliamentary system when that kicked in and did so in a completely non-partisan way. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para18"><a name="07101129001223">The answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is that I shall urge that the approach he spoke of will be taken. If it is not, and probably in any case, we shall want to act at parliamentary level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para19"><a name="07101129001224">We have increased the funding significantly in recent years. I hope that hon. Members welcomed the Secretary of State&#146;s announcement that funding for flood defences will increase to &#163;800 million in 2010-11. We are also working with the Environment Agency to develop a long-term investment strategy, to build on the one that we already have, for river and coastal flood-risk management, looking ahead over the next 20 years to deliver those objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para20"><a name="07101129001225">The hon. Gentleman raised an important point about insurance. I was disappointed to read the comments of the Association of British Insurers earlier in the week. The amount of money spent on flood defences is never enough&#151;I say that openly, although I know that I will be misquoted in certain parts of the media. How does one know how much to spend? One takes a risk assessment, just as insurance companies do. The Government have increased significantly the amount of money that they are spending, but, as the Environment Agency is the first to point out, the lead-in times on projects can be significant. The projects cannot be turned on and off, like water&#151;I hope that you will pardon the pun, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07101129001226">We think that our work with the ABI is constructive, and I know that it reciprocates that view. I assure hon. Members that we have found from our meetings that our shared commitment to the statement of principles that we have with it is secure. There has been no reason to think that insurance will not be available and that the statement of principles will be breached. My understanding is that insurers will use their best efforts to provide flood cover, and will work with customers who take measures to allow insurance to continue, even where they may not be covered by the statement of principles. I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents that they will be able to carry on getting insurance, and that we are committed to that statement of principles.</p>

statement of the Government&#146;s policy on flood defences; I would take more than the time that I could use, were I to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para23"><a name="07101129001228">The hon. Gentleman talked about the critical infrastructure. Clearly, we have to re-examine the defences against flooding. In critical infrastructure we need to include not just the utilities, but some infrastructure that may not be obvious, such as communications infrastructure. I look to Sir Michael&#146;s report on that point. The hon. Gentleman did not suggest that the matter was simple, but let me say that it is not as simple as putting a barrier around a sub-station. As all of us who witnessed the floods know, drainage and the drain system are critical. Often the most dangerous aspect of flooding is the impact that is has on drains. While pumping out from the drains, one is also trying to stop the water coming in. That is true of critical infrastructure. It was the case at Walham. Water treatment works are often, by definition, at the most vulnerable points in the river basin. That is why they are where they are. The hon. Gentleman knows the geography of the Severn basin better than I do, but simply looking at a map shows why it is where it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="71011-0017.htm_para24"><a name="07101129001229">The hon. Gentleman made an important point about bowsers and the co-ordination between utility companies. We need to redouble our efforts to ensure that we have provision there, should it be needed&#151;may goodness forbid it. From the information that I have, I am confident that that worked well, but it could always go horribly wrong. I invite the hon. Gentleman to take part in the review that Sir Michael is undertaking, which I know will be approached consistently.</p>

That is as true in east Yorkshire, south Yorkshire and the east midlands as in his region. We hope that we can continue to work constructively to alleviate the devastation that his constituents suffered.</p>
