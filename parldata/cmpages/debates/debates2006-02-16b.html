 (Lab): What steps his Department is taking to encourage manufacturing and research and development in Coventry, South and the west midlands region; and if he will make a statement. [51995]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60216-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Industry and the Regions  (Alun Michael): </b> 
 The manufacturing strategy has been designed by the Government to encourage manufacturers in all regions to move to high value-added production through the application of science and innovation, world-class practice and skills development. There is a long list of the support given by the Government, directly and through the regional development agency, but to save time I will send that to my hon. Friend.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60216-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Cunningham: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for that answer and I appreciate that there has been considerable investment in the west midlands, but does he understand that we need considerably more, particularly in manufacturing&#151;I am sure that he knows of events with Rover&#151;where there is serious concern about the intentions of Peugeot? What discussions has he had with that company on future investment models?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60216-01_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 I recently met the chief executive of Peugeot, Mr. Folz, to discuss the issues and to stress my concern, which very much reflects that of local Members of Parliament. There was a positive response to the wish of the Government to work closely with the company and an understanding of our concerns and hopes for the future. These are obviously commercial decisions for the company, but we continue to maintain those contacts&#151;for instance, my officials are having a meeting with the company in the next few days.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="60216-01_spnew2"><b> Miss Julie Kirkbride  (Bromsgrove)</b> 
 (Con): Can the Minister give us any information about the prospects of car manufacturing at Longbridge? He will be aware that the plant is now owned by the Chinese, and they have promised that they will reinstate a car business at 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1540</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Longbridge. However, we heard earlier this week that the first six months&#039; option on the land owned by St. Modwen has lapsed. The Chinese can still produce cars if they take up that option, but does the Minister have any information as to whether they intend to do so and to make good their promises?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60216-01_spnew3"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The company is certainly saying that it intends to develop production in the way that has been promised and is publicly maintaining that position.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60216-01_spnew4"><b> Richard Burden  (Birmingham, Northfield)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree that the west midlands has a really good research base&#151;in Birmingham itself there are three excellent universities? All too often, however, the problem is linking that to development and translating it into products. He and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will shortly be considering the report of the MG Rover taskforce, and the key thing will be to ensure that technology corridors work and that that is translated into regeneration in the Longbridge area and the broader west midlands. That will regenerate local communities as well as attract investment to the area, which it so desperately needs.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60216-01_spnew5"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a good point. He is aware that the grant given in recent times has included &#163;32&nbsp;million to the premier automotive research and development centre at Warwick university. He is right that the important thing is to link research and development work to the sharp end of business. There is a very good story to be told by the automotive industry in the west midlands, and we want to support that and see it continue.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60216-01_spnew6"><b> Michael Fabricant  (Lichfield)</b> 
 (Con): Notwithstanding the recent announcement of the closure of GKN in Lichfield, the Minister is right to stress that businesses and manufacturing should concentrate on high-value production, but what can he do about the tax credit system for research and development? Although it is a good system in principle, it is very difficult for smaller high-tech industries to claim R and D tax credits. They vary so much from region to region and inspectors make different value judgments on whether a project is an R and D project. The problem is that there is no consistency in the United Kingdom or ease in applying for such a tax credit.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60216-01_spnew7"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Sometimes it is down to a lack of information and of knowledge on the part of companies. We want to promote such information. For instance, the Manufacturing Advisory Service has generated &#163;212&nbsp;million-worth of added value for companies. We want to spread that knowledge and understanding. Secondly, since its inception, the research and development tax credit has provided &#163;795&nbsp;million in Government support, the majority of which has been for manufacturers. The hon. Gentleman makes the important point that there is a need for greater knowledge and to ensure that it is applied at the sharp end.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60216-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Brian Jenkins  (Tamworth)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend will be fully aware that manufacturers move into and expand in an area only if there is a skilled work force 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1541</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to produce their products. He will also be aware that the west midlands work force have the lowest level of qualifications. Has he had discussions with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills on plans for joined-up government to improve the qualification base in the west midlands?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60216-01_spnew9"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point. We are working closely with colleagues at DFES to ensure that there is a proper focus on the development of skills. One way of ensuring that that happens properly is the work to link the regional development agencies with the skills bodies, particularly through the regional skills strategy. We have, too, the manufacturing academy, which is being developed in a positive way to make sure that the skills at every level through industry are appropriate to its needs. That must be done by focusing on the regional and local need in the way that he suggests. That is very much at the forefront of our minds.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60216-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Alan Duncan  (Rutland and Melton)</b> 
 (Con): Following the disastrous intervention of the right hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers) in the sale of Rover, which unfortunately sealed its fate, it now turns out that the sale of the Longbridge plant to Nanjing was somewhat botched. There is, however, some potentially good news: there is a serious prospect of moving the plant from Longbridge to Coventry so that car production can resume. What can the Minister tell the House about that? <i>[Interruption.]</i> Is he prepared&#151;now that he has had something whispered in his ear&#151;to engage fully with Nanjing and all the investors involved in trying to make that happen and, in doing so, to encourage the project, give grants where appropriate and attend any meetings that might assist the project?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60216-01_spnew11"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman seeks to promote misery and misapprehension by his comments. He should be aware that the Government and colleagues in the Department are fully engaged in all these issues to try to achieve the best possible outcome. As I suggested earlier, there is every indication that the company intends to pursue the intended prospects. He referred to employment, and he is surely aware that it is at virtually its highest level for the past 15&nbsp;years.

 (Con): If he will make a statement on his Department&#039;s policy on increasing the UK&#039;s share of international trade and inward investment. [51997]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60216-01_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Trade  (Ian Pearson): </b> 
 Overseas trade is an essential part of the UK&#039;s prosperity. UK Trade & Investment helps companies in the UK to develop their businesses internationally. UKTI also works to attract high quality inward investment and the UK is the No. 1&nbsp;location in Europe for inward investment.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60216-01_spnew12"><b> Andrew Selous: </b> 
 The United Kingdom&#039;s 2005&nbsp;trade deficit was not only the largest ever at &#163;47&nbsp;billion, it was a fifth larger than the year before. Even within the European Union, we are running a trade deficit in goods of some &#163;3&nbsp;billion a month. Do the Government think 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1542</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that we, as a country, can go on indefinitely importing more than we export? Even Belgium sells more to India than we do.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60216-01_spnew13"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 The UK&#039;s trade performance with India is growing strongly and it is absolutely right that we do more to trade with China, India and other emerging markets. Our trade deficit is about 2&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product. The United States trade deficit is 6&nbsp;per cent. of GDP. In 1989, under a Conservative Government, our trade deficit was 5.1&nbsp;per cent. Our current account deficit is forecast to widen a little this year, but it is easily sustainable.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60216-01_spnew14"><b> Rob Marris  (Wolverhampton, South-West)</b> 
 (Lab): In terms of international trade, two growing areas are medical technology, and pollution control equipment and environmental control materials and so on. What is the Department doing to encourage UK companies to invest, research and export in those two sectors?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60216-01_spnew15"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to point out that those are two important areas. Certainly, with regard to countries such as China, health care and pollution technology are recognised as key priority areas where we have expertise in the UK in our research base and in many of our companies. We are actively supporting those companies to win business contracts in China. It is not just China, but India, Brazil and other emerging markets where we need to up our economic performance in such areas and in other sectors as well.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60216-01_spnew16"><b> Peter Luff  (Mid-Worcestershire)</b> 
 (Con): I think that the Minister said two slightly contradictory things. In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous), he said that our trade performance in India was very good. Now, quite rightly, he has just said that we need to up our game. Has he seen the recent survey from KPMG that suggests that British businesses are retreating to the comfort blanket of north America and Europe and are largely ignoring the opportunities in the emerging and developing economies of the world? What can the Government do to re-engage those companies and help them to rediscover the sense of enterprise and adventure that created the wealth that we now enjoy in this country?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60216-01_spnew17"><b> Ian Pearson: </b>

<a name="60216-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">We need to improve continuously trade performance, just as our manufacturing and other industries need to improve continuously. I am aware of the study to which the hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1543</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that companies already in those countries and doing well in the financial services industry are given further stimulus from the Department of Trade and Industry?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60216-01_spnew19"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend is right to point out the importance of the service sector to the UK economy and to our international trade. He knows that Lloyd&#039;s of London managed to enter the Chinese market. The deal was sealed during President Hu Jintao&#039;s state visit to the UK last year. We are doing a great deal on financial services in both China and India, working with the Mayor of London and a number of others to open up the insurance, re-insurance and financial services markets. These are areas where the UK has a great deal of expertise. Public-private partnerships are another aspect of financial services where we have tremendous expertise, which we can trade internationally. There is a great deal of work going on, particularly in China and India and through the joint economic trade relationships that we have with those two countries.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="60216-01_spnew26"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire has the done the House and the country a favour by drawing attention to our record trade deficit, up 25&nbsp;per cent. on last year. Yet at the same time the United Kingdom&#039;s main trade and investment body, UKTI, has had its budget cut this year by &#163;6&nbsp;million. The Government&#039;s obsession with fragmentation and dilution to the rural development agencies and the devolved Assemblies is blurring our trade effort throughout the world. Is it not a fact that UK plc&#039;s trade and inward investment effort could and should be a great deal more effective?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="60216-01_spnew27"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman tried to get angry, but the simple fact is that UKTI has a budget of &#163;280&nbsp;million per annum. It helps companies in over 100&nbsp;markets worldwide through its network of posts and staff. It provides a range of services. According to the most recent trade figures, our export volumes are 9.7&nbsp;per cent. higher than in the same period last year. Value for money is important to the Government, and &#163;65&nbsp;million was spent on four main business support programmes. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1544</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>That helped 6,000&nbsp;companies and produced &#163;1.1&nbsp;billion in net additional benefit. By any measure, that must be good value for the taxpayer&#039;s money.

 (Lab): I hear what my hon. Friend says about the increasing trade with India and China, but does he believe we are doing as well as our competitors? For example, are we encouraging joint ventures at the rate at which we ought to be doing so, and are we encouraging larger companies to piggy-back smaller companies into those markets&#151;a measure with which the Germans were very successful in the mid-1990s? Are such initiatives being taken up by UKTI?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o31"><a name="60216-01_spnew29"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes several good points, and I can assure him that UKTI is taking them up. Our performance is lagging behind in relation to India&#151;we should be doing better. We have strong historical and cultural ties with India, and we are not leveraging those to maximum benefit. I am dissatisfied with that, and I want us to make more progress. We have made great strides with China in recent years. There is a bumper crop of exchanges at top levels. We have formalised relationships through the joint economic trade committee, and that is bearing fruit. Exports to China are up massively. Two-way trade and investment is growing strongly, and I am sure that it will continue to do so in future years.

<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="60216-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Alan Johnson): </b> 
 The recent increases in energy prices are causing great concern, particularly in relation to their impact on industrial competitiveness and fuel poverty. Prices are rising mainly as a result of increasing oil prices, leading to higher wholesale gas prices, and higher international coal prices. I can assure the House of our determination to reduce the impact on those least able to cope.

<p><a name="st_o33"><a name="60216-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Amess: </b> 
 As the sponsor of the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill, now enacted, which committed the Government to eliminating fuel poverty within a set period, does the Secretary of State share my concern that gas prices have increased by 38&nbsp;per cent. and electricity prices by 30&nbsp;per cent. since October 2003, pushing another 200,000&nbsp;people into fuel poverty? What does he intend to do to address that very worrying trend?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o34"><a name="60216-02_spnew1"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to raise this issue. I congratulate him on his sponsorship of the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill in 2000. Fuel poverty is the most serious consequence of rising gas prices. We have had great success in pulling more than 4&nbsp;million people out of fuel poverty, but the fact that it is defined as fuel taking up more than 10&nbsp;per cent. of one&#039;s income automatically means that people on fixed incomes, particularly pensioners, will get pushed back into fuel poverty, so those figures are bound to rise.

There will be a total of more than &#163;800&nbsp;million. We need to ensure that elderly people use the helplines that are set up to give them advice on what to do. We also need to give them the confidence to switch suppliers, because doing that, in our competitive environment, can save up to &#163;60&nbsp;per year, which is significant for the kinds of people who are particularly affected.

Does he accept the Energy Watch estimate that by the end of this year 3&nbsp;million households will be in fuel poverty compared with just 1.2&nbsp;million in 2003? We have a combination of a lack of liberalisation of markets and a failure of Government policy to eradicate fuel poverty. Energy Watch points to myriad different schemes&#151;

 I agree with the comment made by the chairman of Ofgem this morning. Opposition Members claim that Government policy on fuel poverty has failed, but our record is excellent, and hon. Members on both sides of the House should commend our taking 4&nbsp;million pensioners and disabled people out of fuel poverty. May I put the increase in prices in context, Mr. Speaker? The issue involves not only the UK, but Germany, where wholesale gas prices have increased by 75&nbsp;per cent., and Denmark, where they have increased by 50&nbsp;per cent. The central questions are how we help the fuel poor tackle

<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1546</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the problem and how we liberalise the EU market, which, as the hon. Gentleman has rightly said, is a major factor in the problems that we face this winter and next.

Will the Langeled pipeline, which will come on stream in 18&nbsp;months&#039; time, affect the price of gas? What talks has the Secretary of State held with industry on that development and on eradicating fuel poverty in households across the country?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o41"><a name="60216-02_spnew8"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to raise that issue. Langeled will lead to a 16&nbsp;per cent. increase in our gas supplies. Next year, we will have the gas pipeline from Easington to Norway and the new BBL interconnector with the Netherlands, so the problem should ease. If we are to have a mature debate, however, we must accept that the days of plentiful, cheap, indigenous energy are gone&#151;we can probably wave goodbye to the prices that we enjoyed for many years. Our position is the same as that of almost every other G7&nbsp;country&#151;only Canada has sufficient indigenous supplies to be a net exporter of energy, and, like every other major economy, we will become a net importer of energy. Perhaps reflection on the days of cheap, indigenous energy being gone for good will focus us on energy efficiency, on which we can do a lot more.

Eighteen months ago, British small businesses paid 12&nbsp;per cent. less than French small businesses for their energy, but now they are paying 15&nbsp;per cent. more. Companies renewing their energy contracts this spring are being told to get ready for price increases between 60&nbsp;and 100&nbsp;per cent. The Government wasted a unique opportunity during their EU presidency to make European energy markets more efficient. Now that businesses and consumers are paying the price, does the Secretary of State understand why they are so angry?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o43"><a name="60216-02_spnew10"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I hope that we are not going to get a series of displays of superficial anger from Opposition Front Benchers. If the hon. Gentleman wants knockabout, I have got all the figures: in the nine years since 1997, the average price for energy was 23&nbsp;per cent. lower than in the nine years before 1997, and UK domestic gas prices have only just returned to their 1990&nbsp;level. We have a good record on energy and climate change. On the problems that companies face now, it would be disastrous if we were to interfere in the market, and we must ensure that we have the proper liberalisation of the EU energy market. The hon. Gentleman has said that we wasted the six months of our presidency, but it is a bizarre idea that having the presidency allowed us to click our fingers and make everything change. We have put in place mechanisms to change the situation, and I hope to provide further details later in answering the question tabled by the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry).

<p><a name="st_o44"><a name="60216-02_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Energy  (Malcolm Wicks): </b> 
 By 2010, Britain&#039;s gas market will have received some &#163;10&nbsp;billion of investment in new gas storage and import projects. In addition, we intend to bring forward legislation to facilitate innovative new offshore storage and supply projects. We are also working to ensure that there are no unnecessary non-commercial barriers in the existing regulations to new onshore gas storage projects.

<p><a name="st_o45"><a name="60216-02_spnew11"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 The Minister knows that we are playing our part in Wales with the new Pembrokeshire facility. He will recognise that we need a much wider, balanced portfolio of energy products. What future does he envisage in the energy review for marine tidal energy off Wales, coal production in Wales and clean coal technology? We have a great part to play but it must be wider than one confined to imported gas.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o46"><a name="60216-02_spnew12"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The Government are investing heavily in research and development for marine tidal, which is part of a new range of technologies that we need to take seriously. On clean coal technology, we have a fund of some &#163;35&nbsp;million for carbon abatement projects. We have, in principle, much indigenous British coal and, with clean coal technology, there should be a future for it. That is a feature of our energy review.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o48"><a name="60216-02_spnew14"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 I do not believe that the Secretary of State or I have been rescued by the mighty Atlantic. There were always Jeremiahs about this winter, who will want to look at what they said come April. Supply is plentiful but we recognise the problem of prices for intensive users. As we speak, there is plenty of gas in storage. Although we are not complacent, with the Langeled pipeline and the rest coming on stream later this year and more storage projects, we face a better future than our experience this winter suggested.

 (Lab): My hon. Friend said that gas supplies are plentiful and that we have plenty of gas storage, which tends to suggest that problems of supply were not the cause of the quadrupling of industrial short-term gas prices in November, which continues to affect the market. Heren Energy forecasts a short-term gas price of around 70p per therm this summer compared with 40p in the same period last year. Will my hon. Friend examine gas trading, bearing in mind that the biggest buyer of industrial gas in this country is Barclays bank? He must investigate the trading aspects of gas.

<br>&nbsp;<br>supply and the Jeremiahs were wrong, intensive users, usually buying short term and often on the daily spot market, paid very high prices. The commercial sector needs to reflect on that and so do we. As the Secretary of State said, things are changing and the days of cheap prices are probably gone for ever but there is more supply capacity into Great Britain and that should ease the position, albeit in the context of a huge global demand, not least from China, for the world&#039;s energy.

 We have not only a policy but practice. Next winter, Britain&#039;s import capacity will be double today&#039;s figure. By winter 2009&#150;10, it could be trebled. Investment in new gas stocks is increasing all the time. We will have more capacity for storage next winter and the following winter than previously. The issue that the hon.

</p>


<p><a name="st_o53"><a name="60216-03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Barry Gardiner): </b> 
 The UK is widely recognised as one of the lead countries in the world on intellectual property enforcement. Through the Patent Office, the Government have implemented the national IP crime strategy. It put in place a multi-agency IP crime group, involving Government, public enforcement bodies&#151;including police, trading standards, Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs&#151;and key industry sectors to deliver better-targeted enforcement action. In December 2005, we carried out the first multi-agency operation at Wembley market in London, where more than &#163;1.5&nbsp;million of counterfeit and pirate goods were seized. I pay particular tribute to Brent police and Brent and Harrow trading standards for leading the action. There were a number of arrests, which are being pursued to prosecution by trading standards and the police.
</p>

</p>





<p><a name="st_o55"><a name="60216-03_spnew1"><b> Barry Gardiner: </b> 
 The whole House is aware of my hon. Friend&#039;s strong support for the ceramics industry, with which his constituency has long been proudly associated. He is right to point out the threat that the industry faces from counterfeit goods, particularly from China and the far east. We have developed specific training programmes to ensure that Chinese enforcement agencies develop strategies to stop such infractions at source. Last year, the Chinese Government reduced the threshold for offences there, and in the past year there has been a 23&nbsp;per cent. rise in

<p><a name="st_o57"><a name="60216-03_spnew3"><b> Barry Gardiner: </b> 
 As I said earlier to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello), this country has one of the proudest records on the protection of intellectual property rights. We have been working with our partners in Europe to develop that further as an EU-wide strategy, because this is an issue that all developed countries are facing. As we seek to make the UK the hub of the intellectual creative industries, not only for Europe but for the world, it will be increasingly important to have provisions in place to protect not only our ceramics market but the music industry and all the other creative industries for which this country is so well positioned.

 I hear what my hon. Friend says. The clean-up of our waste legacy is one of the big challenges that we face; in my judgment, it should have been tackled before now. We now have in place the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, and an expert committee will be advising us in the summer on the equally important issue of a final repository for nuclear waste. Once both of those are in place, we shall be in a position to discuss with the public&#151;should we need to, and should that be our decision&#151;the future of civil nuclear power in this country.

 The Work and Families Bill builds on the strong foundations of support that we have already introduced for working families. It proposes to extend maternity and adoption pay, give fathers a new right to additional paternity leave, and extend the flexible working law to carers for adults.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o84"><a name="60216-04_spnew8"><b> Mrs. Dean: </b> 
 I welcome the proposals, and the progress that has already been made with family-friendly policies. What analysis has my hon. Friend conducted of the impact of maternity and paternity rights on both industry and families?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o85"><a name="60216-04_spnew9"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 Companies that take account of the need for flexible working and recognise that they need to draw from the whole pool of talent, men and women, generally do better. Keeping an employee in work following maternity leave is often far less expensive than recruiting and training someone new.

<p><a name="st_o87"><a name="60216-04_spnew11"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 We take the issue of carers&#039; rights very seriously in the Work and Families Bill. We have issued a consultation document on the definition of carers. That is obviously connected with the issue of respite care, and discussions are ongoing. Respite care, along with flexible working, obviously helps those with caring responsibilities to go on working, which is often in their interests and those of the people for whom they care.

 We introduced three years ago the right for parents of children aged under six, and of disabled children aged under 18, to request flexible working. Flexible working covers a range of areas, including job sharing, and the right to request it has proved very successful for employers and employees. So the encouragement is there to look at all types of flexible working, including job sharing.

 We consulted widely on the issues with which the Work and Families Bill deals&#151;it is being led by the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, my hon.

We have decided not to extend the right to request flexible working to families with children aged over six at this stage, but to consider introducing that right on a steady basis. The costs associated with introducing flexible working arrangements are minimal&#151;much less than those arising from having to recruit new employees.

 I agree with the hon. Lady that it is important to get the balance right, which is why we have proceeded at the rate that we have. We have not rushed into these matters, and we have consulted business. She will know that small businesses are often the best at introducing flexible working; indeed, they often adopt such practices so that they can ensure that their small number of employees can cover the work, and that they can get the right people in. There are skill shortages in many fields, and they are often the ones in which women are under-represented. So getting more women into the labour market in those fields will help such businesses, rather than preventing them from making progress.

: When the Government will publish their report on the pension position of women. [52016]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o94"><a name="60216-05_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Women  (Tessa Jowell): </b> 
 Last November, the Government published an analysis of women&#039;s pensions. The evidence showed that 30&nbsp;per cent. of women retiring today are entitled to the full basic state pension, but that by 2025, on average, more than 90&nbsp;per cent. of both men and women will be entitled to the full basic state pension&#151;a figure that reflects the much larger number of women in work.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o95"><a name="60216-05_spnew0"><b> Adam Price: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for her reply. The Government should be congratulated on the detailed analysis set out in that report. I hope that such reports will become an annual event, until we get genuine pensions equality between men and women. Are the Government finally going to scrap the 25&nbsp;per cent. rule whereby women with less than 10&nbsp;years-worth of contributions do not qualify for the full pension?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o96"><a name="60216-05_spnew1"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his question and for his congratulating us on the approach that we are taking to one of the most intractable issues that we face. No decisions have yet been taken about the final settlement. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions will in due course publish proposals, in response to the Department for Work and Pensions&#039; own evidence and that of the Pensions Commission. I should point out that fairer pensions for women is one of our key objectives, given the scale of such inequality and the risk of poverty in old age that too many women still face today.

 As a member of the ministerial group on human trafficking, I work closely with Home Office colleagues to ensure that provision for victims is sensitive to women&#039;s needs.

<p><a name="st_o103"><a name="60216-05_spnew7"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 I pay tribute to my hon. Friend&#039;s interest in this very important matter. She will know that the Government were involved when the action plan was drawn up, and that we are considering moving towards signing it. Our concern is that automatic periods could act as a pull to bogus asylum claims, but we are looking at the experience of other countries. We consider all victims on their merits: the cooling-off periods are not automatic but are on the basis of each person&#039;s need.

 (Con): The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) is absolutely right. The Council of Europe convention on human trafficking was agreed in May 2005, and no fewer than 24&nbsp;of the council&#039;s 46&nbsp;members have signed up to it. Therefore, will the Minister tell the House what discussions she has had with the Home Secretary in respect of why the Government still feel unable to sign up to the convention, which would provide minimum standards of protection and treatment for all trafficked people?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o105"><a name="60216-05_spnew9"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 The ongoing discussions on this matter are very detailed. The UK took a lead and made human trafficking one of the key issues of our EU presidency. We are enormously concerned about it, and are consulting on our UK action plan. As I said in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh), we are looking at this issue. We consider every case on its merits, and women are given time to reflect. Our concern is that an automatic period may act as a pull factor in a way that would be unhelpful to real victims. However, there is no end date for the period in which the UK can sign up to the convention. That is under active consideration, and many other measures are in place to deal with the terrible problem of human trafficking. We are having great success in finding the people involved in it, stopping it happening, and dealing appropriately with the victims.

I recognise that there is a requirement for reorganisation in a number of areas&#151;I am tempted to say that he has mentioned all of them&#151;but it is important that such changes continue to deliver effective services to his constituents, my constituents and people across the country. Those reform processes are a necessary consequence of the significant investment that has been made in each of the services that he mentioned. The country rightly expects more money to be made available for those services, but it also expects that money to be used efficiently, wisely and successfully. That is why those reorganisations are necessary.

Friend&#039;s observations about Afghanistan. Far too much of the Afghan economy is already based on the production of opium, and it is vital that we persuade farmers there to adopt alternative livelihoods so that, in the future, Afghanistan is not a country that is totally dependent on the production of a harmful drug.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I am grateful to you for allowing me to make a point of order, of which I have given you prior notice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_43">In recent years, the Government have been encouraging&#151;some would say bullying&#151;benefit recipients to take benefits through direct payment to banks or through a Post Office card. I was involved in that debate and I cannot remember at any stage receiving a letter or reading anything in Parliament to say that the card was anything but permanent. I even had a constructive meeting&#151;I took one of my postmasters&#151;with the Minister for Pensions Reform, who was then the Minister responsible, and I cannot remember anything being mentioned to suggest that the card was anything but permanent.
</p>

<a name="stpa_44">That was until yesterday, when we had a spirited debate in Westminster Hall and the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the hon.

It is a matter of the utmost importance. The facts, very simply, are these, and I am worried about them. Charles Munyaneza, who is a former Rwandan Government official suspected of the orchestration of the mass killing of civilians in Rwanda, has already been publicly exposed&#151;it is not before the courts&#151;as living in Bedford. It is not disputed that in 2002&nbsp;the Government gave him unlimited leave to stay in this country. The international criminal tribunal on Rwanda, headed by the UN, has already indicated that it would provide to Britain all the evidence that it has on the man if Britain wishes to bring him to justice.

<a name="stpa_58">The order adds nearly &#163;3.5&nbsp;billion to Government spending. It tackles poverty by helping those most in need and supports our ambitious programme to renew welfare and pensions. Since 1997, we have taken decisive measures to address the pressing problems that we inherited. Through winter fuel payments, free TV licences for over-75s and basic state pension increases, we have helped all pensioners. From April 2006, the basic state pension will be &#163;84.25&nbsp;for a single person and &#163;134.75&nbsp;for couples, which is a real-terms increase of 8&nbsp;per cent. since 1997. By targeting extra resources on the least well-off, in particular through pension credit, we have taken nearly 2&nbsp;million pensioners out of absolute poverty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_59">The pension credit guarantee will rise in line with earnings so that even the least well-off pensioners can share in Britain&#039;s rising prosperity.

<p><a name="st_95"><a name="60216-12_spnew7"><b> Mr. Graham Stuart  (Beverley and Holderness) (Con):</b> 
 Is the Minister comfortable with the fact that, according to Government figures, about 1.5&nbsp;million pensioners are not claiming their due pension credit? NGOs that specialise in looking after older people have suggested that the poorest and most in need are not getting the pension credit. Will the Minister re-examine his claim in that light?
</p>





<p><a name="st_96"><a name="60216-12_spnew8"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 We continue to be extremely active in promoting the take-up of pension credit. There has been a large increase in take-up since pension credit succeeded the minimum income guarantee, and it is clear that those who stand to gain the most from it are now overwhelmingly in receipt of it. The hon. Gentleman is right that a significant number of people&#151;in particular, those who are entitled to the saving credit only&#151;are not yet in receipt of it, which is why we have introduced a big programme of targeted mail shots and home visits to ensure that people take up their entitlement.

<a name="stpa_60">As a result of changes since 1997, we will spend some &#163;10&nbsp;billion extra on pensioners in 2006&#150;07, almost half of which will go to the least well-off third of pensioners. If we had merely increased the basic state pension in line with earnings, the least well-off third of pensioners would be on average &#163;30&nbsp;a week worse off. Today, we are in an almost unprecedented position in which pensioners are no more likely to be poor than any other group in society. We have succeeded in breaking the historic link between being old and being poor, an achievement that I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the House will celebrate.
</p>

<a name="60216-12_para10">
<a name="stpa_61">We have made other important changes to pensions policy since 1997. We have set a framework within which there are personal pension products that are economic for people on low and medium incomes.

 I appreciate the nobility of the Government&#039;s aim of improving pensioner incomes, but does the Minister understand the concerns of thousands of pensioners in my constituency who see the system as a disincentive to save?

The report and the debate give us the chance to build a consensus for an enduring pensions settlement. That is our aim and I hope that the hon.

 I can give my hon. Friend that assurance. It was a scandal that so many pensioners were on a means-tested benefit of &#163;69&nbsp;a week in 1997. We must not head in that direction, where a large number of pensioners were below the generally recognised poverty threshold. That will be a key criterion in our package of reforms, and I am sure that she has been encouraged by Lord Turner&#039;s comments about maintaining the pension credit.

 I hope that the hon. Gentleman will welcome the fact that the basic state pension has been uprated well above inflation since 1997&#151;by 8&nbsp;per cent. in real terms. That is in sharp contrast to what his party did in government. There was no real-terms increase in the basic state pension between 1980&nbsp;and 1987, except for a single year&#151;the year in which VAT was added to fuel&#151;in which it was increased by 50p a week on top of inflation. That year is vividly recalled by pensioners and, indeed, by us all. I hope that the hon.

It is going up and up, and the Minister knows exactly why that is happening. It is because of the endless fiddling by Complexity Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The question that the Secretary of State must answer is whether he is going to engage with us in this process of reform. He hit the heights of uncharity when, on 9&nbsp;January, he said that he did not believe that we had anything to contribute to the debate on incapacity benefit and welfare reform. Well, we do, and we are going to scrutinise his proposals.

<a name="stpa_82">In this debate on social security uprating, delivering more support and help to those in need, and giving support to those who want to work but are being prevented from doing so, it would be appropriate to remind ourselves that the Green Paper on incapacity benefit reform&#151;which, we hear, is to become a flagship welfare reform Bill in this Session&#151;comes from a long line of well-meaning attempts from the Government. I counted them up; since 1997, we have had six Secretaries of State and 28&nbsp;White or Green Papers.

<a name="stpa_83">On close examination, the Green Paper announced in January was found to contain vagaries and obfuscations that give cause for concern, even for a Green Paper.

<p><a name="st_115"><a name="60216-14_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ruffley: </b> 
 I am grateful for that guidance, Madam Deputy Speaker, but I took the trouble to look up the last four years&#039; debates on the uprating, and it was my understanding that they roved quite widely. However, I shall observe your strictures. We are talking about benefit recipients, and the benefits that they receive, including incapacity benefit, which is the subject of the order. We are also talking about jobseeker&#039;s allowance and the allowances available under the new deal, so, if I may, I shall continue with my remarks, but not specifically in relation to the Green Paper.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_84">The proposals for change and reform will affect some of the people who are affected by the order today. It is important to remember that the Green Paper is very slack when it comes to detailed costings. The help that people need is not going to be delivered from existing budgets. Benefit recipients&#151;who are the subject of the first order&#151;will perhaps benefit under the extension of the pathways to work programme, which will be funded from existing budgets, but from 2008, there is no indication of the commitment of resources that the Government will need to deliver the help and support that benefit recipients need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_85">Another issue related to those who will be affected by the order is the release of the labour market statistics yesterday by the Office for National Statistics. They showed a sharp rise of 17&nbsp;per cent. in long-term unemployment over the past 12&nbsp;months. It was particularly noticeable that 18&nbsp;to 24-year-olds were the hardest hit, with an increase in youth long-term unemployment of more than 28&nbsp;per cent. in the past year. The figures also show that the number of economically inactive 18&nbsp;to 24-year-olds is now more than one fifth higher than it was in May 1997. The Chancellor has claimed that he would not be satisfied until he had

<p>
<a name="60216-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_86">However, yesterday&#039;s figures clearly show that he is nowhere near to achieving his goal. His welfare policies&#151;the present ones and the proposed ones&#151;have a long way to go before they deliver for young people. The Government must re-evaluate their approach to long-term unemployment and the economically inactive.

<a name="stpa_87">I must now anticipate the question that I know Labour Members will ask me. It concerns our stance on the new deal. The future loyal Opposition&#151;the Labour party&#151;are keen on saying that we want to scrap the new deal and all its works. Let me place on record, so that it is absolutely clear and there is no misunderstanding, that the new,

Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), says unambiguously that the Conservatives, now and when in government, believe in active intervention to get people who can work and who want to work back into work. The principle of the new deal, and of a Government backing welfare-to-work policies, is not in doubt, and I hope that Labour Members will be mature enough to accept that we are all on the same page in wanting to help people back into work&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Hon. Members ask whether I would keep the new deal. The straightforward answer is that every single commitment made in a manifesto is for the lifetime of a Parliament. If the party that put forward those proposals in the manifesto was not fortunate enough to get into government, the basic laws of politics mean that that manifesto would fall.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-14_para10">
<a name="stpa_88">My right hon. Friend the Member for Witney has already said that we will be doing patient, long-term policy work on a range of policies over the next 18&nbsp;months, but let me say that we have grave concerns about how the Labour new deal is configured. Let me tell the House why. We have yet to see any proper evaluation to describe and detail the cost to the taxpayer and to Government budgets for every new job created. Research published by John Van Reenen of the Centre for Economic Performance in April 2004&nbsp;said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;The jobs created are much smaller than the total numbers of young people who have gone through the New Deal and into jobs . . . This is mainly because the majority of those people would have attained employment even in the absence of the New Deal.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-14_para11">
<a name="stpa_89">It is difficult to judge from the evidence available how many people have got jobs because of the new deal and how many would have got jobs in any event. In short, the statistics released by the Department for Work and Pensions in, for instance, &quot;New Deal for Lone Parents: Statistics to end of August 2005&quot; show that 42&nbsp;per cent. went into employment, either sustained or not sustained; 13&nbsp;per cent. went into employment and in-work benefit; and 37&nbsp;per cent. went on to income support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-14_para12">
<a name="stpa_90">It seems to us that those figures could be improved. Whether we improve them by revamping or recasting the new deal, we promise the House this: we will do better&#151;

Is he aware that in my constituency just 30&nbsp;per cent. of the people who go on to the new deal for lone parents get sustained, unsubsidised employment and that the number of young people who are on a repeated cycle of going through the new deal and ending up back on benefits is scandalous? To be lectured in the way that we have by the Minister today&#151;as if right is solely on the Government side of the House and that we have no concern for people in that predicament&#151;is appalling and flies in the face of the facts.

<a name="stpa_91">Can the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) confirm that he thinks that focusing help on young people, lone parents and older people in the way that the new deal has is the right approach to helping people back into work?
</p>





<p><a name="st_123"><a name="60216-15_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ruffley: </b> 
 I am afraid that the Minister really needs to pay closer attention to what we are saying. It is not a change of policy to make it clear that manifesto commitments from last year do not subsist for the four years after the general election. He should grow up, or maybe do A-level constitutional history, and understand that we are going through a policy process. Nothing I said suggested that we are endorsing the new deal. In fact, I went out of my way to describe how it is defective, how it needs to be improved and how it does not represent value for money for the taxpayer as currently configured.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_92">There is clearly a huge chasm between what the Labour Government are saying on the results of the new deal and what can be delivered by greater and more effective use of the third sector and private sector delivery. The fact is that the Government have failed utterly with the new deal as configured to get enough people into work&#151;sustainable work&#151;as quickly as they would like to get into work. However, I shall return to the burden of my argument. I had to put to rest a canard that the Minister was trying unjustly to lay on us. There has been no policy change in that respect.

<a name="stpa_93">On pensions and the income that our pensioners enjoy, will the Minister tell us what consideration he is giving to uprating the basic state pension in line with earnings?

<p>
<a name="60216-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_94">Lord Turner&#039;s proposals contain an important central conclusion, which is that means-testing for pensioners should be reduced. Nearly half of all pensioners depend on means-tested benefits, which is an increase over the past eight years. By 2050, that proportion will have risen to more than 70&nbsp;per cent.
</p>





<p><a name="st_124"><a name="60216-15_spnew7"><b> Mr. Stuart: </b>

<p><a name="st_125"><a name="60216-15_spnew8"><b> Mr. Ruffley: </b> 
 As my hon. Friend says from a sedentary position, it is indeed disgraceful. I repeat that by 2050&nbsp;the proportion will have risen to more than 70&nbsp;per cent. if Government policy is continued. Pension credit is not being claimed by 1.7&nbsp;million pensioners who are entitled to it, and the latest figures show that despite all the money that is being spent on advertising and the no doubt sterling efforts of the Pension Service, take-up does not seem to be shifting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_95">Another question for the Minister, which relates directly to the orders, involves the confusion introduced by the Chancellor to the debate in relation to the pension credit link to earnings, or is it prices? We know that the pension credit is linked to earnings in uprating terms until 2008, but in a rather transparent attempt to torpedo Lord Turner&#039;s proposals, even before they saw the light of day, the Chancellor told Lord Turner

</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_98">The Minister is rightly engaging in the rhetoric of long-termism and of patient solutions. Lots of hard work needs to be done to plan for the long term. On pensions, who could disagree with that? But, it would be useful to know about the short term, not so much the long term, as 2008&nbsp;is not far away. We look forward to an answer to what is a fairly simple question. Many pensioners listening to the debate and those who hear about it subsequently will want an answer.

However, given the confused approach that the Government have demonstrated in relation to Turner, with the Treasury saying one thing and the Department for Work and Pensions saying another, and the gaping holes in the welfare reform proposals of the January Green paper, the major part of which will not take effect until 2008&nbsp;in any event, my concern is that we might not see any change in the next 12&nbsp;months, and that when we debate the issue again, too many of our fellow citizens will too often have to rely on benefits.

About 1.7&nbsp;million are not claiming the pension credit&#151;mentioned by the Minister, among others&#151;to which they are entitled. Moreover, figures released last month by the Office for National Statistics suggest that about 2&nbsp;million more pensioners are not claiming the council tax benefit to which they are entitled. I should like to know what further efforts the Government will make to promote take-up of those two benefits.

Given the lack of take-up of some benefits, including pension credit, that approach means a continuing increase in the relative poverty experienced by the poorest pensioners. It should also be borne in mind that if the Government maintain their current policy, means-testing will extend to about 70&nbsp;per cent.&#151;some say 80&nbsp;per cent.&#151;of pensioners by 2050.

The system is imperfect, and that is one of its chief flaws. The more people depend on means-testing, the larger will be the group who are left in poverty through non-claiming. The growth in means-testing, which is not altered but perpetuated by the orders, also makes the benefits system more complex and gives people a powerful disincentive to save for themselves.

 If pensioners living in remote areas find that because of Government policy their pensions increase only in line with average prices, and if because of Government policy their local post offices have to close and they face a longer journey to collect their pensions, they will face greater financial burdens as a result of Government policy. That is not reflected in the pension increase that the Government are giving them. If the Government adopt a policy of wholesale post office closures, surely they should give pensioners in remote rural areas larger increases because of the greater distances that they must travel.

 My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. If, as a result of the Government&#039;s policy, the means of access to benefits and pensions&#151;local post offices in rural areas or deprived urban areas&#151;is removed, the uprating should include an amount that makes it possible for people to gain access to those benefits and pensions. Otherwise, while there may be a superficial uprating, increased costs will mean an overall downrating for those people. I hope that the Minister will address that issue, and particularly the question of when people living in such areas might lose the ability to access benefits in the manner of their choosing.

The Government estimate that the pathways to work project costs some &#163;400&nbsp;per claimant. Based on the latest annual figures for people commencing incapacity benefit claims, it would take some &#163;220&nbsp;million a year to fund a national roll-out at the same level.

<p>
<a name="60216-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_125">Some important issues need to be considered. For example, the current disability living allowance does not provide support for the communication needs that many disabled people have. Some 4,000&nbsp;disabled schoolchildren with such needs have been fortunate enough to receive support from the communication aids project, which is funded by the Department for Education and Skills. Unfortunately, such funding ends in March and the Department has no plans to renew it. A review of disability living allowance could&#151;indeed, should&#151;consider whether support for communication needs should be given, in addition to support for care and mobility.

<p>

<a name="stpa_126">In his opening remarks, the Minister pointed out that disability living allowance applies whether one is in work or out of work, and it is true that that is one of that benefit&#039;s potential strengths. However, in the experience of many organisations that help benefit recipients back into work, a return to work can often quickly trigger a new review of entitlement to disability living allowance. That issue needs to be addressed.

<a name="60216-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_127">The uprating of benefits inevitably increases the sums lost to the Exchequer through error and fraud in the benefit system.

<a name="stpa_128">in this regard. On errors, the picture is even more unclear. In fact, it seems likely that the number of benefit payment errors is increasing. They now account for more losses than does fraud: some &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion, according to the PAC&#039;s estimate. In a recent debate, the Government pointed out that the figure is actually &#163;1.7&nbsp;billion. Perhaps the Minister will give the House the Government&#039;s latest estimate of the amount that will be lost through errors in the benefit system as a result of the upratings before us today.

The Government came to power in 1997&nbsp;promising radical and ambitious reform, and the Prime Minister vowed that the cost of what he called failure would be reduced in the first five years of the Labour Government. In the event, the cost of failure has risen since the Government came to office.

<a name="stpa_135">The backdrop to any uprating of benefit is the general state of the economy. In 1997, the incoming Labour Government had an opportunity to reform the welfare state that was without parallel since its formation. We all support the welfare state if it gives people dignity rather than means-testing, and relieves poverty rather than continues it. The unparalleled opportunity to reform the welfare state was the result of the transformation of the economy that took place under the previous Conservative Government.

The number of people claiming that benefit was 2.37&nbsp;million in May 1997, but by February 2005, it had risen to 2.68&nbsp;million. That is a testament to the Government&#039;s failure to deliver for those with least, and the backdrop of economic strength bequeathed by the previous Conservative Government makes it all the more shameful.

He will be aware, although he is no longer in his place, that the percentage of children experiencing persistent low income&#151;those in the unhappy state of remaining below 60&nbsp;per cent. of median household income in at least three out of four years&#151;was 16&nbsp;per cent. in 1996&#150;97&nbsp;and remained at 16&nbsp;per cent. for the following three years to 1999&#150;2000. We need to recognise that far too many children still live in poverty and that the Government have not delivered the transformation that they promised. I hope that we will see fewer eye-catching initiatives and more hard work to make the systems that we already have work better. When we have a Conservative Government, we will make the systems work better. We will be less interested in headlines and more interested in reducing poverty for those with least.

Now we have one of the weakest. That is a searing indictment of the Government&#039;s failure. They have removed opportunity from hard-working people and replaced it with means-testing. I have yet to meet a constituent, whether from the far left like so many Labour Members who rebel against the Government, or from the right, or of no known political persuasion, who wishes to spend their life working hard and paying tax in order to end up on means-tested benefit. They do not want to have to fill in 24-page forms to get pension credit or 12-page forms to get their council tax benefit.

 My hon. Friend is making a powerful speech and has reached the crux of the issue. If the Government would only uprate pensions in line with earnings, not the retail prices index, it would help many pensioners and, over the years, remove pensioner poverty.

 That is my next point. At the election, the Conservative party laid out proposals to help to lift pensioners out of poverty, to bring them dignity and not means-testing, and to bring back the link between average earnings and the state pension. Labour Members will point out that that link was removed by the Conservatives, but I ask them when that happened. It was in 1980, at the end of a decade in which Labour Governments had brought the economy of this country to its knees. That is why we had to remove the link. By 1997, we had transformed the economy, which is why Labour Members should join Help the Aged, Age Concern and the National Pensioners Convention&#151;indeed, everyone associated with pensions except the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#151;in believing that we should bring back the link between average earnings and the state pension.

 I am conscious of your strictures, Madam Deputy Speaker, to confine our remarks to the topic for debate, and I shall endeavour to do so. I hope that you will allow the odd lapse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_150">Yesterday, I received a helpful press release from the Office for National Statistics, which suggested that we are at a tipping point for the potential number of claimants. For the first time for some years, the trend in employment is declining and the number of people unemployed is increasing. That is noticeable and I shall remind the House of the statistics. The unemployment rate has increased from 4.7&nbsp;per cent. to 5.1&nbsp;per cent. over the period October to December 2005. The number of unemployed people has increased by 108,000&nbsp;over that quarter and by 123,000&nbsp;over the year, to reach 1.54&nbsp;million. In tandem with that alarming increase, there has been a significant increase in the inactivity rate for people of working age. That is relevant to the debate because it affects potential claimants.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_151">The number of economically inactive people of working age has risen by 59,000&nbsp;to reach 7.95&nbsp;million&#151;the highest figure since comparable records began in 1971. At the same time, the average number of job vacancies for the three months to January 2006&nbsp;was 616,800, which is down more than 34,000&nbsp;over the previous 12&nbsp;months. While unemployment is rising, job vacancies are declining, which suggests that there may be a significant change in the number of claimants in the coming year. It will be interesting to see what&#151;if anything&#151;the Chancellor makes of that in his Budget statement next month.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_152">A connected issue relating to those in receipt of benefits is tax credit. We have been told that, from April 2006, the level of income that the Chancellor will disregard, which was &#163;2,500&nbsp;a year, will rise significantly to &#163;25,000&#151;a move that I welcome as it will take a large number of tax credit recipients out of the pernicious series of negotiations with the Inland Revenue into which they are required to enter to determine whether they are entitled to tax credit as their income changes during the year. All Members will have countless examples from their advice surgeries of members of the public who cannot understand the informative&#151;I shall be polite&#151;letters that they receive from the Revenue on that subject.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_153">I wanted to know the cost of that move to the Exchequer, so I put a parliamentary question to the Chancellor last month. I received a reply from the Paymaster General, who was incapable of providing the information. I shall read part of the reply, which stated:

<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1604</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;The increase in the disregard from &#163;2,500&nbsp;to &#163;25,000&nbsp;from April 2006&nbsp;is part of a package of measures announced in the 2005&nbsp;pre-Budget report . . . It is not possible to produce robust estimates of the impact of individual elements of the package of measures, as there are significant interactions between the different components.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 26&nbsp;January 2006; Vol. 441, c. 2246W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_154">That answer is not acceptable. It is beyond belief that the Chancellor could announce such a major measure, which will have an impact on a large number of people, without understanding its effect on the public finances. I shall be looking for clarification in the Chancellor&#039;s Budget statement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_155">Another aspect of tax credits relates to the issues we are discussing: the impact of child support measures. It was disappointing that, in his pre-Budget report, the Chancellor failed for at least the second successive year to uprate to any degree the family element of child tax credit, which has been frozen&#151;as indeed has the child care element of working tax credit. Both measures would have done something to help families on the lowest incomes out of child poverty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_156">I turn to the pension element of the uprating. I have been following with some interest the statements about pensions of the Minister for Pensions Reform, who is not in his place, so I welcomed his comment in this debate, when he appeared for the first time to acknowledge the need to encourage incentives to save. Under the Labour Government, savings have roughly halved nationally. One of the main contributory reasons is the introduction of so much means-testing in the pensions environment. It is essential that the Government&#039;s measures in response to the Turner commission reduce dependency on the state and on means-testing, and they have acknowledged that as an important ambition. I shall look particularly at how they achieve it and should welcome the opportunity to participate in that debate over coming weeks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_157">I urge the Government to take care that they do not damage the existing savings regime in our pensions industry. It has already suffered significant damage from measures taken by the Government, as we heard earlier, so it would be the height of folly if the introduction of a low-cost national pension savings scheme, or its equivalent, caused the migration of all existing savings arrangements to that scheme to the detriment of pensioners and the savings industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_158">It is also important that the Government do not fall into a mis-selling trap of their own making. It could be avoided if there were an element of compulsion in the national pension savings scheme. If there is an auto-enrolment system, as proposed by Lord Turner, individuals must be given some advice, one way or another, to determine whether saving for their pension is right at a particular stage of their working life. I am thinking particularly of graduates at the beginning of their careers who have to pay off tuition fees and so on. Is it really appropriate for them to be saving for their pensions at the beginning of their career when they have costly debts to pay off?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_159">I also urge the Minister to ensure that there is sufficient confidence in whatever savings scheme is established to allow people on lower incomes to participate if they want to do so. Experience has shown the difficulties of previous Government schemes that were rolled out with great fanfare but not taken up in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1605</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>numbers that the Government wanted, in part because people felt that the Government would not play fair with them and the rules were changed. I do not criticise this Government particularly because all Governments have a tendency to change the rules as they go along, so whatever regulatory oversight regime is in place, there should be an element of independence. Just as, to their credit, the Government introduced independence for the Bank of England, they should consider a regulatory oversight regime for the national pension savings scheme that is independent of Government.
</p>





<p><a name="st_164"><a name="60216-19_spnew3"><b> Danny Alexander: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the most significant disincentives for people on low incomes to make provision for their retirement is the spread of means-testing in the pension system? People on low incomes are likely to be much more affected by means-testing, so the current system is much less likely to encourage them to make provision for their retirement.
</p>





<p><a name="st_165"><a name="60216-19_spnew4"><b> Mr. Dunne: </b> 
 I completely agree. Indeed, until two years ago when the Government made the change, it made no financial sense for many people on low incomes to save because they were better off depending on the state in their retirement. The Government have taken some steps to reduce that disincentive to save but it still exists to some extent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_160">Incapacity benefit is also being uprated. I do not want to comment at length on the welfare reform Green Paper, as I am aware of Madam Deputy Speaker&#039;s strictures on the subject. However, it discusses the need for a reduction in the number of IB claimants over the next 10&nbsp;years, and how we achieve that is relevant to the debate. All Members can agree that the aim is desirable, but it is a major challenge for the Government and there are some specific problems that they need to address.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-19_para12">
<a name="stpa_161">The vast majority of the 2.7&nbsp;million IB claimants have been in receipt of the benefit for more than four years. We are dealing with a large proportion of people who are in the most difficult category in terms of getting back to work. They include some of the most vulnerable people&#151;the most severely disabled and the most persistently unemployed. Whatever the Government may say about the previous Conservative Administration&#039;s attempt to shift people from unemployment benefit to incapacity benefit, the number of IB claimants under the Labour Administration has risen significantly&#151;it has gone up by more than 300,000&#151;so they cannot make that accusation without acknowledging that the number has risen significantly under Labour as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-19_para13">
<a name="stpa_162">The pilot pathways-to-work schemes that the Government have introduced over the past couple of years are making modest progress in increasing take-up, thus getting more people back into work. The percentage for each pilot area varies between about 7&nbsp;per cent. and about 11&nbsp;per cent. I acknowledge that that is an improvement, but that is the percentage increase for all claimants in the area, irrespective of the duration of their being on incapacity benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-19_para14">

<br>&nbsp;<br>advantage of visiting Holland with other Members last week, and some dramatic and significant reforms have taken place there over the past few years, as I am sure the Minister is aware. Particularly in addressing long-term incapacity benefit claimants, great strides are being taken in changing the attitudes of people in receipt of benefit and putting in place an array of measures to encourage people back into work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-19_para15">
<a name="stpa_164">The main focus in Holland is on making employers and individuals who have disability aware of the fact that they have the potential to work. The focus is on what they can do, not what they cannot do. Although that is a rather simplistic description, that change in attitude is dramatic. Unfortunately, the pathways pilot schemes do not provide that. They continue to encourage people to think that they have a right and an entitlement to benefit and to think about what they cannot do and what they are entitled to if they cannot do it. The Government need to address that change in attitude.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-19_para16">
<a name="stpa_165">The Minister is aware of the final issue that I should like to raise, which relates to how the Department for Work and Pensions copes with the voluntary and private sector agencies with which it enters contracts to supply training and other services to long-term incapacity benefit claimants. The Department is in the midst of reviewing its relationships&#151;and it needs to do so, because they have been chaotic. We have evidence from many of those organisations to show that the Department has been running its supplier contracts in such a way as to shut them all down&#151;

 With the leave of the House, I should like to respond to the debate, which has been interesting, important and short. I was particularly interested to hear the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart), who reminded us in an interesting and fluent contribution that benefit dependency has been on the increase in the past eight years. People are now on benefits who do not want to be on them; they would rather be in work. He also reminded us that benefit uprating has been conducted more often by Conservatives when in government than by other parties. He stressed that the Conservative party believes in welfare for those who need it&#151;those who, for no fault of their own, need the support of the state and the taxpayer, who is, of course, happy to lend that support&#151;but we need fresh thinking to ensure that those who can work and want to work are given the opportunity to do so and have the obstacles that are in their way removed.

It was an enjoyable contribution, with some important points, which can also be said of the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne), who drew attention in a technically adept set of remarks to the fact that the tax credit disregard, which has been raised from &#163;2,500&nbsp;to &#163;25,000, appears to be an uncosted commitment and that he has sought in vain, using the method of asking parliamentary questions, to find out the cost to the Exchequer of that policy change. I really do hope that the Minister can tell us and not shuffle us off to other Ministers at the next Treasury questions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_167">My hon. Friend also talked about savings, which are, of course, very pertinent to a debate on benefits uprating. If the savings culture is as damaged as he said&#151;I think that he is right&#151;more and more pensioners must rely on the very benefits that are uprated by the order. He spoke about the need for the Government to find more intelligent savings policies. Those points were well made. He also touched tantalisingly on pathways to work and how benefits recipients might escape from benefits into work. He certainly touched on incapacity benefit reform in an instructive way. He talked about the experience of Holland and the lessons that DWP Ministers might learn&#151;the Opposition are certainly learning them&#151;about active intervention in the labour market to get those who are desperately keen to get off benefit back into work. Although we share the same objective as Ministers, today&#039;s debate has shown that the Opposition have radically different solutions and means to achieve that common objective.

After all, it adds more than &#163;3.44&nbsp;billion of extra spending, &#163;2.58&nbsp;billion of which goes to pensioners and &#163;360&nbsp;million is above inflation. Some &#163;40&nbsp;million goes to children; &#163;400&nbsp;million to disabled people and their carers; and &#163;420&nbsp;million to people of working age. Most benefits have increased in line with the retail prices index, at 2.7&nbsp;per cent., while pension credit guarantee has increased in line with earnings, at 4.2&nbsp;per cent.

We have seen a fall of 58,000&nbsp;in the number claiming incapacity benefit since August 2005, and a fall of 29,000&nbsp;in the number claiming lone parent benefit.

He referred to the projection in Lord Turner&#039;s report that if nothing changed in the current configuration of pensions provision, we could find ourselves with 70-odd per cent. of pensioners encountering means-testing. Lord Turner does say that, but in fairness, the House should acknowledge what he also said about the effectiveness of the means-testing in the system in reducing pensioner poverty. There is an issue about the role and degree of means-testing in the system for the long term, and of course we are reflecting on Lord Turner&#039;s point, as are many others, and we will have things to say about that when we come back to the House in the spring with our response to his report.

<a name="60216-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_174">The hon. Gentleman asked me to distinguish between performance on fraud and that on error, and I am happy to do so. Our performance on fraud is very encouraging. Losses to fraud are now below &#163;1&nbsp;billion, and we think that the figure now stands at less than 1&nbsp;per cent. of the total spend. That is a creditable performance. On the main benefits that tend to be prone to fraud&#151;housing benefit, income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance&#151;losses to fraud are down by a half since 1997. Of course there is still more to do. We recently published the fraud strategy document, which I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has studied, in which we outline additional measures that we are now taking and additional powers that we have to make even more progress in reducing fraud in the benefits system.

<a name="stpa_175">On error, yes, the figures are flat-lining; there has not been as much progress in reducing losses to error in the system as we would have hoped. We believe that the total of such losses is about &#163;1.7&nbsp;billion. If the hon.

<a name="stpa_176">The hon. Gentleman moved on to be critical of our proposed reform of housing benefit. I think that I heard him describing the local housing allowance as &quot;not radical&quot;. Again, I urge him to have a further read of the chapter in the welfare Green Paper. He will find that once the local housing allowance is rolled out nationally in the private rented sector, it will definitely help us to make progress in increasing financial inclusion, something that I should have hoped he would welcome. It will certainly help us make progress in simplifying aspects of the benefits system; I had hoped that he would have welcomed that. It will certainly help us to make progress in increasing return-to-work incentives; and I would have thought that he would have welcomed that. The hon. Gentleman went on to refer to the single room rate. He should know, and I would have thought welcomed the fact, that under the LHA scheme, support for young people is more generous than under the existing scheme. I am sorry that he did not welcome those developments.

<a name="stpa_179">The hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) sought also to criticise the Government on what has happened to savings. Indeed, one or two other Members made the same point. The savings ratio is quite a volatile indicator and there have certainly been periods under this Government to date when it has been quite low, but I urge the hon. Gentleman to look at the figures under the previous Administration. He will find that at times the savings ratio fell to levels lower than at any time under this Administration. He should know that the savings ratio tends to be very much geared to the housing market, and during periods of high inflation in house prices we see the ratio plummet. When the housing market stabilises, we see the savings ratio recover. Interestingly, that is exactly what it is doing again, as the latest figures confirm.

I appreciate the work that he does on the Work and Pensions Committee, as I do his comments about the Dutch experience and the importance of undertaking reforms that focus on people&#039;s capacity to work and not on their incapacity to do so. I would claim that that is very much the direction of travel of the Government&#039;s reforms.

<a name="stpa_181">Since 1997, the Government have worked to build a modern, active welfare state. There are now 2.3&nbsp;million more people in work and 1&nbsp;million fewer people on benefits. We have lifted 2&nbsp;million children and almost 2&nbsp;million pensioners out of absolute poverty. We have already taken action to replace the &quot;one size fits all&quot; model of benefit dependency with an active service, where tailored support to help people back into work is matched by their obligation to do everything possible to help themselves.

<a name="60216-21_time0"><h5>2.44&nbsp;pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_178"><a name="60216-21_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Caroline Flint): </b> 
 It gives me great pleasure to open the debate on inequalities in health. Over the past 50&nbsp;years we have seen impressive social, economic and health improvements in the United Kingdom. People from every class and every region are healthier and are living longer than ever before. The differences over time are striking. For instance, data for 1972&#150;76&nbsp;show that male life expectancy in the lowest social group was 66.4&nbsp;years. That compares to a life expectancy of 71&nbsp;years by 1997&#150;2001. That is an indication that public health policies are having an effect on people&#039;s lives, as are treatment and new drugs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_192">However, the Government are not complacent. We need to do more about inequalities. We know how to improve life expectancy, but we need to ensure that all parts of society are benefiting. We know that families in poorer neighbourhoods are at greater risk of infant mortality, still die at a younger age and are likely to spend more of their lives in ill health. A man living in Manchester is likely to die nine years earlier than one living on the south coast of England. We know, too, that a man working as a manual worker in a factory is a third more likely to report a long-standing illness, compared with a man in a professional group, such as a doctor or a lawyer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_193">Social injustices like those are what brought me and many of my colleagues into politics, and are one of the reasons why we have given health inequalities a high priority now that we are in government. From the beginning, we were keen to set the record straight. One of the first things we did was to commission a comprehensive inquiry into the evidence on health inequalities. We invited a former chief medical officer to chair the inquiry. The result was the Acheson report, published in 1998. Acheson showed a significant widening of health inequalities between the 1970s and 1990s. The differential had increased two to three times between the highest and lowest social classes. It could be addressed only by focusing on the wide range of determinants&#151;social, economic and environmental&#151;that have an impact on health.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_194">Acheson focused on programmes and priorities, but targets are important to focus attention on the problem, to stimulate action and to engage key players. In 2001, we set a national health inequalities target for England that called for a 10&nbsp;per cent. reduction in the health gap for life expectancy and infant mortality. We extended this approach by including health inequalities as part of our key targets on heart disease, cancer and smoking. We have used the adoption of national targets as a way of influencing and shaping policy across the Department of Health, the health service and, importantly, other Government Departments, too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_195">In our target on smoking&#151;the biggest cause of avoidable deaths&#151;and our work to reduce smoking levels, we recognise that we cannot achieve our overall goal to reduce smoking levels without focusing on the hard-core group of poor smokers. Clearly, the decision 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1614</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of the House to ban smoking in all public places apart from a few exemptions, which was supported by Members from all parties, will make a huge contribution to tackling the problem, and took account of the concerns about health inequalities caused by partial restrictions on smoking in public places, particularly licensed premises.

 I intend to cover those issues, which are very complex. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, they are complex. The reality is that everybody from every social group is making progress in terms of their life expectancy. Our problem, which I am certainly not afraid to face up to, is how we deal with a situation whereby although everybody is living longer and improving their health, people who are better off and more educated take up the challenges of improving their health more quickly than those who are less well off and less educated. That is one of the reasons why we have to deal with the gap, of which I am fully aware.

<a name="stpa_196">Following the adoption of the national target, health inequalities was chosen as the subject for a cross-Government review led by the Treasury. That review was designed to influence spending decisions across Government as part of a wider programme to address child poverty and promote social justice. Jointly chaired by the Department of Health and the Treasury, it brought together 18&nbsp;Departments&#151;from Department for Work and Pensions to the Department for Transport&#151;and Government units and agencies. Together, they assessed progress and agreed priorities for action. For us, the role

<a name="60216-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_197">That strategy&#151;the programme for action launched in 2003&#151;sets out four themes to tackle health inequalities: supporting mothers, families and children; engaging with mothers, families and children; preventing illness and providing effective treatment and care; and, importantly, addressing the underlying determinants of health. Those four related themes set out a programme to address health inequalities on a broad front, directed to the whole population and designed to ensure that responsibility for tackling health inequalities lies at the heart of all public services. That includes work on urban and neighbourhood renewal and on giving children from poorer families a fairer start in life through Sure Start. As well as focusing on the 2010&nbsp;national target, the strategy seeks to address some of the underlying causes and determinants of health such as employment, education, crime, transport, early years support and homelessness. Our aim is to improve everyone&#039;s health, but to improve the health of the poorest fastest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_198">People living in disadvantaged areas usually have much lower expectations of the health care system and of their own health. On a recent visit, we met a 49-year-old man who, despite breathlessness, did not think that he was unwell. He said, &quot;I&#039;m not ill&#151;I&#039;m just getting old&quot;. Yet he was not even 50. Here we are in Westminster, where a man will most likely live until 76. If we travelled east on the Jubilee line to Canning Town, eight stops away, we would find that on average men live until 69&#151;a seven-year difference. A shorter life expectancy means that families are robbed of parents and grandparents. Between 2002&nbsp;and 2004, there were 13,700&nbsp;additional deaths among 30&nbsp;to 59-year-olds in the most deprived local authorities compared with the rest of England.

We have developed a model to deliver real improvements in public health in the short term that concentrates on averting early death. The model identifies the age groups we need to focus on&#151;the 40&nbsp;to 60-year- olds&#151;the most common causes of early death, and the most effective treatments and interventions we can apply to prolong life.

 It would be courteous to my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton) to find out precisely what Government policy is. Clearly, primary care trusts in different parts of the country reach different decisions about whether they will fund Herceptin for breast cancer patients on the basis of their judgment of the clinical case rather than that of individual clinicians. Do the Government think that that is the right way to proceed? Do they accept that different decisions should be made in different parts of the country about an issue where a clinical judgment could potentially be made on a national basis?
</p>





<p><a name="st_189"><a name="60216-22_spnew3"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 It would be inappropriate to direct PCTs to have a standard position on a drug that is not yet licensed or appraised. The PCTs have the opportunity to make choices about their policy on that particular drug and we have made that clear. As with many such matters, PCTs should deliver what they think is right for their local communities and should take into account clinicians&#039; advice as well as other issues, such as guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.
</p>





<p><a name="st_190"><a name="60216-22_spnew4"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 It is a simple point. It is perfectly logical for the Government to have said that PCTs must make a decision on an unlicensed drug, but why did the Secretary of State interfere? Why did she say such things if her intention was not to send a message that Herceptin would be available for early stage breast cancer?
</p>





<p><a name="st_191"><a name="60216-22_spnew5"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 I think that I am correct in saying that the Secretary of State was pointing out that cost was not the only factor that should be taken into account. Clearly, individual cases have to be suitable and other matters apply.

<a name="60216-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_201">I want to return to my point about the major reasons for people dying an earlier death than we would hope. For example, circulatory diseases and cancer are responsible for approximately 50&nbsp;per cent. of avoidable early deaths. Logically, it would be correct to focus on treating those diseases. However, as I said before, we should also target the underlying causes of ill health. Unemployment, the absence of support in early years, housing conditions, homelessness and other contributing factors mean that some individuals are more likely than others in their community or elsewhere in the country to suffer ill health.

One way of meeting that challenge is to examine the way in which some services could be provided closer to home.

I have taken part in a few Adjournment debates on this subject, and I am aware that some of the services being provided by the community hospitals are not necessarily the ones that most meet the needs of their community. It is important, whether in community hospitals or acute hospitals, to consider what is being provided and whether it meets people&#039;s needs. I hope that I have given the hon. Gentleman a full answer to his question.

 May I say that my hon. Friend has got this absolutely right? One of the problems with rural areas is the disproportionate effect of funding being spread across the whole area and missing the pockets of real deprivation. This is made clear by the way in which some general practices operate. Will my hon. Friend take it from me that the best way to deal with this is&#151;to use a horrible expression&#151;to drill down and find out what the social and medical problems are in rural areas, and disproportionately to fund the people and places in greatest need? It is not fair that, too often, those people miss out because they do not have a voice. We hear the rhetoric that the funding is going to those people, but the reality is that it is not.

<p><a name="st_195"><a name="60216-22_spnew9"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point. One of the things that we can do at national level, in identifying this problem, is to ensure that the organisations that commission and provide services demonstrate how they are meeting the targets on health inequalities through the services that they provide and through the outcomes of those services. That is one way of incentivising local service providers, commissioners and GPs to understand the nature of the problems

 It is certainly there, along with a number of other issues, such as obesity and smoking. Alcohol is an interesting subject because there is evidence that its misuse takes place across different social classes. Yes, it is a problem for those in our poorest communities, but also for those who are better off. I am having discussions with the Ministers responsible for these matters in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Home Office, and we are working with Ministers in the Department for Education and Skills on alcohol education in schools. We are also engaged in discussions with producers and retailers in the alcohol industry about what further information they could provide on packaging to inform people about safe levels of drinking. There is lot that we need to do to get people to understand the dangers. They might not think that they are drinking at an unsafe level, but, over time, they could develop real problems. This is an issue for young people, some of whom could have considerable health problems by the time they reach 30, if they do not reflect on the amount that they are drinking.

I am not saying that that was all right or that it was rather judgmental, but there are consequences. We are seeing, because of that, some evidence that issues that were often seen as male health problems are starting to emerge among women as well. We must consider how best to deal with that too.

 On the point relating to rural areas, does the Minister agree that the national weighted capitation strategy is plainly inherently biased towards urban areas? Its assessment of additional need adopts indices that are clearly not applicable to poverty in rural areas, to which the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) referred. If it is inherently biased, and if the best method of capturing need in rural areas is being systematically missed, there will be increasing health inequality in rural communities. Is not that something that the Government should deal with urgently, and what is the Minister going to do about it?
</p>





<p><a name="st_203"><a name="60216-23_spnew2"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The basis of funding to primary care trusts is determined on levels of need and issues around population are taken into account, but this is an area that we keep under review. To give an example from my constituency, which is semi-rural as it contains mining villages, we have benefited from money we got through the rural bus grant to have bus services provided for some of our outlying villages. That has given many people an opportunity to reach some of the services in Doncaster. That provision has helped and it is a good example as it involves health in terms not only of rural areas, but of how other Departments and those agencies closer to where people live&#151;whether the local authority or the strategic transport executives&#151;take these issues into account. The regional development agencies also have a role to play in looking at supporting infrastructure in our rural communities.

<p><a name="st_204"><a name="60216-23_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 This is an interesting point. Does the Minister agree that using ward-based data in relation to deprivation in rural areas such as her constituency might indicate high levels of deprivation there, while in many other rural areas such data do not do so because smaller numbers of relatively poor people are hidden by larger 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1620</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>numbers of relatively wealthy people? One method of dealing with that is for the national health service in particular, given that it is building up through GPs an enormous database of morbidity&#151;knowing how many asthmatics there are, knowing how many diabetics and the like&#151;to transfer from assumed to real data.
</p>





<p><a name="st_205"><a name="60216-23_spnew4"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Data are important for planning and commissioning. I have had interesting discussions about how some GPs are breaking down their practice areas, not just on a ward basis but street by street, to target services on those who are most in need, rather than getting in touch with everyone. Some exciting work has been done in rural and urban areas. For example, particular ethnic minorities have been targeted, because of certain health needs, to good effect. One of the Department&#039;s challenges is how to enable those who commission and plan services to use social intelligence better to construct services and gain better value for money through more precise targeting.
</p>

<a name="60216-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_207">I am sure that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) would agree that, having given record funding to the NHS, our challenge is to demonstrate that best value for money is being achieved. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State visited Dudley the other week where better-quality services are having much greater impact and better outcomes, from less money, than the old services used to provide. I visited a sexual health clinic off the Tottenham Court road only last week, which provided good examples of changing the way in which services are provided to improve access and save money. There is a 48-hour waiting time target for those services, which is challenging but which some providers are meeting. It is an exciting area, and those who are planning and want to provide services need to think about how to reach people in a more targeted way. If they do, we will have a much greater opportunity to close the health inequalities gap.

 In tackling health inequalities, it is critical to be clear which are the most vulnerable groups in the local community when it comes to suffering ill health. It is then a question of identifying the core components leading to those poor health outcomes. As to whether that is partly about changing what happens in the acute sector, there is probably room for improvement in hospitals. Provision in community hospitals is also part of the debate. But there are two other aspects. First, prevention can stop people getting ill in the first place or reduce illness. Secondly, people are living longer because technology has moved on and drugs are better, which is welcome&#151;more people are surviving heart attacks and cancers. The question of provision for more long-term management of illnesses follows from that. Whether it should be done in hospital or in the community is open to debate. It is extremely

We must also bear down on health inequalities, however, and recognise that they are not a case of &quot;One size fits all&quot;.

 I am glad to have the opportunity to follow the Minister and contribute to this debate. I thank the Government for making time available for it. It may be at the periphery of parliamentary time, but it is on the Floor of the House and we appreciate that. I am not sure how long it has been since the subject of tackling health 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1626</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>inequalities has been debated. The Minister did not say that it was the Government&#039;s intention to have regular debates on the issue, but I hope that it is. It is certainly one of the priorities that my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) set out for us at the beginning of the year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_220">It was the Government&#039;s intention to publish an annual status report on health inequalities, but the first report took two years. They said in July 2003&nbsp;that the Department of Health would publish an annual report on health inequality indicators, related to the health inequality targets. The first was published in August 2005. A letter in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> in September described its publication as Labour&#039;s Black report moment, because it had been buried in the middle of August. Why did they do that? For the same reason that the Minister did not give the figures when I invited her to tell us the changes in the two national targets identified by the Government for measuring health inequalities. I do not see why not, because as she explained, the point of national targets is to focus people&#039;s attention on them, so it does not make much sense to publish them at a time when people will not notice them. Equally, if they are going in the wrong direction, the Government should be rigorous about what they will do to deal with that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_221">The figures are straightforward. The relative gap in life expectancy for men has increased by nearly 2&nbsp;per cent. and for women by 5&nbsp;per cent. The latest figures on infant mortality confirm the previously reported trend. Despite overall improvements, the relative gap between the routine and manual groups and the population as a whole has widened over recent years, since the target baseline. The overall infant mortality rate was five deaths per thousand live births, while the rate for those in routine and manual groups was six per thousand. In 2001&nbsp;to 2003, the infant mortality rate in the latter group was 19&nbsp;per cent. higher than in the total population; it was 16&nbsp;per cent. higher in 2000&nbsp;to 2002&nbsp;and 13&nbsp;per cent. higher in the baseline period, so the relative gap has widened&#151;from 13&nbsp;to 19&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_222">The Minister said that it was important to look at the finer detail, but the detail she referred to showed things going in the right direction. However, the infant mortality rate among sole registrations&#151;births registered only by the mother&#151;rose to 7.4&nbsp;per thousand live births, compared with 6.6&nbsp;per cent. in 2002. In 2003, the mortality rate in the routine and manual social group rose to 6.1&nbsp;per thousand, compared with 5.8&nbsp;in 2002&#151;an absolute rather than a relative rise in that one-year period.

 Have not the Government failed to deal with health inequalities and is not that why they did not meet their promises? Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister should tell the House that that will not happen again? If the Minister&#039;s top NHS priority truly is to tackle the appalling gap between the poorest and the better-off in our society, she must set targets and meet them, and report to the House not annually but every six months. That is what she should do, rather than giving us waffle and rhetoric, while people at the bottom of our society are all too often let down by the Government.
</p>





<p><a name="st_228"><a name="60216-25_spnew7"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. In a nutshell, the burden of what I wanted to say is that, if 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1627</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>one is to deal with health inequalities, it is vital to focus on the relative gap between the most and least healthy, and between the richest and the poorest. It is not good enough to elide aggregate progress and relative failure. For example, the Minister&#151;as Ministers always do&#151;talked about the absolute reductions in mortality from cancer and coronary heart disease, on a trend that I am sure she will not deny was pretty well established in the latter part of the 1970s for coronary heart disease and the early 1980s for cancer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_223">The point is that in all such trends we need to look at mortality rates and find the real inequalities. We may be making considerable progress on cancer treatments, but the relative gap may be widening. At the same time, there are many deaths from lung disease, which the Minister did not mention. The British Thoracic Society tells us:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;There are three times as many deaths from respiratory disease that are associated with social inequalities . . . than there are cancer deaths that are associated with social inequalities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_224">Social inequality in respect of the incidence of respiratory disease is much greater than that in respect of cancers. There is a gap. Eight times more deaths&#151;3,800&#151;are caused by respiratory disease as a result of social inequalities compared with the impact of such inequalities on coronary heart disease, which results in 500&nbsp;deaths. The Minister did not mention this, but if people are talking about relative mortality rates and the things that bear on them to the greatest extent, they spend more time referring to lung disease than to cancers and coronary heart disease respectively.

Will he also support directing extra funds to places such as North Durham and Easington in County Durham, which have some of the greatest problems with health inequalities?

 I am not quite sure what evidence the hon. Gentleman has to back the idea that I have somehow been converted. If he goes back, for example, to before the general election to the opportunity that I took in September 2004&nbsp;to set out our policies on public health, he will find that one of the first things that I did was to say that that was our top priority. I said&#151;and I would have done it&#151;that if I had become Secretary of Sate after the election, I would be Secretary of State for Public Health and when we debated health inequalities, the Secretary of State would be here, not an Under-Secretary of State. I made it clear that that focus on public health was intended to improve not just health outcomes for the whole population.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_225">The intention was not only to improve health outcomes in the whole population, but to increase the relative health of those who are poorest. Why did the Minister not just get up and say what the objective is? We agree that the objective of our policies is to improve the health outcomes of the people of this country and those of the poorest fastest. Why did the Minister not say that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_233"><a name="60216-26_spnew3"><b> Caroline Flint: </b>

<p><a name="st_234"><a name="60216-26_spnew4"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 The Minister did not say that. That is what must be done and she is confusing the aggregate data&#151;it is astonishing that she carries on doing so&#151;on whether we are making progress in improving the health outcomes of the whole population with the question of whether the poorest and the least healthy people in this country are improving their health faster than the rest of the population. They are not, and the Government should acknowledge that fact so that they can do something about it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_226">I asked some questions about evidence, which is central to the issue. If there are two things that have bedevilled the tackling of health inequalities, the first is that we just cannot agree about the causes. Of course, poverty is one of the causes. The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) made a rather absurd proposition about that and then left. Of course, there are many causes: poverty, poor housing, environment, family structures, education, ethnicity and genetics. Those are all causes.
</p>





<p><a name="st_235"><a name="60216-26_spnew5"><b> Dr. Andrew Murrison  (Westbury) (Con):</b> 
 That is right.
</p>





<p><a name="st_236"><a name="60216-26_spnew6"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 Indeed, and we could say that there have been substantial shifts over recent generations. For example, one could go back 100&nbsp;years when infectious disease led to 25&nbsp;per cent. of the deaths in this country. The figure is now 1&nbsp;per cent., and I hope it stays that way, touch wood. What lies at the heart of the debate is the fact that we must be aware&#151;the Minister acknowledged this&#151;that we must not only deal with those environmental issues and the physical and societal factors that cause ill health and inequality&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_237"><a name="60216-26_spnew7"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones: </b> 
 Poverty.
</p>





<p><a name="st_238"><a name="60216-26_spnew8"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 I do not deny that poverty is included. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the simple fact that the latest data in the family resources survey, which are from 2003&#150;04, show that, in the lowest quintile by income, the ratio of the top to bottom quintile incomes has deteriorated compared with 1997&#150;98. So not only are family incomes falling in the 2003&#150;04&nbsp;data, the situation of the poorest is slightly deteriorating compared with that of the richest. I do not know whether he wants to dispute that&#151;maybe not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_227">The point that I was making is that if one takes the long view, which we have to do, those environmental factors, important as they are, are at risk of being overtaken by personal, behavioural factors. Even if we reduce income inequalities, reduce the number of people living in poor housing&#151;as has happened&#151;improve the environment and get rid of toxins in the air, which we have done because a Conservative Government introduced the Clean Air Act 1993, and eliminate or 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>reduce the threat of infectious diseases, behavioural issues may still mean that some health inequalities are intractable and not reduced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_228">In some parts of the population obesity rates may be higher, drug taking may be higher, smoking may be more prevalent, alcohol intake may be higher and sexual health may be worse. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I do not dispute that the Minister said all these things. We have to focus on them and part of the purpose of today&#039;s debate is to try to get some agreement about the necessity of acting on both sides of the equation. In the past it has tended to be the case that Labour Members talk excessively about the environmental, physical and economic factors, and Conservative Members talk rather more about the behavioural factors. We must acknowledge that we have to do both, and make progress on both. We must also be aware that, over time, those behavioural factors have begun to show how intractable health inequalities are.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_229">The hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) asked about more money for Easington. Easington has more money. I cannot remember the precise figure, but it is about &#163;1,200&nbsp;per head for the primary care trust, and the figure in my constituency is &#163;880, so Easington is getting more money. If shifting resources within the NHS were the answer to health inequalities, Scotland would be very healthy. The Minister did not mention this, but the lowest life expectancy in this country is in Glasgow, at 69.1&nbsp;years for men compared with 80.1&nbsp;years for men in East Dorset. I am not aware that East Dorset is thick with NHS resources.

<p><a name="st_239"><a name="60216-26_spnew9"><b> Mr. Jones: </b>

 I will certainly apologise for the fact that health inequalities did not narrow more under the last Conservative Government if the Minister will get up and

<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1630</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>apologise for the fact that health inequalities have widened since 1997. She is not going to do that, as the hon. Gentleman knows. I will not apologise&#151;I have come across this point before&#151;for what the last Conservative Government did. As it happens, I was not a politician at the time but a civil servant, and I stood next to Norman Tebbit when he signed the deal with Nissan to bring that business to Sunderland. The transformation of the north-east economy did not happen post-1997; it began in the mid-1980s. I know, because I was there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_230">If we are to tackle health inequalities, we must be aware of the serious problems coming down the line. The Minister referred, for example, to the incidence of smoking among young women. There is also the increase in consumption of alcohol among young women. I was talking recently to Professor Roger Williams, who treated George Best. He is seeing in his surgeries young people, and increasingly young women, who have liver disease which to all intents and purposes is irreversible. That will be an enormous burden of mortality and morbidity in years to come.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_231">At the rate we are going, obesity will in three or four years overtake smoking as the principal cause of avoidable death in this country. The Minister will know that over the past 10&nbsp;years&#151;before the hon. Member for North Durham chastises me, this is not a trend that was established in 1997, although it has continued over the past eight years&#151;the proportion of our population that is obese has risen from 16&nbsp;per cent. for men and 13&nbsp;per cent. for women to 26&nbsp;per cent. for both women and men. Our children are getting fatter faster than any other children in western Europe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_232">If that does not change, we will have an epidemic of weight-related diseases such as diabetes, stroke and heart disease; we will have an epidemic of mental health problems as a result of drug abuse; we will have an epidemic of liver disease as a result of the consumption of alcohol; and we will have an epidemic of infertility and related disease&#151;pancreatic inflammation in respect of chlamydia and related sexually transmitted infections. The Minister did not mention the fact that the number of sexually transmitted infections has doubled over recent years. These things have to be tackled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_233">The Minister did not talk either about the structure of public health services. One of the things that I said before the election was that we needed a new structure. We must ensure that the focus is institutional and financial as well as political, and it is not at the moment. There may be professional leadership from the chief medical officer&#151;even if he had to fight Ministers in order to get through his view on smoking&#151;but the service is not integrated. We have the functions of the chief medical officer on the one hand and those of the Health Protection Agency on the other. Out in the field, directors of public health in primary care trusts must be tearing their hair out trying to get public health messages through the chaos and noise of PCT reconfiguration. Before the PCT restructuring was mooted by the Government, directors of public health found their priorities pushed to the margin, with the single exception of stop-smoking services, to which the Government attached a target.

It is because there is no distinct, discrete organisational function or financial structure that ensures that public health is focused in individual localities. The Government do not even know how much money is spent on public health. They cannot measure it because it has been absorbed into primary care trust allocations. I have asked how much is being spent, but I have not received a reply.

The Government announced lifestyle checks in the press prior to the publication of the White Paper, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1632</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and the implication was that they were going to be of immense benefit. On every occasion that we have mentioned them, Ministers, including the Under-Secretary, have moved closer and closer to the proposition that they consist simply of reminding people at certain points to think whether they need to visit their doctor, and no more than that.

<a name="stpa_238">A great deal could be done that would be beneficial&#151;and I keep telling Ministers so&#151;but not necessarily at the age of 11, 18&nbsp;or 50.

Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson) mentioned the initiatives that have been taken in Hull, but where are the school nurses that should be in every school so that health services have a consistent visible presence for young people between the ages of 11&nbsp;and 18, and, indeed, under 11, and can encourage them to understand how they can improve their health and to understand the risks that they run. Those are precisely the things that impact on behaviour, and which are important in the most deprived areas of this country if we are to change the behaviour of young people in those areas.

 I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has heard of Healthworks and various programmes operated by the St. Helens and Knowsley primary care trusts. They operate what some people would describe as fitness checks. Others might call them very quick medicals. People are tested for their weight, cholesterol and various other things. Those tests give an indicative view of whether they should go to see their doctor. They do not take place in a surgery. In Knowsley, they take innovative form, as they take place in working men&#039;s clubs and youth clubs. The people involved in the programmes are attacking the health inequalities. That is the kind of thing that we need to push.

 Of course we need to reach out. Perhaps the hon. Lady was not in the Chamber when we discussed the White Paper when I said that the pharmacy contract was a very good example of such initiatives. It is perfectly possible for pharmacies to offer a range of opportunities, including cholesterol, chlamydia and blood sugar tests. I have seen, for example, what Lloyds pharmacy has done to promote diabetic testing among south Asian groups. There are many opportunities for such tests, and the pharmacy contract permits them. The problem is that the primary care trusts are not commissioning them. Pharmacies are keen to offer testing. That would be particularly beneficial for men, who go into pharmacies for various reasons. Given the large disproportion between women attending GPs&#039; surgeries and men attending GPs&#039; surgeries in the middle years of life, that would be a good way of offering men health tests. It is important that that is done.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that matter. It is vital for my constituency, which is predominantly rural&#151;not just farmhouses dotted round the countryside, but small towns and large villages, where access to services at the district general hospital will be jeopardised by the future health care programme. Maternity, obstetrics, paediatrics and children&#039;s services may be removed in an area where one in six people does not own a car and there is no meaningful transport. Is that not another example of health inequalities between the rural and the urban areas?
</p>





<p><a name="st_250"><a name="60216-27_spnew5"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. We must address such inequalities of access and, like so many of the problems that we are discussing, that is not achieved merely through changes in the NHS. A wider range of changes are needed to tackle rural issues.At the outset, the Minister mentioned Sir Donald Acheson&#039;s report of 1998. Of 39&nbsp;recommendations in the report, only three were directed to the national health service, so the problem goes wider than that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_243">In our earlier exchange about resource allocation, the Minister made some perfectly fair points but she did not answer the question. Resource allocation is still being decided across the country on the basis of assumed and aggregated data in respect of deprivation and age. We increasingly have data that would allow known morbidity in a community to be the basis on which NHS resources are allocated. I hope that the advisory

<br>&nbsp;<br>committee on resource allocation will start to make those changes. That would make an enormous difference to many parts of the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_244">At the same time, we should isolate the resources that have to go to any community to provide good-quality services to meet the levels of mortality and morbidity that are occurring in those places, and, as distinct from that, recognise the need for separate allocated resources to impact upon health inequalities and poor outcomes arising from a wide range of factors. That separation was part of our policy at the last election, and I am still convinced that it is right to have dedicated public health resources. Otherwise, we end up in the current situation, with, for example, dramatic disparities between the allocation of resources in England, Scotland and Wales. Because those resources are not necessarily being directed to public health outcomes in some places, they are not necessarily delivering the best health outcomes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_245">I saw an example of that when I was in Manchester last week. Hope hospital in Salford is taking large numbers of referrals from Northern Ireland, with referral letters going back to 2001. Northern Ireland does not have small amounts of money going into it for the provision of hospital services&#151;it is just that it is extraordinarily inefficiently provided. It is evident that the shifting of resources across the country is not reducing inequalities of access or of outcome. It is all about delivering a reformed system.

 My hon. Friend may be aware of the report commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in December 2004, in which the Institute of Rural Health reported on a survey of various agencies responsible for the collection of data from which funding decisions would subsequently be made. It said that the majority had no idea that they should be looking at rurality factors or collecting data against the definition of rurality, and were not gathering information that enabled anybody to distinguish between rural and urban areas and thus to make fair decisions for rural areas.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I do recall that. My hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) has published some material of his own on how we could deal with rural health problems and inequalities of access.

<p>
<a name="60216-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_246">The principle of evaluating policies for their impact on health inequalities is established in theory, but it has to be carried out in practice&#151;it is a rigorous process. Technically speaking, that is what the Acheson report recommended. I am not sure how well that has gone recently, given the inclusion of the Airdrie and Shotts provisions in the Health Bill at the end of last year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_247">Inequalities of access need to be tackled. The Government were right to point in their White Paper to the wide disparity in the availability of GPs in different parts of the country relative to their populations. I was entertained and impressed by the article from Simon Stevens, a former adviser at No. 10, who said that the language used in the White Paper exactly mirrored that used in 1920&nbsp;in relation to the distribution of doctors across the country. These are intractable problems, but we have to tackle them&#151;I make no bones about that. We have to ensure the availability of services in the

</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_248">I want to close with one further thought. As I said earlier, it is always invidious to try to single out major disease groups, but the Government, right at the start of their time in office, singled out cancers and coronary heart disease. I know why they did it, and it was not a dishonourable thing to have done, as cancers and coronary heart disease were the largest and most avoidable killers. However, the time has come for there to be a wider range of clinical priorities and for their distribution to be much more determined by clinicians, practitioners and professionals than to be dictated by a narrow range of Government targets. Stroke is a classic illustration of that. The National Audit Office report identified many things that could be done today that would not only deliver substantial improvements but save more than 500&nbsp;lives a year. That is the same number of lives that we set out to save in the Health Bill on Tuesday as a result of the changes to smoking. If the NHS took some of the necessary measures, such as immediate CT scans, 500&nbsp;lives could be saved today. That would save the NHS money. It would not cost it any more; it would not only be value for money but would reduce the cost of treatment. The same, as I said, is true for lung disease and the availability of pulmonary rehabilitation, for example.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_249">Such matters have to be dealt with, but for lung disease&#151;for all that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a real killer&#151;the disparities are striking. I was astonished to read that in the north and west mortality rates are 30&nbsp;per cent. above the national average; in the south they are 30&nbsp;per cent. below the average. Those are massive disparities. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, if the hon. Member for North Durham knows that, why is it not on the Government&#039;s priority list? Why is there no national service framework, since that is supposed to be how the Government have addressed such matters over the years? Why is the British Thoracic Society having to argue for a national service framework? Why has no national clinical director dealing with respiratory diseases been given the status of others? Why is there not pulmonary rehabilitation? Why do we not have routine spirometry in GP practices? If the hon. Gentleman wants those things to happen, why did he not intervene on the Minister to ask for them rather than intervening on me?
</p>





<p><a name="st_253"><a name="60216-28_spnew2"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones: </b> 
 I will not take any lessons from the Conservative party on COPD. The Government put in place the most generous compensation package for those miners whose health was ruined while the hon. Gentleman&#039;s Government refused to settle those claims for many years. It is a bit rich if he is trying to say that now.
</p>





<p><a name="st_254"><a name="60216-28_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman should understand that I am not asking him to take lessons from me, but from the British Thoracic Society. I am sure that even those former miners would take the view that the fact that they have been given compensation does not mean that they should not receive the highest quality health services. Of course they should, and that is what we are arguing for.

<a name="60216-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_250">To tackle health inequalities we require a focus on the evidence of the disease group from which those inequalities come, on the behavioural and environmental factors and on an understanding that relative inequalities will not necessarily be overcome, even if at the same time we&#151;like countries across the world&#151;improve aggregate health outcomes. As in the debate about Herceptin, if it is a national health service, the national part demands equitable access to services. It should not be distorted by the centre&#039;s failure to understand what clinical criteria should be applied on a consensual basis or by distorted funding from the Government to try to advantage some areas of the country. If we do all those things and improve the public health environment, I hope that in years to come a new Conservative Government will bring our reports back to the House and show that we have tackled and reduced health inequality.

 I am pleased that the subject of today&#039;s debate is tackling health inequalities because I have tried to address that issue in my constituency since my election in 1997. I have had first-hand knowledge of the Government&#039;s commitment to confronting and dealing with inequalities. Last week, more than 250&nbsp;people from two council wards in the south of my constituency braved a freezing February evening to attend a small reception hosted by the London borough of Merton and me to thank my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for saving their local general hospital, St. Helier. They wanted to thank her for listening to their concerns. Many were elderly or infirm and they had suffered for years as a result of inequalities in the health service, but they wanted to celebrate because they were so delighted that the health establishment&#039;s decision about where to locate a new hospital had been overruled in order to tackle health inequalities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_251">Inequalities in health care had become virtually unchallengeable by the end of 18&nbsp;years of Conservative Government. My constituency is one of the most disadvantaged in our strategic health authority&#039;s catchment area, with some of the greatest health needs, yet through the 1980s and 1990s, when the axe had to fall, it was my constituency that suffered the cuts. As a local councillor, I spent many years campaigning against plans to close our local community hospital, the Wilson hospital in Mitcham. I led thousands of campaigners in the fight against the local authority, but eventually the Tories won and Mitcham and Morden lost its last community hospital. Thankfully, the campaign to reopen the Wilson has carried on, and now, eight years after Labour came to power, we have learned that we are finally going to get our Wilson back. The Wilson is only one example of how the health establishment targeted Mitcham and Morden. In the past few months, we have uncovered secret local authority plans, dating back to the mid-1990s, in which the authority proposed to close our nearest general hospital, St. Helier. Thankfully, it was unable to do so before Labour came to power.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_252">The health establishment has scorned Mitcham and Morden for many years, and even now, despite many complaints from me, there is still no one who lives in Mitcham and Morden on any of the NHS boards that

<br>&nbsp;<br>make decisions about the lives of the people living there. So I should not have been surprised when St. Helier came under threat again more recently. It was saved only after the intervention of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health.This is a salutary tale. St. Helier is not actually in my constituency, but it serves half my constituents. It is part of the Epsom and St. Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust, which covers Merton, Sutton, Epsom and beyond, and which was created when Epsom hospital got into financial difficulties and merged with St. Helier in the 1990s. Epsom hospital had been struggling for some time, and the health authority decided to look at remodelling health care so that there would be one main hospital and several smaller community hospitals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_253">The health authority argued that the site of the main hospital&#151;the critical care hospital&#151;was not important, as the community hospitals would take most of the people who normally go to hospital. A public consultation took place to determine whether there was agreement with the proposals, and it soon became clear that the main issue would be where to put the critical care hospital, which would house the area&#039;s accident and emergency services and acute services such as maternity and obstetrics.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_254">My view is that the people who need critical care services the most are those who are the most disadvantaged and have the worst health. There is a strong link between social disadvantage, the need for emergency services, and health problems such as low birth weight and teenage pregnancy. As the vast majority of those with the greatest health needs live near St. Helier, I felt that having the critical care hospital there would be the best way to reduce health inequalities. Initially, the health establishment agreed&#151;in its original assessment, it gave St. Helier a 7&nbsp;per cent. higher score than a Sutton hospital site in Belmont.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_255">The public seemed to agree, following the consultation. Although fewer people from disadvantaged areas take part in public consultations, and although my own surveys were repeatedly ignored, St. Helier emerged as the top choice among the public for the location of the critical care hospital. However, last January, local NHS managers voted to overturn the views of residents and to build a new critical care hospital in Belmont, a very well-to-do suburb in Surrey. That decision meant that St. Helier would lose its accident and emergency, maternity and other critical care services. Belmont is one of the wealthiest areas in the country and people living close to it have very high life expectancy, very good access to health care and very high levels of private health care.

The highest prevalence of smoking is in my own city of Bristol, where it is 33&nbsp;per cent., and the lowest is in an area that has been mentioned several times today, east Dorset, where it is 20&nbsp;per cent. There are also great variations within areas. In the Henleaze ward in my constituency the figure is 12&nbsp;per cent., while in the Knowle West ward, in Bristol, South, the constituency of the Paymaster General, it is as high as 56&nbsp;per cent. Those wards are only about two and a half miles from each other. There is an enormous variation in quite a small geographic area. In broadly middle-class parts of the city, the prevalence of smoking is below 20&nbsp;per cent. In working-class or deprived communities it is always over 40&nbsp;per cent., and in some areas over 50&nbsp;per cent. Throughout the city, the rates are higher among men than among women.

I admit that I did not note that she voted for the exemption, but I am sure that the people of Liverpool will take careful note. As the hon. Gentleman will know, an excellent organisation called Smokefree Liverpool is promoting a private Bill to impose a full smoking ban throughout Liverpool&#151;of course, it will not now be necessary&#151;led by Liberal Democrat-controlled Liverpool city council.

<a name="stpa_267">Health outcomes are not always a matter of choice. They are often related to the accident of where people were born, their family circumstances, the occupation of family members, the housing in which they were brought up and the degree of poverty in their household. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) quoted from a briefing that I too received, from the British Thoracic Society, about chronic pulmonary diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma. Those diseases can often be linked with occupations in declining industrial areas. It is a complicated picture.

 It is often dangerous to presume too much knowledge of areas represented by other Members. I do not know the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency, but I am sure that he knows more about occupational patterns there than I do. The smoking industry in Bristol went into decline a long time ago. I think that only very expensive top-of-the-range cigars are still produced in south Bristol, although the world headquarters of Imperial Tobacco is still there. The white-collar jobs remain in the Bristol cigarette industry, but the blue-collar jobs do not. The hon. Gentleman is partly right, however: the incidence of smoking in south Bristol can, to an extent, be linked with the fact that workers in the Wills factories were given free cigarettes almost as part of their pay.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_268">What we did on Tuesday night to eliminate smoking in public places represents a big step towards narrowing health inequalities, but there is still much to be done. We need to deal with alcohol consumption, poor diet and other contributors to ill health.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_269">One thing that has not been mentioned so far today is the location of health care services. The recent White Paper on community services contains an interesting section on what the Government call &quot;under-doctored areas&quot;&#151;a phrase that I had not heard before. It includes a table showing the bottom 10&nbsp;per cent. of areas in England in terms of the number of general practitioners per 100,000&nbsp;of population. North Manchester PCT has 41, and Wigan PCT and Blackpool PCT each have 45. The accompanying map shows a clustering of low-level GP services in the north-west, south Yorkshire and Tyneside. Of course, they are the areas of greatest general deprivation in England, and they also have some of the worst health outcomes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_270">However, this is not just a north-south phenomenon. As is often quoted, Hastings is a pocket of poverty and deprivation on the south coast, so it is no surprise to discover that it has a GP rate of 46&nbsp;per 100,000&nbsp;people&#151;a figure that matches those for the north of England. According to the Department of Health, a GP rate of 58&nbsp;per 100,000&nbsp;people constitutes under-doctoring. On comparing PCTs across the country, it is clear that rural and more prosperous urban areas have twice as many GPs per head of population as the bottom 10&nbsp;per cent. of areas that I just mentioned. Interestingly, that distribution has not really changed since the NHS was formed in the 1940s. So Aneurin Bevan&#039;s vision of a health centre for every community in the country is still not that close to being realised, 60&nbsp;years after he pioneered his service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_271">There is, therefore, a correlation between a low concentration of GPs and the worst health outcomes. Given that the general trend of the White Paper is to move the focus of health care away from secondary and toward primary care&#151;and, we hope, toward preventive care as well&#151;it is all the more important, as we undertake that switch, that PCTs with under-doctored areas be given the incentives and resources that they need to ensure that everyone has access to a GP.
</p>

It is true that in many ways, men can be their own worst enemies, and not only in terms of visiting GPs. Men are three times more likely than women to become an alcoholic, and four times more likely to have a drug addiction. They are also more likely to be obese and to smoke. As the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire said earlier, we should not overlook our responsibilities in this regard. It is not simply a question of the Government providing services; we must all behave responsibility. None the less, according to the most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics, male life expectancy is 76.3&nbsp;years, whereas female life expectancy is 80.7&nbsp;years.

<a name="stpa_274">Of course, disparities have always existed and are often due to different working patterns, warfare, child-rearing and so on. None the less, at the start of the 21st century, social class is still a factor affecting health outcomes, and men still die younger than women do. Indeed, men are twice as likely as women to develop one of the 10&nbsp;most common cancers affecting both sexes, and especially bowel and lung cancer, but there remains a great disparity in outcomes in respect of cancers that are peculiar to gender. We heave heard about breast cancer already this afternoon in connection with the drug Herceptin. That debate highlights the fact that much more research is carried out into diseases that affect women than is the case with men, and that more drugs are available for women.
</p>

<a name="60216-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_275">On my lapel, I wear a blue metal symbol, and I get asked every day what it means. I have to make sure that it is the right way up, as otherwise people think that it has something to do with the Scottish National party. In fact, it represents a man covering his testicles and is meant to highlight testicular cancer. The pink ribbon campaign has been a great success in raising awareness of breast cancer among women, and has raised vast amounts of money for research into treatment. We need to put much more effort into raising awareness and funds in respect of the diseases that affect men.

<a name="60216-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_276">Bowel cancer affects both sexes. It can be treated successfully if it is caught early, but men are still more likely than women to die from it. Men in whom testicular cancer is detected early have a 90&nbsp;per cent. chance of getting successful treatment. That shows that the advice and support given to people is very important, as is their level of awareness of their own health, but we also need to look at the disparities between the support and advice that are offered to disease sufferers.

<a name="stpa_278">I turn briefly to children. We know that there is a disparity in the funding for hospices for children and for adults, and a debate on that subject has been held in Westminster Hall. However, there is also a difference in the support that is given to children whose parents have an illness that may be terminal. I shall raise that matter when I visit Bristol Royal Hospital for Children tomorrow morning.

<p>
<a name="60216-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_279">Health inequalities in this country arise between men and women and rich and poor, but inequalities due to race have not been mentioned much in this debate. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire mentioned the NAO report on stroke care, which was considered at last Wednesday&#039;s sitting of the Public Accounts Committee. A surprising fact that emerged from the report was that black and ethnic minority people are far more likely to die from strokes than are white people. No explanation of that finding was given, but it is clearly worth further investigation. Moreover, a black African person is 44&nbsp;per cent. more likely to be detained under mental health legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-30_para15">
<a name="stpa_280">Last week, the Minister and I debated sexual health and HIV in Westminster Hall, where I said that it had been shown that 45&nbsp;per cent. of new HIV cases in the city of Bristol in the past two years involve black African men. That is especially significant, given that they make up only about 4&nbsp;per cent. of the population. When we attempt to tackle health inequalities, we must look at the awareness of certain groups in society. We must tackle their reluctance to discuss their diseases, try to remove the stigma attached to doing so, and encourage them to find professional help.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-30_para16">
<a name="stpa_281">We need better access to services targeted at people who are at the greatest risk, and to ensure that interventions are made earlier.

<a name="60216-30_para17">
<a name="stpa_282">That raises questions about joined-up Government. I am a member of the Education and Skills Committee, which this week looked at how educational attainment varies between declining industrial areas and more prosperous parts of the country. In Bristol, the Bristol, West constituency has the highest uptake of higher education in the country, and the Bristol, South constituency has the lowest access to higher education. Educational attainment is also linked to poverty and therefore ill health.

<a name="stpa_283">In the early 1970s, statistics show that men were twice as likely to die young if they came from an unskilled group than if they came from a professional or managerial group. Thirty years on, they are three times as likely to die young. At the start of the 21st century, the difference in life expectancy between those who live in Dorset, which has been mentioned several times, and those who live in Manchester is 9.5&nbsp;years for boys and 6.9&nbsp;years for girls. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire mentioned Glasgow as an area where such health inequalities are starkly obvious, and I would add the south Wales valleys.

 I was fortunate enough last week to speak in the mental health debate and, listening to the debate today, I believe that the focus on public health and mental health has taken a step forward since 1997. For my constituency, public health is one of the key issues that we need to get right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_285">The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) mentioned behaviour and I have an example in my constituency. When Hull city council meets, it has a tea break at about 4&nbsp;o&#039;clock, at which it used to serve tea and cream scones. The portfolio holder for health decided that it would be better to provide apples and a bowl of nourishing soup. As hon. Members can imagine, that decision caused uproar at the time, but it sent a clear message. We are trying to promote healthy eating habits in Hull and the change sent a very positive message. I pay tribute to Councillor Glew who is battling hard in Hull to put public health at the top of the agenda.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_286">Hull is ranked ninth out of 354&nbsp;local authorities and districts in England in terms of deprivation. It is surrounded by the East Riding local authority, which is ranked 208th. I wish to compare some of the acute health statistics and show the difference with what is happening in my area. Hull has major health risks, with a high prevalence of smoking, a high consumption of alcohol and a bad diet. Those lead to high rates of coronary heart disease, diabetes and cancer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_287">I wish to make four points. I want to discuss Hull&#039;s health statistics; Hull and East Riding, and the unfairness in the funding available; what is happening in Hull now; and the positive and good aspects of what has been done since 1997. As I mentioned earlier, the local authority and the two primary care trusts in my area have a joint director of public health in Dr. Wendy Richardson, who is doing a sterling job. She has just published her annual report for 2005, in which she compares the life expectancy of men and women living in Hull and in Hambleton and Richmondshire, a rural area of north Yorkshire. She found that life expectancy for a man in Hull was 4.1&nbsp;years less than for a man living

<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1646</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in that north Yorkshire patch, just an hour up the road by car, while life expectancy for a woman in Hull was 2.6&nbsp;years less. The mortality rate for Hull is 120, on a UK average of 100, which means that our rate is 20&nbsp;per cent. higher than in the rest of the country. In Hambleton and Richmondshire, the rate is 89, 11&nbsp;per cent. below the average.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_288">I was delighted that this week we took the bold step of banning smoking in all enclosed public places. In the most deprived wards of my constituency, about 50&nbsp;per cent. of people smoke, when the national average is about 26&nbsp;per cent., so smoking is a real public health issue in Hull. Smokers are likely to live seven years less than non-smokers. As we have heard, Liverpool is trying to promote itself as a smoke-free city, as is Hull, so it is an enormous boost for a majority of Members to say that getting rid of smoking in public places is absolutely the right thing to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_289">Coronary heart disease in Hull is about 50&nbsp;per cent. higher than in the rest of England, so I contacted the two PCTs in my area to ask them about acute care for people suffering from that disease. Compared with Hull, East Riding has a higher percentage of people aged 65&nbsp;or over, but Hull has higher rates of deprivation, so after taking age into account one would expect mortality from coronary heart disease, as well as rates of treatment, to be considerably higher in Hull. Deaths from CHD are much higher in Hull, across all age groups and both genders, compared with East Riding. However, after taking age and gender into consideration, the rate of treatment for CHD is slightly lower for males and much lower for females in Hull, which is shocking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_290">Similarly, the number of hip replacements, after taking into account age and gender, is more than a quarter more for males in East Riding than it is in Hull. For females, the difference is even more dramatic: there are almost twice as many hip replacements&#151;91&nbsp;per cent. more&#151;for females in East Riding, a much more prosperous area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_291">Given the health profile of my constituency and the health needs of my constituents, those figures show that something is not right: there are health inequalities. People who live in East Riding may be more able and willing to visit their GPs, state their needs and demand treatment, whereas perhaps people in Hull do not have the same background and cannot stand up for themselves and say what they need, but the contrast is stark in terms of health inequalities.
</p>

<a name="60216-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_292">The PCTs in east and west Hull will break even in the current financial year, which is a tribute to the hard work of their chief executives, chairs and boards. However, the PCT that covers East Riding is massively overspent, so the strategic health authority has asked Hull PCTs to provide funding to meet its problems. Again, when we desperately want to put money into Hull and ensure that health inequalities are reduced, we must give money to a much more affluent, much healthier area to meet the mismanagement of health service finance there, and I am very concerned and upset about that.

We have also had initiatives such as free swimming for children to get them to exercise and to maintain that throughout their lives. Of course, Hull is lucky that it is a flat city, so people can cycle around it easily. We have one of the highest numbers of people cycling to work in the country.

Of course, we are allocated a little more money at the beginning because of our health needs, but we do not get the full amount because of what happens elsewhere. We took a bold step this week. Let us carry on being bold in tackling health inequalities, thus ensuring that the health inequality gap narrows for the next generation.

Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) that I want to focus on in particular. I think that her contribution to the debate was sparked by the fact that I told her a couple of days ago that I wished to address the issue of Sutton and St. Helier in my remarks, and I shall try to keep them brief.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_300">There is a substantial health and technical case against the Secretary of State&#039;s decision to overturn the recommendation of the local health community in Surrey and south-west London to site the new critical care hospital at Sutton rather than at St. Helier. The merits of that recommendation are substantial and it is the product of well over a year&#039;s work, with an enormous consultation process and the rest.

 That does not entirely surprise me because, if one examines the scale of the hon.

<a name="stpa_301">I want to address the substance of the issue: the merits of the case. I hope that the merits of the case for Sutton against St. Helier will now be addressed judicially. There is only one way to overturn the decision of a Secretary of State in these circumstances&#151;when the decision is perverse, unfair and, in my judgment, has been taken for reasons of party political advantage rather than because it best serves the health needs of the 500,000&nbsp;people who will be served by the critical care hospital. That is to invite a judge to review the decision, and I hope that that judicial review process is now in hand to put right this manifest unfairness.
</p>

<a name="stpa_302">It is not that case that I particularly wanted to deal with but the use of the term &quot;health inequalities&quot; by the hon. Lady in her lengthy campaign to secure St. Helier as the site of the hospital. She simply could not answer the central point that I made to her in two interventions, a point that has been made repeatedly in different ways during this debate. Primary care services and community care hospital services are far more effective at tackling the issues arising from health inequalities, particularly those arising for social and economic reasons. That is especially true under the new model proposed for hospital services in the area served by the Epsom and St. Helier trust, which serves 50&nbsp;per cent. of the hon.

I am afraid that we had a very similar case in 2001&nbsp;when a Labour Secretary of State for Health decided to intervene in the provision of secondary care in the south of my constituency, imposing a moratorium on the reorganisation of services between Crawley hospital and East Surrey hospital. That cost the trust &#163;10&nbsp;million a year, delayed for three years the implementation of important advances in services for my constituents and has left the trust burdened with the largest deficit of any secondary health care trust in the United Kingdom. That is a direct result of the intervention of the Labour Secretary of State for Health for party political reasons. I have produced a full memorandum on the issue and I regret to say that I will have to repeat it for what has happened in the north of my constituency for my constituents there.

<a name="stpa_305">During all the hon. Lady&#039;s efforts to secure the siting of the new critical care hospital at St. Helier, the fact that a community care hospital would be a more effective way of addressing health inequalities was repeatedly explained to her.

 I apologise to Members on both sides of the House for intervening again, but this is the last time I will do so. Who needs access to maternity care led by consultants? It is young women who smoke and have babies at an early age. Who needs access to an A and E department? It is people who do not have a GP. Those are the people in my constituency, so I certainly reject the idea that local care hospitals can meet the needs of my constituents and others surrounding the St. Helier site.

<p><a name="st_281"><a name="60216-32_spnew4"><b> Mr. Blunt: </b> 
 Three miles away from the St. Helier site is St. George&#039;s hospital in Tooting, 4&nbsp;miles away is the Kingston general hospital and 5&nbsp;miles away is the Mayday hospital. A rather greater distance away is the East Surrey hospital, whose trust has the largest deficit in the country. As a result of the Secretary of State&#039;s intervention, 7,000&nbsp;more people will present themselves at the A and E at that hospital and there will be 800&nbsp;more in-patients, which will require an additional 25&nbsp;permanent beds. That hospital cannot cope at the moment. The situation is bizarre. A simple examination of the map would suggest where the new hospital should be sited. The consequences for the 500,000&nbsp;people who are to be served by the critical care hospital and for those whose services will be deflected to other hospitals should be taken into consideration.

She knows that, I know that and, far more importantly, all the health care professionals involved in putting together the proposal know that. Yet the Secretary of State has intervened to overturn the recommendation of all the health care professionals, contrary to the view of the consultants, doctors and everyone else who will be involved.

That site would have attracted the very best doctors and consultants to serve the people whom both the hon. Lady and I represent.

 I welcome the debate and am pleased to contribute to it. My constituency is in eastern Greater Manchester and covers two local authority areas. The first, Tameside, like much of east Manchester, contains a number of deprived areas, which consequently have serious public health problems. The second, Stockport, is considered one of the most affluent areas in north-west England, but, despite that, it must be recognised that there are areas of serious deprivation in Stockport, including parts of the borough that form my constituency. In socio-economic terms, they have much more in common with Tameside and east Manchester than with the prosperous areas of Bramhall and Cheadle in the south of the borough.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_309">More than 100&nbsp;years ago, at the height of the industrial revolution, the city fathers of Manchester sought to make a radical improvement in the health of the growing population by ensuring a supply of clean drinking water from the Lake district. Almost overnight, the rates of cholera and other preventable diseases plummeted. That, along with other sanitation services and the provision of public parks&#151;I believe that one of the first municipal parks in the country was in Greater Manchester&#151;was the first major step towards greatly improving public health in our major cities. With the introduction of the NHS in the late 1940s, there was a remarkable improvement in public health. I am proud of the fact that the former Denton urban district council was among the first councils to adopt the Clean Air Act 1956.

<a name="60216-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_313">Mr. Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, I wish to focus on the work undertaken by agencies throughout Denton and Reddish to tackle issues of concern. First, as a result of the single regeneration budget round 5&nbsp;funds, there has been tremendous investment in the regeneration of the most deprived parts of the constituency. In Haughton Green, SRB funding has enabled the provision of innovative community-based health services in a new joint community and health centre. The services are provided by numerous agencies, but come together under one roof to provide local people with access to housing and homeless services, local health services, benefit advice, access to the credit union, child care help and advice for young people, including advice related to tackling sexual health issues and teenage pregnancies. That superb facility has provided the local community with a new resource.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_314">Adjacent to the Haughton Green community and health centre are the Haughton Green playing fields. Again, spearheaded by SRB 5&nbsp;and the commitment of the neighbourhood forum and local councillors, major funding was secured to refurbish completely the rather derelict, overgrown waste of space. Through community consultation, a bid for doorstep green funding was secured and that public open space in an urban area that lacks good-quality open space has been transformed into a community asset to be proud of. Not only were the football pitches drained, new play areas for toddlers, children and teens, and a new floodlit multi-purpose games area were provided. Even the old bowling green was restored after being out of action for at least two decades. Now, the area is used by all the community. A bowling club has been established and the sports development unit at Tameside metropolitan borough council ensures that the state-of-the-art sports facilities are well used by local youths in particular. That is crucial, not least to ensure that the ticking obesity time bomb is diffused in communities such as Haughton Green.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_315">I also want to highlight the impact that Sure Start is having in my constituency, offering access to a variety of services such as child care and health advice, providing new parents with the skills necessary to be a parent, and developing simple skills such as cooking. These are crucial in areas such as Haughton Green and other parts of Denton and Reddish. Sure Start is beginning to address long-standing problems and I am proud that my constituency will eventually benefit from six Sure Start centres. I point especially to the good work being done by Reddish Vale early years centre in the Stockport part of my seat, which provides all the services that I mentioned. It has undoubtedly been a resounding success.

<a name="60216-32_para16">
<a name="stpa_316">I draw to the attention of the House the work of Tameside youth service and the Tameside and Glossop primary care trust in providing services to young people throughout the borough. Whether we like it or not, many teenagers find themselves in situations where they have access to alcohol and sometimes to drugs. Usually as a consequence of being under the influence of those substances, they may be more inclined to have, or be at risk of having, unprotected sex.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-32_para17">
<a name="stpa_317">In connection with the borough&#039;s health targets and the crime and disorder partnership, the joint service offered by the PCT and the youth service provides local young people with an all-in-one support service on drug abuse, alcohol abuse and sexual health issues. As a result of the latter, teenage pregnancy levels in the borough are starting to show an improvement. I commend to the Minister the recent report of Tameside&#039;s health and education services scrutiny panels on teenage pregnancies, which describes in much more detail the progress being made in the borough.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-32_para18">
<a name="stpa_318">Finally, I highlight the proposals of Tameside and Glossop primary care trust to devolve primary care services to local communities. Three primary care centres are being developed which will provide services far more locally than ever before. A range of services previously available at only the district hospital or outside the borough will be available in the state of the art new centres. Importantly in the context of the present debate, the centres will be located in some of the most deprived wards in the borough. One of the wards, St. Peters, which is partly in my constituency and partly in the constituency of Ashton-under-Lyne, is in the top 5&nbsp;per cent. of deprived wards in the whole country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-32_para19">
<a name="stpa_319">The availability of services locally is important because too many people from areas like St. Peters do not have access to good services if those are not available in the communities. Whether because of low car ownership or poor bus services, if facilities are too far away, people will not access them, so I commend Tameside and Glossop primary care trust for taking the services directly to those communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-32_para20">
<a name="stpa_320">Leading and responding to the debate is a Health Minister, and a very good one at that, but I could fill up the Front Bench for this, because tackling health inequalities is a responsibility not just of the Department of Health. I have spoken of the single regeneration budget, community regeneration, the crime and disorder strategy and sports development, but I could also mention the hundreds of millions of pounds being invested by New Charter Housing and Irwell Valley Housing through stock transfer, and by Stockport Homes through an arm&#039;s length management organisation, which will bring the area&#039;s housing stock up to the decent homes standards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-32_para21">
<a name="stpa_321">I could talk about the new schools being built and the innovative joint services being developed with the NHS and social services, or the new jobs coming into the area through redevelopment and regeneration schemes. Put simply, tackling health inequalities involves cross-cutting responsibilities. When that is looked at as a whole, the Government have much to be proud of.

 I shall try to be brief, as I know that others of my hon. Friends want to speak.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1653</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_322">I listened to the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne) with fascination. I have begun to realise what it must have been like for the little boy pressing his nose to the window of the pie shop, wishing he could get his hands on some of the goodies. I represent Torridge and West Devon, which is one of the most rural constituencies in England. In the few minutes of the House&#039;s time that I shall occupy, I shall concentrate on rural health inequalities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_323">The constituency that I represent cannot tell a story of such gladness and happiness as the hon. Gentleman has just recited. It is suffering cuts. Constituents who are in need of medical services often have to travel dozens, if not hundreds of miles to receive it. We have acute and primary care trusts in deficit. They are closing community beds, have shut down minor injuries units, and are considering further cuts on top of those. An acute hospital trust is &#163;9&nbsp;million in debt and two out of three primary care trusts are between &#163;1&nbsp;million and &#163;3&nbsp;million in debt. I know that the Government will say that mismanagement is almost certainly the only explanation for those predicaments, but I submit to the House that there is another, longer-term reason, and it has to do with the system of allocation of resources to rural areas in England.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_324">On 10&nbsp;January this year, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) asked the Secretary of State to look again at the resource allocation system for rural PCTs. He was told that a review had been carried out by the advisory committee on resource allocation and that as a result,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;the formula takes account of the effects of access, transport and poverty in calculating health need in rural areas.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 10&nbsp;January 2006; Vol. 441, c. 601W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_325">However, things are definitely not all right. It is widely recognised by experts who have examined the subject that the indices of deprivation which partly govern the allocation of resources fail to capture rural health needs. The characteristics that make that so are reasonably well understood, although perhaps their quantitative effects are not. What is to blame is the national weighted capitation formula, which is based on the age distribution of the population, additional need, and unavoidable geographical variations in the cost of providing services. The indices adopted by the formula use inappropriate proxies for deprivation in rural communities, and research has highlighted an inherent bias towards urban areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_326">It is absurd to apply to Torridge and West Devon a measurement that depends on car ownership. Everybody in the countryside who can possibly scrimp and save to buy a car will do so. It must be the same in the rural constituencies represented by Labour Members. If we adopt a proxy for rural health need that is based on car ownership, we will get a distorted picture of the needs in that rural area. It is absurd to base an assessment or measurement of health needs on the proportion of ethnic minorities in the seat. As we know, it is a documented fact that there are fewer ethnic minorities in rural areas, but that does not mean that there is less isolation, less poverty and less financial disadvantage. Nevertheless, that is the effect of the formula.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1654</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_327">As we heard earlier, rural deprivation tends to be hidden, because people living in poverty in rural areas are dispersed across heterogeneous communities. Therefore, the indices that aim to define areas as deprived ignore profound and genuine need in rural areas. People in the countryside are a hardy breed. They are proud, self-reliant and independent-minded, and there is characteristically&#151;a researched and documented fact&#151;a low uptake of benefits. That, too, disguises the true level of deprivation in rural areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_328">The costs of geographical variations are underestimated. Delivering services in rural areas is more expensive because of poor economies of scale, unproductive time spent travelling by health care professionals and patients alike, and additional telecommunication costs. There are additional expenses associated with transport, including higher fuel costs, providing mobile and outreach services, maintaining branch surgeries, dispersed community hospitals and providing training and support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_329">The Minister has said that the current formula for resource allocation to PCTs takes rural factors into account, but if one examines the fifth edition of the weighted capitation formula, which is an 88-page document, the word &quot;rural&quot; appears seven times in a single section about ambulance trusts. That document states, for example, that need is assessed with reference to the number of GP surgery visits, but people in rural areas do not go to their doctors as often as people in urban areas. In rural areas, GP surgeries often involve single-handed practices; people find it difficult to attend GP surgeries for want of transport; and cultural factors sometimes prevent people from admitting that they are ill. In rural areas, one cannot depend on the number of people who visit GPs to assess the primary medical services component.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_330">Those are the reasons why the people of rural communities do not believe the Government when they talk a good game on delivering rural health services and tackling rural deprivation. The people do not believe them on health, and they do not believe them on education, which is another important factor in any assessment of deprivation. This year, the schoolchildren of Devon will receive &#163;308&nbsp;a pupil less than the national funding average, and next year they will receive &#163;330&nbsp;less, which is a function of the sixth worst education grant in the country. The people are entitled to doubt the Government&#039;s commitment to rural areas in the south-west.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_331">A radical change in direction is needed. In countries such as Australia, Canada and even Scotland, rural adjustments are made, and it is accepted that the indices for the allocation of resources are flawed when they are applied to rural areas. In those countries, systematic research is conducted to capture those needs, and although the Government have made pious noises about compiling a rural database from which to make an accurate assessment of rural needs, little has been done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_332">In an earlier intervention, I referred to the December 2004&nbsp;DEFRA technical report, which shows that most of the agencies from which DEFRA seeks information are simply not equipped to distinguish between the rural and the urban in the data that they collect. The health funding formula is based on the work of those agencies. Only last week, the Government&#039;s chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, said in the foreword to a booklet:

<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_333">A concerted multi-agency approach is required, and every agency and every Department should ensure that information distinguishes between the urban and the rural. It is time for the Government to live up to the CMO&#039;s admirable sentiments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_334">The Government have wept crocodile tears over the plight of the countryside for eight and a half years. Farming and tourism are the twin pillars of the rural economy, but as farming has declined, English tourism has been undersold and the way of life in rural communities has been decimated by insensitivity and neglect, we have been told that it is all right, because Labour is concentrating on the things that matter to people in the towns and the countryside&#151;education, health and poverty. However, those claims ring hollow when they are judged by the reality in the rural south-west, where people perceive a casual indifference to their areas.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_335">If the real needs of rural people are not identified by a concerted and coherent effort, which I have discussed, health inequalities can only get worse.

<p><a name="st_284"><a name="60216-33_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jeremy Hunt  (South-West Surrey) (Con):</b> 
 I wanted to contribute to the debate because there is a fundamental flaw in the way in which the Government approach health inequalities that leads to serious discrimination against two groups of people. Let us take as an example a child who goes to St. Mark&#039;s Church of England primary school in Godalming, in my constituency. Godalming is an affluent Surrey town, which in many ways represents the stereotype of Surrey towns alluded to by Labour Members. For the children who go to St. Mark&#039;s, the reality is different.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para14">
<a name="stpa_336">Of the children at the school, 35&nbsp;per cent. have special needs. Teachers have told me that in some classes 80&nbsp;per cent. of the children have special needs. One teacher told me of a child fed on nothing but rice for five days. Staff turnover is high, and although the school is now on the up it is a pocket of deprivation in an otherwise affluent area and has the same health needs as the inner cities. It is somewhere where social breakdown, a lack of education and a lack of money lead to less healthy diets and worse health outcomes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para15">
<a name="stpa_337">How does the NHS funding formula, designed to tackle health inequalities, treat the families of those who go to St. Mark&#039;s? If they need elective surgery, they will have to wait two to three times longer than people in virtually any city or virtually anywhere the north of the country. They will wait 26&nbsp;weeks for ear, nose and throat surgery, compared with a 13&nbsp;week wait in Manchester. They will wait 25&nbsp;weeks for breast surgery, compared with 15&nbsp;weeks in Leicester. They will wait 36&nbsp;weeks for trauma and orthopaedics work, compared with 12&nbsp;weeks in Sedgefield.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para16">
<a name="stpa_338">The NHS funding formula punishes poor families in rich areas, because it can only deal in averages. How does it work in practice? In Guildford and Waverley we

<br>&nbsp;<br>get an increase of about 3&nbsp;per cent. because of the high proportion of elderly people. The market forces factor, because of the cost of health care, increases the funding by 7&nbsp;per cent. However, the additional needs factor decreases our funding by 25&nbsp;per cent. because we are apparently an affluent area. So, somewhere that spends 3&nbsp;per cent. less than the national per capita average is told that it should spend 20&nbsp;per cent. less. Who suffers? The families of children who go to places such as St. Mark&#039;s.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para17">
<a name="stpa_339">St. Mark&#039;s is 2&nbsp;miles away from Milford hospital, a specialist rehabilitation hospital that the PCT is trying to close. If it is closed, the poverty in the area surrounding St. Mark&#039;s will get worse. If Haslemere hospital, just up the road, is closed&#151;the PCT is consulting about removing all the beds&#151;those who will suffer are not the wealthy people who can afford to go private but the pensioners on a basic state pension who do not have that choice. That is the madness of a system based on a mathematical average of health outcomes that cannot account for individual circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para18">
<a name="stpa_340">One more group is badly discriminated against. Every week, 90&nbsp;severely disabled children are born in this country. The lives of 90&nbsp;families are turned upside down. One would think that in the fourth largest economy in the world we would look after those people properly, but for many families the help and support they get is little better than it would have been 100&nbsp;years ago. A system that funds to reduce the inequality of the outcome inevitably prioritises acute care over chronic long-term conditions. According to a Mencap survey, 48&nbsp;per cent. of the parents of severely disabled children get no care from the state. A further 30&nbsp;per cent. get less than two hours care a week from the state. Only 20&nbsp;per cent. of such families are able to get any respite at all. The result is a cycle of deprivation. Often the father cannot cope and leaves the mother to bring up the disabled child on her own. She cannot possibly work in such a situation, so the social exclusion starts and gets worse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para19">
<a name="stpa_341">Why does the health inequalities agenda fail? As my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) said, we share the objective of reducing inequalities. The agenda fails because of the neo-Stalinist focus on health outcome rather than on access to health care. If the objective is to equalise health outcomes so that people have the same life expectancy in Sheffield as they do in Somerset and in Bath as they do in Bolton, we have to be careful that a mathematical formula does not end up inadvertently denying health care to Surrey, Sussex and Hampshire to make people die more quickly there than they would in Sheffield, Manchester or Leeds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para20">
<a name="stpa_342">That approach is flawed because it ignores the fact that health outcomes are the product of choice as well as of circumstance. It fails poorer families who happen to live in affluent areas and those with long-term chronic conditions because it prioritises outcomes, and those people have outcomes that will never improve. Most of all, the approach is flawed because it simply does not work. The point of targets is to motivate managers in organisations to decide on their priorities.

<a name="60216-33_para22">
<a name="stpa_344">The crystal test of a target is whether an NHS manager can look at it and know what he or she should do next, but it is impossible to look at that target and know what should be done to achieve it. NHS mangers have similar targets for smoking, cancer, teenage pregnancy, obesity, infant mortality and mortality. These targets are failing, and that has been a fundamental element of this afternoon&#039;s debate. We all want to eliminate health inequalities, but we are failing to do so because the system of targets is over-focused on health outcomes and not focused enough on inequalities of access to health care.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-33_para23">
<a name="stpa_345">I am generally suspicious of targets because I want a decentralised NHS in which local GPs and managers have the flexibility to determine the health needs of their own area. However, if we are going to use targets, there should be just one or two, related to absolute improvements in health outcomes for the lowest socio-economic groups, rather than a multiplicity of targets relating to relative improvements. We must prioritise equality of access to health care as much as equality of outcome. That is vital for the elderly on state pensions, for poor families&#151;wherever they live&#151;and for disabled people with chronic long-term conditions. They, after all, were the people for whom the NHS was set up.

<p><a name="st_285"><a name="60216-34_spnew0"><b> Mr. John Baron  (Billericay) (Con):</b> 
 We have had a short but useful debate this afternoon, in which hon. Members on both sides of the House have highlighted the extent to which the Government have failed to address the issue of health inequalities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_346">The hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) understandably talked about local health issues, but failed to explain why health inequalities had actually widened under this Government. The hon. Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams) explained how health outcomes were not simply a matter of choice. In referring to differing GP availability rates, he correctly observed that access was also important.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_347">The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson) said that life expectancy rates in Hull were poor compared with those in the rest of the country. She also talked about the need for better financial management by her local trusts. My hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) passionately and rightly expressed his concern about the Secretary of State&#039;s intervention for political reasons in important health matters such as the siting of a new hospital, and about the adverse effect that that could have on his constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_348">The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne) reminded us that the Conservatives Clean Air Act 1956&nbsp;had contributed to better health outcomes, and I thank him for that. My hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox) powerfully pointed out that the cuts in health services were closing community beds and minor injuries units to the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1658</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>detriment of his constituents. He talked about the need for the resource allocation system to be re-examined because of its apparent inbuilt bias against rural health needs. He said that his constituents were suffering accordingly, that the real needs of rural people were not being recognised, and that that situation needed to be corrected now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_349">Finally, my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) rightly pointed out that the NHS funding formula punishes poor families in rich areas and that a high percentage of carers in the families of those with long-term medical conditions are unable to get respite care. The need, therefore, is to address access to services as well as outcomes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_350">A good number of those and many other contributions made outside this place have made it clear that strategies to reduce health inequalities are not having the impact that we all want. Indeed, the Government&#039;s own figures, as was mentioned earlier, confirm that progress has not been made. The Department of Health&#039;s public service agreement target aims at reducing inequalities in health outcomes by 10&nbsp;per cent. by 2010, as we have heard, using 1998&nbsp;as a start date, as measured by infant mortality and life expectancy at birth&#151;yet, as we have also heard this afternoon, a progress report made in August last year confirmed that those inequalities have widened since 1998.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_351">The Government&#039;s figures are not the only statistics that highlight Labour&#039;s failure to tackle inequalities in health outcomes. According to a joint study by the universities of Bristol and Sheffield last year, there is a 10-year difference in life expectancy between the most affluent and the most deprived areas of the United Kingdom. There are many other such reports.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_352">Clearly, those depressing statistics reflect patterns of poverty and social deprivation across the country. There is, of course, a link between poor health and poverty&#151;something that was questioned by an hon. Member who is no longer in his place. I should perhaps say at this point that some of what the Minister has said risks creating the impression that she believes that only on her side of the House are there Members with a social conscience. Among those on the Conservative Benches, too, the wish to help the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in society is the reason we came into politics, but we sit on these Benches because we do not believe that big government and socialist dogma are the way to achieve that goal&#151;quite the opposite.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_353">Having said that, we should be careful of overstating the causal link between poverty and ill health. Unhealthy lifestyle is the more direct and relevant causal factor. The Government have still not done enough to persuade people in areas with the highest deprivation levels to adopt lifestyle changes that would do most to improve health outcomes. Smoking provides one worrying example. According to the Library, 17&nbsp;per cent. of those in managerial and professional occupations smoke. The figure rises to 29&nbsp;per cent. among those employed in the routine and manual sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_354">Such simple facts powerfully argue for a much more ambitious public health and awareness campaign. Conservative Members pledged to put those themes at the heart of our policies if elected last year. The 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1659</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Government should now do the same. However, their public health record is poor. Indeed, it was described by the British Medical Association as &quot;dilatory and disgracefully complacent&quot; and a &quot;calamity&quot;. Only recently, Ministers produced an unworkable smoking policy before being forced into a total ban by their own Back Benchers. Meanwhile, Labour has presided over accelerating obesity and sexually transmitted infection rates.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_355">As well as disturbing regional variations in lifestyles and health outcomes, there are unacceptable postcode lotteries in access to services and treatments, which has been referred to on previous occasions. Cancer is one area in which the Government have claimed a great success. Indeed, there have been improvements in services and patient experience, but cancer still exemplifies inequalities of both kinds. In terms of outcomes, a recent Public Accounts Committee report highlighted persistent and unacceptable variations depending on where patients live. For example, the figure for lung cancer deaths is twice as high in the worst region compared with the best. Breast cancer death rates are 20&nbsp;per cent. higher in some regions in the north than in others, which are mainly in the south. Men with prostate cancer have a 10&nbsp;per cent. better chance of surviving for five years if they live in London or the south-east than in Trent and the northern and Yorkshire regions. That is on top of the inequality already suffered by men with prostate cancer, who report significantly poorer experience of care than patients with other cancers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_356">Uptake of drugs and technologies recommended by NICE also reflects wide variations, a fact recognised by the cancer tsar in a report back in 2004. We know that use of the breast cancer drug Herceptin one year after the NICE recommendation ranged from a staggering 90&nbsp;per cent. of eligible women in Dorset to a dismal 16&nbsp;per cent. in Essex. In relation to early-stage breast cancer, it is incredible that Ann Marie Rogers had to go to the High Court to clarify the Secretary of State&#039;s direction last autumn, in which she seemed to suggest that PCTs could not withhold the drug on consideration of cost alone. By not making additional resources available at the time, however, she might have done as much to exacerbate inequalities as to reduce them, particularly at a time of worsening deficits. The charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer commented:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;This drug could save the lives of 1,000&nbsp;women a year and it is unfair and cruel for women like Ann Marie Rogers to know that it is money and their postcode that stands between them and this potentially life-saving treatment.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_357">The whole situation is a nonsense caused by this Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_358">The problem of regional variations in access to drugs and technology is not restricted to cancer. Photodynamic therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration was approved for use in the NHS in September 2003. Only last autumn, however, data presented by the Macular Disease Society and the Royal National Institute of the Blind showed that 30&nbsp;per cent. of people in the UK who could have benefited from PDT had not been treated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_359">NICE was set up to address the postcode lottery in access to drugs and treatments. However, the Government must now address the postcode lottery in implementation of NICE guidance. In particular, they 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1660</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>should follow the Conservative policy of ensuring that NICE appraisals are carried out in conjunction with a full resource implementation assessment, so that national guidance is realistic, implemented and successful. More broadly, NHS bodies should be subject to a statutory duty to implement NICE guidelines on standards of care as well as drugs and technologies. In a devolved health service, it is essential that patients are given clear entitlements to treatment. That will help particularly the 17&nbsp;million patients who suffer from long-term medical conditions and who are increasingly realising that in a target-driven culture, conditions that are not targeted suffer unduly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_360">Chiropody services for elderly people and rehabilitation services for the visually impaired are two sad examples of the type of care for long-term conditions that suffers in a devolved service when Government targets are focused on the acute sector and politically sensitive waiting times. A survey by the Conservatives showed that more than half of chiropody services had recently raised the eligibility criteria for access to treatment, with the average department undermanned by a shocking 25&nbsp;per cent. Meanwhile, with regard to the nearly half a million people in the country registered as blind or partially sighted, the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association has estimated that as many as 20&nbsp;per cent. of local authorities have no dedicated rehabilitation services, with nearly 80&nbsp;per cent. overall admitting that services were restricted due to a shortage of suitably qualified staff.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para15">
<a name="stpa_361">With an estimated half of all NHS trusts going into deficit, inequalities in local services and patient care are bound to increase. Hon. Members have already highlighted cases in their constituencies where services are being cut in order to balance the books. This latest development comes from a Government who spent years bombarding the NHS with targets and bureaucracy and then destabilised trusts with bungled reforms. The Government have not tackled health inequalities&#151;in fact, they have widened in recent years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-34_para16">
<a name="stpa_362">By not implementing a strong public health programme and not radically improving the NHS, the Government have failed to break the link between poverty and ill health. All the evidence suggests that when unreformed state services do not perform as well as they should, the less well-off tend to be let down the most. Meanwhile, inequalities in access to services have also proliferated. As Conservative Members have argued, postcode lotteries will be ended only if NICE is given the tools and instructions to create a culture of standards and entitlements in the NHS. Until patients have those entitlements, health inequalities will continue to widen.

 I think you will see in <i>Hansard</i>, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that I gave way extensively during my opening speech. As I now have less time than was taken by the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron), I want to make some progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_364">Tackling public health issues is hugely important. The situation will not change overnight, but we must accept the challenges, some of which have embedded themselves over many years. There has been an increase in sexually transmitted infections, for instance, but in many other respects we live in a world that is very different from the world of 10, 20&nbsp;and 30&nbsp;years ago. I pay tribute to the Labour politicians who established the national health service, but their concept of the health service that was needed then was very different from the service that we need today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_365">Many other things have changed. Work has changed enormously. In my constituency, a mining constituency, the number of miners who suffer from respiratory disease is heartbreaking for those individuals and their families. At least the miners must be encouraged by the Government&#039;s decision to meet the claim for compensation for that industrial disease.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_366">We in the Labour party have an historic commitment to fight for ways of tackling inequalities. That has meant fighting for safe working conditions, decent housing, a national minimum wage and&#151;in earlier campaigns&#151;clean water, public sewerage and public parks. Those campaigns are all part of the overall picture.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_367">I think that all Members agree that, in general, everyone is living longer and everyone is healthier, but we must deal with the gap caused by health inequalities. One reason for that gap is the way in which services are being delivered, but there is another reason. It is interesting, but we have not much time in which to explore it. Research suggests that those who are better off and better educated can gain access more quickly to NHS services such as information and an understanding of how lifestyle choices affect health, and that that enables them to make choices more quickly. That is part of the problem. The more we provide such services, the more the better off take advantage of them before poorer people can do so. We must therefore provide services in a different way because there is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; solution. It is not enough to organise national education campaigns with advertisements on television, or to provide services on the internet. We need to find a better way of working in communities to give people the support that they need.

<a name="stpa_368">Reference was made earlier to the need for people to feel confident about talking to their GPs, demanding services and making their voices heard. I am afraid that it is an indication of modern life that more affluent people are often more confident, shout the loudest and get the services, whereas poorer people perhaps have less confidence and do not. That is unacceptable. For some reason, GPs do not want to work in our poorest areas, which is also unacceptable. Perhaps they prefer working in more affluent communities.

The figures are not absolute&#151;they constitute a reduction in the gap between the average for England and the figure applying to the five most deprived areas. I accept that infant mortality has risen: it rose by 19&nbsp;per cent. in 2001&#150;03, and by 19&nbsp;per cent. in 2002&#150;04. That is unacceptable, but there was no increase during the second tranche, which I hope shows that the situation is not getting worse. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I have accepted that the figure has risen, but it has stabilised and we must try to reduce it.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_372">On public health structures, I am glad that the Conservatives agree with us about joint appointments, which we are encouraging. My first speech as Minister with responsibility for public health was made at the invitation of the Faculty of Public Health. I pointed out at its conference that, in my view, that is the direction in which we should go, and there some very good examples of such practice. However, we must recognise that it is more than just a question of appointing someone to serve the local authority and health services in a joint capacity; there must also be a change in the culture and mindset of all the organisations involved, so that they can work together. Local area agreements are important in that regard, and the consideration of health inequalities must form an integral part of the assessment of local authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_373">The health trainers programme is based on the Bandera study, which is a psychological behaviour change model. It shows that one-to-one, structured motivation techniques empower individuals to change their lifestyles. In our view, providing such services to those who are taking advantage of other forms of information and support is a good way forward. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence is working closely with us on the development of the life checks model.

Our proposal to allow pharmacies and nurses to play a greater role in prescribing will allow them to add to the role played by GPs; they will not replace GPs.

<p><a name="st_303"><a name="60216-36_spnew3"><b> Jeff Ennis  (Barnsley, East and Mexborough) (Lab):</b> 
 I am pleased to have this opportunity to draw the House&#039;s attention to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds&#039;s Old Moor wetlands centre in my constituency, which I believe is very much a best practice model for the Government&#039;s sustainable communities agenda.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_382">Given the type of seat that I represent, I am an avid supporter of the Government&#039;s sustainable communities agenda. After all, having witnessed at first hand the total devastation visited on my local communities by the previous Government&#039;s politically motivated pit closure programme of the late 1980s and early 1990s, I know that it is important that the Government ensure that future local community development is founded on the principle of sustainability. The Old Moor centre is a classic example of the type of good practice that we as a Government need to develop, in south Yorkshire and across the rest of the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_383">Twenty years ago, the site of the Old Moor wetlands was part of a much larger area known as the Wath Manvers complex which, by the early 1990s, had become the largest area of despoiled land in the whole of western Europe. Something drastic needed to be done, and the three Dearne valley local authorities&#151;Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster&#151;decided to work collaboratively on the project when they won city challenge funding from the previous Government. Indeed, my local authority of Barnsley ended up being the only local authority in England to win two city challenges, which exemplifies its efficiency and effectiveness and&#151;I am pleased to say&#151;that continues to this day. I would say that of course, being a former leader of Barnsley council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_384">The development of Old Moor wetlands was the brainchild of Robin Norbury, a good friend of mine, the former planning chairman on Barnsley council and member for the Darton ward. It became part of the wider regeneration city challenge project to rebrand the Dearne valley. The other flagship projects under city challenge included the development of Dearne valley college, addressing the skills deficit in the Dearne valley, and the designation of one of the last enterprise zones in England, the Dearne valley enterprise zone. All those flagship projects have been highly successful in transforming the Dearne valley into an economically and environmentally attractive area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_385">The Government&#039;s sustainable communities programme offers significant challenges to how we deliver genuine sustainable development. The Old Moor wetlands centre has demonstrated that it is possible to deliver green infrastructure, enhance wildlife populations and conserve natural resources while offering jobs, education and recreational opportunities to local people. The benefits from investing in wildlife and places such as the Old Moor centre are manifold. We need to convince all in Government that that is the right path to take.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1666</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_386">Old Moor has proven to be an excellent example of how green infrastructure can be developed to help contribute to the Government&#039;s sustainable communities agenda, and that has been achieved thanks to significant support from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Yorkshire Forward and Waste Recycling Environmental Ltd. It has also built on the splendid work done by Barnsley council to create a wetland environment and bring the reserve to the point where it is nationally important for wintering wader birds. Old Moor has helped to deliver a fantastic resource for birds and people, thanks to the generosity of RSPB members and the many funding partners who have contributed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_387">Old Moor is a demonstration of what can be achieved in the restoration of former coalfields, and I hope that that approach can be replicated across the country, as part of the Government&#039;s sustainable communities agenda. Restoration of former coalfields has created excellent places for wildlife. The reserve buildings also feature renewable energy technologies and have provided new facilities for local communities, including conference facilities for local business and community groups.
</p>





<p><a name="st_304"><a name="60216-36_spnew4"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 The Old Moor project is a flagship for the restoration and regeneration of the Dearne valley and it sounds much like the Sent valley project in my own village, which is part of the wider regeneration of north-west Leicestershire. The key to that very successful project has been community involvement at volunteer level&#151;not at employee or passive visitor level, although that has been useful. It is that volunteer involvement that has built the links. Has it also been crucial at Old Moor?
</p>





<p><a name="st_305"><a name="60216-36_spnew5"><b> Jeff Ennis: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a valid point, and I shall come to the role of volunteers shortly. Their role is vital. Not only does it improve the quality of life of the volunteer, but it enhances the quality of life of those whom the volunteering helps.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_388">In all, the reserve employs 24&nbsp;people and has increased the viability of local businesses by adopting a local sourcing policy. Wildlife tourism is big business. People travel to see natural spectacles, and spend money at local shops and other businesses. The total number of visitors expected by the centre in this financial year is 65,000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_389">The RSPB has created a number of wildlife viewing opportunities for the local community and has demonstrated that rare species can be an asset for the local economy. For example, in the year after the foot and mouth outbreak, 70,000&nbsp;people visited an osprey viewing site in the Lake district, demonstrating that the attraction of wildlife can draw people back to the countryside. Osprey watching at the nine sites in Britain managed by the RSPB is worth a staggering &#163;2.5&nbsp;million to local economies. The phenomenon is not restricted to birds of prey. Marine mammals tourism generates &#163;8&nbsp;million a year for the west coast of Scotland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_390">On the education front, about 4,000&nbsp;schoolchildren a year enjoy visits to experience and see renewable technologies through the Old Moor reserve&#039;s field teaching programme. Nationally, nearly 50,000&nbsp;children benefit from RSPB facilities. The society believes that all 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1667</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>children should be able to benefit from out-of-classroom learning, because all our modern technology and sophisticated teaching practices and living are no substitute for a child getting out of the classroom to experience nature and culture at first hand&#151;getting their hands dirty, as we say in Yorkshire. That can link to, and help to achieve, many Government objectives, such as those on children&#039;s health, citizenship, social inclusion and the reduction of deprivation, crime and unemployment. The site&#039;s award-winning, energy-efficient visitor centre makes use of renewable energy technologies; it has a biofuel burner, solar panels, a wind turbine and a solar water heater.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para12">
<a name="stpa_391">On the health front, physical inactivity costs the national health service about &#163;8&nbsp;billion a year. Sport is not always the best way for the majority of people to get fit, and research suggests that sociable walking in green space can be the best way to get people moving. It also suggests that if the primary purpose of exercise is contact with a high-quality environment people are more likely to sustain their activity and thus accrue more benefits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para13">
<a name="stpa_392">Health walks, such as those organised by Old Moor, and volunteering can provide people with the motivation to become active. One in six, or 18&nbsp;per cent., of the RSPB&#039;s 13,000&nbsp;volunteers were inactive before they started work for the RSPB, and that 18&nbsp;per cent. are prepared to continue volunteering, which emphasises the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor). More than 350&nbsp;health walks in the UK are organised by more than 10,000&nbsp;volunteers, led by the British Heart Foundation and the Countryside Agency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para14">
<a name="stpa_393">Throughout England, the RSPB is an effective delivery agent and partner in the Government&#039;s sustainable communities programme and it has plans to extend the model to help to develop a bold and innovative vision to regenerate the lower Aire valley in west Yorkshire, which includes part of the Pontefract and Castleford constituency of my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning. The RSPB believes that, as a society, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build sustainable communities such as those in the Dearne and lower Aire valleys. We must make the right choices to provide the homes and jobs that people need, without jeopardising their quality of life now or in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para15">
<a name="stpa_394">Sustainable communities need wise planning, for which we must meet four crucial challenges. First, we must deliver a green infrastructure. Wildlife-rich spaces in and around new communities play an important role in people&#039;s quality of life. We believe that green infrastructure, such as that created at Old Moor, is as vital to us as the traditional infrastructure of roads, hospitals and schools. There should be no difference between hard infrastructure and green infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para16">
<a name="stpa_395">Secondly, we must respect environmental capacity. Even if green infrastructure is fully designed into new communities, there will still be serious questions about the overall environmental impact of development. We believe that much more needs to be done to assess, and if necessary avoid, the impact, of national and regional planning. To do that, and thirdly, we need a national spatial strategy subject to robust strategic environmental assessment.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1668</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para17">
<a name="stpa_396">Fourthly, we need to conserve natural resources. Creating sustainable communities inevitably has implications for the consumption of natural resources such as fossil fuels and water. Climate change is a crucial issue, both for biodiversity and communities. To build a new home with water and energy saving measures to the eco-homes excellent standard costs as little as &#163;160. Building on research carried out for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the water industry and the Housing Corporation have estimated that society could save billions of pounds on new water resources infrastructure and reduce carbon emissions. The proposed code for sustainable homes must be both rigorous and mandatory, not left to the whims of house builders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para18">
<a name="stpa_397">Finally, we need to protect and enhance wildlife, which should go without saying. The RSPB also believes that sustainable community development must protect and enhance the best bits of biodiversity. That is the test of genuine sustainable development. If we cannot protect and enhance sites such as Old Moor, we will certainly not pass our environment on to future generations in the state that they would wish.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-36_para19">
<a name="stpa_398">In conclusion, as I am sure that the Minister will know, the RSPB&#039;s mission statement is simply, &quot;For birds, for people, for ever&quot;. I believe that that mission statement could also form part of the Government&#039;s sustainable communities mission statement, and I commend the Old Moor wetlands centre to the Minister and, indeed, the House.

<p><a name="st_306"><a name="60216-37_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Jim Fitzpatrick): </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis) on securing this debate and thus raising issues about the regional and national work that is taking forward the sustainable communities agenda. My honourable colleague has been involved in the development of the RSPB&#039;s Old Moor wetlands centre since its inception and I commend him and Councillor Norbury on the leadership they have shown in supporting that important and valuable community asset. My hon. Friend was deputy leader and leader of the local council, as well as now being the very active local Member of Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-37_para0">
<a name="stpa_399">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is all about creating sustainable communities, and our departmental strapline and mission statement reflect that fact. However, that is much more than about words: it is about creating change, delivering diversity and implementing initiatives. That commitment comes not just from the ODPM, but from across Government. We are working closely with the Department of Trade and Industry, through the regional development agencies, with the DEFRA agents, such as the Environment Agency, and with organisations such as the RSPB to create better places to live and work, such as those in Barnsley described by my hon. Friend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_400">But I should like us to take a step back: the sustainable communities plan, launched in 2003, set out the Government&#039;s long-term vision for thriving, sustainable communities in every English region. The plan defined an ambitious programme to deliver a step change in housing supply, decent homes, urban renewal 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1669</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and countryside protection, and it also signalled unprecedented investment in our neighbourhood environments. It also made a commitment to the environment, making it clear that it is important that new housing should be located on brownfield land where possible and that the protection of the countryside and the green belt were priorities for the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_401">We have seen achievements in those areas. Residential development on brownfield land is up from 56&nbsp;per cent. in 1997&nbsp;to 72&nbsp;per cent. today. The density of new residential developments has increased from 25&nbsp;dwellings per hectare in 1997&nbsp;to 40&nbsp;per hectare. Between 1997&nbsp;and 2004, there was a net increase of about 26,000&nbsp;hectares in designated green belt. A further 13,000&nbsp;hectares of green belt has been proposed in emerging development plans.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_402">The sustainable communities plan also set ambitious targets for the growth areas, including the Thames Gateway, to consider green space as part of the overall master plan. In the Thames Gateway, the &quot;Greening the Gateway&quot; strategy established the principle that new and existing residential and commercial areas should be set in a network of varied and well managed green space. Supported by &#163;26&nbsp;million from the ODPM Thames Gateway programme fund, a number of green space initiatives have been funded, including &#163;3.25&nbsp;million to ensure the protection of the RSPB reserve at Rainham marshes and to construct an environment and education centre; &#163;5&nbsp;million for the London Riverside conservation park at Rainham and Averley marshes and the restoration of Erith, Crayford and Dartford marshes; and &#163;2&nbsp;million to provide a 74&nbsp;hectare conservation site at Nevenden nature reserve in Basildon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_403">ODPM funding worth &#163;40&nbsp;million is supporting the delivery of key components of green infrastructure in the key growth locations by improving the interface between the urban and rural environments, providing improved access for people and wildlife and restoring areas of the countryside, which provides people with more opportunities to experience and interact with their environment first hand, as suggested by my hon. Friend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_404">Two examples of projects being funded are Dunstable downs, which is receiving &#163;1.5&nbsp;million to provide a new flagship facility to accommodate additional visitors resulting from the nearby growth area, and the Forest of Marston Vale, which is working to transform 61&nbsp;square miles of land in a key location between Bedford and Milton Keynes, with a long-term aim of achieving 30&nbsp;per cent. woodland cover. A sum of &#163;2.8&nbsp;million will ensure a wide range of environment and community benefits, including landscape improvement, wildlife conservation, agricultural diversification, recreation provision, employment generation and environmental education.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_405">More recently, the Government&#039;s response to Kate Barker&#039;s review of housing supply reinforced the commitment to protecting and enhancing the environment alongside accommodating housing growth. As my hon. Friend can see, on a national and regional level we are working cross-departmentally to deliver sustainable communities.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Feb 2006 : Column 1670</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_406">Quite a few of the examples I have cited are from the south and the midlands, but let us not forget the subject of today&#039;s debate. My hon. Friend has given us the example of the Old Moor wetlands centre in a former coalfield area in his constituency, and I am glad that he has raised the profile of the centre, which demonstrates what can be achieved in a location that could so easily have become a no man&#039;s land, or a nobody&#039;s land, to be more politically correct.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_407">Reflecting on what I said earlier, Old Moor certainly demonstrates excellent usage of brownfield land being, as it is, a former farmhouse and associated agricultural buildings surrounded by an area formerly used for mining with some contaminated land. Through a combined budget of &#163;500&nbsp;million, the national coalfields programme, the Coalfields Regeneration Trust and the Coalfields Enterprise Fund mentioned by my hon. Friend are delivering real change through a long-term programme and commitment to action. People are being given access to the skills and jobs that they need, the environmental legacy of the coal industry is being cleaned up, and the housing, economic and social needs of the local communities are being addressed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_408">Old Moor nature reserve is a practical example of how a former coalfield site can become an important community asset. A number of the awards received by the centre mirror the Government&#039;s commitment to sustainable building. During the actual building process, the builders, Wakefield-based Tolent Construction, demonstrated high standards of workmanship and health and safety to staff and visitors. The company and the RSPB won the national built-in quality award for innovation for the visitor centre&#039;s many energy conservation measures. It has a wind turbine, solar panels and wood chip boiler supplied from a nearby sawmill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_409">There are also links to education, culture and heritage through the work of the centre. Old Moor, with its extensive visitor facilities, is a fantastic place to watch wildlife, particularly a range of birds. A mix of habitats includes open water, marsh, reed beds and grassland. There are also curriculum-linked, term-time educational visits, including pond-dipping, &quot;mini-beasting&quot; and other creative and science-based activities to suit children from reception to key stage 2. Around 4,000&nbsp;children have had first-hand experience of nature through the reserve&#039;s field teaching programme, and 65,000&nbsp;visitors are expected to go through the gates during this financial year, reaching the targets set for 2008. I am sure that, as a result of this enjoyable but educational facility, a generation of children will grow up with a much wider appreciation of the local environment, and that that enjoyment will translate in later life into a caring and responsible attitude towards their community, as my hon. Friend suggested.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_410">As my hon. Friend said, by the first anniversary of the opening of the centre in the autumn, the RSPB work should be replicated across the country in line with the Government&#039;s sustainable communities agenda. I hope that I have demonstrated that this is happening nationally, and I certainly commend the RSPB&#039;s plans to create and enhance other wildlife areas throughout the Dearne valley. The RSPB has additional proposals for the Yorkshire coalfield area to develop more

People living, working and visiting the area will have easy access to a network of sites via new footpaths, bridleways and cycle routes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_411">Moving slightly further afield from South Yorkshire but still in the Yorkshire and Humber region, North Yorkshire county council is consulting on the Swale and Ure washland project. Future sites could form a network, with high ecological, landscape and amenity value. In Wakefield, the council is working with partners through developing local area agreements to develop plans to designate a number of local nature reserves, to improve biodiversity and provide improved green spaces for the deprived communities in its district.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-37_para13">
<a name="stpa_412">I cannot finish without referring to the work of the Land Restoration Trust. It is a joint venture company, which was launched in 2004&nbsp;by the Deputy Prime Minister. It is jointly owned by English Partnerships, Groundwork, the Environment Agency and the Forestry Commission, and regional development

</p>

<p>
<a name="60216-37_para14">
<a name="stpa_413">I certainly feel that I have covered a lot of ground, both geographically and from a policy point of view. It is easy to get drawn into the minutiae of these issues, so it is good to reflect on the bigger picture, as afforded by my hon. Friend. He has raised the issue of sustainable communities with reference to the Old Moor wetlands centre. Communities are about people&#151;people from all backgrounds, young and old. Centres such as Old Moor help to bring life to an area in many ways. That area suffered with the decline of the mining industry, but a new life is emerging, as demonstrated at Old Moor and replicated in other parts of the country. I conclude by congratulating my hon. Friend once again, not only on securing this debate, but on his solid support for our policies generally and for the Old Moor wetlands site and the creation of similar sites across the country, ensuring the building of sustainable communities.
