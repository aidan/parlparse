<p>1. <a name="40721-01_wqn0"><b> Ms Meg Munn  (Sheffield, Heeley)</b> 
: What help he is giving to post offices in deprived urban areas.  [185307]
</p>



<p><a name="40721-01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Phil Hope): </b> 
 Among a range of Government measures to support post offices, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has set up a &#163;15 million fund for 2002 to 2005 to support post offices at risk of closure in deprived urban areas. To date, 194 post offices in the most deprived 10 per cent. of wards have been supported. We anticipate that this number will rise to 350 on completion of the fund. A further &#163;210 million is available from the Department of Trade and Industry for managing the long-term sustainable future of the urban post office network.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew0"><b> Ms Munn: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for his answer and welcome the fund. However, Jordanthorpe post office, in a deprived area of my constituency, was assessed for the fund and met the criteria, but was told that there were insufficient funds for it to benefit from the scheme. That post office is enormously important in supporting a whole community and shopping area. Will he give me further advice on what Jordanthorpe post office should do to keep providing the service that it does?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew1"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is a strong champion of the residents of her constituency. I fully understand her concern for ensuring that her urban post offices stay open and I shall listen carefully to her representations. She may not know that since 1997 the Government have invested &#163;2 billion in the post office network. I urge her, as a specific action, to encourage the Jordanthorpe post office to investigate the option of gaining access to the additional funding for the urban post office network that has been made available by the DTI.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Roy Beggs  (East Antrim)</b> 
 (UUP): Consultation on the closure of post offices in Northern Ireland has become a farce. There is obviously a clear policy on closures. Waterloo road post office in Larne in my constituency was signalled for closure. A neighbouring 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 312</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>business man was prepared to provide new post office accommodation and to buy out Waterloo road post office&#039;s rights and interests with the full support of his community. That was refused and he received no support from Postwatch. Is any appeal open to my constituents as we had accepted the closure of several other small post offices?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew3"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The ODPM does not provide support for post office networks in Northern Ireland. I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concerns, which I shall convey to my ministerial colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office and ensure that he, his constituents and the business he describes get the fullest possible reply to those concerns.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew4"><b> Tony Lloyd  (Manchester, Central)</b> 
 (Lab): Some farce is also associated with the closure programme in England. In my constituency&#151;one of the most genuinely deprived inner-city communities in the land&#151;more than 40 per cent. of the post offices will be closed. It would help enormously if the Post Office came clean about how the process works and opened up the books so that when people tell me that post offices are viable yet the Post Office still closes them, we know whether it is the Post Office that is abusing the rules or simply a misunderstanding of the position. I think that the Post Office is abusing the rules.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew5"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s concerns and I will certainly convey them to my ministerial colleagues in the DTI who have responsibility for the post office network. It is true to say that the previous Government presided over 3,500 unstructured closures, with no plans for the long-term sustainability of the network. This Government are providing a huge investment in both the rural and the urban network to ensure that there is a planned process and a sustainable future for post offices in both urban and rural areas.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew6"><b> Ms Karen Buck  (Regent&#039;s Park and Kensington, North)</b> 
 (Lab): I have recently been told that 50 per cent. of my post office network faces closure by this time next year. Although I fully understand the economic necessity for a reduction in the network, does my hon. Friend realise the impact that that has on urban communities as well as rural communities? Will he urge the Post Office to think carefully about what it does, especially in the complex social situation of London, where rich and poor areas jostle side by side, and ensure that it accepts that post offices are part of the lifeblood of local communities in urban villages, as they are in rural communities?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew7"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right: the urban post office network is essential. That is why the Government are investing over &#163;180 million to fund compensation payments to sub-postmasters whose offices close, and we are investing substantial extra resources through the urban reinvention programme that I mentioned earlier. Post offices play an important part in community life, and without a rational approach the unplanned closures that occurred under the last Conservative Administration would continue, leaving damaging gaps in the network. The DTI is working hard to ensure that there is a planned process for ensuring the long-term sustainability of post offices in urban as well as rural areas.

<p>2. <a name="40721-01_wqn1"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): What Government policy is in relation to the rights of local authority tenants to have homes which meet the decent standard criteria by 2010; and if he will make a statement.  [185308]
</p>



<p><a name="40721-01_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Keith Hill): </b> 
 We are determined to make good the appalling neglect of council homes by the last Tory Government, who left us with a colossal &#163;19 billion backlog in repairs and modernisation, and 2 million substandard homes. We have now reduced the number of substandard homes by 1 million and are on target to bring a further 600,000 homes up to the decent homes standard by 2008. Where councils can achieve the decent homes standard through mainstream funding they are perfectly entitled to do so; otherwise the most effective and efficient way to secure the extra funding and better standard of management required to deliver decent homes will be through a choice of public finance initiative, stock transfer or arm&#039;s length management organisation.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew8"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 Many on these Benches benefited from an affordable, well maintained home rented from an accountable local authority, and we welcomed the reassurance of the then Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Tyneside, North (Mr. Byers), that the right to a decent home would be extended even to those who retained their local authority landlord. Why has this Minister torn up that commitment, allowing home investment only through the PFI, ALMOs or stock transfer even where tenants prefer direct investment from their local authority to coerced privatisation? Does not the modernisers&#039; mantra of &quot;a right to choose&quot; apply to our core supporters?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew9"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Well, if my hon. Friend wants to put it in those terms, he can, but I believe that the decent homes programme is precisely designed to deliver to our core supporters. My hon. Friend misuses language when he talks about privatisation. Under the PFI and ALMO arrangements the stock remains council-owned stock and the tenants remain council tenants. The housing associations, which are a key lever for bringing in the huge new sums to deliver the decent homes programme, are not-for-profit organisations. Fifty per cent. of all tenants are in housing associations, which on the whole deliver homes that are of a higher standard and afford tenants greater satisfaction.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Robert Key  (Salisbury)</b> 
 (Con): Has the Minister seen yesterday&#039;s report from the UK Noise Association, called &quot;Antisocial Housing&quot;? Why do the Government continue to refuse to include noise insulation in their decent homes-plus standard?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew11"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Ambient noise is included in the decent homes standard.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Ken Purchase  (Wolverhampton, North-East)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): I welcome and understand the Minister&#039;s concern about the disrepair of our stock and that which we inherited, but the solutions that he proposes are seen as departmental proposals that are mean and spiteful&#151;

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 314</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>bad-tempered, even&#151;and almost a betrayal of the wishes of many tenants who want to remain with their local council. For a Labour Minister to be denying them that right seems to me perverse.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew13"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 But I put it to my hon. Friend that we have so far had some 130 ballots on various aspects of the decent homes programme, and in over 80 per cent. of cases tenants have voted for the various forms of PFI, stock transfer or ALMO on offer; they have gone for what my hon. Friend seems to regard as a spiteful option. Where a ballot fails the Government are anxious to work with the local authority to examine the ways forward. That is occurring in Birmingham, close to my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency, where good progress is being made.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew14"><b> Mrs. Caroline Spelman  (Meriden)</b> 
 (Con): Birmingham, Hodge Hill borders my constituency, and in an effort to help my neighbour&#151;<i>[Laughter.]</i> I might remind Labour Members that their party was in charge of Birmingham city council during the time to which I am referring, and it still is. No one could fail to have been struck by the number of homes and shops boarded up in that constituency. Take, for example, the parade of shops in Shard End, over which all the flats were boarded up. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps the new hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne) might like to take note.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. First of all, if the hon. Lady intended to raise matters relating to another constituency, she should have notified the hon. Gentleman. Secondly, I know we are near the end of term and I like to give some leeway, but the supplementary question must be short.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew16"><b> Mrs. Spelman: </b> 
 For all the worthy aspirations of the decent homes standard, does the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister accept that the Government have failed to get to grips with the problem of empty flats over shops, which could be made into perfectly decent homes and be an asset rather than a liability?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew17"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I suppose that after her long sojourn in Hodge Hill I ought to welcome the hon. Lady back to the Dispatch Box, but in the light of her singular lack of success in Hodge Hill, it might be a good idea for her to repair to her own constituency, Meriden, at the earliest opportunity. She raised a number of issues, one of which was the decline in neighbourhood shops. I want to encourage Birmingham city council&#039;s programme of flourishing neighbourhoods, which is designed to deal with those issues. With regard to flats above shops, the Government have already set up a taskforce to deal with that problem. We are making progress there. The hon. Lady ought to at least acknowledge the Government&#039;s addition to the current Housing Bill of a proposition to bring empty homes in cities back into rented accommodation.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Dennis Skinner  (Bolsover)</b> 
 (Lab): What is the philosophical objection of my right hon. Friend to the idea that councils like Bolsover&#151;which does not have social services, does not deal in education, and deals 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 315</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>only with housing&#151;should be able to keep control of the housing stock and build even more? What is the philosophical objection to that, even in new Labour?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew19"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Well, I do not know. I am not always described as new Labour, nor, for that matter, is my Department invariably categorised in that fashion. As I understand it, my hon. Friend&#039;s local authority, Bolsover, is in the process of carrying out the stock options appraisal, which will be completed in January. At that stage we can have a look to see what is the appropriate way forward. As I have already indicated, mainstream funding by Bolsover may well be the appropriate way forward.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew20"><b> Mrs. Spelman: </b> 
 As Shelter&#039;s report on homeless households, &quot;Living in Limbo&quot;, reveals, the number of people living in temporary accommodation has hit record levels at 94,000 and is still rising. Does the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister accept that temporary accommodation, by definition, is the antithesis of a decent home, and that a doubling of the length of time that people have to wait for a permanent home is an indictment of the Government&#039;s policy? Is not the truth of the matter that although the decent homes standard is a laudable ambition, for 94,000 people the Government have made it irrelevant?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew21"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The hon. Lady makes a fair point. It is an issue about which the Government and hon. Members on both sides of the House are deeply concerned. But while she has been away in Hodge Hill, she obviously missed the Chancellor&#039;s excellent statement, which will accord huge new levels of investment for social housing in the next spending review period. It is our expectation that as a result of those high levels of investment, which will yield no fewer than 75,000 new homes for social renting in that period, by 2008 we shall have turned round the increase in homelessness.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew22"><b> Mr. Clive Betts  (Sheffield, Attercliffe)</b> 
 (Lab): Can my right hon. Friend confirm that of the three options that he says are available to tenants now to achieve decent homes&#151;stock transfer, PFIs and ALMOs&#151;ALMOs are different in that their borrowing counts against Government borrowing? Will he give an assurance to tenants in Sheffield who are working with the local authority towards ALMOs that no artificial limit will be placed on the amount they can borrow, so that even where tenants of local authorities choose the ALMO route, in practice it will not be available to them?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew23"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 We hope to work with Sheffield to deliver on the ALMO programme, for which funding is available. The new arrangements for housing capital finance were introduced in April, and they allow local authorities to determine how much they can afford to borrow beyond borrowing supported by central Government&#151;the matter is linked to increases in the management and maintenance allowance. We hope that a number of authorities will be enabled to deliver decent homes under the so-called prudential code.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew24"><b> Mr. Edward Davey  (Kingston and Surbiton)</b> 
 (LD): The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister: Housing, Planning and Local Government Committee recently 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 316</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>released a critical report on progress towards the decent homes standard. Why are Ministers now the only people who believe that the decent homes standard will be met by 2010? The spending review provided new money for housing in growth areas and low-demand areas, but it provided no money for the decent homes programme. Given the tough efficiency savings that Ministers demand from the housing sector and the recent trend for tenants to vote against stock transfer, which of these will be dropped first&#151;the decent homes target or the Government&#039;s ideological obsession against local authority borrowing for housing investment?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-01_spnew25"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is wrong on all counts. Funding is available for the decent homes programme. We acknowledge that the decent homes target for 2010 is challenging, but I reiterate that we are on target to bring 1.6 million homes up to the decent homes standard by 2008.

<p>3. <a name="40721-02_wqn0"><b> Mrs. Lorna Fitzsimons  (Rochdale)</b> 
 (Lab): What assessment he has made of the effects of the Northern Way growth strategy on growth in the north.  [185309]
</p>



<p><a name="40721-02_spmin0"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister  (Mr. John Prescott): </b> 
 In February, I invited the three northern regional development agencies to produce a joint plan for driving up sustainable economic growth in the north, and I expect to receive that report shortly. The three northern regions, which are home to 15 million people, have excellent prospects for economic growth. To help boost the economic revival in the north and elsewhere, the spending review has increased the funding of RDAs from the current &#163;1.8 billion to &#163;2.3 billion in 2007&#150;08.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-02_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Fitzsimons: </b> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend, whose personal commitment to regeneration in the north is welcome, for that answer. Is he aware that the fastest economic growth in Britain is in south Manchester? He might miss a trick by not joining up the huge pools of Government investment in the regeneration of north Manchester around Rochdale and Oldham with organisations such as the Knowledge Capital Group, which maximises research and development in universities. Will he do everything in his power to make sure that we maximise public investment in north and south Manchester to make sure that we are the engine in the Northern Way?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-02_spmin1"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend. I recently visited her constituency, where we have made a substantial investment in housing in low-demand areas through the pathfinder programme. The Northern Way is not taking over cities&#039; roles, and it co-ordinates the economic assets and advantages that exist in the three regions. Rochdale has an extremely important part to play, and I was pleased to learn about its development plans, which fit into the Northern Way. The Northern Way will not replace the RDAs, which will work together for the benefit of north Manchester and Rochdale.

 (Con): Will the right hon. Gentleman join me in expressing disappointment that the RDAs in the north failed to deliver a rural-proofing policy in the Countryside Agency report? What progress can he make through the Northern Way growth strategy to answer that criticism?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-02_spmin2"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 The hon. Lady makes an important point. We develop not only urban areas but rural areas, and we have given that objective to the RDAs. I recently attended a meeting in Cumbria, where the representative from the rural board, which was the set-up before the RDAs took over, was keen to point out the increase in resources for rural areas in Cumbria. Rural areas are important parts of the region; we will not ignore them and the RDAs are directly responsible for implementing the plans that we have given them.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Peter Pike  (Burnley)</b> 
 (Lab): This afternoon the Northwest Development Agency will announce decisions on the aerospace innovation centre that is to be sited in Lancashire. Is that not an important part of the Northern Way policy, along with the housing renewal pathfinder project? Will it not eventually make the north-west the place to be, and make Burnley a good place for people to live and work in?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-02_spmin3"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend, whose area benefits from the pathfinder proposals. We have also given new powers to the regional development agency to ensure that decisions on jobs, housing and infrastructure are brought together. I think the RDA has done well in that regard. The Northern Way will unite all those decisions across the three regions, and will begin to develop the assets of the north rather than allowing them to become liabilities. It is really a matter of the sum of the parts.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bernard Jenkin  (North Essex)</b> 
 (Con): Does not the Northern Way strategy underline two huge conflicts at the heart of the Government&#039;s entire policy? First, whatever the Deputy Prime Minister is planning to spend in the north of England, will it not be utterly dwarfed by investment in the massive 1 million homes that he plans to build in the south, east and south-east of England? Secondly, what is the purpose of setting up elected regional assemblies in the north if the Deputy Prime Minister is going to impose a strategy of his own? What is the point of the cost of all those extra politicians and bureaucrats if he is going to stick his own strategy on them and tell them what to do? That is not devolution; it is fake devolution.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-02_spmin4"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman often reveals his ignorance of what is actually going on. He needs to recognise that housing problems in the north are different from those in the south. We have a lot of empty houses in the north, because there is less demand. The opposite is true in the south. If we have to deal with different problems at different costs, we must make the appropriate decisions. More resources may be used in the south, but we have made it clear that the distribution will be balanced fairly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-02_para0">
The Northern Way is a very imaginative idea, which came from the north itself. It was not imposed by the Government; it was presented by the three regions. We now await the taskforce report.

 The Government have increased the powers available to local authorities, the police and other agencies to tackle antisocial behaviour no matter where people live. Antisocial behaviour orders are available regardless of the perpetrator&#039;s or the victim&#039;s housing status. There are also a number of powers available specifically to social landlords to protect both their tenants and the wider community.Those have recently been strengthened in a number of ways, including the commencement on 30 June of new powers under the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003.

Will the Minister come up to my constituency so that I can take him out canvassing, and we can view the problem at first hand?

<p><a name="40721-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 I am well aware of the specific problems that have been identified on the Gaywood South ward, the Reffley Lane estate and the South Lynn estate. I understand that the council is aware of the problems, but may not have been able to pursue the antisocial behaviour orders as expeditiously as people would like because of capacity constraints due to staff absence. It will be taking action, however, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will support that wholeheartedly.

Members: &quot;Hear, hear!&quot;] Does the Prime Minister recall that, in those halcyon days in 1994, he said that it was wrong that we were wasting millions of pounds on accountants and bureaucrats in the NHS instead of spending it on doctors and nurses? Is it not a shame that, 10 years on, the National Audit Office still does not have a detailed cost breakdown of how much of the &#163;61 billion extra investment is reaching the front line? Can we please have detailed cost breakdowns between spending and overheads on the front line? Will he provide Parliament with the information that we need?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-03_spmin1"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Administration costs as a proportion of overall expenditure in the health service are falling, but since the hon. Gentleman wants the figures, what we have been able to achieve in the national health service over the past few years are 67,000 more nurses, 19,000 more doctors, and reductions in every single part of waiting times and waiting lists, including in his own constituency.

Will he join me in congratulating the Hastings crime reduction partnership on that success, which is due in large measure to the 37 street wardens and community support officers who are now walking the streets and making them safer?
</p>

 Order. Supplementaries should be brief.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-03_spmin2"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I know that it takes my hon. Friend some time to go through the achievements. It is correct that we are putting more support officers and neighbourhood wardens into operation on our streets. That is important because people welcome them where they have been in operation. We should not forget either that we have 12,500 more police officers since 1997, and it is this Government who are going to carry on increasing the police budget&#151;unlike the Conservative party, which is going to impose a cut in the police budget by the cash freeze announced by the shadow Chancellor.

<a name="40721-03_para2">
In his acceptance speech 10 years ago, the Prime Minister said that he would be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime. Can he tell us what has happened to violent crime since he became Prime Minister?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-03_spmin3"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Under the British crime survey, violent crime is down, not up, since we took office. It is true that recorded violent crime is up, but overall, crime is down since we came to power. As I have just said, we have increased the number of police officers by 12,500. That contrasts with the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s record, as he cut the number of police officers serving on Britain&#039;s streets.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 The British crime survey figures do not include murder, rape, drugs offences or crimes against children, which is why the Prime Minister never mentioned them when he was Leader of the Opposition and why he then used the recorded crime figures only. On the recorded crime figures, violent crime has gone up by 64 per cent. since 1998. For the first time in this country, 1 million violent crimes were committed in a single year. The Prime Minister has also said that too many of the guilty are going free. Can he tell us how many people guilty of these violent crimes are brought to book?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-03_spmin4"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 First, in respect of violent crime, the British crime survey is calculated in exactly the same way as it was when the right hon. and learned 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 321</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Gentleman was in office, and the figures indicate that violent crime is down. Secondly, crime overall has fallen but, yes, there are real problems with violent crime. That is why we have the new Criminal Justice Act 2003 coming into force, which will make a big difference in many parts of the country. It is also why we have more police officers and new measures on antisocial behaviour. None of this would be improved by his plans to cut the police budget in real terms.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 I am not going to cut the police budget; that is absolute nonsense. The Prime Minister was also talking nonsense when he said that overall crime had fallen. On the recorded crime figures, crime has gone up by 15.5 per cent. since 1998. The Prime Minister did not answer my question. He certainly has been good at very many things over the last 10 years, but answering questions is not one of them. Clear-up rates for violent crime have fallen by nearly a third. Over 500,000 violent crimes were not cleared up, which is one of the reasons why too many of the guilty are going free. Let us look at another issue. Will he tell the House how many criminals he has let out of prison under his early release scheme who have committed more crimes when they should still have been in prison?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-03_spmin5"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 First, we have increased the number of prison places in this country. Yes, it is true that some let out under early release&#151;who would, of course, have been released later in any event&#151;have committed crimes, but it is a small percentage of the overall figures. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Two per cent., I am told. Let us go back to the essential question. Crime has actually fallen under this Government, not risen. The Leader of the Opposition said a moment ago that he does not intend to freeze the law and order budget. Let me read what the shadow Chancellor has said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I have agreed with my shadow Cabinet colleagues that the baseline for spending across all of these departmental budgets&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-03_para3">
that is, outside the NHS and schools budgets&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">will be 0 per cent. growth for the first two years.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-03_para4">
That is in cash terms and it includes the law and order budget, does it not?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 No, it does not, because we have also explained how we will save over &#163;1 billion a year on the paying of benefits to asylum seekers. Let us get back to crime. On the recorded crime figures, about which the Prime Minister always talked when he was in opposition, there have been 800,000 more crimes committed a year than in 1998. That is an increase of 15.5 per cent. Since his early release scheme was introduced, nearly 2,000 prisoners have committed crimes when they should have been in prison. They have been responsible for nine serious sexual crimes, 163 burglaries, 47 robberies and 462 other violent crimes, whose victims will not have been comforted by the Prime Minister&#039;s assurance that that is a small percentage. What is tough on crime about that?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-03_spmin6"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Tough on crime means making sure that we toughen up the penalties for serious offenders and for drug pushers, which we have done. It also means making sure that we increase the number of police on the streets and that we back that up with 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 322</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>community support officers, which we have done. It further means getting crime down overall, which we have also done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-03_para5">
The right hon. and learned Gentleman says that he is going to save &#163;1 billion through the reduction of asylum costs, but that is going back to his fantasy island, is it not? We have been doing a little research on this. Apparently, the shadow Chancellor actually says that he is going to save &#163;1.8 billion on asylum costs; unfortunately, that is the whole of the immigration budget. <i>[Laughter.]</i> So perhaps the right hon. and learned Gentleman will explain, given his proposed freeze on the law and order budget, how he would maintain police numbers, improve investment in the criminal justice system and carry on getting crime to fall.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 Anyone who thinks that I would not make sure that the Home Office gets the resources that it needs is living in fantasy land. This week, the Prime Minister launched another of his five-year plans full of gimmicks and schemes, like the ones he has had before. Can he tell us how many people have been marched to a cash point, how many have had their housing benefit docked, and how many are appearing before night courts? Is any one of the gimmicks that he has previously announced still in operation?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-03_spmin7"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Certainly. Thousands of fixed penalty notices have been given up and down this country. <i>[Interruption.]</i> They are on-the-spot fines and they have been welcomed by police throughout the country. The right hon. and learned Gentleman actually opposed fixed penalty notices, and incidentally he also opposed the introduction of community support officers; perhaps he will tell us whether that is still his position? As for it being fantasy that he would cut the Home Office budget, perhaps he will now accept that when he was Home Secretary, having promised to raise police numbers, he actually cut them.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 Everybody knows that crime fell by 18 per cent. while I was Home Secretary, which is more than even the Government&#039;s target for the next five years. Now, let us get back to my question. I did not ask about fixed penalties; I asked about cash points. The answer to the question that I asked the Prime Minister is none&#151;no thugs have been marched to cash points, no one has had their housing benefit docked and the courts do not sit at night. Is not the truth that every one of these failed initiatives is typical of this Government&#039;s dismal record on crime? Ten years on from his acceptance speech, have we not had just more slogans, more spin, more gimmicks and more initiatives, none of which are tough on crime or on the causes of crime?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-03_spmin8"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Fixed penalty notices are of course on-the-spot fines, and they are to be combined with antisocial behaviour orders, closing down crack houses, making sure that the police have the power to close pubs and clubs where disorder occurs, making sure that courts have a proper information technology system, and putting more community support officers and police on the beat.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-03_para6">
The right hon. and learned Gentleman wants to compare 10-year records and I am very pleased to do that. Let us look at them, mine and his. Under this

<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 323</b>

Under the right hon. and learned Gentleman, what happened? When he was Secretary of State for Employment, unemployment went up, and when he was Home Secretary, police numbers came down. And we should never forget that he was the one who introduced the poll tax. So on comparing 10-year records, we are doing pretty well.

 I agree entirely. The strengthening of the law against discrimination has been an important part of this Government&#039;s agenda over the past few years.

 First, I do not believe that the numbers are falling. The numbers of people going to university are rising. If the hon.

<a name="40721-04_head0"><h3 align=center>Rural Strategy</h3>


<a name="40721-04_time0"><h5>12.32 pm</h5>




<p><a name="40721-04_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Margaret Beckett): </b> 
 I am pleased to present to the House today the Government&#039;s rural strategy 2004. As in the rural White Paper 2000, our vision for rural communities is based on delivering genuinely sustainable development, with economic and social strategies consistent with our aim of protecting and enhancing our natural heritage for future generations. Rural strategy 2004 represents an ambitious set of policy priorities for rural communities and the countryside, coupled with radical reforms to the delivery of our policies.

</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para0">
Fresh evidence that we have commissioned confirms that there is relative prosperity in rural areas. For example, measured in terms of average household income, 55 per cent. of households in rural areas are above the median, but the evidence also confirms that the picture is by no means uniform across rural England. Rural society is changing in ways that are blurring the distinction between urban and rural. Farming remains at the heart of rural society, and an important focus of rural policy, but employees in rural businesses are now more likely to be employed in manufacturing, tourism or retailing. Within the overall picture of relative prosperity, there are pockets of economic and social disadvantage.

</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para1">
That evidence shapes our approach to delivering sustainable communities and so puts a premium on policies and on delivery mechanisms that focus on that deprivation. My reform agenda sees the devolution of decisions and delivery&#151;to get help to the areas and people that need it most. To ensure that they are able to access that help, I will ruthlessly streamline the funding support we provide. The present 100 rural, agricultural and environmental funding schemes will be reduced to three major funding programmes linked to strategic priorities, allowing us both to sweep away unnecessary rules and to simplify application processes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para2">
Our policy has three main planks. First, while supporting prosperity across the board, we will act to help the minority of rural areas that are lagging economically. I want rural businesses to have the support they need. This year, I will put an extra &#163;2&nbsp;million into the Business Link network, to improve support and assistance to businesses, especially those in lagging rural areas. I want all rural business men and women to know that they can turn to a service that understands their needs, including the needs of agricultural businesses and businesses diversifying from agriculture, and a service to help them through the existing maze of services and grants available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para3">
I will devolve decision making and funding for economic regeneration to the regional development agencies, to allow decisions better to reflect the needs and pressures in each region. I am increasing the funding DEFRA provides to the RDAs&#039; single pot from &#163;45&nbsp;million to &#163;72 million next year. To ensure that it is spent in the most effective way, each region is to put in place arrangements to facilitate rural prioritisation within a strong partnership structure. I shall not impose a single structural form&#151;I want to encourage maximum 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 330</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>simplification and streamlining&#151;so that regional delivery partners are set free to focus on doing, rather than talking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para4">
Local authorities have a vital role as community leaders in joining up and delivering quality services, so I intend to look at innovative mechanisms for devolving delivery even closer to rural communities. Over the course of this year we will set up a pathfinder in each region, to explore practical ways of providing more joined-up and flexible approaches at local level in rural areas, including joining up services and funding at the point of delivery.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para5">
The second plank of our policy is to tackle rural social exclusion wherever it occurs and to achieve fair access to services. Access to transport, to affordable housing and to broadband helps to underpin economic prosperity and social justice for rural dwellers. Last week, the Government announced more money for sustainable housing. My Department will act as guardian, to ensure that that money helps to address social disadvantage in rural areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para6">
I will devolve money for building capacity in the voluntary and community sector to each region, to be managed through the Government offices, as that sector can truly understand local need and provide innovative solutions. However, I want to be sure that we get an independent assessment of results. The need for a rural advocate is as strong as ever, so I will create a small and well-focused new countryside agency by next April, initially within the legal framework of the existing body, to act as expert watchdog and advocate on behalf of rural communities. Its priority will be rural disadvantage, and it will act as a think-tank and futures body, drawing on its monitoring of progress and best practice to suggest innovative solutions to Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para7">
The third plank of our policy is to protect and enhance the natural environment in rural areas, and that of our seas, coasts and rivers, and our green spaces in towns and cities. A healthy and attractive countryside brings social benefits such as tranquillity, but also economic benefits; more than 300,000 jobs depend directly on it, and rural tourism brings about &#163;13.8 billion to the rural economy each year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para8">
Rural England is also a treasure trove of diverse and wonderful landscapes and wildlife. Its natural beauty is an asset to be cherished and enhanced. The countryside provides us with the essentials of life; improving its health is the most valuable inheritance we can leave. Our woodlands, for example, help to mitigate the effects of climate change&#151;one of the most serious environmental problems the world faces. Visiting the countryside does much to improve our quality of life, providing recreation, better health and a source of education and learning.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para9">
Much of the quality of our landscape and its biodiversity depends on how it is managed by farmers and others. The changes that we are introducing as a result of CAP reform will enhance the positive and reduce the negative impact of farming methods and land management on the environment. As recommended by Lord Haskins, we will establish an integrated agency to deliver our policy objective of a healthy countryside valued and used in a sustainable way. The new agency will be a powerful, independent statutory non-departmental public body, building on the world-class 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 331</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>strengths of English Nature, the Countryside Agency and the Rural Development Service. Its remit will be the integrated management of our natural heritage that the challenges and environmental threats of the 21st century demand. That will include biodiversity, landscape, and the sustainable use of the countryside, including recreation and access. It will have a remit to carry out its functions within a sustainable development context. It will work closely with the RDAs&#151;and elected regional assemblies, if established&#151;to ensure that the natural environment is taken into account in regional policy making and activity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para10">
The formal establishment of the integrated agency will require primary legislation. I hope to introduce legislation next year and to publish a draft Bill, as an early step. In the meantime, while each of the three bodies will remain responsible for their own statutory duties, they will come together into a confederation of partners by April next year. To help that partnership working, I will move the Rural Development Service from the policy core of DEFRA and give it the autonomy that befits a major delivery body.

</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para11">
This package of policy and delivery reform is aimed at delivering services in a more streamlined and customer-friendly way, through radical devolution to regional and sub-regional partners, as well as to our own delivery agents. The significant streamlining of our funding should make things easier and simpler for our customers. These arrangements are aimed at improving effectiveness in the delivery of our three policy priorities, within an enduring framework of sustainable development. They will also deliver efficiencies, exploiting operational synergies and removing duplication. They have been developed in an inclusive and transparent way. They will build on the excellent work being done across the country by those working for DEFRA and its family, and beyond DEFRA. They will provide greater freedom to staff to get on with delivering what our customers need from the Government, and I am confident our people will rise to that challenge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para12">
I want these reforms to be workable, but sufficiently flexible to meet future challenges and changes. I commend the approach and its implementation to the House.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Tim Yeo  (South Suffolk) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for the letter that she sent me first thing this morning, although the website referred to in it did not contain any detail of the rural strategy, and for a copy of her statement, which for various reasons, including a mishap&#151;I am not sure whose&#151;I have only seen in the past 15 minutes or so. I welcome the recognition that some rural areas do not share the prosperity enjoyed by other areas, but I am afraid that I do not share her view of how their needs should be addressed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para13">
First, on agriculture, I appreciate that the Government may have more to say about farming-related issues tomorrow, but the Secretary of State&#039;s two-and-a-half- page letter&#151;headed, &quot;Rural Strategy 2004&quot;&#151;does not mention either agriculture or farming, and the statement that she just made scarcely did so. That will alarm many people who depend on that vital industry for their livelihood. It suggests that, even now, Labour Ministers do not recognise the central role that farmers play in protecting, maintaining and enhancing 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 332</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the rural environment, and the extent to which prosperity in many parts of the countryside is still very directly related to the fortunes of agriculture.

</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para14">
The statement is made against the background of severe problems in many rural communities. Under Labour, rural councils receive less cash support from the Government than their urban counterparts; under Labour, rural communities have fewer police per head of population than their urban counterparts; under Labour, rural bus services receive less support than their urban counterparts; under Labour, homelessness in rural areas is rising; under Labour, police stations in rural areas are closing; and under Labour, post offices in rural areas are disappearing and the proportion of households in rural areas with access to affordable broadband connections is only a tiny fraction of what it is in towns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para15">
Against that background, the proposals summarised in the Secretary of State&#039;s letter this morning and in much of the statement that she has just given to the House are vague, often riddled with jargon and sometimes of limited relevance to the needs of rural communities. A dairy farmer worried about the spread of TB, a rural community whose environment is about to be destroyed, against its wishes, by the development of nearby greenfield sites at the insistence of the Deputy Prime Minister or a neighbourhood blighted by illegal fly-tipping will draw no comfort from the waffle that we have just heard from the Secretary of State, such as


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;setting up regional pathfinders&quot;;</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para16">
So much for the DEFRA family.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-04_para17">
Why will the Government not stand up for rural communities in a practical way and give local councils, which are democratically accountable, the power to decide how much development takes place on greenfield sites in their districts, what kind of building is allowed and where it should go? Why will the Secretary of State not address the rapidly growing menace of fly-tipping, a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problem partly caused by her Department&#039;s incompetence in not preparing for the implementation of new laws? Why not, for example, make fly-tipping an arrestable offence now? Without such practical steps her claim&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>

 Order. The hon. Gentleman must be allowed to speak.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-05_spnew1"><b> Mr. Yeo: </b> 
 I am afraid that Labour Members do not like the truth about what they have done to our rural communities. Without such practical steps, the Secretary of State&#039;s claim that her policy will protect the rural environment will ring very hollow indeed in many parts of the countryside.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para0">
In turning to that part of the statement that deals with the response to Lord Haskins&#039; review, I make clear our support for the broad thrust of many of his conclusions and, in particular, that too many organisations have become involved in the delivery of rural policy, leading to confusion, inefficiency and a lack of co-ordination and accountability. Proposals to reduce the number of organisations to a more manageable number are therefore desirable. However, as the Secretary of State has said, since legislation will be needed to set up the new 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 333</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>integrated agency, there seems a danger that, until parliamentary time is available, uncertainty may now blight some of the work of the existing bodies. Since the Countryside Agency is apparently to continue as a rump, there still seems to be a lack of clarity in the Government&#039;s mind about how the new arrangements will work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para1">
Let me also make it clear that we do not agree that the regional development agencies are the right bodies to perform an expanded role in delivering any aspect of rural policy. The idea that using regional development agencies&#151;and, possibly, and even worse, elected regional assemblies&#151;will bring the delivery of services even closer to rural communities is so absurd that it can be proposed only by a Minister who neither knows nor cares what life is like in the remoter parts of East Anglia and the south-west.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para2">
Regional development agencies are unaccountable, bureaucratic quangos that are wasteful in their use of public resources. They exercise powers that have mostly been seized from elected local authorities, particularly county councils. The fact that their main champion is the Deputy Prime Minister should alone make anyone in rural communities suspicious of them. We all know that the Deputy Prime Minister has only one view of the countryside and that is as a vast potential building site.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para3">
It is a pity that the Secretary of State has done nothing in her period in office to protect our landscape from the unwanted and intrusive developments imposed by the Deputy Prime Minister or to defend the rights of elected county and district councils to exercise local control over the scale of new development. We will fight the transfer of any more responsibilities to regional development agencies in the context of rural policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para4">
I am also concerned that the important independent advisory role at present entrusted by law to English Nature will still be performed properly under the proposed new arrangements. From time to time&#151;for example, over the issue of GM crops and their environmental impact&#151;the independent advice that English Nature has provided has been uncomfortable for the Government, but the need for that advice and the need for an independent voice able to speak up with the authority of a statutory body remain. I am therefore concerned that the new arrangements will not fully recognise this need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para5">
I am concerned also that, although the aim of the proposals is to streamline the machinery through which rural policy is delivered, the situation will, in certain respects, get more complicated. For example, the role envisaged for regional rural affairs forums is a move in the opposite direction. They will be talking shops for so-called stakeholders and nothing more.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para6">
People in my constituency of South Suffolk and in other rural areas are used to plain speaking. There has not been much of that from the Secretary of State today. For too long, rural communities have been at the bottom of the Government&#039;s agenda. They have been discriminated against in terms of financial support and neglected through the provision of new services, with their age-old traditions held in contempt by urban new Labour Ministers, their industries endangered by imports, often produced to lower standards than those 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>required here, and their environment destroyed in too many areas by a stroke of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s pen. Judging by what the Secretary of State said today, only the election of a Conservative Government will start the process of addressing their real and urgent needs.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-05_spnew2"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I got the distinct impression that the hon. Gentleman had understood neither the statement, nor, despite his experience, the reality of what is happening in rural areas. Let me pick up on a couple of the many points that he made. He talked about ignoring the central role of farmers, but I specifically identified and recognised that, as we do through the &#163;17 billion that goes to farmers under pillar 1 of the common agricultural policy. He is right that there are other occasions to make more detailed announcements about farming&#151;today&#039;s statement was about rural areas as a whole. Some 25 per cent. of those employed in rural areas are employed in manufacturing, which is more than in urban areas. Some 9 per cent. are employed in tourism, with 7 per cent. in retailing and 6 per cent. in agriculture. I share his view that agriculture is enormously important, but it is a pity that he seems to think that unless we are talking about farming, we are not talking about rural areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para7">
The hon. Gentleman listed ways in which he thought that rural areas were discriminated against under Labour, but ignored the fact that under this Government, all councils have received more money and every area has more police services. Under this Government, &#163;450 million has been put into supporting rural post offices. He was foolish enough to talk about post offices disappearing, but it was because many commercial rural enterprises disappeared under the Government of whom he was a member that we were forced to introduce a special rate relief for villages with only one such enterprise left. They did not all disappear under us, but under them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para8">
The hon. Gentleman made a totally unwise and inaccurate remark about English Nature and GM crops. English Nature advised us to run the trials, which we did, and after we received the results of the trials, a scientist from English Nature told us that he could not understand why anyone would oppose something that was better for the environment. Of course, however, that is quite consistent, because the only Government who brought GM products on to the market in this country were the Government of whom he was a member.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para9">
The hon. Gentleman said that people like plain speaking and that rural areas have been at the bottom of the agenda under this Government. The plain-speaking truth is that if the Conservatives&#039; stewardship of rural areas had been as he said, and if they had not taken many rural areas and their support completely for granted, we would not now have some 180 Labour MPs representing rural and semi-rural constituencies.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-05_spnew3"><b> Andrew George  (St. Ives) (LD):</b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for providing me with an advance copy of her statement, although that happened after the Prime Minister rose to his feet for Prime Minister&#039;s questions&#151;within half an hour of the statement itself. I did not receive a letter from her, although I have received a communication to tell me that the right hon. Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George), who shares

</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para10">
I understand why the Department has been drawn into the vortex of incredibly fluffy thinking that often arises when talking about rural development. Indeed, paragraph 40 of the candid report that the Secretary of State penned in autumn 2003 to review the progress of the rural White Paper said that


</p>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;defining effectively what is meant by the concept of &#039;rural areas&#039; versus urban&quot;</p>

areas has been a challenge. In the same report, she said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The White Paper&#039;s inevitably aspirational nature means that it has not always been easy to pin down what it has actually meant in practice, and different groups and individuals have tended to interpret it differently. This in turn has made it harder to be specific about the outcomes that the Government wants to see in rural areas and to target resources to those areas and people with greatest need.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para12">
At least she acknowledged that, three years after the publication of the rural White Paper, the Government were not clear about what they were intending to do in the first place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para13">
The problem is that on top of the labyrinth of strategies, initiatives, pilots and projects, the rural strategy will fail if it merely adds to the strong sense of fatigue among the agencies, local authorities and Government Departments that are expected to implement it. The streamlining of initiatives and the funds announced today by the Secretary of State will help, but at least she was honest in her review of the rural White Paper when she said that among its &quot;successes&quot; it was &quot;increasingly understood&quot;. It should now recognise the problems conventionally found in strategies created to give the impression of purposefulness, compared to the determined action required in rural areas today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para14">
I agreed with the principles that the Secretary of State set out, the general thrust of the reforms that she mentioned to clarify and devolve matters and the work to avoid rural areas becoming the exclusive preserve of the better-off. What has she done since the autumn to define what rural areas are, and do all Departments agree with the definition, especially the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in its delivery of housing policy? Does the strategy supersede the rural White Paper? Will she explain in plain English the core objective of the strategy and is she confident that it will this time be understood across Government Departments?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para15">
Has the Secretary of State discussed the strategy on rural-proofing with her colleagues in the Treasury, who I understand are working tirelessly to ensure that Britain is removed from objective 1 and other European regional development aid? If that is the case, the money that the Government are proposing to add to rural regeneration might not even begin to match that withdrawn from the most needy rural areas that will lose aid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para16">
The Secretary of State said that money will be given to regional development agencies, but will it be apportioned according to need or simply on the basis of rural populations? What will be the role of the fully independent sector in rural delivery? Over decades, we have had the tried and tested process of rural community councils throughout rural England providing an excellent means of delivery, so bypassing 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 336</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>them or giving funds to regional development agencies so that RCCs must try to draw money from them would not be a good mode of delivery. She should use the existing method of delivery to ensure that the money gets to the ground, and I would like some reassurance on that matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para17">
On the environment, farmers are pivotal to delivering what the Government want throughout the countryside, but they are going out of business at the rate of 12 a day. Lord Haskins says that he thinks that the fact that farms are becoming larger is a good thing, although I do not know whether that is Government policy. What are Government doing to ensure that there are sufficient farmers so that their targets for the countryside may be met?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-05_para18">
The biggest challenge facing rural areas today is housing, so what is the Department going to do about that? If rural areas are not to become the exclusive preserve of the better-off, sustainable action is needed to ensure that rural areas are there for rural people.

 I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s view that if the changes that we are announcing today merely add to the sense of fatigue, we will certainly have failed.

The hon. Gentleman asked about definitions and data. It is a symbol of the failure of the Conservative party that when we came to power and endeavoured, through the implementation of the rural White Paper, to find out how to address some of the problems that unquestionably exist in rural areas, there was a dearth of evidence, information and reliable data. We had to start from scratch in building an evidence base. We now have an agreed definition. I shall not share it with the House, but I will write to the hon.

I agree that farmers are critical to the environment and land management. The hon. Gentleman asked what we had done to assist their enduring participation in farming. There have been many initiatives, gestures and support of various kinds, but the most important thing we have done is to reform the common agricultural policy, which sets them free to farm to the best advantage of their business, not because that is how they get the subsidy. On housing, I said that the resources will also apply to housing in rural areas.

 I warmly welcome the statement, in particular the reduction of the 100 rural agricultural and environmental funding schemes to three major ones. Will my right hon.

Many organisations are delivering in rural areas and will want to know which section they have been put into.

Will my right hon. Friend say a little about funding for areas of outstanding natural beauty? It was clear in the Haskins review that national parks will get 100 per cent. of their money directly from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, but the future of the money for areas of outstanding natural beauty was not clear. At the moment, some of it comes from local authorities and some from DEFRA.

I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Diana Organ). We will obviously publish more detail. A rather attractive diagram shows what schemes will go where. Broadly speaking, the three major funds will focus on natural resource protection, sustainable food and farming, and sustainable rural communities. Although initially there will be an indication of how existing funds fit into that framework, one of my key goals has been that we do not simply introduce three headlines under which remain the existing complexity of schemes, rules, application forms and so on. I am determined that there will be three funding streams and that their delivery will be devolved as much as possible. We will also honour existing commitments, so it will take a little time to introduce the scheme.

 A number of the questions raised on specific policy developments are for other Departments, although I recognise the potential knock-on effect.

On the more substantive issue, she mentioned the RDAs in paragraph 6 of the statement. Will she look at how her proposals will affect the Peak park, which falls into four Government areas&#151;the east midlands, the west midlands, Yorkshire and the north-west? Certain

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her words, which are in stark contrast to those of Conservative Front-Bench Members. I do indeed recognise the huge difference made by the resources that have been put, for example, into rural transport, which has certainly undergone a transformation. I share her concern about access to affordable housing, about which the Conservative party seems to have nothing to say, except to try to pretend that it would all be in greenbelt areas so nobody wants any of it, which is not a very constructive approach. I also understand and share my hon. Friend&#039;s concern that we should carry on making such improvements, and we will certainly continue to do what we can.

 The right hon. Lady constantly used the word &quot;delivery&quot;. Is she aware that delivery depends on reliable IT systems that do not fail? The Rural Payments Agency is under strain and the cattle tracing service has been criticised. The besetting sin of this Government is introducing schemes before they can deliver them, as with the whole tax credit system. Will she make sure that nothing is introduced until she is absolutely certain that it can be delivered?

 Some of the criticisms made of the cattle tracing service had validity but are well out of date. I entirely share the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s view that successful delivery depends on reliable IT, not least because, as he will probably recognise, when our Department was set up not only did neither of its constituent parts have reliable IT, but they could not talk to each other, so we are very mindful of the need for IT to underpin successful delivery of services.

 The final sentence of my right hon. Friend&#039;s statement stressed implementation.

We believe and hope that a number of changes on the ground can begin next April, but as he says, changing the legal structures will require primary legislation, and obviously that depends on the Government&#039;s overall approach. I believe that we will begin to see differences next spring.

 I welcome the additional &#163;2 million for Business Link announced by the Secretary of State, which is probably just as well as there will be few farmers left in Devon and we will need other businesses.

Royal Mail is about to reduce postal collections in Teignbridge and south Devon; BT is shutting and removing telephone boxes; and the Post Office is about to close seven post offices.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-07_spnew6"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 Contrary to the carping that we hear across the Floor of the House, very many people in the farming community fully recognise not only that this Government have done an enormous amount to help and support British farming, but that the changes that we have negotiated and are putting in place will help to create a sounder future for the farming community over the next half-century and beyond, not least because the resources that it will receive will be given in return for public goods and are therefore much more likely to be accepted and welcomed by the public.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-07_para0">
With regard to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s further comments, I am of course mindful that changes are taking place in rural areas, but I have already pointed out how much the Government are already doing to try to help to support rural post offices, which were one of his examples.

Does she accept that there is still a problem in rural Britain regarding the capacity of parish and town councils and the level of disagreement that sometimes takes over? Will she make sure that resources are put into the first layer of our democracy, because those bodies are, and will remain, very important?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-07_spnew8"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b>

 I congratulate the Secretary of State on the statement; it reminds us why many of us voted for her 10 years ago in the leadership election. She is right to refer to the priorities of rural business, rural exclusion and rural environment, and she cites tranquillity as an important characteristic of the countryside. Where in her Department is the co-ordinated liaison with the aviation industry to try to tackle the problems of those villages that lie under flight paths or are scattered around regional airports, where environmental controls are particularly defective?

<p><a name="40721-07_spnew13"><b> Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory  (Wells) (Con):</b> 
 Following the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) and the Secretary of State&#039;s inadequate reply, will she at least seriously consider shutting down the talking shop regional assembly in the south-west and the regional development agency, with all their glossy brochures and strategy documents which do absolutely nothing for the people who live and work 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

Maybe they do not like to say so to the Conservative party because they know that it is pledged to abolish them.

<p><a name="40721-07_spnew15"><b> Mr. David Kidney  (Stafford) (Lab):</b> 
 The general approach of much more devolution has to be right, and I congratulate my right hon.

 Obviously, responsibility at Government level remains with my Department, but we believe that a new, smaller and more focused Countryside Agency will be able to act very effectively as an independent adviser, advocate and watchdog for the interests of the countryside.

<p><a name="40721-08_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement about the need to transform our armed forces to deal with the challenges of the 21st century. Before I do so, however, I know that the House would want to join me in paying tribute to the bravery, professionalism and dedication of the men and women who serve their country in the armed forces, as well as those who support them in the Ministry of Defence and British industry. Their reputation is second to none. The transformation that I am setting out today will help to ensure that our armed forces can continue to respond effectively to the global challenges they are likely to face.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para0">
The Government are absolutely committed to Britain&#039;s defence and to our armed forces. That was made abundantly clear by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor&#039;s announcement last week of the Budget settlement for defence. The 2002 spending review provided the largest sustained growth in defence spending plans for 20 years. This year it has been possible to make even more resources available to defence, providing the longest period of sustained growth for over 20 years&#151;a defence budget rising by &#163;3.7 billion. It is this sustained investment that makes possible the transformation to which the Government and the armed forces are committed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para1">
In the 1998 strategic defence review we set out plans to develop defence capability to match the needs of the post-cold war world. We built on this with the SDR new chapter, published after the appalling events of 11 September 2001, and we confirmed this direction in the defence White Paper of December 2003. That White Paper makes it clear that the threats to Britain&#039;s interests in the 21st century are far more complex than was foreseen after the disintegration of the Soviet empire. That is why the defence White Paper signalled that we should continue to modernise the structure of our armed forces, embrace new technology and focus on the means by which our armed forces can work together with other Government agencies to meet the threat of international terrorism and the forces of instability in the modern world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para2">
Our armed forces have enthusiastically embraced this process of transformation. It will see a shift away from an emphasis on numbers of platforms and of people&#151;the inputs that characterised defence planning in the past&#151;to a new emphasis on effects and outcomes, and on the exploitation of the opportunities presented by new technologies and network enabled capability. We measured numbers of people and platforms in the cold war because we were preparing for an essentially attritional campaign, holding back Soviet forces. That kind of campaign has fortunately passed into history as technology has moved on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para3">
The capability of our armed forces is growing year by year as intelligence is combined with target acquisition, modern communications and precision weaponry to produce results that have changed the nature of modem warfare. These new capabilities involve the rapid communication of actionable intelligence to the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 344</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>commander in the field to deliver a range of combined effects, involving all three services and our allies acting efficiently and effectively together.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para4">
We are also able to respond more rapidly to crises through the improved deployability of our forces. We saw that in 2003 when forces were moved to the Gulf in less than half the time that it took 12 years before. With better target acquisition and precision weaponry, our Air Force was able to hit its targets with less ordnance&#151; and hence fewer aircraft&#151;than in the first Gulf war. The same tasks can now be completed in much less time, with far greater accuracy and correspondingly lower risk to our armed forces.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para5">
The defence White Paper makes it clear that this shift in investment towards greater deployability, better targeted action and swifter outcomes would involve a reduction in the numbers of tanks, aircraft and ships. Drawing on our experience of operations since the strategic defence review, the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces have been identifying which parts of the armed forces are most in demand, and which are less well utilised. As a result, we have developed new plans to ensure that our armed forces can retain maximum effectiveness. I have set out those plans in detail in the Command Paper on future capabilities, which is published today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para6">
The majority of reductions will affect not the front line, but support operations. We will exploit greater efficiencies in the delivery of logistic support and the modernisation of infrastructure. We plan to accelerate this process over the years ahead. Efficiency savings of &#163;2.8 billion are included in our plans. All this money will be recycled to enhance our front-line capabilities and other modernisation initiatives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para7">
Of course, we are investing more new money in defence. This investment will, for the Army, enable us to fund its transformation into a force which is structured and equipped to meet the demands of multiple, concurrent operations across the full spectrum of tasks. This involves a shift from the current structure, which is strong at the heavy and light ends of the spectrum but thinner in medium forces, to one that is better balanced right across the capability spectrum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para8">
The balanced land force of the future will consist of two heavy armoured brigades, three medium-weight brigades, based around the future rapid effects system family of medium-weight vehicles&#151;FRES&#151;and a light brigade, in addition to the air assault and commando brigades. We launched the assessment phase of the FRES project in April this year and we expect to sign a contract for technology demonstration work to start later this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para9">
The shift in emphasis to more agile, deployable forces means that we will establish an additional three light armoured squadrons, re-role a Challenger 2 regiment into an armoured reconnaissance regiment and re-role an AS90 regiment into a light gun regiment. Later, we will equip three artillery regiments with the new light mobile artillery weapon system. At the same time, we will seek to improve our ability to engage land targets with precision and at range. The first Apache attack helicopter will go operational later this year, which is an important first step down this path.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para10">
That will be followed by improvements in our missile&nbsp;inventory, through the progressive introduction of the Brimstone air-to-ground missile, a new infantry 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 345</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>anti-tank guided weapon&#151;Javelin&#151;and improved artillery rounds to allow precision indirect fire over the second half of the decade. Collectively, these improvements will be balanced by a reduction of seven Challenger 2 armoured squadrons and six AS 90 heavy artillery batteries by early 2007.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para11">
Critical as these new weapons systems are, at least as important are the changes that we are making to enhance the Army&#039;s network enabled capability. Digitised communications systems provide the network links. The entry into service of Bowman at the tactical level, and the Cormorant and Falcon systems at the operational and strategic levels, will represent a step change in our capability to pass data between commanders and the front line. We are also continuing to invest in improved electronic warfare capabilities such as Soothsayer, and in developing stand-off sensors, such as the Watchkeeper unmanned air vehicle. I announced yesterday that the preferred bidder for Watchkeeper is Thales Defence Ltd. This will provide battlefield commanders with high quality, timely and accurate information. The new joint surveillance aircraft Astor recently made its first test flight successfully.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para12">
Our battlefield and maritime helicopter forces, arguably the most capable in Europe, have demonstrated their versatility by supporting the full spectrum of recent operations. Over the next 10 years, we plan to invest some &#163;3 billion in helicopter platforms to replace and enhance our existing capability. This substantial investment within a relatively short time frame will make it possible to produce a future helicopter fleet focused on the key capability areas of lift, reconnaissance and attack, central to future expeditionary operations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para13">
The dominance in the air by alliance and coalition air forces shown in recent conflicts, together with our judgment about the likely threat on deployed operations, and our continued investment in Typhoon and its advanced air-to-air weapons, mean that we can plan to reduce our overall investment in ground-based air defence. We will meet our requirement in future from 24 Rapier fire units and 84 high velocity missile launchers. Rapier will be deployed by the Army, with the RAF Regiment relinquishing the role. Ground-based air defence will be commanded by a new joint headquarters within the RAF command structure. We are reviewing the implications of these force structure changes for our future equipment plans. In the meantime, I can announce the procurement of additional missiles worth about &#163;180 million for the high velocity missile system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para14">
I come now to the infantry. We currently provide for operational and geographical variety for the infantry by moving battalions between locations and roles every few years, which is known as the infantry arms plot. This process inevitably takes battalions out of the order of battle while they are moving and training for new roles. It also adds to turbulence. We need to ensure greater capability from the infantry, improved continuity, better careers for infantrymen and more stability for their families. The infantry arms plot will therefore be phased out.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 346</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para15">
In addition, as a result of the improving security situation in Northern Ireland, we announced last month a reduction in the number of battalions committed to the Province by two. The Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the General Officer Commanding have conducted a further review of security requirements. As a result, I can today announce another reduction by a further two battalions, which will take place in the autumn. That will reduce the overall requirement for infantry battalions from 40 to 36. This reduction will comprise one battalion recruited from Scotland and three recruited from England.


</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para16">
Those changes necessitate a new infantry structure that must preserve the best aspects of the regimental system, but produce an organisation capable of adapting for the future. The new structure will be based on regiments of two or more battalions, in largely fixed locations, allowing individuals to move easily between those battalions. Details of the new organisation will be worked out by the Army and announced by the end of the year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para17">
The Army board wants to establish an infantry organisation that will last for the foreseeable future. The manpower released by the reduction of four battalions will be redistributed across the Army to strengthen existing infantry units, but it will also be used elsewhere among the most heavily committed specialists such as logisticians, engineers, signallers and intelligence. The overall size of the Army will be around 102,000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-08_para18">
Our plans for the Royal Navy involve the further development of a versatile, expeditionary force capable of operating at distance from the United Kingdom and focused on delivering effect on to land at a time and place of our choosing. Two new large aircraft carriers deploying the joint combat aircraft will provide the heart of our future ability to project military power from the sea. On Monday, I announced the extension of the assessment phase to take forward further design work on the new carriers in the run-up to our main investment decision and that the principles of an alliancing approach have been agreed with our industrial partners.We are investing heavily in our amphibious capability. HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, which was delivered to the Royal Navy last week, will provide a step change in our ability to launch the Commando Brigade and support other forces ashore.

By ensuring that our major warships are effectively networked and supported, we can deliver more capability from fewer platforms. Developments in network enabled capability&#151;linking sensors and weapon systems&#151;mean that we can meet future area air defence and command and control requirements from a force of eight Type 45 destroyers. With those hugely capable ships currently under construction, we can plan to pay off our oldest Type 42 destroyers, HMS Cardiff, HMS Newcastle and HMS Glasgow, by the end of 2005. We are still in the early stages of an ambitious procurement programme and are working with industry to define a timetable that best matches our capability requirements and the need for steady work in both the shipbuilding and repair industries.

The potential submarine threat to most future UK operations is likely to be low. Where a threat exists, however, we will still need the full range of advanced anti-submarine warfare capabilities to deal with it. We have therefore decided to reduce our overall numbers of

We will pay off three Type 23 frigates, HMS Norfolk, HMS Marlborough and HMS Grafton, by March 2006. That shift of emphasis also allows us to meet our maritime reconnaissance needs with 16 Nimrod MR2 aircraft. That requirement could be met in future by a fleet of around 12 Nimrod MRA4 aircraft, which are more capable, subject to industry demonstrating satisfactory performance at acceptable prices.

We require a total of eight nuclear attack submarines. The introduction of the new Astute class boats will hugely enhance the contribution made by nuclear-powered attack submarines across the spectrum of operations. Solid progress has been made on the first of class following the restructuring of the project, and work continues on boats two and three, as well as on long lead items for boat four, but more remains to be done before production orders can be finalised. We are also investing in the latest generation of Tomahawk land attack missiles and improvements to submarine communications to give our current and future submarines an improved land attack capability.

Our mine countermeasure vessels have made a valuable contribution to recent operations. Against that changing threat, we must retain a balanced force of eight Hunt class and eight Sandown class vessels. We plan to pay off HMS Inverness, HMS Bridport and HMS Sandown by April 2005. The improved security situation in Northern Ireland also makes it possible to pay off the Northern Ireland patrol vessels, HMS Brecon, HMS Dulverton and HMS Cottesmore by April 2007. As a consequence of those changes, the manpower of the Royal Navy will reduce to 36,000 over the next four years.

Air power is critical to the prosecution of modem warfare. Over the next 10 to 15 years, an accelerating transformation of our air power will enable quicker, more precise and more decisive operations at range, delivered by multi-role Typhoon and joint combat aircraft equipped with highly capable weapons. The Typhoon programme is now moving forward towards initial operating capability, with indications that the aircraft is demonstrating excellent performance and good reliability.

The investment in our air forces is already producing substantial improvements in existing aircraft. The Tornado GR4 is now one of the most potent offensive aircraft systems in the world, fully capable of day and night operations in all weathers. The Harrier GR9 development programme is on course to deliver a significantly more capable platform with much wider versatility, including for carrier-borne operations. The tactical information exchange capability project will examine how the effectiveness of the GR4 and GR9 can be further enhanced by improving their networked capability. The Tornado F3 aircraft is now equipped with advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles and the world-leading advanced short-range air-to-air missiles and is fully networked through the joint tactical

With those significant advances in capability, we now judge that we must reduce the types and overall numbers of the RAF fast jet force, providing a firm baseline for transition to the multi-role era. We will reduce the number of the air defence Tornado F3 squadrons by one, and bring forward the withdrawal of two Jaguar squadrons to 2006, with the final Jaguar squadron disbanded in 2007. Those changes in the force structure and the achievement of planned organisational efficiencies will lead to a reduced RAF manpower requirement of around 41,000 by 2008, which will also allow us to close RAF Coltishall airfield by December 2006. We will also be undertaking an extensive review of our future requirement for airfields. Following an extended period of consultations, we have decided to rationalise the basing requirements of a number of RAF logistic support and communication units. My right hon.

To accommodate larger items, we were considering the options to retain C-17s after the A400M enters service, and I am pleased to announce that we intend to buy the current fleet of four at the conclusion of the current lease arrangement and to purchase one additional aircraft, bringing our C-17 fleet up to five aircraft.

Amidst those structural and major equipment changes, we must never neglect the more immediate needs of our armed forces in the field and in particular their personal equipment.

This year, we will procure additional light machine guns for the infantry, together with night vision and target acquisition systems for forces in land, sea and air environments, as well as further enhancements to our special forces capabilities.

The Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon.

Some will claim that the defence budget is under such pressure that it is impossible to sustain the Department&#039;s forward equipment programme.

It is of the utmost importance that industry takes the maximum advantage of that substantial investment to produce what the armed forces need at a price that the country can afford. We will take forward our defence industrial policy and implement those changes in conjunction with industry to ensure a healthy and competitive defence industry, one that continues to play the leading role in our economy, a leading role that it enjoys today. I am confident that it will respond to this challenge.

For the third successive spending review, the Government have been able to announce real growth in the defence budget. That is without precedent since the mid-1980s. Even with these additional funds, it is necessary to secure maximum benefit from efficiencies and make choices to ensure that our force structure matches the requirements of today&#039;s security environment. The plans that I have announced today show the Government&#039;s determination to make the choices necessary to ensure that the real growth in defence expenditure is targeted at what the armed forces require in the 21st century, rather than what they have inherited from the 20th. That will ensure that the armed forces are equipped and trained to continue to perform with success in the future the tasks that they have undertaken so admirably and successfully in recent years.

The servicemen and women whose battalions are to be disbanded, planes grounded and ships scrapped are the same men and women who bailed out the Government over their dismal failures and incompetence at the time of foot and mouth disease, and bailed out the Home Office over the fire strike. These are the same people who brought peace to Sierra Leone and Bosnia, saved Sierra Leone from almost certain self-destruction, helped to secure peace and good order in East Timor, brought freedom to Kosovo, helped push the Taliban out of Afghanistan, and liberated Iraq and brought an increasing security to its people. Some of them are fighting a largely unsung battle in Basra today, in a very difficult environment.

Most of the current difficulties in defence are entirely of the Government&#039;s making. The promise of a strategic defence review to restructure our forces for the post-cold war world was undermined by a defence budget reduced in real terms. The SDR was never properly costed or properly funded. When the new chapter was written after 11 September, as the Labour-dominated Defence Committee has pointed out,

Only a few weeks ago, the Select Committee lambasted the Ministry of Defence for doing away with existing equipment before replacement systems had been procured and tested, failing to tackle manpower shortages, and underestimating the importance of boots on the ground. Does the Secretary of State deny that these latest cutbacks will seriously damage our military capability and our ability to project power for several years, while we await the arrival of largely unproven technology?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-09_para4">
Despite all the Secretary of State&#039;s extravagant claims to be increasing it, there is in reality a deep crisis in the defence budget. According to the latest report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the defence budget is lower in real terms today than before Labour came to power in 1997. Is it not clear that the defence budget is decreasing, not increasing? If it is not decreasing, why did the Chancellor promise &#163;31.8 billion for defence in 2004&#150;05 in his 2002 spending review, but only &#163;29.8&nbsp;billion in his latest&#151;a real-terms cut of 6.44 per cent.? Under this Government, the defence budget has sunk so deeply into the red that the equipment overspend is in excess of &#163;1 billion per annum. That is hardly a sparkling example of the efficiency of smart procurement.

Today, is the Secretary of State not taking his most reckless step so far&#151;cutting tanks, ships, aircraft and men to make immediate savings, while making vague promises that new weapons will be delivered at some point in the dim and distant future?

The Government parrot the mantra that numbers of platforms do not count, because modern warships are so much more powerful. Yet the same warship cannot be in two places at once, and the fewer the platforms the greater the proportionate loss when one is damaged or disabled. Does the Secretary of State accept that with the cuts in the frigates and destroyers, the fleet will not be able to fulfil the broad range of tasks assigned to it, which it performs so brilliantly with so few ships? How will the minehunters be able to continue the many tasks that they have been assigned? Can the Secretary of State confirm that only one carrier at a time will ever be in commission in future, and that without proper air cover? At the very least, the Government should give the Navy what it wants, serious land-attack capability for the reduced number of Type 45 destroyers, by fitting them with the tactical Tomahawk cruise missile.

We welcome the work that is being done to modernise the way in which the Army organises itself in this expeditionary age in which it has been so regularly and invaluably used.

All the evidence and all the experience shows that declining infantry numbers will leave less time for vital training to keep up essential skills and less time for people to spend with their families, and will inevitably lead to an increase in the depressing cycle of overstretch as the infantry struggles with the many tasks that the Government give it.

Superficially, the proposals for large regiments have some logic and may appear attractive.

My party believes, however, that at the same time we must at all costs retain that which makes the British soldier the extraordinary animal he is. The Secretary of State must remember that in these regiments are some of the qualities that set the British Army apart from all others, and that therefore the significance of the regimental system must be retained in any restructuring that takes place. All that these regiments stand for, and all that they have given over the years in the fighting efficiency of the Army, is not to be lightly tossed away as it has been this afternoon.

I agree about the importance of achieving value for money in support services to make way for expenditure on new equipment. Will he confirm his commitment to awarding contracts for support services, particularly for surface ship refits, on the basis of competition, rather than allocation? Does he understand the concerns of people in Plymouth that that was not borne out in the recent award of the contract for HMS Edinburgh?

 I welcome the Secretary of State&#039;s commitment to the Eurofighter Typhoon. Will he put on record the numbers of aircraft that he is negotiating to purchase in tranche 2? Given the length of time it is taking him to negotiate best value in this context, will he also tell the House what are the barriers to further progress? When does he expect those matters to be resolved and when will the four partner nations be able to announce the purchase of tranche 2?

 I am consistently grateful for the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s interest in Typhoon. I share his view that it is a vital asset for Britain&#039;s future military capabilities. Seven aircraft have now been received by the RAF and are performing better than anticipated, but these are commercial issues. The contract for tranche 2 will be signed when I judge that we have an offer on the table that is affordable and delivers the kind of capability that I judge to be necessary for the future of this country.

 The hon.

This restructuring is in order to allow those men and women to continue to do their job in the 21st century. The world has changed beyond recognition in terms of the kind of external threats faced by the men and women in our armed forces and by their families. Frankly, the idea that we can move those men and their families around every two years for essentially traditional reasons is long past its sell-by date. It is absolutely vital that we provide greater consistency in terms of our future requirements. As I said in my statement, identity is vital, as is maintaining the regimental tradition and history by which the hon. Gentleman rightly sets such store. There is no reason why, under our proposals, those traditions and that history cannot be maintained in the course of the restructuring.

 I have always had some difficulty in accepting the hon. Gentleman&#039;s arguments about defence, given that his party is committed to pulling out of NATO.

<p><a name="40721-11_spnew5"><b> Chris McCafferty  (Calder Valley) (Lab):</b> 
 I, too, congratulate my right hon. Friend on winning a substantial increase in defence funding, but will reducing by four the number of battalions also mean that all un-amalgamated battalions will be re-organised into larger regiments? Will that proposed reduction change the received wisdom in the Ministry of Defence that an infantry battalion should always have a clear 24 months between operational tours? I ask that question because my own local regiment, the Duke of Wellington, which has a history of more than 300 years, is returning to Iraq in October after a stand-down time of only 14 months. If the answer to my questions is yes, will my right hon. Friend ensure that relevant Army officers are allowed to participate in discussions about the future of their battalions?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-11_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her observations. I should emphasise that in essence, the posts of the four infantry battalions no longer required for duty in Northern Ireland will be redistributed to strengthen existing battalions and to provide extra resources for those elements of our armed forces that have been under the most pressure in recent times. This entirely sensible and pragmatic change is necessary to ensure that the pressures about which Members have expressed concern are alleviated.

<a name="40721-11_para0">
On the re-organisation of single-battalion regiments, there is a hybrid structure throughout the United Kingdom, in that some regiments consist of a number of battalions and others of a single battalion. It is certainly the Army Board&#039;s ambition to create a new structure in which single-battalion regiments are subsumed into larger organisations. But as I have emphasised, there is no reason why traditional regimental histories and distinctive uniforms cannot be maintained within that new structure and those larger organisations.

 The hon.

</p>








<p><a name="40721-11_spnew10"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I entirely accept my hon. Friend&#039;s observation, which is based on considerable experience. We need to continue to invest in armed forces&#039; accommodation; indeed, that bequeathed to us in 1997 by the then Conservative Government was appalling. We have put in place a significant number of programmes to improve such accommodation, and it is highly necessary that we continue to improve it.

 The Secretary of State said that the details concerning the new organisation of infantry regiments will be worked out by the Army, and that an announcement will be made by the end of the year. He knows that a tremendous fight was previously put up to ensure that the Staffords were not reduced to a sludgy amalgam. Will he ensure that proper consultation takes place, and will he be taking personal responsibility for such matters or passing the buck?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-11_spnew12"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 Of course I take personal responsibility, but there is another, equally important issue. If the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concerns about serving members of the armed forces are genuine, he will recognise that it is vital that we make these changes in the interests of those men and women and, crucially, of their families. The arms plot cannot be sustained in the 21st century. Servicemen and women&#039;s partners have jobs and their children are in school, so a degree of domestic stability is vital to allow them to serve their country so successfully. If the hon.

If 11 fewer platforms will be available to the Navy by 2007, there must be serious concern about its ability to provide the capabilities that the Government require of it. What is the value of the cuts that he is making to the existing defence budget? Many of the people whom I represent regard those cuts as the price that they will have to pay for the failure of smart procurement to deliver the dividends that the Ministry of Defence promised.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-12_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 There are no cuts to the defence budget, and the figures given are clear. This Government are committed to increasing consistently the amount spent on defence, over a prolonged period of more than 20 years. On platforms, it is vital that the hon. Gentleman recognises&#151;I know that he spends a lot of time thinking about these issues&#151;that there has been an enormous change in terms of what modern equipment can do. If we continue to preserve the equipment that the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex seems to think we should maintain for as long as we possibly can but that is increasingly inflexible and was designed for another era and another conflict, we will not be able to invest in the modern equipment that delivers the greater effects that can be achieved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-12_para0">
An obvious example, which I mentioned in the statement, is the accuracy of modern ordnance. We no longer need to fly huge formations of bomber aircraft across targets in the hope that perhaps 10 per cent. of the bombs will hit. A single aircraft with a single weapon is usually enough to deal with that target in modern warfare. The effects created by a single aircraft or a single Royal Navy platform are now so remarkable that we necessarily can adjust our platforms to go on investing in modern technology that will deliver those modern effects.

<p><a name="40721-12_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 On the contrary, Eurofighter will be an aircraft for the 21st century. It will provide air capabilities and have a swing role, with a ground attack facility. It is already attracting considerable interest. I was in Farnborough yesterday, and many of the overseas visitors at the exhibition were enormously impressed by Typhoon&#039;s capability. It is already winning competitions around the world, and I am confident that it will provide not only significant employment in the United Kingdom but a potent capability for the Royal Air Force.

 Can the Secretary of State clear up some serious concerns and omissions in his statement, regarding the future of security in Northern Ireland? Will he confirm what will be the future battalion strength of the Royal Irish Regiment, and does it include the three home battalions necessary for backing up the police for internal security in Northern Ireland? Secondly, what is the future for RAF Aldergrove, and does it include the various forces involved in aerial surveillance for internal security in the

<p><a name="40721-12_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I accept that the defence role in Northern Ireland must be kept under constant review. We have to work closely with the Chief Constable to ensure that our view of the security situation is up to date, but as that situation is maintained at a much improved level from years gone by, it is right to consider carefully the level of resources required. Obviously, I take account of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s observations, and we must not take risks with security in Northern Ireland, but the four battalions that I have mentioned repeatedly today have not been based in Northern Ireland for some time, so I judge it appropriate to say that they are now no longer required for duty there. If there is, as I hope there will not be, a serious deterioration in the security situation there, we will have the flexibility and the capability to take appropriate action.

 There is no doubt that the Royal Armoured Corps, the Royal Artillery and the infantry have handled everything that has been thrown at them over the past few years, and they have done so admirably. The fact remains that three quarters of battalions are now heavily undermanned. Those based in Nottinghamshire&#151;the Secretary of State&#039;s area and mine&#151;now have a ridiculously short time to rest, retrain and see their families between operational deployments.

 I do not accept that for a moment. The hon.

The real pressure has been not on infantry or on armoured units but on the logisticians, the support elements, the engineers and others who maintain the front-line forces. We propose to augment such staff in the restructuring, to allow them to have the full intervals that we have set out, so that we can maintain simultaneously a number of smaller but necessarily concurrent operations in a modern, more difficult world.

 My right hon. Friend will be aware that there is some disquiet on the Labour Benches about a reduction in the size of the Army. In my constituency, and the rest of Cumbria and north Lancashire, we have no military bases at all, so we keep our contact with the armed forces through the King&#039;s Own Royal Border Regiment, and it would be a great pity if that tradition were to go, and we would have great difficulty in recruiting from these areas if the regiment were no more.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-12_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend to this extent, that it is important to maintain a footprint and identity right across the country. One of the problems, though, with the arms plot as it currently operates, and in particular for single-battalion regiments, is that they may not even be based in the traditional recruiting area from which they come, so it could well be that the regiment to which he refers is not even located in the area from which it is recruiting. I certainly anticipate a much greater identity between the recruiting area and the location in which people serve following the restructuring. That will be good for the footprint of the Army across the United Kingdom, as well as for the families of those who serve.

First, technology can never replace manpower. Secondly, when we have serious problem of overstretch, it cannot be solved by cutting the number of troops. Thirdly, there are benefits from our regimental system, which is about loyalty and identity. I say to the Secretary of State: hands off the Cheshire regiment, because it has the support of the whole county and will fight to head off attempts to get rid of it, as we did before. The Army Board was wrong last time, and it is wrong this time.

 I said that I did not recall it, but if she did, I am delighted to allow her the opportunity of making representations to her Front Benchers who are proposing to cut defence, should they be elected. If the hon. Lady is really concerned about the safety and security of the men and women in the armed forces, she will recognise that technology provides enormous protection for them. The programme that I announced yesterday&#151;the Watchkeeper programme, which is the latest and best technology available&#151;will provide us with intelligence and reconnaissance information well over the horizon, allowing those men who serve to be properly protected. That is what technology is about. It is not an either/or: we need both effective, well-trained people and effective modern technology.

<p><a name="40721-13_spnew11"><b> Mr. Russell Brown  (Dumfries) (Lab):</b> 
 The further increase in departmental spending is to be welcomed and it has to be better than what the Conservatives would do with a standstill budget. However, my right hon. Friend is fully aware of the strong support for the King&#039;s Own Scottish Borderers. History and cap badges are but two aspects of regiments, but recruitment and retention of personnel are vital and the KOSB has an excellent record. Over the coming weeks and months, will the Secretary of State make time available in his diary, because I will be coming to lobby him&#151;and I suspect it will be on more than one occasion?
</p>

 Is the Secretary of State aware that, if he goes ahead with the proposal to move RAF Boulmer to Lincolnshire, he will have to find at least &#163;15 million&#151;probably a lot more&#151;to replace the facilities just being completed at Boulmer, and that the revenue savings, already greatly exaggerated, will quickly be eaten away by having to meet those capital costs?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-13_spnew14"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 That decision has not yet been taken, but it will have to be discussed in future.

<p><a name="40721-13_spnew15"><b> David Cairns  (Greenock and Inverclyde) (Lab):</b> 
 My right hon. Friend rightly rejected the option of buying two second-hand aircraft carriers from the Americans and is pledged to plough ahead with building the two new aircraft carriers. In view of that, is it not about time that BAE Systems stopped moaning about perceived injustices and got on with working together with Thales and the UK Government to deliver on time and on budget? It is very important for Clydeside constituencies that BAE Systems clarifies its intentions with respect to the marine division.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-13_spnew16"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 I want to emphasise how co-operatively we work with BAE Systems and how pleased I am that it has agreed to the alliancing proposal that will ensure that it works closely with the Ministry of Defence and Thales in delivering those two magnificent aircraft carriers for Britain&#039;s armed forces.

 As one of the armchair majors, may I draw the House&#039;s attention to my entry in the Register of Members&#039; Interests? Does the Secretary of State agree that network enabled capability, like any other system, relies ultimately on the quality and calibre of the servicemen and women who operate it? The maintenance of morale will therefore retain its fundamental importance. What estimate has the right hon. Gentleman made of the impact on morale of his statement today?
</p>

 I indicated to the House that we intend to update the remuneration and rewards available to those who serve so well as reservists. Once again, I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his efforts. I ask him&#151;he has spent some time working with the men and women of our armed forces&#151;to consider the question of morale. The truth is that one of the most damaging aspects of lower morale, particularly in the Army, is the disruption caused to family life by the constant rotation that the arms plot involved. That is extremely damaging to personal morale. In my judgment, it is one of the reasons why many highly trained, expert men whom we would have liked to retain in our infantry battalions leave before they originally planned to leave&#151;simply because of the effect on their families of moving around the country so frequently.

<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 366</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Defence has learned the lessons about equipment from Operation Telic in Iraq. Does he believe that, as a result of the statement, there will be greater or lesser urgent operational requirements in the future?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-14_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 The whole purpose of urgent operational requirements is to ensure that we have the right equipment for the particular operation being conducted. In our longer-term planning, we are trying to ensure flexibility&#151;and flexibility is at the heart of the proposed changes&#151;for the capabilities that we have available. Nevertheless, there will always be a requirement for some urgent operational requirements, since they are specific to the particular operation in hand.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-14_spnew2"><b> Sir Robert Smith  (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD):</b> 
 Many constituents have approached me with their concerns about what might appear in the statement today. They recognise that high technology and what happened in the initial phase of the Gulf war demonstrated some of the Secretary of State&#039;s points in the statement, but believe that the real lesson that has still not been learned relates to what happened after the initial phase and the crucial role played by troops on the ground and the infantry. Does he recognise that it is vital for the restructuring that he does not squander what we will get by reducing numbers in Northern Ireland, but maximises the impact and availability of those forces for future peacekeeping roles?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-14_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 Implicit in that entirely proper observation is the idea that technology is relevant only to the war-fighting phase, and somehow irrelevant to peacekeeping. The truth is that it is absolutely vital when one puts soldiers into a potentially hostile environment. For example, technology ensures that they can receive information and intelligence from commanding officers and that they can be evacuated by search and rescue from places of danger. The technology that we are providing&#151;at the organisational level and to individual soldiers&#151;will transform how they are able to conduct both the war-fighting and peacekeeping roles.

<p><a name="40721-14_spnew4"><b> Mr. Doug Henderson  (Newcastle upon Tyne, North) (Lab):</b> 
 In last week&#039;s spending review, the Ministry of Defence was committed to making a contribution to the dispersal of civil servants&#039; jobs, enthusiastically or otherwise. My right hon. Friend said today that he aims to make savings of &#163;2.8 billion. I strongly support that and believe that it can be achieved. Will he clarify whether that figure includes an element of saving to be achieved by the dispersal of MOD activity to the regions? If not, when will he be able to make a statement on the matter?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-14_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 The figure does include the dispersal element. Indeed, I am very proud of the MOD&#039;s record in providing opportunities for people to be employed outside central London and the south-east area. It has led the way among Government Departments in that, but there will be a further dispersal of jobs across the country. We anticipate that some 3,800 jobs will be dispersed in the near future, but that will be in addition to what has already been achieved.

<p><a name="40721-14_spnew6"><b> Mr. Crispin Blunt  (Reigate) (Con):</b> 
 Does the Secretary of State accept that his statement heralds the most substantial changes to the armed forces since the end of the cold war, that that has been driven largely by technological change and that a lower share of the nation&#039;s wealth, in terms of gross domestic product, is now devoted to defence? When I was in uniform, I was told that the inevitable logic of technological change was that, in 100 years, our armed forces would consist of one aircraft, one ship and one tank. Representations have been made by hon. Members of all parties about the importance of boots on the ground. Does the Secretary of State accept that war fighting has been the easy bit in the conflicts that the Government have undertaken and that the difficult bits are the subsequent peace enforcement and nation building? Is he prepared to accept that he and his Department may have got the balance wrong? Will he be prepared to listen over the coming months?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-14_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 Obviously, I am prepared to listen. I recognise that the hon. Gentleman speaks with some knowledge and experience of these matters, as a serving soldier and as someone who in the past was involved in defence policy. He is right that it is necessary to ensure that we get the right balance between existing equipment, new equipment and numbers of people, but I do not accept the logic that he describes. A comparison between the numbers of aircraft needed to attack a target in the second world war&#151;often with poor results but at huge risk to the airmen involved&#151;and modern precision strike operations that may involve only one aircraft makes it possible to see the changes that have taken place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-14_para0">
I always recognise that this is a question of balance and judgment. I believe that the MOD and our armed forces have the balance right and that we must continue to invest in the new technology. In that way, we can continue to deliver the war-fighting successes that have been achieved in recent times. In addition, as I said in response to the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith), we can ensure that our armed forces are properly protected in an increasingly difficult peacekeeping role.

 I accept the vital importance of the identity that is associated with traditional and historic regiments. I have answered similar questions several times already, and my hon.

 Several of my hon. Friends have asked about the Queen&#039;s Lancashire regiment, so may I tell my right hon.

Does the regiment not fulfil already, therefore, many of the objectives that he has set out, in that it is locally based and recruits locally? Does not the maintenance of an effective infantry depend on retaining those traditions and local connections, so that regiments such as the QLR can recruit?

 I broadly agree, and that is pretty much the answer that I just gave my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Crausby), who raised the same point.

 There is no satisfying my hon. Friend. I anticipate that, in the months ahead, I shall learn a good deal more about the history of the QLR, and I shall be delighted to do so. In the course of my attendance at the Farnborough air show yesterday, I was able to visit the Airbus stand. I was thanked profusely for the British Government&#039;s commitment to A400M.

<p><a name="40721-15_spnew2"><b> Bob Russell  (Colchester) (LD):</b> 
 The Secretary of State said that the Army is to be reduced in size by 6 per cent. and that there will be four fewer battalions. However, he also said that the new structure would be based on regiments of two or more battalions. He made no reference to any regiments being merged or closed. Will he explain how he will achieve his objectives? If he has managed to square that circle, and if there are going to be regional regiments of two or more battalions, may I invite him to reverse a Tory defence cut of 1992 and reinstate the 3rd Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment&#151;the former Essex Regiment?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-15_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 Of course, the Royal Anglian Regiment is the perfect example of a successful regional organisation that is multi-battalion and that can provide a degree of stability. It is a lesson to the rest of the Army in proper organisation and recruitment. That is one of the reasons why the Army Board is so keen to establish a more consistent structure across the country. That is why the hon. Gentleman is right to assert the interests of the Royal Anglians. I regret that in the circumstances I am unlikely to be able to provide the answer to his question that I know he would like.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-15_spnew4"><b> Mr. Julian Brazier  (Canterbury) (Con):</b> 
 The Secretary of State talks about increased capability and agility replacing the shameful cut in numbers, but that will require the training that is required for professionalism.

Everybody knows that I am no Euro-fanatic. I have always been somewhat sceptical and am against further political integration. Nor do I see any merit in the constitution. I certainly do not suffer from Europe hysteria: I am perhaps more of a Euro-pragmatist and a Euro-realist.

My concern is the criminal destruction of the environment, the horrendous devastation of fish stocks, and the impact on the ecosystem, resulting in a distortion of the balance of nature in and around our waters. What kind of policy actively encourages catching millions of fish, only to throw 50 per cent. back dead? Eating more fish is essential for a healthy diet, but we are signed up to a policy that exhorts fishermen to destroy the very fish they catch&#151;what madness in a world where millions go hungry!
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-15_para2">
Two thirds of Europe&#039;s main commercial fish stocks, such as cod, hake, plaice and sole, are on the verge of collapse, with undersized fish, which could have matured, being discarded and left dead to pollute the seabed. The largest fish at the top end of the food chain are caught en masse leaving smaller fish lower down multiplying at an increased rate. Such fish are swallowed by massive industrial fishing vessels to feed farmed fish, about which serious health questions have already been raised. The ecosystem has flipped over, with the fish that were formerly low down the chain now being at the top. The only living organism that is safe in the seas is plankton. I am told that the CFP has plans for them as well.

One hundred years ago, one acre of good North sea fishing ground produced a ton of fish a week; it now produces just a tenth of that. A 90 per cent. decrease in fish stocks around our shores inevitably has major repercussions. If wildlife on the plains of Africa were savaged in the way the seabed is, there would be a worldwide outcry. Although national game reserves have been created to protect animals and we have national parks to protect the environment, similar arrangements have not been made to protect underwater life.
</p>

If the CFP resulted in fish being caught to feed people, that would be one thing, but it does not: it is just a massive, indiscriminate destruction of underwater life. Among the victims are cetaceans such as dolphins, and it has been estimated that 10,000 dolphins and porpoises are mindlessly killed in the English channel and the Bay of Biscay each year, with ever-increasing numbers being washed up on the coasts of Devon and Cornwall, the victims of the bass trawler nets. If in an attempt to maximise beef and lamb output we stretched mile-long

Why, then, do we tolerate such devastation of the ancient landscapes of the seabed? The coral reefs in the English channel will take 100,000 years to grow back, having been destroyed by trawlers hoovering the sea bed.

Fish are not the only inhabitants of our seas, nor are dolphins. Thousands of birds die in fishermen&#039;s nets every year because they feed off live fish just below the surface.

Subsidised tuna-fattening operations in southern Europe have caused the overfishing of one of the ocean&#039;s most prized assets, the blue fin tuna, which I note is on the menu in the Adjournment restaurant in Portcullis house this week.

The basic problem with the common fisheries policy is the concept of &quot;common&quot; responsibility. The Dartmoor Commons Act 1985, which I piloted through Parliament, was designed to safeguard common land on Dartmoor from over-grazing. As no one owned the land, farmers took advantage of it; so, too, with water that is common&#151;there is no sense of responsibility. People use it for individual gain and with no recognition that the activities of one fisherman impact on another. Again, the fact that fishermen from different nations are all involved in the plunder of the stock makes it a free for all&#151;anything goes, any time, anywhere. The fisheries protection vessels never stand a chance.

<a name="40721-15_para8">
The House of Lords Select Committee on the European Union said&#151;I paraphrase&#151;that the problems of fisheries management are compounded by an interaction between biological and economic factors, which leads to the failure of the free market to deliver an acceptable solution. Such problems are overcome only when fishermen are given a long-term interest in the health of fish stocks, and the ecosystem on which they depend, by being allocated some form of property rights.

<a name="40721-15_para9">
Existing tools for fisheries management, as far as Europe is concerned, are excessively reliant on total allowable catches and quotas, which have been demonstrated to be wholly ineffective. Furthermore, fisheries management in Europe has become excessively politicised, largely due to the haggling by the Council of Ministers when it renegotiates total allowable catches each year.

As the House of Lords Committee concluded, the widely supported proposals made by the Commission to reform the CFP have been emasculated and held hostage by some member states acting quite perversely in the short term, with the interests of their fishing constituents uppermost in their mind, rather than the long-term common good&#151;the conservation of marine resources for the whole community.

 I understand that with this it will be convenient to discuss the following motions:


</p>

</p>








<p><a name="40721-16_spnew0"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 Together with the three orders already considered Upstairs, confirming the dates for referendums and the options for local government reorganisation, these orders represent the package of secondary legislation necessary to provide for the proper conduct of this autumn&#039;s regional and local referendums.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-16_para1">
The orders set out, first, the rules and procedures for the referendums, including the postal ballot; secondly, the amounts counting officers can receive for their fees and expenses in connection with the referendums; and, thirdly, the spending limits for those campaigning in the referendums. I shall deal with each in turn.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-16_para2">
The Regional Assembly and Local Government Referendums Order 2004 details the procedures for the conduct of the referendums by all-postal ballot. During the passage of the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act 2003, which enables the referendums to be held, concerns were voiced about the level of turnout. Indeed, some hon. Members were so concerned about the legitimacy of any result that they called for a threshold to be set. However, we considered that a threshold other than a simple majority vote would be arbitrary and unfair. Why should non-voters be able to veto a yes vote by those who bother to turn out?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-16_spnew1"><b> Mr. George Osborne  (Tatton) (Con):</b> 
 In the past, the Minister has said that he would discount a yes vote if the turnout was derisory. Will he provide the House with a definition of derisory?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-16_spnew2"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 Oh dear. Unfortunately, the hon. Gentleman has not done his homework or he would know that I have frequently said both in Committee and in the House that if turnout was derisory we should not feel obliged to proceed with the outcome, if that involved setting up an elected regional assembly. I have also explained, repeatedly&#151;most hon. Members know this by now&#151;that to give a figure automatically sets a threshold. That threshold then automatically provides an incentive for people not to vote. There would be the most perverse and absurd consequence: rather than voting to express their point of view, people would use 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 375</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the device of not voting to try to frustrate something. That is a perversion of democracy and I have explained on many occasions why it is not appropriate.
</p>

</p>








<p><a name="40721-16_spnew4"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 No, the hon. Gentleman must do his homework more thoroughly in future if he wants to be taken seriously in this place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-16_para3">
Secondly, let me remind Members of what happened in Scotland in the 1970s. There was a threshold and the people of Scotland voted substantially&#151;by a significant majority&#151;to have a form of devolved government, but they did not vote in sufficient numbers to meet the threshold. The net result was that for almost 20 years the people of Scotland were denied the opportunity for devolution that they wanted and for which they had voted. They were denied it&#151;they were frustrated&#151;and the Conservatives would do well to reflect that their persistent opposition to Scottish devolution has cost them dearly in that country. The absence of Scottish Conservative representation in recent years has been a simple reflection of the response of the Scottish people to the way in which the Conservatives treated their legitimate aspirations for devolution with contempt.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-16_spnew5"><b> Mr. Osborne: </b> 
 Will the Minister give way?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-16_spnew6"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 No, I have already indicated to the hon. Gentleman that I do not intend to give way to him again.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-16_spnew7"><b> Mr. John Taylor  (Solihull) (Con):</b> 
 But will the Minister give way to me?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-16_spnew8"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 I will give way to the hon. Gentleman.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-16_spnew9"><b> Mr. Taylor: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister. Can he reassure me that in his proposals for postal voting he has taken careful account of what happened in Birmingham before 10 June? That was very disturbing to midlanders, such as me.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-16_spnew10"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, I shall deal specifically with that question later. He raises a legitimate point about concerns as to the safety of the ballot. We have given the matter careful consideration and I shall set out our response in a moment. However, I was talking about turnout and I should like to focus on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-16_para4">
I said at the time, and I am happy to repeat it, that if the turnout for the referendums were so low as to be derisory, the Government would not be bound to implement their proposals. None the less, we consider it our duty to do everything in our power to maximise public participation in the debate over the governance of our regions. That is why, last October, we announced our intention to hold the referendums by all-postal ballot, against the backdrop both of successful pilots at local government elections in 2000, 2002 and 2003 and of the Electoral Commission evaluation of the 2003 pilots, which recommended that, subject to certain safeguards, all-postal voting should become the norm for future local government elections&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 376</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand why the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) is showing such derision from a sedentary position; he indicated in the previous debate on this subject that he did not care a fig for the view of the Electoral Commission, which carried out the evaluation. It is an indication of the cavalier approach of those on the Conservative Front Bench that they show such contempt for the considered views of the Electoral Commission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-16_para5">
The Electoral Commission&#039;s conclusion reflected the evidence from the pilots, which had demonstrated the ability of all-postal voting dramatically to increase turnout&#151;sometimes more than doubling it. The announcement was made early to give electoral administrators certainty in their planning and was welcomed by the Electoral Commission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-16_para6">
A month later, in November, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and I launched the Government&#039;s information campaign to raise awareness of the forthcoming referendums and the issues involved. Since then, debates have been held in each of the regions focusing on the main arguments for and against regional assemblies, and we have conducted a number of hearings to give local people the opportunity to feedback their views on the powers to be contained in the draft Regional Assemblies Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-16_para7">
As a result, individuals and groups have already begun to organise their campaigns on what they see as the key issues, with yes and no groups established in each of the regions. Their expectation is quite properly that the issue will be decided at the referendums this autumn, so it is important that the House confirms the arrangements set out in these orders. To avoid administrative and voter confusion, the provisions drafted in the Regional Assembly and Local Government Referendums Order 2004 are broadly similar to those for June&#039;s European and local elections.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-16_para8">
At the European elections, the average turnout was 42.6 per cent. in the pilot regions compared with 20.2 per cent. in 1999&#151;an increase of more than 100 per cent. In the non-pilot regions, turnout also increased, largely because the European and local government elections were held at the same time, but by only 50 per cent. compared with 1999. There is absolutely clear and incontrovertible evidence that all-postal voting substantially increased the number of people voting, and we have seen that evidence repeatedly, in 2000, 2002 and 2003. The evidence does not come simply from a single election but has been repeated, time and again, and I can quote example after example of local authorities that have conducted all-postal local elections and achieved a doubling, or near doubling, in participation rates compared with previous elections.

<p><a name="40721-17_spnew0"><b> Mr. Edward Davey  (Kingston and Surbiton) (LD):</b> 
 What does the Minister have to say to the Royal National Institute of the Blind, which has been very concerned about the impact of postal voting on partially sighted and blind people? What measures will he take in the forthcoming referendums to ensure that those people have a choice of how to vote?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-17_spnew1"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman raises an absolutely valid issue, and we have made provision, to which I will refer in due course, for electoral officers to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 377</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>visit individuals who have difficulty in filling out all-postal voting forms for reasons of visual impairment. Provision is specifically made for that in these orders, and I am sure that he will welcome that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-17_para0">
The evidence is clear that all-postal voting can substantially increase turnout. Despite that success, we recognise that media coverage of the pilots this June highlighted various concerns. The first group of concerns relates to the administration of the process, which generally worked well, albeit to a very tight timetable. Similar concerns will not apply to regional referendums, which have a much longer lead-in time and no constraints, such as are created by nomination dates for candidates, which prevented the advance printing of ballot papers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-17_para1">
The second group of concerns relates to allegations of possible fraud and malpractice associated with postal voting. Many of the concerns raised at the time and subsequently in debates in the House relate to postal voting outside the all-postal pilot areas. Indeed, the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) mentioned the west midlands a moment ago. That was not one of the all-postal pilot areas, but concerns were expressed, as he said, about the use of postal balloting.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-17_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bernard Jenkin  (North Essex) (Con):</b> 
 There were, of course, problems with postal voting outside the pilot areas. Does the Minister think that those problems apply to the pilot areas? Anyone looking at this dispassionately would think that the problems apply to postal voting, whether voluntary or compulsory, full stop, and that they must be addressed before we go down the route of all-postal voting.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-17_spnew3"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman, as he looks into the subject, will establish that problems are associated with any form of balloting. Electoral administrators will advise that difficulties are associated with all types of voting, so it is necessary to have in place proper safeguards and measures to guard against possible abuse to the greatest extent possible. That is essential&#151;it is our commitment&#151;but the fact that, this year and in previous years, allegations of problems and malpractice associated with postal voting have been made does not in itself raise specific problems in relation to all-postal pilots. [Hon. Members: &quot;Yes, it does.&quot;] It does not; it raises an issue to do with postal voting generally, not with the intention of holding&#151;

</p>








<p><a name="40721-17_spnew5"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman wishes to intervene again, of course, I will give way to him.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-17_spnew6"><b> Mr. Jenkin: </b> 
 The problems with postal voting have arisen as postal voting has increased in importance in our electoral system. If we vastly increase postal voting, the scale of those problems will vastly increase. We have a well-developed body of law for voting at ballot boxes and polling stations; we do not have a well-developed body of law and practice for large-scale postal voting. That is the problem.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 378</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="40721-17_spnew7"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s hypothesis is simply not supported by the evidence. He should listen to the views of the returning officer for the north-west region, where probably the largest number of problems were reported. The chief executive of Manchester city council, Howard Bernstein, said that, if anything, the number of problems with fraud was probably less this year than in previous years. So I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument about scaling up the extent of all-postal voting is simply not substantiated.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-17_spnew8"><b> Mr. Graham Stringer  (Manchester, Blackley) (Lab):</b> 
 I have heard my right hon. Friend and other Ministers use that quote from Sir Howard Bernstein a number of times. It is accurate, but partial&#151;the rest of the quote goes on to say that there has been an increase in the number of cases of intimidation. That is a joint statement from the regional returning officer and Greater Manchester police. What weight does my right hon. Friend put on the fact that intimidation apparently increased in the north-west?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-17_spnew9"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 Clearly, we must wait for the report from the Electoral Commission, which is carrying out an evaluation, and we will give very considerable attention to that report when it becomes available. However, my hon. Friend will be conscious of the fact that a number of the complaints were associated with actions seeking to ensure the success of individual candidates in elections where candidates were seeking office, which can attract substantial allowances, and there may be something of a financial incentive. Most commentators who consider the referendums, where no such incentive applies, would recognise that the kind of instances that he alludes to are much less likely to occur in the context of a simple referendum question, where no individual stands to gain election as a result.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-17_spnew10"><b> Mr. Edward Davey: </b> 
 I agree with the Minister: the case for an all-postal ballot in a referendum is much stronger because the incentive for fraud is much less. Given that logic, is he saying therefore that the case for all-postal ballots in local elections is much weaker?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-17_spnew11"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 No, what I was saying&#151;<i>[Laughter]&#151;</i>as the hon. Gentleman and other Opposition Members, whose mirth indicates their reluctance to listen, should be aware, is that we will await the Electoral Commission&#039;s response, because it is the body charged by the House&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Frankly, for the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, from a sedentary position, to talk about ignoring the Electoral Commission&#039;s views when he said, from the Conservative Front Bench, that that was exactly what he did shows a degree of inconsistency that I find quite astonishing&#151;but, sadly, we are all too used to that from the Conservative party.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-17_para2">
In the light of that media coverage, the Electoral Commission suggested that we delay laying the referendum orders until after it had published its evaluation of the pilots in September. However, as we pointed out to the commission, if we are to hold referendums this autumn, as is widely expected, and allow an adequate campaigning period and public information in line with the commitments that we have given, Parliament needs to approve the necessary

 What will be the nature of the advice given by the Electoral Commission? Does the right hon.

</p>








<p><a name="40721-17_spnew13"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 My understanding from the Electoral Commission is that it will, in its report, specifically address the issue of the all-postal referendums proposed for this autumn and report, which it is required to do by statute, on the experience of the all-postal pilots that took place in June. It is entirely up to the commission to decide how it wishes to address the issue, but it is conscious of the significance of what it says. As I have said, if the evidence is convincing that it would be unsafe to proceed, we shall certainly react positively and be prepared not to proceed with an all-postal referendum. However, we must obviously wait to see the evidence.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-17_spnew14"><b> Mr. Edward Davey: </b> 
 The Minister has been very generous in giving way. I hope that the Government have no intention of hiding behind the statement made by the Electoral Commission. I hope that he will recognise that its report is advisory, as the Government have reminded the House on many other occasions, and that the decision about whether to go ahead with a referendum lies with Ministers and not with the Electoral Commission.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-17_spnew15"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 I entirely accept that; we have always accepted that. However, we take the advice of the Electoral Commission seriously and we have, on occasions, disagreed with it. When we do so, that is not because we simply state arrogantly that we do not care a fig for its views. We set out objective and fair reasons why we take a different view. There have been few such occasions. Overwhelmingly, we have gone along with the recommendations of the Electoral Commission, and we intend to give proper and serious consideration to whatever it says.

 Will my right hon. Friend clarify the matter? If the Electoral Commission finds that there are problems with postal ballots in a region, will that rule out postal ballots in all three regions or only the region that has the problem?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-18_spnew1"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 My hon. Friend asks a very pertinent question. As he will know, his region&#151;the north-east region&#151;probably has the greatest experience of all-postal balloting. Most authorities have adopted it and his authority of Gateshead has been a pioneer in showing in one of the earliest pilots the capability of doubling participation. It has sustained high levels of participation 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 380</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in subsequent pilots. Therefore, experience in the north-east is generally overwhelmingly positive, and I have received very few indications of anxieties from north-east authorities about potential problems. If there are concerns, it is right to address them wherever they are rather than adopting a blanket approach that would not be appropriate in the circumstances.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-18_spnew2"><b> Ms Dari Taylor  (Stockton, South) (Lab):</b> 
 I seek reassurance from my right hon. Friend that he is not losing confidence in postal ballots. I am bound to remind him that we in the north-east and my constituency of Stockton, South voted in significantly greater numbers because of the use of postal ballots, even with the witness statement, which was an absolute nuisance. The Electoral Commission said that there was no cause for concern, no evidence of improper behaviour and no evidence of fraud. I seek reassurance that my right hon. Friend is not losing confidence in postal ballots as an important way of supporting our electorate.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 My hon. Friend will have heard the remarks that I made earlier in which I made it clear that I believe that there are considerable advantages with all-postal ballots. We certainly want to maximise participation. However, we take seriously all genuine and substantial allegations of fraud or malpractice, and we want to ensure that there are proper safeguards in place to ensure that public confidence in the voting system can be maintained. That is the proper balance to maintain, and it is the position that we have adopted.


</p>








<p><a name="40721-18_spnew4"><b> Mr. Curry: </b> 
 Does the right hon. Gentleman envisage circumstances in which postal ballots might take place in fewer than three regions&#151;in other words, in one or two&#151;and that the entire ballot might be deferred in one or two or take place at a later date by traditional methods of voting? That is really the question that the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Clelland) posed.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-18_spnew5"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The Government brought forward all three orders and the three separate orders that were debated Upstairs two days ago on the basis that we propose that the referendums should all be held on the same date this autumn. It is implicit in what I have said about our response to the evidence and, in particular, to the views of the Electoral Commission that if it were suggested that it were unsafe to proceed in one region but not in others, we would by the nature of our response be prepared to proceed in one region on the basis already proposed while deferring or adopting a different approach in another one. That has to be the way forward. I shall not speculate on that; the issue is purely speculative. Implicit in the approach that we have adopted is an indication of our commitment to proceed according to the timetable that we have set out and our willingness to listen carefully to the evidence brought to the House as well as that of the Electoral Commission. We shall reach a considered view in the light of that evidence.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-18_spnew6"><b> Mr. Curry: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman referred to deferring or using a different approach. Is it therefore conceivable that, let us say, the north-east and Yorkshire and Humber will vote by postal ballot on

<br>&nbsp;<br>4&nbsp;November as anticipated&#151;I understand that it would not be possible to arrange a manual ballot by that date&#151;but that the north-west might vote on a subsequent date but still within this Parliament?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-18_spnew7"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Were one of the orders not to be passed tonight or tomorrow when the other place considers the matter, there would need to be alternative orders because it would not be possible for a simple shift in the method of voting to take place without that being approved by the House. There clearly would be a need for additional parliamentary consideration if that course of action were pursued.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-18_spnew8"><b> Mr. Mark Field  (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con):</b> 
 I appreciate the Government&#039;s desire to raise turnout, and the Minister has concentrated his comments on administration and fraud, about which Conservative Members have concerns. However, he has not concentrated on&#151;the Electoral Commission has not made great play of this&#151;the credibility of an election or a referendum. A campaign takes place that culminates in one day with the public at large collectively making its decision. The great power of an election or a referendum depends on that. Does he not see that that notion of an election or referendum is entirely undermined if the system of postal voting is made compulsory?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-18_spnew9"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 No, I do not. I accept entirely the hon. Gentleman&#039;s premise that there should be a formal period for campaigning. However, we have accepted as part of our democratic arrangements for decades that some people can vote either by proxy or by post. There were provisions&#151;most spectacularly in the 1945 election, which did not help his party&#151;for the forces to vote at a different time to other people. Arrangements can be made for voting at different points during the campaign period, and that does not undermine the validity of a ballot. The important things are for arguments to be presented and for the public to have a full opportunity to hear the arguments debated, after which they form a judgment. That is one of the reasons why we have insisted that there should a proper period throughout the referendum to allow people to hear and consider the arguments of the yes and no campaigns, which will be registered by the Electoral Commission and given access to funds to promote their points of view. It is right for that to be in place before people receive their ballot papers. People may vote at different times, but there will be a proper campaign so that they may form a judgment based on the arguments to which they are exposed.

We are confident that problems highlighted in the media coverage of the pilots would not apply to the referendums.

In June, there were reports that votes could not be counted because witnessed declarations of identity were incomplete, so the Government intend, in line with the advice of the Electoral Commission, to use security statements that do not require witness signatures for this autumn&#039;s referendums.

 I welcome what my right hon. Friend says about not continuing with witness statements in the unhelpful form that they took in June.

 I entirely concur with the views expressed by my right hon. Friend, who has a lot of experience of the matter and has watched the process over those years. As I said in response to our hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South, who shares the same local authority as my right hon. Friend, there is considerable evidence of successful all-postal voting in Gateshead. The evidence from this summer&#039;s pilots suggests that the witness statement might have adversely affected the turnout compared with that in previous pilots, but we will wait for the measured and considered response of the Electoral Commission before reaching a firm decision. However, we do not intend to use witness statements during the course of the referendums.

I hope that he will give due weight to people&#039;s concerns that the danger of electoral fraud will remain until we get individual voter registration. The Government need to be careful if they really are to discard the witness statement.

One problem is that individuals are nervous that the existence of a witness statement compromises the secrecy of the ballot&#151;it does not, but people are fearful that it might. People who live alone face a problem because they may not find it easy to have someone available to witness their declarations at a convenient time. Those and other factors are probably some of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 383</b>

<p><a name="40721-19_spnew1"><b> Mr. Davey: </b> 
 May I come back to the Minister on two points? First, the Electoral Commission favours individual elector registration as a long-term goal&#151;I think that there is cross-party consensus on that point&#151;but how do we insure against fraud in the meantime? Secondly, if there is misperception among the electorate that the secrecy of a ballot could be jeopardised, surely we should tackle that by proving through clearer information that that is not the case.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-19_spnew2"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 I shall take the hon. Gentleman&#039;s second point first. It is absolutely right that good information should be available to everyone who votes, whatever method is used. There is evidence that the authorities that have explained the all-postal voting process most thoughtfully have achieved the highest levels of participation because they have allayed fears and ensured that people were on side. Several authorities that have done that over three years or more&#151;Gateshead has done it for four years&#151;have demonstrated that it is possible to achieve sustained high levels of participation. We should pay close heed to the experience of those authorities, many of which are in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the north-east, that have operated the system successfully without problems on separate occasions.

<p>
<a name="40721-19_para1">
The Electoral Commission&#039;s recommendation on individual registration is important and we are giving it serious consideration. We intend to move forward on the basis of its proposals. However, that cannot be done without legislation and quite complex administration, which will not be in place before this autumn&#039;s referendums. The Electoral Commission was aware of that when it welcomed our decision to proceed with an all-postal referendum. They knew that it would not be possible to accompany that with individual registration and took its decision in the light of that evidence.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-19_spnew5"><b> Mr. Jones: </b> 
 Chester-le-Street in my constituency has had postal voting for the past three years. Does my right hon. Friend agree that the confusion in the European election was caused by the need for people to sign a witness statement, and turnout went down whereas in previous elections it had been going up? For example, last September we had a record turnout in a council by-election of 64 per cent. Surely the fact of the matter is that the witness statement causes more confusion.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-19_spnew6"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 My hon. Friend also speaks from considerable experience. Most hon. Members will be highly impressed with that figure. Sadly, we are not used to a 64 per cent. turnout in a council by-election. It reflects the remarkable success of all-postal voting in achieving higher turnouts.

Another difference between the pilots held in June and the referendums this autumn is that we have made provision for more assistance and delivery points of at least one per 50,000 electors, to be open on the date of the referendum and the preceding seven working days, during normal working hours, to enable those people who want to vote in person to do so.

The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) asked in a previous debate whether that provision would be adequate in rural areas. We have reflected on that and I am pleased to tell him that electoral administrators will be empowered to make additional arrangements in areas where they think that the 50,000 figure is inadequate, so there can be greater provision if they think that it is justified. In addition, as I said in my reply to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, there will be provision for electoral administrators to visit individuals who are not able to vote because of a disability, in particular visual impairment, and who might need assistance.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-19_spnew9"><b> Mr. Curry: </b> 
 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for making that common-sense provision. The Craven area barely has 50,000 inhabitants, let alone 50,000 electors, and they are spread over the north Pennines, so it is an obvious difficulty. For people who are visually impaired or who have difficulty getting to a poll or filling in a ballot paper, will there be a mechanism by which they notify the returning officer of that disability or problem so that they can be visited? What will be put in place to enable them to take advantage of that facility?

<p><a name="40721-19_spnew10"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The chairman of the Electoral Commission, who is overseeing the process, and the returning officers who will be responsible within each region, must give thought to that matter.

<p><a name="40721-19_spnew12"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises a question that clearly will have to be considered by the electoral administrators.

 As my right hon. Friend knows, I have one or two problems with the whole idea of the referendum. However, if we proceed, we must encourage the greatest number of people to participate, so will he ensure that the instructions are in plain English so that people can understand them? That is an important point. In June, the instructions issued in Yorkshire and Humber were virtually incomprehensible and caused many people to make a complete mess of voting. In London, despite the complexity of the elections, the instructions were a lot clearer.

 I can assure my hon. Friend that the orders that the Under-Secretary of State, my hon.

 I was not suggesting that there was an analogy; I was suggesting that arrangements had been put in place to ensure that those people who want to vote in person will be able to do so. The assistance and delivery points to which I referred will be open for a whole week before the close of ballot, and most people, even in rural areas, would find it possible in the course of a week to visit such a location. I have also referred to our intention to allow electoral administrators to make individual visits. There might be mobile polling stations to call in certain areas at specified times. It is our intention that everything possible should be done to encourage participation. This is all about making it easier for people to vote. We know that all-postal ballots are very welcome to many people, who find that the most convenient way to vote.

Political parties would be subject to a sliding scale of limits, determined by their vote share at the last European elections.

Parties receiving less than 5 per cent. of the vote would be able to spend no more than &#163;100,000, the same limit as applies to permitted participants that are not political parties. There is a sliding scale determining maximum limits for political parties between these extremes.

<p><a name="40721-20_spnew4"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 No. The rules are spelled out clearly in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, which sets the overall framework.

Because this is an all-postal election and the ballot papers will be sent out approximately three weeks before that, we have agreed in our discussions with the Electoral Commission that we will apply the 28-day cut-off to mean 28 days from the date at which the voting papers are likely to be sent out, so it is more likely to be 28 days plus three weeks from the final date of the poll.

: Is it not easier to impersonate someone under the present ballot-box system than under the postal-vote system? I could turn up at the hon. Gentleman&#039;s polling station, give his name and address, receive a ballot paper and walk out. There would be no audit trail to establish that I had been there. Surely what the hon. Gentleman is saying is nonsense.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-21_spnew6"><b> Mr. Jenkin: </b> 
 Logistically, it is much more difficult to organise large-scale impersonation in a polling station than behind a closed door with stacks of ballot papers. In order to impersonate me, another voter and another voter several times, the hon. Gentleman would have to go into separate polling stations to avoid being identified voting more than once. That is not necessary if he is voting behind a closed door using ballot papers with forged signatures. It is possible to vote hundreds and hundreds of times under the system that is being promulgated in these orders. It would not be possible to do that with the conventional ballot box.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-21_spnew7"><b> Mr. Edward Davey: </b> 
 Would the hon. Gentleman be more relaxed if there were a declaration of identity, as there was in the all-postal ballot pilots? It is important for him to say that. If he can join our party in making that point, perhaps we can persuade the Government that, until we get individual elector registration, that is the way to go to prevent the fraud that he has expressed concern about.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-21_spnew8"><b> Mr. Jenkin: </b> 
 A witness statement is an additional safeguard. None the less, it is unsatisfactory because it can be forged, too, and there is no way to check that. However, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it would be preferable to have a witness statement.

I still think that it would be preferable to have conventional ballot box voting. That would be a more secure way of conducting the referendums. How could anyone check whether the signatures on the ballot packs were real or fake?

 The House is well aware that evidence was produced that fraud took place in parts of the midlands. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman could tell us whether there was any evidence of similar fraud, on any scale, in the northern region.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-21_spnew10"><b> Mr. Jenkin: </b> 
 If the system is unsound in the midlands, it is unsound in any other region. I will come to what the leader of Birmingham city council said in a moment, but the other place insisted on a witness statement in the postal pilots because of the need for some check on all-postal balloting. I agree with the right hon. Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Joyce Quin), who is longing to be the new Miss North-east in the regional assembly: it probably would reduce the turnout because it would complicate the system, but it would make it safer. We must accept that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-21_para7">
That is why the Electoral Commission wanted the Government to delay these referendum orders. It is all very well to say that my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan), who is no longer here unfortunately, would not listen to the Electoral Commission. When it does not suit the Minister for Local and Regional Government, even though his Government set up the Electoral Commission, he does not listen to it&#151;well, he listens to it and ignores it. That is what he has done in this case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-21_para8">
It is widely known that the Electoral Commission would have preferred the Government to delay the orders until it reported on the pilots. I am sure that the Minister will not be disingenuous enough to insist that that is not true. What it wants ideally is to implement individual voter registration, so that a record of every voter&#039;s signature is held centrally on file and signatures on ballot papers can be cross-checked if there is any doubt or any need. Indeed, they could be spot cross-checked to discourage anyone from forging a signature on a ballot paper.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-21_para9">
In these referendums, apathy will be rife. The majority in all three regions probably do not care, or hardly know, about the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s precious regional assembly proposals. Few people will care what happens to the ballot papers that they never asked for. Again, despite the chaos last time, live, validated ballot papers will pour out across the north of England and, from that point on, no one will know where individual ballot papers have been, who has completed them and whether any fraud has taken place. That is what the postal pilots clearly proved last month.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-21_para10">
The other problem is the state of electoral law. As Sir Albert Bore, Labour leader of Birmingham city council, said last month:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;At present, in relation to postal ballot papers, the law is so general that almost anything is legal.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-21_para11">
That is why the Electoral Commission is pushing for an increase in the number and type of offences with regard to postal voting to protect the integrity of the ballot.

<a name="40721-21_para12">
I put it to the Minister that there is no consensus on this matter. He has the support of neither the Liberal Democrats nor the Conservative party on the question. Why are the Government galloping ahead with their own way of conducting ballots without any party consensus? This has hardly ever been done before with such a cavalier attitude. The only conclusion that one can reach is that it is being done because it is in this miserable, rotten Government&#039;s interests; they see political advantage in it. An all-postal ballot is the only hope of avoiding the humiliation of a totally derisory turnout. That is not an excuse for hijacking the voting system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-21_para13">
The other advantage that the Government now have is a convenient exit strategy. I can well imagine that the right hon.

<a name="40721-21_para14">
Last month, the House was told that the referendums would not proceed if the Electoral Commission were to conclude that it was &quot;unsafe&quot; to proceed with all-postal voting.

<p><a name="40721-22_spnew0"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 I should make it clear that the hon. Gentleman is quoting my remarks in the previous debate out of context. When I talked about possible changes to regulations, I was asked about the impact on the timetable of any recommendations that the Electoral Commission might make. I tried to draw a distinction between recommendations that would involve legislation, which clearly would involve a long delay; recommendations that might involve a change in regulations, which would involve a delay; and recommendations that might involve administrative changes, which might not involve a delay if those could be done expeditiously. I was simply trying to illustrate the fact that we had to take account of a range of possible circumstances. The hon. Gentleman should not imply that a suggestion that there might be a modest change to administrative procedures is a justification for not taking action. That was certainly not what I implied.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jenkin: </b> 
 I fully accept what the right hon. Gentleman says, but it does not alter the substance of the point I am making, which concerns what the real test of &quot;unsafe&quot; is. In the end, it that will be a decision for Ministers; we cannot expect the Electoral Commission to make the decision about whether the referendums 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 393</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>should go ahead, any more than we could expect Hans Blix to decide whether we should invade Iraq. It is a question for Ministers, and not something that the Minister will be able to define today. It leaves him all the room for manoeuvre that he wants.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-22_para0">
The real test of the word &quot;unsafe&quot; will be a political judgment, not a legal or technical one. If it looks likely that Labour will lose one or more of the referendums, that may well be what the Government conclude to be &quot;unsafe&quot;. It will be the Prime Minister who makes the ultimate decision, not his hapless deputy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-22_para1">
The Minister refuses to define &quot;unsafe&quot; and &quot;derisory&quot;. This kind of confusion, chaos and deceit has characterised the Government&#039;s proposals for elected regional assembles from the start. I ask for one simple reassurance that the right hon. Gentleman failed to give the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Clelland) or my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry). Either all the referendums go ahead, or not. Does the Minister agree that there can be no conceivable excuse for cancelling one or two of the referendums? Either he will consider postal voting to be an unsafe system, or a safe one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-22_para2">
How can the system be safe in some places and not in others? That is the answer to the question from the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor). Do we think people behave differently in Bradford than in York? [Hon. Members: &quot;Yes.&quot;] That is an interesting comment. All citizens in this country should be treated as equals. To cast aspersions on one part of the population but not another is a very nasty thing to do; yet that is the implication of the Government&#039;s position. Either the system is sound or it is not, and if not, none of the referendums should proceed on this basis.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-22_spnew2"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 I should make it clear that there is no question of casting aspersions on any section of the community or individual area. However, the fact is that the complaints made about the problems associated with all-postal voting&#151;or, indeed, with postal voting&#151;tended to be concentrated in certain areas. That factor clearly has to be taken into account, and it would be quite wrong to draw general conclusions from what might be localised problems associated with particular candidates in individual elections. I drew a clear distinction between circumstances that might prove an incentive to commit fraud&#151;in which a candidate has an incentive to get elected&#151;and the very different circumstances that apply in a referendum. The hon. Gentleman should accept that in that regard it is possible to draw distinctions between different areas of the country without implying the kind of slur that he suggested might lie behind our position.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-22_spnew3"><b> Mr. Jenkin: </b> 
 I do not accept that that should be the determining factor. I repeat: if the system is unsound, it is unsound anywhere. The right hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument is that because we do not have competing candidates, no vested interests are involved in this process, but of course that is not true. Huge vested interests are involved. The reputation of the Deputy Prime Minister is on the line; the careers of the &quot;jobs for

<p>
<a name="40721-22_para3">
In any case, what about some of the organisations that might be involved in the yes campaign or the no campaign? I certainly do not want to have anything to do with the British National party. However, it is on the record as saying that it will apply for designation as a permitted participant. Does the right hon. Gentleman expect the BNP to behave as well as any other political party behaves? I certainly do not.

<p><a name="40721-22_spnew4"><b> Mr. Curry: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has asked a question of the Minister and in order to avoid ambiguity, I want to explain to my hon. Friend my understanding of the Minister&#039;s reply to my earlier intervention. I do not understand why we are being so squeamish about saying what we believe, which is that there appear to have been problems with the conduct of the ballot in certain ethnic minority areas. That is what we are talking about; we are simply trying to avoid using that expression. As I understood it, the Minister said that it is not impossible that there could be three ballots, two ballots or one ballot, and that they could all take place through postal voting or through a combination of postal and manual voting. In the latter case, manual voting would take place at a later date than postal voting because it would not be possible to make the necessary arrangements in time, given the need first to pass the relevant legislation through this House. That is my understanding of what the Minister said.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-22_spnew5"><b> Mr. Jenkin: </b> 
 If the Minister will confirm that that is so&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> He nods, but I have to say that that was not my understanding of his response to the intervention of my right hon. Friend. The point is that, as my right hon. Friend will agree, we are faced with an extraordinary mess. There is a very high likelihood that what we are debating&#151;and possibly approving&#151;is what will not happen. This is a mess of the Government&#039;s own making, and one made over a remarkably short period.

<p><a name="40721-22_spnew7"><b> Mr. Jenkin: </b>

That reminds us that the Labour party is hopelessly split. On Monday, it was reported that 27 north-west Labour Members, including three Ministers, have written to the Deputy Prime Minister asking for the regional referendum to be scrapped. The truth is that Labour Members are queueing up to tell him to ditch the project. Just two days ago, the hon.

Of course there is a division of opinion in some areas of the north-west, and in Yorkshire, as we have heard today.

 It is worth reminding the House that when some related orders were debated on Monday, one was carried by only nine votes to seven, and indeed would have been lost by the Government without the support of the Liberal Democrats, because of the number of Labour Members put on that Committee by the Whips who voted against the Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the hon.

We still do not know what powers an elected assembly would have. Throughout the past 12 months, we have had ministerial claim and counter-claim about what the powers are to be.

That is what the Minister believes to be correct, but we have not seen the draft Bill, so we have no idea whether it is, in fact, correct.

Will it contain those new powers or, as the Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the hon. Member for Corby (Phil Hope) told my hon.

I have to tell the Minister that that statement is, at the very least, a subject of political dispute and controversy. It is not undisputed fact.

 I have not met the gentleman concerned, so I have no way of assessing the veracity of that statement. The fact remains that there is a long list of powers in the White Paper&#151;including powers to deal with waste, transport and housing&#151;that are currently carried out at local government level, but will subsequently be interfered with by regional assemblies.

 The hon.

<p><a name="40721-23_spnew8"><b> Mr. Jenkin: </b> 
 I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not going to be suckered by what is in the White Paper. Let us consider what it actually says. Under the heading &quot;Where we want to be&quot;, paragraph 9.4 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We will improve the current arrangements for making decisions on transport. Central to this will be giving regional and local bodies more influence&quot;.</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-23_para6">
But what is &quot;influence&quot;? Influence means not having the final decision. These new organisations will be empowered with strategies, consultation and influence, but virtually no executive powers whatever. Even such executive powers as they will have, such as the appointment of directors to the regional development agencies&#151;something that those agencies do not want&#151;will be subject to the Minister&#039;s veto.

 If the hon. Gentleman is right about that, it would be worrying and we will not be suckered if that is what happens.

 I strongly support the orders, because they will enact the will of the House. The people of the northern regions should have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether they want directly elected regional assemblies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-24_para0">
The choice will be between the new assemblies and maintaining the current system and all its inequalities. A child born today in the north-west is likely to live 10 years less than one born in the south-east. Overwhelmingly, the country&#039;s deprived wards and local authorities are concentrated in the north-west, and funding for scientific research continues to be concentrated in four higher education institutions&#151;the Oxbridge colleges, and two colleges in London.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-24_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jenkin: </b> 
 We often hear about the life expectancy disparity between north and south. It is possible to find wide disparities in life expectancy between people born in leafy Surrey, say, and the worst ward in Newcastle, but the greatest disparities exist between the good and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 399</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>bad areas of individual regions. The average disparity in life expectancy between regions is actually quite small, so can we have truth in this matter? I have checked the figures, and I challenge the hon. Lady to produce region-wide figures that bear out her assertion, because it is not true.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-24_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Ellman: </b> 
 I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that I am being untruthful. If he is, I ask him to withdraw the suggestion. The figure that I quoted is correct, and is borne out by numerous statistics put forward by other people. It is clear that there is a concentration of deprivation in the north-west&#151;in terms of wards, special areas, local authorities and life expectancy, and in many other ways.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-24_spnew3"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the disparity in constituencies such as hers and mine was made worse by the last Tory Government?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-24_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Ellman: </b> 
 I certainly do agree and we are attempting to change the situation in which deprivation and inequality continue. Those people who oppose the proposals&#151;the orders that will give effect to the choice that we want to offer the people of the north, to decide whether they want to change the system&#151;want to maintain the status quo, with all its inequalities.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-24_spnew5"><b> Mr. George Osborne: </b> 
 The hon. Lady mentioned science moving from the north-west to Oxbridge and she will know that the Government took the decision to move the synchrotron from Daresbury to Oxfordshire. That was a damaging decision for the north-west, but does she really think that a regional assembly would have been able to stop a decision taken by the Minister for Science and Innovation in Whitehall to move the facility? Even if the referendum were to be won, such decisions would continue to be made by the Minister and the Cabinet.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-24_spnew6"><b> Mrs. Ellman: </b> 
 The decision to which the hon. Gentleman refers was one instance, although it was a serious instance that outraged the north-west and started to bring the region together. One of the consequences was the formation of the North West Science Council, with people from the academic and scientific sector working together with Members of Parliament and local authority representatives. We realised that unless we worked together, the system&#151;of which that decision was only one example&#151;would continue. It would have been inconceivable for that decision to have been taken for the areas represented by the Welsh Assembly or the Scottish Parliament. It is essential to have an organisation to represent the region as a whole, to deal with those issues that are regional&#151;not local&#151;and to give clout to the north-west and the other northern regions, and to argue for change and a better allocation of resources.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-24_para1">
The hon. Gentleman refers to a decision taken by a Minister, but it was taken after concentrated lobbying and threats from the Wellcome Trust as to what it would do if the decision were not taken in its favour. The real decision was taken by that magic inner circle&#151;the people who know one another and who are convinced that the only centres of excellence are to be found in London and the south-east. That is one of the very 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 400</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>strong reasons why it is so important that we have an elected regional body to speak out for the needs of the region and to work with people in our centres of excellence. By mentioning that example, the hon. Gentleman has drawn attention to one of the strongest reasons for going forward with an elected regional assembly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-24_para2">
Reference has been made in the debate to the postal vote. From experience, it gives people the maximum opportunity to vote. Indeed, in the recent elections in my area, turnout was almost doubled in some areas by the postal vote. My right hon. Friend the Minister mentioned the caveats about the postal vote in terms of any comments that the Electoral Commission might make. The hon. Member for North Essex said that he believed that people in the regions did not know about the opportunity that they will have to vote for a directly elected Assembly. If that is the case, that is all the more reason to pass the orders. The yes and no campaigns can be officially organised, with sufficient resources to argue their cases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-24_para3">
I find that people in the north-west are most interested and concerned about how the region has been treated in terms of transport, jobs, planning, housing and public health. Those are all areas in which the elected regional assembly will have specific responsibilities and powers. Reference was made earlier in the debate to housing. The housing powers that would go to the elected regional assembly under the White Paper are currently exercised by quangos at a regional level, which report to a Minister. They are not powers for local authorities; they relate to the allocation of housing investment within and between local authorities and housing associations. An elected body should decide such extremely important matters. I suspect that few people in the regions know that such decision making is taking place, let alone the names of the individuals and organisations taking those decisions. It is thus essential that the powers promised in the White Paper go to the elected body.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-24_para4">
Jobs and skills are extremely important. Under the White Paper, regional development agencies would be accountable to the region and not solely to Ministers, as is currently the case&#151;although of course Ministers discuss various issues with the regional chambers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-24_para5">
The north-west has had a bad deal on transport. The rate of progress on the west coast main line leaves much to be desired. If we had an elected assembly, much more would have happened in that regard. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport has made several statements recently about devolving transport matters locally to passenger transport authorities and to regional bodies, but unless such bodies are directly elected, those powers would be devolved to quangos&#151;to unknown people who are not accountable in the region.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-24_para6">
Proposals have been made about setting up transport boards, especially in regions where there are directly elected assemblies. That, too, will give power to people in the regions and to people who are elected and thus accountable.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-24_spnew7"><b> Mr. George Osborne: </b> 
 From my dealings with the hon. Lady, I have no doubt about her sincerity and I know why she speaks with such strength on these issues. I ask 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 401</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>her to consider the M6 toll road&#151;probably one of the most important issues facing the north-west, which we both represent. Does she really think that decisions such as whether to proceed with the M6 toll road will have anything to do with a north-west regional assembly? That decision will be taken by the Secretary of State for Transport, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and, possibly, the Cabinet. Those vital decisions for the north-west will continue to be taken in London.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-24_spnew8"><b> Mrs. Ellman: </b> 
 Some decisions will be taken locally, some regionally and some nationally, but a directly elected body would have the clout and legitimacy to ensure that decisions such as the one the hon. Gentleman mentioned would be dealt with much more seriously and quickly. Without such a body, things would lapse and decisions would increasingly suit the south and the south-east where strength already lies, with no need for direct elections&#151;although it will not have escaped the hon. Gentleman&#039;s notice that the existence of the Mayor and the London assembly have brought increased strength to London and its power to attract more and more resources. Unless there is an equivalent body in the north-west, we shall find that power and resources are increasingly sucked to London and the south-east. The north-west and the other northern regions will continue to be left behind.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-24_spnew9"><b> Mr. Edward Davey: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is right. Furthermore, if the powers of the Highways Agency were devolved to the north-west regional assembly, the assembly would have powers over trunk roads, such as those devolved to the Greater London authority. That would be especially welcomed by county councils in the north-west, as they are annoyed when investment decisions on trunk roads are made in London and by the Highways Agency, rather than by the people of the north-west. Devolution of powers for trunk roads would be a substantial improvement on the current situation.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040721/debtext/40721-25.htm"/>







<p><a name="40721-25_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Ellman: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s observations. Regional assemblies should be involved with such important matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-25_para0">
Another important issue in the north-west is the second Mersey crossing at Halton, which the Government are considering at present. Again, an elected north-west assembly would ensure that the arguments were put to Ministers and when they took their decisions, the whole strength of the north-west would be behind them, supported by its elected assembly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-25_para1">
There is often much dissention in such debates about whether the people of the north-west or, indeed, the other northern regions want an elected regional assembly, but there is considerable evidence that they want them. Only very recently, the ICM poll carried out in the north-west showed increasingly strong support for a directly elected north-west assembly and the business leadership team&#151;derided, unfortunately, by the hon. Member for North Essex&#151;has come out in strong support. I found his suggestion that the business leadership team was some kind of organisation set up by the Deputy Prime Minister pretty amazing. In fact, the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 402</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>business leadership team, with which I have worked very closely since its inception, was set up in 1982, and I do not recall that it was set up by the then Deputy Prime Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-25_para2">
In 1982, I was leader of Lancashire county council, and I recall bringing together people in the north-west to argue the case for an elected north-west regional body. The businesses of the north-west responded by getting together themselves and saying that they did not believe that the current system served business or the people of the north-west well. Among those businesses currently represented in the business leadership team at senior level, usually chief executive, are Pilkington, BAE Systems, British Nuclear Fuels Ltd., Manchester Airport, McAlpine and Littlewoods&#151;hardly a little group set up by the Deputy Prime Minister, but an extremely powerful body. Indeed, it advocates that it is time that the north-west had a stronger voice with clout and the ability to get things done, which is supported in votes taken across the north-west at the moment by various chambers of commerce.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-25_spnew1"><b> Joyce Quin: </b> 
 I strongly support the case that my hon. Friend is making with great force. Does she welcome, as I did earlier today, the statement made by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs about increased devolution in rural development policy to the regions? Does she agree that that is a way to help regional development agencies and regional assemblies, if established, to work effectively?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-25_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Ellman: </b> 
 I very much welcome the point that my right hon. Friend makes. Indeed, in doing so, she draws attention to the importance of regional assemblies not only representing interests that are regional in their essence&#151;such as, for example, science research and transport issues that affect the whole region&#151;but being able to consider the differing needs of various parts of the region, including those of rural as well as urban areas. All that diversity of interest can be represented by elected regional assemblies, working with local authorities&#151;I hope that they will continue to be strengthened&#151;and central Government, where appropriate.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-25_spnew3"><b> Mr. George Osborne: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Lady for generously giving way to me a third time. She keeps saying that chambers of commerce support regional government. Let me read what the Wirral, Warrington and North Cheshire chamber of commerce says. It asks the Government


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;to abandon this project before it wastes a great deal of money on a level of government that few people want and even less people need.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-25_para3">
That is what chambers of commerce actually say about the proposal.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-25_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Ellman: </b> 
 That quote does not represent the view of all chambers of commerce&#151;certainly not that of those in my area. Clearly, there is continuing debate about whether people want elected regional assemblies. There is only one way to find out: to go ahead with the referendums with the easiest possible way for people to register their vote. That is why I hope that the orders will be passed. I hope that both Houses will continue to support the important issue of giving the people of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 403</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>north a choice on whether they continue with the current system, which has not served them well and increasingly results in inequality.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-25_spnew5"><b> Mr. Dawson: </b> 
 Given that devolution is a dynamic process, not a single event, does my hon. Friend share my anxiety that, if the people of the north-west choose not to go for an elected regional assembly and other regions, such as Yorkshire and Humber and the north-east, choose to do so, the north-west could find itself swiftly losing out in comparison not only to the south-east, but to those other northern regions?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-25_spnew6"><b> Mrs. Ellman: </b> 
 I share my hon. Friend&#039;s concerns. Devolution has already started to happen in the United Kingdom. Scotland has its Parliament; Wales has its Assembly; and London has its assembly and a directly elected Mayor. If other parts of the United Kingdom start to gain more powers, the northern regions will increasingly lose out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-25_para4">
That is why it is important that the people of the northern regions have the earliest possible opportunity&#151;on 4 November&#151;to vote in referendums to decide whether they want to continue with the current system that has produced inequality or whether they want to start the vital process by taking the great leap forward of having directly elected assemblies that will start to reverse the decline of many years and open up new opportunities for the people of the north.

<p><a name="40721-25_spnew7"><b> Mr. Edward Davey  (Kingston and Surbiton) (LD):</b> 
 The hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) has made a powerful and passionate speech. She has put the argument for elected regional assemblies exceedingly well by talking about the voice for the north-west, about the need to get businesses behind the economic development needed to reduce the inequalities that she mentioned and, above all, about the need to democratise the many quangos. She made a point early in her remarks with which I very much agree&#151;we have regional government already; this is about regional democracy. That is why I find the Conservatives&#039; position so bizarre. We hear time and time again from the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) that we should trust the people and let them speak. The referendums are all about that; that is the whole point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-25_para5">
The last time we debated the issue, we had a change of position from those on the Conservative Front Bench. My right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), being his usual perceptive self, noticed that shift of position and intervened on the hon. Member for North Essex and got him to accept that the Conservatives&#039; position had changed and say:

<p><a name="40721-25_spnew9"><b> Mr. Davey: </b> 
 I shall let the hon. Gentleman intervene, but I hope that he will be able to answer the following point as well. This issue is rather like Iraq for the Conservatives. They are now in favour of the campaign, but they are not prepared to vote for the motion to let 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 404</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that campaign happen. This is about democracy and we should let people have the choice. I would have thought that those on the Conservative Front Bench would be behind all the measures that will make that happen.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-25_spnew10"><b> Mr. Jenkin: </b> 
 I explained the position to the hon. Gentleman in the Tea Room before we came into the Chamber. The Government have promised the referendums and we should hold them to that promise. I am a politician who likes keeping other politicians to their promises. However, the referendums should be conducted according to a verifiable and safe electoral system. The Government are putting the process at risk by insisting on all-postal balloting instead of having the conventional ballot boxes that would provide the certainty that the referendums would actually go ahead.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-25_spnew11"><b> Mr. Davey: </b> 
 I think we understand the Conservatives&#039; position, but it could change later in the debate. We seem to be clear that they would support the referendums if they did not involve all-postal ballots. I think that that is their position, but we shall wait to see whether it is clarified.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-25_para7">
The Liberal Democrats certainly support the referendums. We support the orders, but not without some concerns and caveats. The proposals are generally right. Indeed, we took the same position on the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act 2003. We supported the principle behind it and its direction, but we voiced our concerns and the Government reacted to them constructively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-25_para8">
I have three concerns with the all-postal voting aspects of the first order, but they have largely been dealt with. The first related to blind and partially sighted people, and I see that, in paragraph 29 to schedule 1, the Government are trying to listen to the views expressed by the Electoral Commission, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister: Housing, Planning and Local Government Select Committee and the Royal National Institute of the Blind.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-25_para9">
I hope that, when the Minister replies to the debate, he will be able to say a little more about how he expects the administrators of the elections to assist voters. The idea that voting administrators will knock on people&#039;s doors and say, &quot;Can we help you?&quot; will be an unusual exercise and an interesting initiative. We need to understand how that will work and we need to be clear that there are no dangers in the process. We also need to be clear about how people will be able to apply for such a visit. How will that be marketed and how do the Government expect the Electoral Commission and administrators in the regions to advertise the availability of that option? That will be critical to answering the concerns of the RNIB and others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-25_para10">
Our second concern, which I have already raised with the Minister on an intervention, relates to whether the Government will try to hide behind Electoral Commission reports on the all-postal pilots in June.

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree with the Electoral Commission that the regional referendums should not be held on the same day as 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 405</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>another kind of election? I ask only because the right hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson) is in the Chamber and he might be interested in that.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-26_spnew1"><b> Mr. Davey: </b> 
 We can always make an exception if there should be a by-election, but the hon. Gentleman is right about what the Electoral Commission said. The Government found that there was no statutory power to ban by-elections, and council by-elections especially, during the relevant period, so his point does not directly relate to the order. He made his political point interestingly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-26_para0">
Will the Government ensure that they will not try to subcontract out the decision on whether the referendums should go ahead? It is vital that a political decision is taken for which the Minister is accountable to the House. The Electoral Commission&#039;s judgments and research are important. We have heard that it will make a separate statement on all-postal votes and the referendums, so there will not be a review of only what happened in June. We have also heard that the statement will be brought forward and made before the House returns in September, so I hope that the Minister will confirm that we will have time to debate the Electoral Commission&#039;s findings on our return. Although that information is all very well, the decision is fundamentally political. The Minister might decide to go ahead, pull the plug on everything, or go ahead in one or two regions, as the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) inferred, but the decision will be political.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-26_para1">
I argue that the Minister should not pull the referendums&#151;we want them to go ahead&#151;but there is concern in the north-west, especially, that the Government have not taken our advice or that of many other people and made the elected regional assemblies attractive to people who live in the regions. If they are to be more attractive, more powers must be on offer. The White Paper &quot;Your Region, Your Choice&quot; timidly and limply proposed the powers to be devolved, which was why during our negotiations with the Government when the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Bill was in the other place, we pressurised them to publish a draft powers Bill. The hon. Member for North Essex made an awful lot of that, but the Government agreed to do it due to our negotiations. We did not have draft powers Bills before the referendums in Scotland, Wales or London. We will have such a Bill for the first time&#151;it will be a major improvement to the process&#151;thanks to negotiations between the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Government.

<p><a name="40721-26_spnew3"><b> Mr. Davey: </b>

The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) said that devolution is a process rather than an event, and the Government have made it clear that they are open-minded about, and keen for, further devolution. We saw that in the spending review and the

 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s last words partly pre-empted what I was going to say.

 I think that the Government are doing that, but as the hon. Member for North Essex rightly pointed out, we do not intend to be suckered. We want not only promises and words, but provisions in the draft powers Bill. That is important not only for us and the right hon. Lady, but for the people who will be given the choice. They will want to know that they are voting not for a talking shop, but for something that will be able to make a difference to their lives.

 Hon. Members might be worried about the Government&#039;s intentions on the draft powers. Later this afternoon we will debate the Fire and Rescue Services Bill. We had the&nbsp;opportunity to give the elected regional assemblies the same powers that have been given to Wales.

<a name="40721-26_para3">
My third concern with the all-postal vote process is the security statement, which was raised earlier. It is not a matter of such concern that we will vote against the order because, as I told the Minister in other debates on the subject, a referendum does not have an individual candidate so the incentive for fraud is reduced massively. In that respect, I disagree with the hon. Member for North Essex. However, we would have preferred the Government to retain what happened in the pilots&#151;namely, a declaration of identity in a full witness statement. I regret the backsliding on that and hope that fraud will not increase. I am hopeful that when the Electoral Commission makes its statement in early September or possibly late August it picks up that point having read the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-26_para4">
I am concerned about the order on expenditure limits, and the Minister was frank in saying that he shares those concerns. We are not convinced that the legislation that established the framework&#151;the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, not the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act 2003&#151;is tight enough. There is a danger that a loophole will be exploited in the first test of the 2000 Act as it relates to referendums.

A range of organisations could be set up, register themselves as permitted participants and, under the order, spend &#163;100,000 each.

I hear what he says if we do not have statutory powers to turn to, but it is a concern and both sides of the House are responsible for the mistake of letting a loophole remain in the legislation. I hope that the Minister will say a little more on the Government&#039;s thinking because we do not want this important democratic experiment undermined.

</p>








<p><a name="40721-26_spnew9"><b> Mr. Davey: </b> 
 I do have an individual in mind. Let me make no bones about it: it is Paul Sykes. The United Kingdom Independence party is under the bizarre belief that the proposal for regional assemblies comes from Europe, but the Liberal Democrats have argued for them for decades, even before we went into the European Union. To be fair, many Labour Members also argued for them. The idea that regional assemblies are proposed by Europe is total nonsense.

 Paul Sykes is one of my constituents and I have a schizophrenic view of him. I disagree entirely with some of the things on which he wishes to spend his money. In other respects, for all the wrong reasons, he may turn out to do a powerful public good. Is it not a fact, however, that if the matter is left to the discretion of the Electoral Commission, it will become locked into legal proceedings? Someone who sets up an organisation that is challenged or disallowed by the Electoral Commission might decide to go to law to challenge that decision in the absence of clear legislation. That could halt the outcome of the whole procedure.

 The right hon. Gentleman makes a valid point that had not occurred to me. We face the prospect of confusion and chaos for months after 4 November.

The hon. Gentleman is making a serious contribution on the question of expenses, which of course reads across to other referendums, of even greater importance, that may take place in future. Two things need to be said. First, constraints on expenditure work in elections because candidates aspire to be respectable, responsible people and are in danger of being disqualified if we wilfully overspend. However, in referendums we are dealing with one-off organisations, and perhaps even individuals, who care not for their long-term political reputation but only for the issue, and it is difficult to imagine what sort of constraints would limit their activity if they wished to circumvent whatever rules were in place.

Secondly, is it not much more of a concern that the Government still have the panoply of the state at their disposal throughout the referendum period? There may be scrupulous rules in place to try to control what they spend money on directly, but the real problem is the fact that the machinery of government is a superb platform from which to make a political case which will have far more influence than any individual.

 I disagree with the hon. Gentleman on that point. I think that the Government have in many ways been scrupulously fair. They have tied themselves in knots on what they can and cannot spend, but they have failed to plug the loophole for the individual whom I mentioned or others like him. That is the concern that I am expressing. I think that the hon. Gentleman has the wrong target in mind. I hope that when the Minister returns to the Dispatch Box, and possibly in discussions with the Electoral Commission, he can use other election law relating to money used in collaboration. Those rules say that an individual, in this case a permitted participant, cannot work with another individual, another permitted participant, to promote a cause. That may be one way to thwart abuse of that loophole. I certainly hope that the Minister can give me that assurance tonight.

I do not want to detain the House further. I made most of my points on interventions. I simply say to the Minister that the draft powers Bill, which we expect to see on Thursday, will be the key test. My colleagues in the north-west will look at that when they decide how to vote. They are waiting to see whether the Bill provides for true devolution. The Liberal Democrats believe in devolved political decision making, and the Liberal Democrats in the north-west, as a regional party, will take the decision on the Bill. They are waiting to see the colour of the Government&#039;s money, so if Ministers want to make sure that the Liberal Democrats in the north-west are united behind the Government, they need to make sure that the Bill contains significant powers, particularly, as I have said, with respect to transport, learning and skills councils and the environmental agenda.

<a name="40721-27_para1">
More generally, with the people, the Government need to overturn the apathy that was mentioned. There is concern that out there in the regions there is a degree of apathy and a lack of knowledge about these proposals. I know from my own experience that when people are engaged with these ideas they are excited by them, and they see their value. I talked to some sixth-formers on a visit to Durham a few months ago. One could see that they were passionate about regional devolution. They did not see why their lives in the north-east should always be controlled from here in London. They wanted these powers, and more&#151;more than the Government were offering in the White Paper.

It may be late in the day, and it may be that the parliamentary draftsmen need to work late into the night, but if we are to win the yes vote on 4 November we need to say to people in the regions that real powers are to come down from Whitehall, and that this is the first down-payment on major devolution in our country.

But I also say to my right hon. Friend the Minister that it will not be enough. Many of us guarantee that, during the referendum campaign, we will spend our time campaigning to create the groundswell for even more devolution to our regions over the months and years to come, until there is a proper constitutional settlement for regions such as the north-west.

There was little spirit left in his speech&#151;perhaps that is a tribute to my right hon. Friend the Minister&#151;and little from the Opposition today that was serious.

Not that many years ago, when I came into Parliament, there were still a significant number of Conservative Members of Parliament in the north-west. The Labour party in my region was berated from the Conservative Front Bench. There are disagreements among members of the north-west parliamentary Labour party, but at least there are enough of us to have agreement and disagreement. There are no longer enough Tories from the north-west even to have agreement on these issues. The Tory party in the north-west was massively distrusted because of the Thatcherite legacy, particularly because the Thatcherite Government were identified as government of the north by the south-east, and it will be many, many years before the Tory party is considered a respectable voice for the north-west.

<p><a name="40721-27_spnew5"><b> Tony Lloyd: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. It was in the 1930s that the north-west regional Labour party first made the decision to support regional government, and I am not aware that it has ever changed its mind since. Within a democratic party there must be room for dissent, and our colleagues on the Government Benches will debate the issue in a proper and acceptable fashion, not using the specious tactics that have sometimes been used by Opposition parties.

<a name="40721-27_para6">
This is an important debate about the future of our region. As somebody from the region, I deeply resent the fact that the disparities between the north and the south are so enormous and have been growing during my lifetime. In particular, they grew in the period between 1979 and 1997, when we had that imposed Thatcher Government here in Westminster&#151;a Government who were so uninterested in what took place in the north.
</p>

<a name="40721-27_para7">
My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) made the powerful and important point that the life chances of a child born in my constituency today are far less than those of somebody born in the south-east. The matter is not simply about comparing inner-city Manchester with the home counties but about how Governments have swept away any semblance of equality across this nation of ours, which is not acceptable. When Tory Members who represent constituencies in the north-west speak, I expect them to bemoan the fact that people in the region that they represent have such a rotten chance in life, and they should take some responsibility for what previous Tory Governments did.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-27_spnew6"><b> Mr. George Osborne: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman knows, some indicators show that regional disparities have grown under this Government. I am not sure whether his point about a child in his constituency having fewer life chances than someone born in the south is statistically correct. I hazard a guess that someone born in Greenwich and Woolwich or Tower Hamlets would have similar life chances to someone born in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency, so he should not generalise.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-27_spnew7"><b> Tony Lloyd: </b> 
 It is not generalisation but reality that a child born in my constituency will die 10 years earlier than a child with the same origins as the hon. Gentleman. The simple truth is that the funding system has favoured certain parts of the country at the expense of others. There are, of course, differences within regions&#151;that has been and always will be the case&#151;but the average difference between the south-east and the north-west is significant and not a statistical quirk. A gulf exists between the south-east and the north-east, which does not suit the south-east because of the problems caused by the overdevelopment at the expense of the life chances and opportunities for people in the northern regions.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-27_spnew8"><b> Mr. Stringer: </b> 
 I do not agree with my hon. Friend&#039;s conclusions, but I agree with much of his analysis.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Differences within regions do not obviate the fact that inter-regional differences exist too, and the huge differences in London do not mean that people at similar levels in society are not worse off in the north-west than elsewhere. Public expenditure is the biggest driver in putting those differences right, and, as the noble Lord Rooker said in the other place, what is wrong with the proposals on devolution is that the north-west will not get an extra penny.

 My hon. Friend and I agree on the analysis but draw different conclusions. He is right that the disparity in spending is a fundamental driver behind the disparities in regional performance, and we must begin to address that point. He also mentioned regional disparities, which raises the question where London fits into the south-east. Unlike the northern regions, Greater London can vocalise and negotiate with central Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-28_para0">
My hon. Friend&#039;s point is important: how do we get the northern voice in the corridors of power? Over successive generations, we have failed in the north under both Labour and Conservative Governments&#151;the disaster up at Daresbury was referred to earlier. Yesterday, the Government made the interesting announcement that Crossrail will go ahead in London and that the Metro system in Greater Manchester is up for serious discussion. If we had a devolved strategy for transport, it would be easier to make the case for Greater Manchester in the debate in the north-west. It would also be easier if a strong northern voice, speaking together and operating together, had debated the matter with central Government, where London&#039;s voice is heard. The voice from the north has been consistently ignored over the years by all kinds of Governments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-28_para1">
We have the opportunity to seize control of some of the system, which is what today&#039;s debate is all about. Today&#039;s debate means that the starting pistol has gone off and that it is down to the people of the northern regions to take control of their own destinies and make their own decisions. If Conservative Members campaign against us, we will have a debate, which will occur where it matters&#151;in the region. We must ensure that the debate takes place in the north-east, Yorkshire and Humberside and the north-west, and that it is dictated by the needs of those regions rather than by the posturing of the various Opposition parties.

<a name="40721-28_para2">
Electoral fraud is central to the debate about our electoral system. The system must be respected. As the Minister recognises, worrying issues arose from the recent local elections. They must be investigated, but I must tell those who use the charge of fraud as a reason for not supporting postal voting that the increased turnout is the best single guarantee that we have that the decisions are being made by the public in general, rather than by factional and sectional interest groups. It is important to convey that message.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-28_para3">
In fact, our system is relatively free of fraud. That was the case even in the local elections. We should root out every instance of fraud and, if the Electoral Commission says that we must look at certain issues again, we must do so. I emphasise to the Minister that there must be serious exemplary penalties for fraud: fraudsters must know that they will go to prison and that no tolerance

The referendums will be desperately important. We can have different opinions, but in the end it must be left to the people of the northern regions to decide whether this form of devolution takes place.

The debate is a continuous one, but let me say this to the Liberal Democrats.

There will be peripatetic polling stations and, apparently, peripatetic welfare officers helping people to fill in their forms. Polling stations will open in different places.

The issue of the allocation of expenditure is serious. We discovered in the European elections that the proportional system of representation allowed the expression of a far more diverse range of views than under our traditional first past the post system. In my constituency, the three conventional parties, if I may describe them like that, performed roughly as one may have expected. However, the Green party had a significant vote, the BNP had a reasonably significant vote, and UKIP had a more significant vote, although not as much as in other parts of the country, such as the south-west. In some constituencies, it led the vote.

That means that the number of people contending for designation and the number of players in the campaign could represent a confused picture&#151;quite a kaleidoscope. Because there is no consistency, views on this issue may cut across the normal alliances that one would expect to find on general issues. Therefore, it is possible that one could find oneself in a difficult situation where individuals or even unions seek to express themselves through a number of front organisations. The Electoral Commission would have to decide whether they could be designated. There could be a legal challenge to that designation. Curiously, the equivalent of hanging chads could arrive in our political system, with a great dislocation. I hope that the commission will be able to set out in advance some general principles or rules that it will apply, so that there can be some scrutiny to try to minimise the chances of being challenged on an ad hoc basis, according to who comes forward.

The issue of turnout has been with us for a long time. The Minister will not give his definition of derisory, but my fear is that turnout in the referendums, if they go ahead, will be modest indeed. In the Scottish devolution referendum in September 1997, turnout was 60 per cent. That was followed by the referendum on Welsh devolution, where the turnout was 50 per cent. We then had a referendum on devolution to the Greater London authority, at which the turnout was 34 per cent.

Whenever we have embarked on local government reorganisation, it has always cost more than people predicted at the outset.

There is another important point. If these regional assemblies are born, the Labour party will not be running them. We are introducing proportional representation, with constituency members and list members, and as sure as night follows day there will be coalition regional government&#151;even, I suspect, in the north-east. In the light of the results of the elections on 10 June, there is no way that a single party will be running the show. The Deputy Prime Minister constantly tells us what a great first-past-the-post man he is, but yet again this Government are introducing a system that will definitely lead to coalition government.

As a consequence, there will be a democratic deficit and we will lose hundreds of local councillors. My own local authority, Pendle borough council, will disappear and be subsumed into a &quot;Burpendale&quot; plus Ribble Valley body.

There is no way that people in my area will have easy access to local councillors, because their numbers will obviously reduce.

I am also concerned about all-postal ballots. Five election petitions are outstanding and they will go through the courts in the normal way.

In that year, legislation popularly known as the &quot;Ballot Act&quot; introduced the secret ballot for parliamentary and municipal elections. It was hugely controversial at the time; now, we are casually throwing all that away.

It is inevitable that many of us speak from a historical perspective. I grew up as a young woman with a young family in the north-east in the 80s. That period more than anything else inspired me to believe that if we cannot trust in our own, we most certainly cannot trust a Westminster Government&#151;especially a Westminster Tory Government. I say that intentionally. I was part of a group in Sunderland that watched ferry boats being built that could not be sold.

In the end, we made sure that it was not built, but that is an example of what Conservative Westminster Governments think about the north-east.

After that experience, I have every reason to trust a regional government. I never want a Westminster Tory Government to have that influence on my region again. We had a level of unemployment that was second to none, yet we lost manufacturing jobs at an exponential rate.

The agenda justifying regional assemblies is not merely negative. Although it is a bitter experience when one sees communities being destroyed before one&#039;s very eyes, I believe that there are positive reasons to support the orders.

So far, in the northern region, there has been a little trouble in Newcastle and Gateshead, although there have been few, if any, problems in Stockton and Middlesbrough.

There has been no evidence of improper behaviour or fraud.

Moreover, the participation rate in the pilots was up significantly&#151;staggeringly so.

<p><a name="40721-31_spnew0"><b> Mr. John Hayes  (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con):</b> 
 I am delighted to wind up the debate. I shall be brief, because I want to give the Minister the maximum time to answer the many points that have been made. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) said, it is remarkable that the Government should have jeopardised the credibility of their albeit incredible policy through their near obsession with postal ballots. I shall deal with that issue at some length, but I shall first say a word about regionalism in general.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-31_para0">
The truth is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) said, that regionalism will not deliver for localities. It is local government, rooted in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 421</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>communities, time-honoured and with the respect of communities, that will deliver for local people. Those of us with histories in local government, and who believe in local democracy, also believe in empowering local councils&#151;made up of locally elected people&#151;to take decisions on behalf of the communities. We do not believe in ceding power from them to some remote anonymous region, with which they have little connection and less affinity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-31_para1">
Does anyone in this Chamber really believe that people in my constituency in Lincolnshire would owe any loyalty, feel any affinity or offer any support to a regional government that would inevitably be centred on Nottingham, Derby and Leicester, where the people and the money are? The considerations of rural Lincolnshire would be far from the minds of those elected to that regional body. That local case is replicated across the whole of this kingdom. Members on both sides of the Chamber know that, which is why Members from all parties have criticised the Government&#039;s regional agenda. The Government know that their regional policy lacks popular support, which is why they are prevaricating and hesitating on the referendums.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-31_para2">
The postal ballots add further chaos to what would anyway be a faulty process because of the lack of support for regional government. Three points were made in the debate that I wish to amplify. First, democratic elections are not just about turnout. Their legitimacy is founded on the integrity of the ballot and the electorate&#039;s perception of its fairness and honesty. Voting in person, on a particular day and in the locality in which one resides, combines convenience and openness. Casting a vote in a sealed ballot box inspires faith in the system because it delivers fair, honest and free elections.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-31_para3">
Turnout is important, but not at all costs. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) said, blaming declining turnout on the process ignores the fact that elections are about people, policies, ideas&#151;hearts and souls. It is for people in this Chamber, who were democratically elected, and others who aspire to be so to increase turnout by the way they behave, by advocacy and by example. Simply tinkering with the process will be no guarantee of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-31_para4">
The second point, which was made the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) and others&#151;indeed, the Minister referred to it earlier&#151;is that all-postal ballots disadvantage particular groups disproportionately. We heard something about people who are partially sighted, but what about people who live alone, who have literacy problems or who, for one reason or another, find it difficult to have a vote witnessed? The Minister&#039;s response is, &quot;Ah well, we will get rid of witnessing. We will get rid of one of the safeguards of the fairness of the system in order to increase turnout.&quot; The Minister will abandon witnessing because of the very real points that have been made in this debate, and which I have highlighted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-31_para5">
The Minister knows that many people want to continue to vote in person as they have done in the past. I offer the House two examples from my locality. First, a young person, who had just come of age and wanted to vote for the first time, said they felt deeply frustrated 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 422</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that they were unable to go to the polling station and put their voting paper into the ballot box, as their parents and forefathers had done before them. The hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) is correct. We set aside that right at our peril; it was hard earned and is being treated in a cavalier and careless fashion, as he said. Secondly, an elderly lady told me that she had voted in every election that she could and felt angry that she was not able to cast her vote in person. The idea that mobile voting stations can be set up conveniently for people in remote, far-flung areas is nonsense and the Minister knows it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-31_para6">
My third point is that participation is about active involvement. The Minister knows that there is an aesthetic to democratic elections that should be neither disregarded nor derided&#151;campaigning, the drama of election day, the opening of the ballot box and the count in front of people who have participated in the process. The election is seen to be fair, transparent and open. The balkanisation of Britain that would arise from regional government&#151;in the words of the hon. Member for Pendle&#151;would be exacerbated by a system for electing regional authorities in which local people felt they had no faith.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-31_para7">
We have received no assurances about the cost to local government. We have been given no persuasive guarantees about the countering of fraud and impropriety. There has been no draft regional Bill, because there is no popular will for regions and no convincing case for all-postal ballots. There is no good reason to support the orders and I urge the House to vote against them.

<p><a name="40721-31_spnew1"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The debate has been wide ranging, with some rather curious contributions as well as some valuable contributions and perceptive comments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-31_para8">
The hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) was remorselessly negative in his tone. He revealed the position of the Conservative Opposition, who remain utterly hostile to devolution. The tragedy for the Conservative party, which still does not realise why it has been rejected time and again by the electorate, most recently last week in the by-elections, is that it still hankers&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Conservatives were in third place, rejected in seats where they had previously come second. They have no future and no prospects&#151;as the public recognise&#151;because they are locked in the past and do not realise that the world has moved on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-31_para9">
The hon. Member for North Essex made the preposterous claim that the Conservative party trusts the people. The Conservatives&#039; record shows just how ludicrous that claim is. They did not trust the people of Scotland. They did not want the people of Scotland to have devolution, and agreed only after the people of Scotland had voted decisively for it that it was probably a good idea.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-31_para10">
The Conservatives did not want the people of Wales to have a referendum and voted against giving them a choice. Again, after the event, they had to relent and change their mind about that, too. In London, not only did the Conservatives not want to give people the opportunity of a referendum, they even took democratic government away from London when they were in power&#151;without a referendum, giving people no say at

We gave people the opportunity and they voted in Scotland, Wales and London. We are giving people in the English regions the same option. It is absurd to claim that what is good enough for Scotland, Wales and London is not acceptable for the English regions.

<a name="40721-31_para12">
My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) made a passionate speech in support of regional devolution. I shall not go over the valid points she made, but will simply reinforce her message that a number of decisions that have gone against the interests of the north-west might have been different had there been a powerful voice speaking for the region. Many, many people who care about devolution recognise the importance of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-31_para13">
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton supports the Government position in principle, and we are grateful to him for that. He voiced three caveats. First, he mentioned people who are visually impaired, and he accepts that we are making provision to deal with that issue. Secondly, he wanted us to not give the decision to the Electoral Commission, while listening to its views, and that is exactly our view. We will listen carefully to the Electoral Commission&#039;s views, but it is ultimately a decision for Ministers to take. I hope that he accepts that. He also expressed support for the idea of witness statements, but we believe that such statements can reduce participation. There is quite a lot of evidence that the requirement to make those statements deterred people from voting in June. Although we are very clear that there must be safeguards for the proper conduct of all-postal ballots, we accept the Electoral Commission&#039;s evidence that witness statements are helpful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-31_para14">
The hon. Gentleman also asked about people who could get assistance at home. The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes), who made the Opposition&#039;s winding-up speech, has clearly not read the orders or taken any care to do his homework. People who are illiterate will also be eligible for assistance in the same way as people who suffer visual impairment. There will be scope for electoral officers to visit them to assist them in filling out their ballots papers, and I should have thought that the Conservative spokesman welcomed any such measure that helps to encourage participation. His position was remorselessly negative, against a form of voting that has hugely increased participation. He is fundamentally anti-democratic in arguing against giving more people an opportunity to vote.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-31_para15">
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton also asked about costs&#151;an issue also raised by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry)&#151;and suggested that the provision of either additional voting points or visits by electoral officers might increase the costs. Obviously, we will give the returning officers in each region a figure to work with for the costs, but there is provision for exceptional claims where good reasons are given for exceeding those figures. We will consider such claims if they are made. As I said earlier, we expect returning officers to operate in the most cost-effective way and to minimise costs, but provision is made for those circumstances.

The evidence so far is that improved turnouts in those local authorities that have held all-postal ballots have been sustained, but we need to continue to look at that issue. Our objective is to increase turnout.

<p><a name="40721-32_spnew0"><b> Mr. George Osborne: </b> 
 What about the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-32_spnew1"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 Frankly, my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) made a series of allegations that are simply unsubstantiated; there is no evidence for them at all. We have heard speech after speech from hon. Members from the north-east who have made it perfectly clear that they have the greatest experience of all-postal voting and that it has been conducted without problem. He should listen to them, rather than trying to scaremonger in that the way that he did.

<p>
<a name="40721-32_para0">
We have had a good debate. The orders are necessary to conduct regional referendums and to give people the opportunity to have a say on devolution&#151;

<p><i>It being three hours after the commencement of proceedings on the motion,</i> Mr. Deputy Speaker <i>put the Question, pursuant to Order [14 July].</i>


</p>








<p><i>The House divided:</i> Ayes 349, Noes 140.

<a name="40721-34_head1"><h3 align=center>Fire and Rescue Services Bill</h3>





<p><i>Lords amendments considered.</i>


</p>








<p><a name="40721-34_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b> 
 I inform the House that privilege is involved in Lords amendments No. 10. If the House agrees to the amendment, I will arrange for the necessary entry to be made in the <i>Journal</i>.
</p>








<p>Clause 2


</p>




<br>
<center>Power to create combined fire and rescue authorities</center><br>





<p><i>Lords amendment:</i> No. 1.




<a name="40721-34_time0"><h5>6.29 pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="40721-34_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Phil Hope): </b> 
 I beg to move, That this House agrees with the Lords in the said amendment.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-34_spmin2"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 With this it will be convenient to consider Lords amendments Nos. 2 to 4 and 13.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-34_spnew0"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 Before I come to the amendments, the House will be aware of yesterday&#039;s tragic events, which resulted in the death of two London firefighters, Bill Faust and Adam Meere, who were both from Whitechapel fire station. In paying tribute to them today, the Prime Minister recognised the debt that we owe firefighters and the risks that they run to protect people at home and at work. I echo those sentiments and express my personal sadness at those tragic events. My thoughts, and I am sure those of the whole House, are with the families, friends and colleagues of Bill Faust and Adam Meere, to whom I extend my heartfelt sympathy.


<a name="40721-34_time1"><h5>6.30 pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="40721-34_spnew1"><b> Mr. Philip Hammond  (Runnymede and Weybridge) (Con):</b> 
 May I associate everyone on this side of the House with the Minister&#039;s remarks and the message of sympathy that he sent to the bereaved families and colleagues of Bill Faust and Adam Meere? No one in this House needs reminding of the risks that firefighters take day in, day out in their duty to protect the public, and no one needs reminding of the vital service that our fire and rescue services deliver to the community.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-34_spnew2"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 I shall deal first with Lords amendment No. 1, which was tabled in response to arguments put forward by Members of both Houses. As originally drafted, clause 2 generated a good deal of concern. It was seen&#151;we remember the debates in Committee&#151;as giving the Secretary of State carte blanche to create regional fire and rescue authorities, whether or not a referendum was being held on the creation of a regional assembly. Because it left the matter of holding an inquiry to the Secretary of State&#039;s discretion, some also felt that it allowed the Government to ride roughshod over local objections.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 434</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-34_para0">
We have not, of course, always accepted those interpretations, and we made it clear throughout the Bill&#039;s passage that we have no plans to regionalise the fire and rescue service outside those parts of England in which an elected regional assembly is supported in a referendum. Assurances have been given in both Houses that the only circumstances in which we envisage using the original power in clause 2(2)(b) involve urgent public safety&#151;in particular, if authorities fail to co-operate on a key resilience requirement such as the creation of a regional control centre.

<a name="40721-34_para1">
In the light of the Opposition&#039;s continued attempts to present that power as a licence to regionalise by stealth, however, we decided to make our intentions clear in the Bill. Hon. Members may recall that we responded to an Opposition amendment in Standing Committee by agreeing that an inquiry into a combination scheme will be mandatory apart from in a very limited number of circumstances&#151;for example, if the authorities themselves suggest the scheme or where urgent public safety needs cannot tolerate any delay. In our view, clause 2 now addresses all the legitimate concerns raised by Members in both Houses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-34_para2">
Lords amendments Nos. 2 to 4 also respond to arguments put forward in both Houses. There has been considerable debate about whether local authorities, as well as fire and rescue authorities, should be included in the list of those consulted on the making, variation or revocation of combination schemes. To allay the concerns expressed, we have stated and restated our aim to allow for the widest possible involvement of all affected stakeholders, including, of course, local authorities. We did not wish, however, to list in the legislation every category of organisation that should be consulted on a scheme, on the basis that such a list could never be exhaustive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-34_para3">
That said, we accept the argument that local authorities are in a unique position and that the Bill should reflect that. Local authorities are the democratically elected bodies representing the people of the areas involved in any proposed combination scheme, and they are also, of course, the bodies from which the existing fire and rescue authorities are themselves constituted. Lords amendments Nos. 2 to 4 therefore add an explicit requirement for the Secretary of State to consult local authorities on the making, variation or revocation of combination schemes, where all or part of their area forms part of the area which would be, or is, covered by the scheme. I hope that hon. Members recognise that that demonstrates our commitment to an inclusive approach and the Bill&#039;s non-partisan nature.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-34_para4">
Lords amendment No. 13 is consequential and simply adds a new clause in order to define the term &quot;local authority&quot; for the purposes of the Bill&#151;specifically, the amendments relating to consultation.

As the Minister said, clause 2(2)(a) of the original Bill allowed the Secretary of State to create a combined fire and rescue authority where that was

</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-34_para6">
I do not think anyone has ever argued that the Secretary of State should not have that power. The original Bill, however, went on to create a second ground, quite independent of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. It would have allowed the Secretary of State to create a combined fire and rescue authority simply on the ground that the area he proposed to be the area of the combined fire and rescue authority was that of a regional development agency&#151;in other words, one of the Government&#039;s nine English regions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-34_para7">
The Government have made no secret of their proposal, in the event of elected regional assemblies being established in any of the English regions&#151;perhaps I should say &quot;the increasingly unlikely event&quot;&#151;to create a regional fire and rescue service covering an entire region. Be it the north-west region with its 6 million population, stretching from the Scottish border to Crewe, or the rather smaller north-east region with its population of 3 million, the Government in their wisdom have decided that it would be appropriate to have a single fire and rescue authority there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-34_para8">
Many Conservative Members, as well as Liberal Democrat Members&#151;not noted for their hostility to the Government&#039;s broader regional agenda&#151;and indeed Labour Members, have expressed serious doubts about the appropriateness of that proposal. We could argue until late into the night about whether regions are appropriate for other purposes, but they were clearly not designed for the purpose of operational effectiveness of fire and rescue services. I am sure that others will cite instances in which regionally organised fire and rescue services might not be the best idea.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-34_para9">
I think there was a broad feeling that if the Secretary of State wanted to proceed with combined fire and rescue authorities based on the nine English regions&#151;or the eight outside London&#151;he should justify that by demonstrating, as he would in the case of any combined fire authority whose boundaries were not coterminous with an RDA region, that it was in the interests of greater economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the service. He should not be able to get around that test.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-34_para10">
When we introduced amendments to that effect in the Commons, the Government rejected them. They were introduced again by my noble Friend Lord Hanningfield, and again were not accepted. A little later the Government presented their own proposal to amend clause 2, broadening the definition of economy, efficiency and effectiveness to include public safety. That was curious, as we had been told in Committee that the term &quot;public safety&quot; was not required because &quot;economy, efficiency and effectiveness&quot; embraced the concept of enhancing public safety. The Government obviously decided that they had been ill-advised in that regard. They also eliminated clause 2(2)(b) altogether. Under the current Bill, the Secretary of State no longer has powers to create a combined fire and rescue authority simply because it is coterminous with an English regional boundary. That does not mean that he could not create such a combined fire authority. He would have to demonstrate merely that it was in the interests of the efficiency, effectiveness and economy of the service and in the interests of public safety to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-34_para11">
We have no problem with that. If the optimum structure of fire and rescue services to deliver the best service to the community happens to be coterminous

<br>&nbsp;<br>with an RDA region&#151;I would be very surprised but if it happens to be thus&#151;so be it. That must be the sole criterion against which these things are measured.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-34_para12">
Since I do not imagine that the Government have abandoned their plan to create regional fire and rescue authorities, should elected regional assemblies be created, regardless of whether they are in the interests of the service in terms of economy, efficiency and effectiveness, and regardless of whether they are in the interests of greater public safety, we now need to understand how the Government will create such fire and rescue authorities. The Minister did not utter a word about that, presumably because the power to do so, overriding the criteria in this Bill, will be provided in the, shall we say, elusive draft regional assemblies powers Bill.

 We have an announcement that the draft powers Bill will be published tomorrow. Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to tell the House, because it is clearly germane to understanding these amendments, whether the draft Bill will contain the power that Ministers will, I think, need if they are to go ahead with combined regional fire authorities in any regions that opt, in the referendums in November, to have elected regional assemblies. Then he could explain why it is appropriate to override the test that a Government amendment has now clearly written into this Bill in clause 2 and to provide for delivery of combined fire authorities in regions that do not have to satisfy the tests of economy, efficiency, effectiveness and public safety.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-35_para0">
We had these debates when the Bill was considered in Committee and on Report, and they took place again in the other place. While a casual glance at the revised Bill may suggest that the Government made a major concession, I suspect that we will hear that the powers to which we object to create regional combined authorities without passing the hurdles of economy, efficiency, effectiveness and public safety will still exist but in a different form.

 I welcome the additional safeguards, which will at least give us an opportunity to debate the appropriate arrangements for any new body to oversee the fire and rescue services for my area in Gloucestershire, as well as further afield in the south-west. We have rehearsed the implications for Gloucestershire of losing its tri-service control if the fire service control were taken to a different place. As the Minister knows, Gloucestershire has a bid in to be the centre for either part of the region or the whole of region. I suspect it would be the former.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-35_para2">
Lest anyone think that this is an academic debate, while we are debating a change to the place where the fire service is run, there are also debates taking place within the police and the ambulance service about similar reorganisations. I am seeking further assurances from the Government; if these services are subject to any changes, rather than piecemeal debates, we should have an open and transparent debate and look at the strengths and weaknesses of how the services are organised.

Although I am critical of the organisation of counties in some respects, certainly county councils, I see some merit in the emergency services coming together. I am worried that even with the additional safeguards in the Bill, there is a slippery slope down which we are passing. If we lose the fire service from the local area, the police and the ambulance service are bound to follow because of the arguments regarding economy, efficiency and effectiveness. It would be far less effective if the three services were not together.

I ask the Minister to give an assurance that if we look at these matters, we do so with the benefit of full consultation.

It is right and proper that people should have their opinions listened to.

 First, I wish to add my words of sympathy and those of my party to those of the Minister and the Conservative Opposition with regard to the two firemen who lost their lives tragically in Bethnal Green. We all know that firemen put their lives at risk every day. The public tend to hear only about disasters such as Chernobyl and 11 September, but other incidents do occur. Indeed, I found this loss particularly poignant and sad because during the war, my father was a firefighter who covered the Bethnal Green area.

I largely agree with the point that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) made about giving credit where it is due. It is a shame that it was necessary for the Lords to produce an amendment that says almost exactly what we had already said in Committee. The Minister previously said that the inclusion of a reference to public safety was &quot;unnecessary and potentially unhelpful&quot;. He has clearly changed his mind, and I am glad to learn that he has listened to the argument that was advanced.
</p>

<a name="40721-35_para6">
Of course, amendment No. 1 is not exactly the same as the original amendment. As the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and I pointed out, we are not parliamentary draftsmen; rather, we were simply trying to establish a principle.

<p>
<a name="40721-35_para7">
In Committee, we sought to create safeguards in respect of the establishment of regional fire authorities, and the amendments before us go some way towards doing that. Even so, certain issues remain outstanding and the Government will be judged by their actions, rather than their words. As the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) will know, people in the south-west fear the prospect of a region stretching from his part of the world all the way down to Penzance. There is real concern in the south-west at the prospect of regional management boards and a single control room for the entire area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-35_para8">
The Minister still has the opportunity to say that it would make sense to have two regional control rooms in the south-west. That would be a step forward, and it would make more sense than having just one regional control room located in Bristol or Exeter. The hon. Member for Stroud made a very good case for having a tri-service control room, but he knows that he is fighting a hard, if not losing battle in that regard. The people of Cornwall would be extremely upset to discover that their control centre was in Gloucestershire.

Legitimate concerns about regionalisation remain. Hard-won concessions on inquiries were secured in Committee, and other more minor concessions have been made.

 Lords amendment No. 5 acknowledges and addresses the concerns that were raised in the House and in the other place about the level of parliamentary scrutiny attached to the national framework&#151;an item that we were discussing just a moment ago. Concerns were raised that Parliament would not get an opportunity to examine the framework before it came into effect. The amendment meets those concerns by requiring the Secretary of State to make an order, subject to negative resolution, to bring the national framework into effect. An order would also have to be made before the Secretary of State can introduce any &quot;significant&quot; changes to the framework. By &quot;significant&quot;, we mean that the revision represents a change in policy or a new requirement for fire and rescue authorities. The amendment will provide Parliament with an opportunity for greater scrutiny and I hope that it will reassure those who were concerned that there had been insufficient opportunity to examine the national framework.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-36_para4">
Turning briefly to Lords amendment No. 14, it is straightforwardly consequential on Lords amendment No. 5. It removes clause 60(2), which at present disapplies the reference to &quot;Parliament&quot; in clause 21(6) to the exercise of the Bill&#039;s powers by the National Assembly for Wales for the simple reason that it is the UK Parliament, not the Welsh one. Lords amendment No. 14, if agreed to, will mean that clause 21(6) no longer includes such a reference&#151;hence clause 60(2) is unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-36_para5">
Lords amendments Nos. 7 to 9 commit the Government to reporting to Parliament on the extent to which fire and rescue authorities are acting in accordance with the national framework at least once in every two years. The Bill as originally drafted stated that the Secretary of State would report on the national framework from &quot;time to time&quot;, which had been interpreted as a somewhat vague commitment, and while we always intended to make regular reports to Parliament, we believe that the amendments present a clearer timetable for that process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-36_para6">
Finally, Lords amendment No. 6 builds into the Bill a requirement for the Secretary of State to consult on and publish an intervention protocol under which the powers to intervene in clause 22 would be exercised. We have always said that we are happy to follow the provisions of the local government intervention protocol in exercising those powers. We therefore propose to consult fire and rescue service stakeholders on the application of the local government intervention protocol to the powers contained in clause 22. That will give fire and rescue authorities and other stakeholders the opportunity to comment on the procedures that we will follow, should intervention under clause 22 prove necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-36_para7">
Since the local government intervention protocol is specifically designed to address the needs of poorly performing authorities, we believe that it will be appropriate to apply it to the powers contained in clause 22. However, the amendment gives us the opportunity to review the protocol if, following consultation, it becomes clear that there are additional factors that need to be taken into account. Following all necessary consultation, we will publish the protocol that has been agreed. I hope that this provision, in addition to our previous amendment to clause 21, which makes the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

Yet that is the same national framework that the Minister is now laying before us with a provision that will render it subject to parliamentary scrutiny by means of a statutory instrument.

We are delighted that we have got what we wanted&#151;the proper parliamentary scrutiny of the framework. Coincidentally, the final draft version of the framework has just been published.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Minister were to tell the House whether there are any substantive changes from the draft that hon. Members absorbed all those months ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-37_para1">
Anyone glancing at the document will see how substantive it is. It is longer than the Bill. The Bill effectively incorporates the framework, by reference, so that the framework is to a large extent the meat in the Bill&#039;s sandwich. It deals with vital matters such as targets. The Minister does not like me talking about targets, but they are one reason why we were so concerned to secure proper parliamentary scrutiny of any changes to the national framework.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-37_para2">
Last year, Ministers changed the targets for accidental fire deaths in the home, and for deliberate fires. They extended the deadline for achieving a certain percentage reduction in accidental deaths in the home from 2004 to 2010&#151;a massive relaxation of the target. They also reduced substantially the target for the number of deliberately caused fires, saying that the collapse in the scrap metal market made it difficult to achieve.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-37_spnew2"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 Correct.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-37_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hammond: </b> 
 The Minister says that that is correct, but the changes were sneaked out without fanfare. The fact that they had been made emerged only in debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-37_para3">
Quite properly, the targets are at the heart of the framework document. They are the objectives that everything else in that document drives towards. If Ministers want to change such substantive matters of policy, that deserves some scrutiny. Changes should not just be sneaked in. The targets presented in the framework document will, I assume, be capable of being scrutinised when we get the statutory instrument in due course, presumably in the autumn or spill-over sittings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-37_para4">
When the Minister winds up, perhaps he can tell us something about the situation on targets for a reduction in deliberate fires. Ministers have made great play of the problems in the scrap metal market as a driver of their need to relax those targets, but I read articles in the Sunday newspapers this week telling us that the scrap metal industry would effectively shut down on Monday and no longer accept redundant vehicles for processing. That was because the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, in implementing EU directives on landfill and the classification of waste as hazardous, had failed to clarify the status of what is known, inelegantly, as shredder residue from the scrapped car processing industry. My immediate thought when I read that article was of the Minister and his problem with the 35,000 redundant vehicles that the scrap processing industry would no longer accept. What is happening, and what will it do to the targets set out in the national framework for a reduction in deliberately set fires? Are we not on the brink of a massive explosion in the number of abandoned vehicles on our streets? Local authorities will have to deal with them, and many will be the subject of arson attacks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-37_para5">
Integrated risk management programmes and regional management boards are vital components of the Government&#039;s programme, as set out in the national framework, but they do not appear in the Bill. The national framework, in many ways, is the substantive document and the Bill is the enabling mechanism.

Lords amendment No. 6 deals with the intervention protocol. We tabled an amendment and debated the issue in Committee that made the same proposal. The Minister gave us an assurance that the local government intervention code would be used, and I understand that that is still the starting point for Ministers. However, Ministers have recognised that, in the special circumstances of the fire and rescue services, especially a failing fire and rescue service, it might be a good idea to have a consultation with the various stakeholders to see whether any mission-specific provisions need to be included in the intervention code to make it fit for the purpose of dealing with a failing fire and rescue service. That is eminently sensible, but it could have been done in the Commons, saving the Lords a lot of time. In fact, it could have saved the Commons a lot of time arguing over the same issues, in Committee and on Report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-37_para7">
Similarly, we are delighted that the Government have accepted, in Lords amendments Nos. 7 to 9, a requirement to report not less than once in every two years to Parliament. Those were almost precisely the words of the amendment we tabled in Committee, which stated,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;leave out &#039;from time to time&#039; and insert &#039;at least once in every two years&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-37_para8">
The Minister will, no doubt, have a convoluted argument, devised by highly paid civil servants, as to why those words would not do the job as well as Lords amendment No. 9, but we cannot help feeling that it would be nice, once in a while, if such amendments could be accepted in the Commons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-37_para9">
Perhaps when amending clause 24 the Government should have considered including a provision for a report on their performance against the national framework. There will be reports on the performance of fire and rescue authorities and on the Government&#039;s interventions where they fail. I have already mentioned that the Government slacked off in achieving their objectives under the national framework relating to targets on dealing with deliberately set fires and accidental fire deaths in the home, so it would be interesting for an annual report to be made to Parliament, in which the Government carry out a self-assessment on how they are achieving those objectives.

 Lords amendment No. 10 would rectify a possible gap in the powers to establish arrangements for the funding of fire and rescue service pensions. My colleague, Lord Rooker, made it clear when moving the amendment in the other place that the White Paper, &quot;Our Fire and Rescue Service&quot;, committed us to


</p>

In 2001, a joint Treasury, Home Office and Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions working group reviewed the current finance arrangements for funding police and firefighter pensions and recommended that a new pension account system should be developed. We announced our intent to pursue that option in the 2004&#150;05 fire and rescue national framework, which was published on 16 July.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-38_para4">
The underlying principle of the scheme is that Government would pay current pensions and that employers and employees would make contributions to the Government to meet future pension liabilities. In practical terms, authorities would pay pensions from a separate pension account to which employers and employees both contribute. Normally, a payment would be made by the Government to the fire and rescue authorities to balance the account at the end of the year. Provision for those payments could be made under clause 33(2)(e).
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-38_para5">
An authority&#039;s pensions account could be in surplus at the end of the year&#151; the contribution that it and its employees made to future liabilities exceeded the authority&#039;s existing pensions payments. Therefore, to ensure that the system works fairly and consistently and to protect the national taxpayer and other authorities, we need to ensure that a balancing payment can be made 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to central Government. New clause 33(2)(ea), proposed under Lords amendment No. 10, would permit such payments to be made.

<p>
<a name="40721-38_para6">
Lords amendments No. 15 and 16 amend clause 61, so that all the provisions in schedules 1 and 2, which amend or repeal pension legislation, extend to Scotland. Lords amendment No. 17 amends the reference to the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971, in schedule 1, so that it applies to Scottish fire authorities in the same way as it does to English and Welsh fire and rescue authorities. Pensions are a reserved matter in relation to Scotland.

The Minister will forgive me for being slightly suspicious and sceptical of any provision enabling money to be paid to the Secretary of State that is inserted late into arrangements for the operation of a pension fund set up for the benefit of employees. We remember the Chancellor&#039;s attempt to get himself paid from pension funds, with his &#163;5 billion annual pension smash-and-grab raid.

I hope the Minister does not think that I am labouring the point, but this is a fairly unusual provision. It also seems unusual that the Treasury, which presumably has some oversight of the provisions when they are drafted, should have missed a tiny clause providing for payments to be made to the Secretary of State. Can the Minister elaborate on how, when and where it was decided that the provision, which was not included in the original drafting, was necessary? Who spotted the need for it, and in what circumstances do the Government expect that such payments will be made?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-38_para11">
What auditing will there be of the pension arrangements? If payments are to be made out of a pension fund to the Secretary of State from contributions that have been made or partly been made by employers and employees, it will be reassuring to know that proper independent auditing of the pension fund accounts is taking place to ensure that the Secretary of State does not have a slush fund that he could get his hands on. The matter should be dealt with properly at arm&#039;s length.
</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>clear to the House whether the Government determined that the change was required because of the other change that had been made through amendment No. 10 or whether it was simply an omission or error in the original drafting. Were statutes that should have been specified in schedule 1 omitted? If it is the latter, that is again an example of the dangers of rushed legislation. If the additional provisions in schedule 1 arise from the changes made by amendment No. 10, that is a different matter, and I accept that they are consequential on the amendment.

<a name="40721-39_para0">
A pension account is simply an account held specifically for receiving pension contributions and making pension payments. A pension fund&#151;that is what we are not talking about&#151;is something in which pension contributions are invested to pay for future pension liabilities. Let me say a little more about this so that the House can be clear about the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-39_para1">
The firefighters&#039; pension scheme is currently financed in the same way as police pensions&#151;on a pay-as-you-go basis. There are no pension funds. Individual fire and rescue authorities administer the scheme locally, and they meet the cost of pension outgoings, such as pension awards, lump-sum payments and outgoing transfer values, from their revenue accounts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-39_para2">
There are two main problems with the current arrangements. First, volatility exists because of significant fluctuations in the number of firefighters retiring or transferring out of an authority&#039;s employment in any given year. Indeed, many fire and rescue authorities cited one-off pension payments as a major factor behind this year&#039;s high increases in council tax precepts. Secondly, there is a problem with transparency. The high proportion of expenditure by fire and rescue authorities on pension payments 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 449</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>obscures the actual level of available resources for operational work. As pension costs increase over time, the proportion of an authority&#039;s expenditure on pension payments will also increase.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-39_para3">
The option of allowing fire and rescue authorities to pay pensions from a separate pension account to which both employers and employees contribute, with a payment from central Government to balance the account at the end of the year, would alleviate those problems. However, it would be possible for an authority to end up with its pension account in surplus at the end of a particular year, so to protect the national taxpayer any such balance should be able to travel in the opposite direction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-39_para4">
Early indications from the Local Government Association and fire and rescue authorities show that they would welcome changing the financial arrangements. I make it clear that the Secretary of State would recoup only audited surpluses from fire and rescue authorities&#039; pension accounts. That would happen after all pension payments and awards for a year had been made. I hope that my clarification of the technical points satisfies hon. Members.

<p><a name="40721-39_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hammond: </b> 
 I am slightly confused, although perhaps there is just a linguistic problem.

<a name="40721-39_para6">
Although in our view the likelihood of such an event occurring remains small, we believe that it would be prudent to take the opportunity offered by the Bill to give firefighters this modest, yet potentially important, extension of powers. I emphasise that the power could be exercised only if firefighters had a reasonable belief that a fire was about to break out, so they would thus have to account for and justify their actions.

<p><a name="40721-39_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hammond: </b> 
 Once again, the amendments are technical and, once again, we asked for them in Committee. They address real issues raised by real firefighters who gave us real examples. I was disappointed to hear the Minister say again that he thought the powers were unlikely to be needed. We recited in Committee examples of firefighters facing the dilemma of seeing a dangerous situation developing that they could easily intervene to prevent, but could not do so legally. The perhaps slightly artificial example is the candle knocked over on the table when the gas jet on the cooker is turned on. Under the Bill as originally drafted, the firefighter would not have the power to break in to prevent that from happening. He would have to stand, looking in through the window, until the explosion occurred, whereupon he would be permitted legally to break into the premises and extinguish the fire, which two minutes earlier he could easily have prevented from happening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-39_para7">
We thought that that was absurd. The fire commissioner for London also thought that it was absurd. I am glad that the Government have finally decided to agree with us.

There is no doubt that a firefighter presented with a fire that is about to break out would undoubtedly break in and do what needed to be done, but he would expose himself to a risk in doing so.

 The amendments amend schedule 1 to make minor consequential amendments to the Local Government Act 1985 and the Severn Bridges Act 1992.

There may be those who think that there could be no question to ask on these amendments, but I have one question for the Minister. Lords amendment No. 19 deletes the reference to

</ul>

and substitutes the term &quot;fire and rescue authority&quot;. We understand why: the Bill introduces that term. Why is it not necessary to provide a statutory reference to the term&#151;in other words to a fire and rescue authority under the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004&#151;when

 I was, of course, well aware of the concern that the hon. Gentleman has expressed.

I will write to him and clarify the point that he has raised.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Inspiration has arrived. Lords amendment No. 19 amends section 8 of the Severn Bridges Act 1992 so that it refers to fire and rescue authorities under the Bill rather than fire authorities under the 1947 Act.

<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Mr. Heppell.]</i>




<a name="40721-41_time3"><h5>7.53 pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="40721-41_spnew3"><b> Mr. Jim Cunningham  (Coventry, South) (Lab):</b> 
 I begin by thanking Mr. Speaker for granting the debate, and my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) and I appreciate his allowing us once again to debate the matter. The debate is by no means meant to constitute an attack on the staff at Walsgrave hospital, who have done a wonderful job, especially since the change in leadership.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-41_para4">
This debate is probably the fourth on Dr. Mattu&#039;s suspension, and it is the third case of an unresolved suspension at Walsgrave hospital. The current cost of those three suspensions amounts to &#163;1.2 million, which could have been used to deliver better NHS services. It is therefore vital that we resolve the matter, especially given the growing economic cost to the public, which has caused much community protest, not to mention the loss of a competent doctor from Walsgrave hospital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-41_para5">
Dr. Mattu&#039;s suspension has lasted for more than two and a half years and, given that the time period for the panel to examine the case will extend to the end of January and possibly February, I think&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West probably agrees&#151;the doctor should be reinstated without prejudice until the matter is sorted out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-41_para6">
We now find that the disciplinary panel chosen to deal with the case will not meet until the end of January 2005, a further six months away. Surely such a procedure cannot be deemed adequate. I believe that in such cases it benefits neither the doctor in question nor the hospital for action to be delayed for more than two and a half years&#151;approaching three, in fact. This is having a lasting effect on the doctor and his family, and the cost to the NHS is growing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-41_para7">
There is something fundamentally wrong with a system that has no time for the resolution of cases such as Dr. Mattu&#039;s. What has happened to the implementation of the National Audit Office&#039;s report and recommendations? I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West agrees that there should be an independent inquiry into the three cases that have occurred over the past three or four years, to find out exactly how the trust has handled them. There is a big question mark over the way in which it deals with such cases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-41_para8">
I stress that we are not prejudicing the outcome of the case, and only want to resolve the issue once and for all. We are asking for justice for Dr. Mattu. While we must question the competence and efficiency of a disciplinary process that has continued for perhaps more than three years and has yet to reach a conclusion, we believe that Dr. Mattu was suspended for whistleblowing. If there are other documented reasons&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West will probably mention this&#151;the trust should make us aware of them, rather than allowing rumours to fly about all over Coventry. That is in the public interest, and will restore confidence in the competence of the trust&#039;s decision making.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-41_para9">
We understand that the cost of Dr. Mattu&#039;s case is now probably more than &#163;500,000, although it should be borne in mind that that goes back to about six 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 457</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>months ago. There should be an independent inquiry into the way in which the case has been handled. It should be dealt with by an independently selected panel to ensure its validity, and to ensure that there is a timely resolution at the least possible cost to the public. As far as we are aware, Dr. Mattu was not suspended for medical reasons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-41_para10">
I believe that Dr. Mattu&#039;s human rights are being denied because of the time that his case has taken, and the inappropriate way in which the trust has been handling matters. The trust should bring to a conclusion any other allegations against Dr. Mattu, and state what they are and the reasons for his suspension. As I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West will agree, the Minister should intervene directly. It is no good passing the matter on to the trust; the Minister has the powers, and should deal with it in a proper manner. He should set up a proper independent inquiry, and reinstate the doctor until such time as the panel does meet and decide whether he is guilty as charged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-41_para11">
As I am sure the Minister knows, there is public concern in Coventry and rumours&#151;not very pleasant rumours&#151;are flying about. I hope that he will take what I have said on board, and look into the matter. It seems to me that every time a consultant or other doctor is suspended at that hospital, all sorts of stories circulate and we eventually find that there was no basis for them. That is no way in which to conduct the business of a hospital and, in particular, a disciplinary procedure.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-41_spnew4"><b> Mr. James Plaskitt  (Warwick and Leamington) (Lab):</b> 
 I greatly admire the hard work done by my hon. Friends the Members for Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham) and for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) on this case. I intervene because, during this lengthy inquiry, Dr. Mattu has become a constituent of mine. When I contacted my hon. Friend the Minister on behalf of my constituent, he confirmed that the matter had been unresolved for too long. Does that not add weight to my hon. Friend&#039;s point about the need for further ministerial intervention?

<p><a name="40721-42_spnew0"><b> Mr. Cunningham: </b> 
 I endorse that, and I am interested to learn that the Minister has considered the argument that the case has gone on for too long. The question for him now is, what will he do about it? As I have said, many people in Coventry are very concerned. My hon. Friends and I are not taking sides; what concerns us is that justice should be done and the doctor&#039;s human rights protected. If this had happened in a factory in Coventry, there would have been a strike because people would not have tolerated it. Why is it taking nearly three years to deal with a disciplinary matter? An industrial relations dispute outside the hospital would have been resolved within a maximum of about three months. It utterly defies belief.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para0">
We want the situation to be resolved as soon as possible. Someone has to cover for the doctor. People tend to forget that. They also tend to forget that, while Dr. Mattu has not been practising his trade, medicine has advanced and there is a danger that we could lose his skills because he has not been allowed to practise and develop his skills using the latest techniques. If he had been a football player and denied the opportunity to ply

</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para2">
Whatever else is said about this matter, it has gone on far too long and has cost far too much money. The longer it has gone on, the murkier it has got. We put it to the Minister that his intervention is absolutely required. If he cannot go to the extent of reinstatement, there are certain things that he can do. They were alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South when he referred to the rumours that are flying around Coventry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para3">
The wretched rumours that I heard just yesterday&#151;I am in no way critical of the staff at Walsgrave; to my knowledge, it is the chairman and chief executive who seem to be leading the campaign against Dr. Mattu&#151;were to the effect that Dr. Mattu was involved in a court case, that the charges against him in that case were serious and that therefore the people who support Dr. Mattu had to be careful because there was new information that was damaging to his case, about which they should be aware before continuing that support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para4">
It is a serious business to have such briefing, which is emanating, as far as we can see, from the top at the trust, brought to our attention by Tory Members and by the chairman of the campaign to reinstate Dr. Mattu.

I thought that the best way to get the matter cleared up&#151;it coincides neatly with today&#039;s debate, which I only heard about yesterday&#151;was to write to Bryan Stoten, chairman of the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, to ask him whether there was anything in the rumours about new information. I received a remarkable letter straight back, from which it is appropriate to read and to which I specifically draw the Minister&#039;s attention: Bryan Stoten says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Thank you for your letter, received this morning.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">It is indeed the case&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para6">
this is important&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;that new information has arisen concerning Dr. Mattu.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para7">
The chairman identifies the new information as being as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I received a letter, copied to the General Medical Council (GMC), from a member of the public regarding Dr. Mattu. The individual claimed that Dr. Mattu had appeared in court on a serious charge and stated that the case was &#039;not proven&#039;.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para8">
That is an interesting use of words.

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="40721-42_spnew3"><b> Mr. Robinson: </b> 
 I think that the chairman must have thought that Dr. Mattu had migrated to the sheriff court in Glasgow or Edinburgh, as if that would wash. What he was really trying to do was much more insidious and I will come to that shortly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para9">
The chairman goes on to say that the GMC has requested that the trust provide


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;any relevant information which the Trust has in its possession pertaining to these issues, so that these issues can be considered under the GMC&#039;s Fitness to Practise procedures.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para10">
He finishes by saying that the trust has sought its own legal opinion and we will be following that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para11">
I spoke to a solicitor, Mr Paul Dentith, who has agreed that I can name and quote him tonight. I believe that he represented Dr. Mattu in the only court case in which Dr. Mattu was involved; at least it is the only court case I know of in which he was involved. I asked Mr. Dentith what the case was about. He said that the case occurred about seven and a half years ago, so it is pretty new. The result of the court case is in the public domain, so that cannot possibly be new. The outcome of the case was an absolute, unequivocal acquittal of Dr. Mattu, who was also awarded costs, all of which information is in the public domain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para12">
Why does the chairman of the Walsgrave trust write to me&#151;his letter was not labelled personal, or private and confidential; therefore, it is quite right for me to put it into the public domain via this debate&#151;to say that the outcome of the court case was not proven? First, we all know that, in English law, one is either guilty or not; we do not have the third option that is available in Scottish law. So why put that into the public domain? I can tell the House why; he wants to create doubts about Dr. Mattu&#039;s character, which will then influence public opinion and influence us against continuing to support him. I do not think much of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para13">
The information has been available since a snippet on the &quot;Today&quot; programme about Dr. Mattu on 29 May. It is now 21 July. Why has not the chairman informed himself so that he does not continue to spread this sort of disinformation to the public?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-42_spnew4"><b> Keith Vaz  (Leicester, East) (Lab):</b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend and my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham) on pursuing the matter. I came to the last debate on the subject in Westminster Hall. Is he as disappointed as I am at the lack of progress over the last few months and at the attitude of Ministers? Should not they be doing much more to bring the trust to account?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-42_spnew5"><b> Mr. Robinson: </b> 
 I agree with every word that my hon. Friend has said. It may be unpleasant for the Minister; I recall that, on the last occasion we debated the issue, he felt that we were being unfair to the trust and were using a position of which they could not avail themselves.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-42_spnew6"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 That is why we are here.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-42_spnew7"><b> Mr. Robinson: </b> 
 Precisely. If the trust had not put disinformation into the public domain and had put in some real facts about the situation, it would have helped a great deal.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para14">
I fear that the same will happen tonight but, on that occasion, the Minister said that he could not do anything about it and that procedures were procedures. However, some Ministers take a different view about procedures. We will be into the fourth year of this poor doctor&#039;s suspension. What in God&#039;s name can be right about these procedures&#151;on a simple test case of alleged bullying, which happens every day of the week and has to be sorted out&#151;that prevents a Minister from stepping in?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para15">
Instead, we have a continuing campaign of snide implication, instead of getting to the bottom of the facts and dealing with them. I have written to the chairman, copying to him my words tonight, to the Minister and to the GMC to make sure that the actuality of the court case is brought to everybody&#039;s attention. Of course it should not be used at all; Mr. Paul Dentith authorised me to say that any organisation or person who sought to make reference to the case or go behind the decision of the court would be behaving very improperly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para16">
I hope that the Minister will take that on board, but if we hear the usual thing tonight&#151;that we are being irresponsible, that he is a Minister and that procedures must continue&#151;we can cut the debate short because we know it all before he starts. One thing he could do tonight would be to make it clear that this sort of briefing against Dr. Mattu should not continue. That is the minimum we ask for and I ask him to do that now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para17">
The answer, as my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South has said in all the debates we have had on the issue, is to have an independent inquiry. That is different from using the existing procedures and processes, but the fact is that the procedures have already been changed. It was the trust that insisted that we should deal with Dr. Mattu under the old procedures, which can last for an eternity. Why do we not use the current ones? That is the minimum that the Minister should do, and he could do it with no loss of face to anyone involved. Why does he not stop people continuing to brief against Dr. Mattu?
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para18">
If we had had an independent inquiry all those months ago, when we began this process&#151;indeed, that is three or four Adjournment debates ago&#151;the matter would have been settled by now and there would be no problem. One way or another, a conclusion would have been reached. As we have said all along, it is not for us to prejudge the outcome of whatever inquiry takes place. I am afraid that the inquiry will not finish by next January but will go on at least until March, by which time we will be into the fourth year of Dr. Mattu&#039;s suspension. If that is normal procedure, heaven help us when the procedure is abnormal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para19">
There are two other points to which I should like to draw the Minister&#039;s attention. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Sadly, having been through this issue with him at least once before, I think that I know what he is going to say. The trust found that it was within its rights to deny three recommendations that were made to the panel by Dr. Sancassia, a most distinguished surgeon at the trust. On what grounds did it do so? That spun things out for another few months; indeed, everything that the trust does seems to point in that direction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-42_para20">
The Minister will doubtless tell us that we are locked into this process and that we are to have another six or seven months of unjustified suspension. It is no good 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 461</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>telling us that this is a neutral act, because we all know that it is by no means neutral. One only has to talk to the Deputy Prime Minister about trying to get a chief police officer suspended to see how neutrally that act is regarded; one has to go to a court of law to get a suspension&#151;a neutral act&#151;agreed. If the Minister can do nothing in this regard, will he at least deal with the continual briefing against Dr. Mattu? I can show the Minister the relevant correspondence, so that he can see the way in which matters have been handled. Can he not at least take direct ministerial action to stop the briefing?

<p><a name="40721-43_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. Stephen Ladyman): </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham) for his continuing interest in his local national health service, and for his persistence in securing a further Adjournment debate on this issue. I fear that I will be every bit as disappointing as my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) expected, and I shall do my best to explain why.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para0">
I am concerned about this case. As my hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt) said, I confirmed to him in writing my view, which I have stated publicly, that this matter has gone on too long and at no little cost to the NHS. I have an ongoing interest in it, and the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS trust has kept me informed of progress. However, I should make it clear from the outset that our position has not changed, and nor can it. Contrary to what my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West said, the trust&#039;s suspension of Dr Mattu is a neutral act. It is not, and should not be regarded as, a disciplinary sanction, and I can assure my hon. Friends that I am not taking sides on this issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para1">
My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West accuses the trust of putting matters into the public domain, but he has just told us that he wrote to the chairman of the trust. Was the chairman not supposed to reply? My hon. Friend has chosen to put this matter on the public record in Parliament&#151;the most public platform of all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para2">
I am aware that, from Dr Mattu&#039;s perspective, the last two years have been anxious and frustrating, as they have been for&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="40721-43_spnew0"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </b> 
 Will the Minister give way?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-43_spnew1"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 No I will not. My hon. Friend has already taken up most of the time and I need to deal with some of the points that were raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para3">
I realise that this has been an anxious and frustrating time for Dr. Mattu, but it has also been so for those who made the allegations. As I asked in the previous Adjournment debate on this issue, is somebody going to represent those who made the allegations? I suspect that one of the Members in this House tonight is the MP for those who made the allegations. When is somebody going to stand up for those people? That is why we must consider this a neutral act and make sure that it is properly investigated.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 462</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para4">
I want to make it clear that the allegations that were made in February 2002&#151;that is far too long ago&#151;were serious and substantial. They were of a nature whereby Dr. Mattu could not remain on duty while they were investigated. The trust rightly took the view that they should be thoroughly investigated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para5">
An internal investigation was carried out, led by the trust&#039;s joint medical director, and in accordance with its agreed employment procedures. That investigation found that there was a prima facie case to be answered, and under those circumstances, and given the seriousness of the allegations, it was clearly correct for Dr. Mattu to be suspended while a formal investigation was undertaken.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para6">
The trust also decided that the matter was too serious to be dealt with as a personal misconduct case within the trust, so it was obliged to take it to a professional misconduct disciplinary process. The professional disciplinary process is a carefully laid down and legalistic process, and I fear it takes time. It has been agreed nationally between the BMA and the Government, and the process applied locally gives Dr. Mattu a great deal of representation and protection, so my hon. Friends should be confident that his best interests are being served by going down that route.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-43_spnew2"><b> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </b> 
 I do not necessarily disagree that there should be a full investigation. Our problem is about why it has taken nearly three years. That is what bothers us.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-43_spnew3"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 One of the reasons for that is that it is a legalistic process, and the BMA, in agreeing the process with the Government, built in a series of measures to ensure that people who are complained against have the time and the opportunity to build a defence case.

</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para7">
It has been suggested, however, that the trust has been delaying the progress of the case, and even that it is in some way hoping that the issue will go away. I believe that such suggestions are disingenuous, and I can assure my hon. Friends that delays in progressing the case cannot be blamed entirely on the trust. For example, I am advised that there have been a number of occasions on which Dr. Mattu, I am sure for quite proper reasons, has cancelled pre-arranged meetings at the last minute, even telephoning the trust on the day of the meeting. I do not want to criticise&#151;and I do not criticise&#151;Dr. Mattu for the time that the case has been unable to make progress because of his unfortunate sickness in 2003, but it is not appropriate to blame the trust for that either.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para8">
In addition, Dr. Mattu and his supporters have kept up a correspondence and media campaign, and it is their right to do so, but in doing so they have tied up resources at the trust that could otherwise have been used to deal more expeditiously with the case. Given all this, and given the fact that the disciplinary process is in any case a thorough and full one in order to protect Dr. Mattu&#039;s rights and allow him to build his defence&#151;

</p>








<p><a name="40721-43_spmin1"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker  (Sylvia Heal): </b> 
 Order. The Minister is responding to the debate.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 463</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="40721-43_spnew5"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Nobody should be blaming the trust for the slow progress.
</p>








<p><a name="40721-43_spnew6"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 I am absolutely astonished at the complacency of the Minister&#039;s answer. He is a Minister of the Crown. Members of Parliament representing Coventry and other areas&#151;Dr. Mattu has come to see me at my surgery&#151;have raised these issues with him. What has he done to ensure that our concerns, properly raised in this place&#151;where else would my hon. Friend come to raise them&#151;are dealt with? What has he done since the last time the matter was raised in the House?
</p>








<p><a name="40721-43_spnew7"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 I have made sure that the case goes through the proper process, which has been agreed with Dr. Mattu and his solicitors. That is the simple fact, even if my hon. Friends choose to ignore it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para9">
My hon. Friends will also appreciate that the trust is restricted in the response that it has been able to make to allegations and criticisms put in the public domain. My hon. Friends can go much further tonight than I can, or than I would consider wise, but to a great extent we have a situation in which Dr. Mattu and his supporters, and Members of the House, have opportunities to spread around allegations and even attack the credibility and good will of those involved in making the complaints, while the trust and Ministers are unable to put the other side of the case, as we would then be seen to be prejudicing the disciplinary process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para10">
Since Dr. Mattu was suspended, Ministers have been urged through both correspondence and pressure by the local media to intervene to bring this matter to a close. Frankly, I would be ill advised to intervene in a contractual matter between an employer and an employee, especially as NHS trusts are independent organisations. Ministers are certainly not experts in employment law and I am not party&#151;nor would it be right for me to be so&#151;to the detail of the allegations made against Dr. Mattu. Neither am I party to Dr. Mattu&#039;s response to those allegations or the complex legal arguments that are ongoing. This is, therefore, clearly a matter that has to be resolved between Dr. Mattu and the trust.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para11">
Every NHS trust, as an employer, has its own procedures for suspending and disciplining doctors. That is right and proper and protects employees from Whitehall interference. Since 1990, that disciplinary procedure has been a matter for the trust, as an employer. The Department of Health has issued guidance as to what the procedure should include, and has monitored trusts to ensure that it is in place. The trust reviewed its procedures for handling suspensions in the light of that guidance, so we can be confident that its procedures are robust.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>21 Jul 2004 : Column 464</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para12">
That brings me to the suggestion that Dr. Mattu should be reinstated while the disciplinary process continues. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The trust has been keeping this case under review and is satisfied that grounds remain for keeping the suspension in place. I would again ask my hon. Friends, as I did the last time we had an Adjournment debate, also to think about the rights of other parties involved and their feelings in this matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para13">
Ultimately, reinstatement is a matter for the trust to consider in its discussions with Dr. Mattu, but it would not be reasonable of the trust to ignore either the allegations or the rights and feelings of other parties. Nor would it be reasonable for Ministers to put pressure on the trust to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para14">
All of that leads me to conclude that this complex and difficult matter is best dealt with using the formal procedures now agreed and with all sides agreeing that Dr.Mattu&#039;s suspension is a neutral position, suggesting neither innocence nor guilt. Indeed, I understand that the trust has now agreed with Dr. Mattu and his solicitors that the case should go through the formal disciplinary hearing, where both sides will air their views in front of an independent panel of three members, chaired by a QC. The agreed procedure allows that both parties should agree on the selection of the chair of the panel and Andrew Stafford, QC, has been agreed by both the trust and Dr. Mattu.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para15">
According to the trust&#039;s professional disciplinary procedure, the chair of the trust&#039;s senior hospital medical staff committee is then responsible for approving the other two panel members from suggestions made by the General Medical Council&#039;s joint consultative committee. One of the panel members, Dr. Robert Bain, an experienced consultant cardiologist based in Grimsby, has been selected. I understand that a name is currently being considered for the third place on the panel. The trust is making final checks that the person recommended does not know Dr. Mattu&#151;either personally or in a professional capacity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40721-43_para16">
In my view, that is a sensible way forward as it will allow both parties to present the whole of their case in a fair and even-handed setting. It will also allow a proper review of the credibility of the evidence presented. Of course, it will take time&#151;time for both sides to prepare their arguments and time for the panel to consider them. I repeat that&#151;
