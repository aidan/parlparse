 (LD): What percentage of staff employed by NHS trusts in England on 1&nbsp;January, or the latest date for which figures are available, were (a) directly employed and (b)&nbsp;agency staff.  [216966]
</p>


<p><a name="50222-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Mr.&nbsp;John Hutton): </b> 
 The Department does not collect specific information on the numbers of NHS staff who are directly employed or hired through agencies. In 2003&#150;04, the estimated agency spend as a proportion of the total NHS pay bill was 5.4&nbsp;per cent.&#151;a reduction of almost 7&nbsp;per cent. from the previous year.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew0"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 Do Ministers accept that under the Labour Government there appears to have been an increase of approximately 50&nbsp;per cent. in the spend on the health service&#151;which, of course, is welcome&#151;but a 300&nbsp;per cent. increase in the number of agency staff employed by the NHS in England? Will Ministers say categorically that it is always better where possible to have directly employed rather than agency staff? What will they do to keep driving the numbers of agency staff down and fully employed staff up? That is what patients want, and what all the other workers in the NHS prefer.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The answer to the specific question is yes, of course it is. We are making significant progress in reducing the spend on agency staff, and I referred to the overall figures for the NHS pay bill in my answer. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 132</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Gentleman might be interested to know that last year in London, where spending on agency staff accounts for about 35&nbsp;per cent. of the total spend across the NHS, there was a significant fall of about 14&nbsp;per cent. in the use by the NHS of nurse agency staff. That was partly driven by the excellent work of the South West London strategic health authority, but also by a better and more intelligent use of the framework agreements that we negotiated through the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency with the nursing recruitment agencies themselves. I am quite confident that we shall continue to see significant reductions in the overall spend on nursing agency staff.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Patrick Hall  (Bedford)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend will know that Bedford general hospital featured on &quot;Panorama&quot; last Sunday. The key message that came across was the high quality and strong morale of the whole staff team of both directly employed and agency staff. Will he join me in welcoming and celebrating their professionalism, dedication and commitment to solving problems, which has reduced waiting times, delivered high-quality services to patients and made the best use of the sustained increase in resources that the NHS has received?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I certainly join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to the outstanding work of NHS staff in Bedford and many other parts of the country who are doing a brilliant job in improving the quality of care, reducing the time that patients wait and improving the overall patient experience. The right way to make sure that we continue to do so is to bring the investment in and not introduce charges for hospital operations.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Peter Lilley  (Hitchin and Harpenden)</b> 
 (Con): Will the Minister confirm that that huge reliance on agency staff at immense cost is proof that ultimately one cannot buck the market? Attempts to staff our hospitals with nurses with different pay and conditions mean that we cannot balance demand and supply domestically. We have to import 15,000&nbsp;nurses a year because we are losing 8,000&nbsp;British-trained nurses overseas, and nearly one third of nurses with British nurse training go elsewhere. Ultimately, to achieve a balanced domestic supply we must pay a proper rate for our nurses rather than wasting money in this way.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I agree strongly that we need to pay nurses more and give them a better rate of pay. That is precisely what we are doing with Agenda for Change, which has been negotiated with nurses and the Royal College of Nursing in particular. It gives us an opportunity to make significant progress in this important area&#151;something that was quite invisible when the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s party was in charge of the national health service.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew6"><b> Lawrie Quinn  (Scarborough and Whitby)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree that a key part of work in the NHS is teamwork and the dedication of directly employed staff on a daily basis? He will know of recent concerns about Whitby hospital in my constituency, so I wonder whether he can help me to facilitate a meeting with the strategic health authority and the primary care trust to make sure that all the key partners who deliver 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 133</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>an excellent service for the people of Whitby and the surrounding district can continue to do so in future? Will he commend those staff and congratulate them on delivering PCT services in one of the largest community hospitals in England?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Yes, the NHS staff in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency are doing an excellent job, and I pay tribute to their commitment and professionalism. I shall certainly help facilitate the meeting that he asked for. That will not be a problem. I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend&#039;s outstanding support for the national health service in his constituency.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. John Baron  (Billericay)</b> 
 (Con): The Government are well aware that many agencies recruit NHS staff from overseas countries. The recent Save the Children study accused the UK of contributing to the collapse of health systems in many poor countries, and a British Medical Association statement criticised the UK&#039;s shameful record of exploitation in taking nurses from developing countries&#151;an issue that the Opposition have raised many times. Given this new evidence, if the Minister accepts that poor countries need their nurses even more than we do, why will the Government not ban the NHS from using recruitment agencies that have not signed up to their own code of practice?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has drawn attention to the matter a number of times, but he always fails to point out that the UK leads the world in the ethical recruitment of medical staff. The code of practice that we have formulated and promulgated, which has now, I am glad to say, been extended to the independent health care sector, is held up as a model of good practice by the World Health Organisation. We do not recruit in developing nations in Africa. On the point that we should support those countries with the cost of training health care staff, I should point out to the hon. Gentleman that in the past five years the Department for International Development has provided more than &#163;500&nbsp;million worth of aid and development costs for African countries to help them train the nurses and doctors that they need for the future.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew10"><b> Helen Jones  (Warrington, North)</b> 
 (Lab): Further to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Mr. Hall), will the Minister join me in congratulating the staff&#151;both agency and directly employed&#151;at Warrington hospital on the magnificent way in which they worked during and after the fire at the hospital just over a week ago? Will he show his appreciation in a tangible way by considering what can be done to help the hospital through this difficult time, and ensure that it is not penalised for missing targets where that failure results purely from the fire at the hospital?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I shall look at the last point raised by my hon. Friend. There was a tragedy at the hospital, which she has been working closely with her constituents to resolve, and I appreciate the work that she has done. It is right to say that it is not just NHS staff who do an outstanding job for NHS patients. Many agency nurses and agency staff do a brilliant job as well, and it would be wrong to give the impression that that was not the case. They are dedicated to their patients and they do a good job for the NHS.

<p>2. <a name="50222-01_wqn1"><b> Sandra Gidley  (Romsey)</b> 
 (LD): If he will make a statement on the Government&#039;s response to the Parliamentary Health Ombudsman&#039;s report on continuing care.  [216967]
</p>


<p><a name="50222-01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. Stephen Ladyman): </b> 
 The written ministerial statement that was made to the House on 9&nbsp;December 2004&nbsp;outlined our plans to develop a national framework for fully funded continuing care. The framework will improve consistency and ease of understanding and will help to ensure that users&#039; and carers&#039; reasonable expectations are being met.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew12"><b> Sandra Gidley: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for that explanation. There have been 4,000&nbsp;complaints to the ombudsman since the February 2003&nbsp;report, which recommended the establishment of clear national minimum eligibility criteria that are understandable to health professionals, carers and patients. It also stated that the local criteria are over-assessed and poorly applied. Why has it taken so long to draw up national minimum standards, and what will the Minister do to make sure that those are properly and transparently applied?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew13"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 We started off with 96&nbsp;different sets of criteria. We reduced those to 28, which we ensured were legally reliable and properly administered before we started the review. The review of the outstanding cases is complete in all but one strategic health authority area, and even that one will be finished shortly, so we have made substantial improvements. In developing the national framework, we must now make sure that we go down to one single framework that is easy for patients and carers to understand and can be reliably implemented by professionals. By establishing best practice, that is exactly what we shall do.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. David Hinchliffe  (Wakefield)</b> 
 (Lab): On the issue of long-term care, under the previous Administration there was a significant increase in the number of elderly people institutionalised in private care and nursing homes, and this Government have a proud record of moving in the opposite direction. Will the forthcoming Green Paper possibly set targets for a further reduction? Can my hon. Friend set out roughly how soon we will have the Green Paper and tell us what positive policies it will include on developing alternatives to the institutional care sector inherited from the previous Administration?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew15"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 First, I can promise my hon. Friend that the Green Paper will be available shortly. Of course, as a Green Paper, it will not contain specific targets, but I promise him that it will reaffirm the direction of travel&#151;the direction that older people themselves tell us that they want us to take. They want to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. If they cannot do so, they want to move to accommodation where they can maintain their independence. They do not want to be shuffled off into residential care, which is the policy of the Opposition parties.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 135</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Stephen Dorrell  (Charnwood)</b> 
 (Con): Can the Minister confirm that the continuing uncertainty and confusion about entitlement to residential care date back to the Coughlan judgment, which was handed down almost six years ago? Is this not a sorry tale of incompetence and bungling by the Government, compounded by the fact that the Minister promised that, by March 2004, all those who had overpaid their charges would receive back their overpayments? How many of those people are still waiting for overpayments that were declared illegal six years ago?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew17"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 I will not confirm that it goes back to the Coughlan judgment. It goes back to when the previous Government ordered 96&nbsp;health authorities to write separate sets of eligibility criteria. The right hon. Gentleman ought to know that; I rather suspect that he was Secretary of State at the time when it was ordered. The fact is that the ombudsman asked us to go back in our review to 1996&nbsp;precisely because the confusion arose from the point at which the criteria were issued. We are cleaning up the Conservative party&#039;s mess, and we are doing so at great expense to the taxpayer.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Simon Burns  (West Chelmsford)</b> 
 (Con): May I tell the Minister that he is living in cloud cuckoo land? This is a miserable episode for the Department of Health. His own deadlines for sorting out the problem have been missed eight times, and the ombudsman has accused the Government of bungling the cases, criticised the Department for issuing unreliable information to her about its review and found that, in half the reviewed cases that she has looked at, the reviews have not been properly carried out. Can the Minister tell us when there will be completion for all the people who have complained? Can he also tell us more about the compensation? Will it be compensation solely for the money that people inadvertently and wrongly had to pay? What will happen to people who had to sell their homes, when it now turns out that there was no reason whatever for doing so?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-01_spnew19"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Let me deal with that last point first. Since 2001, we have allowed all local authorities to defer payments, so property needs to be sold only after people&#039;s death. That is available in every part of this country. It is a policy that means that people do not have to sell their homes, and it would be swept away by the policies of both the Conservative party and the Liberal Democrats if they were implemented. The simple fact is that we have a serious and complex problem to clean up. We had to go from 96&nbsp;sets of eligibility criteria to 28&nbsp;sets, and we had to ensure that people could understand them. All the cases in which people requested their review by the March deadline have now been completed. Other cases are coming in continuously, and we are paying compensation on the basis that, where the national health service received unjust enrichment, we are paying the money back to people. We are paying &#163;180&nbsp;million to clean up a mess left by the hon. Gentleman&#039;s Government.

 (Lab): What discussions he has had with the new Minister for Health and Social Services in the National Assembly for Wales Government on strategic approaches to health provision in England and Wales.  [216968]


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 136</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>


<p><a name="50222-02_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Ms&nbsp;Rosie Winterton): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not yet met the new Minister for Health and Social Services in the National Assembly for Wales, but he regularly meets his fellow UK Health Ministers to discuss matters of common interest.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-02_spnew0"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 I seek the indulgence of the House to pay tribute to the staff in acute care and ambulance services at Morriston hospital, Swansea, who saved my father&#039;s life over the Christmas period. I also pay tribute to the work carried out in the national health service throughout the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-02_para0">
I am sure that the Minister agrees that one of the benefits of devolution is that we can learn lessons from both sides of Offa&#039;s dyke, and the Assembly should be applauded for its work on primary care, healthy living initiatives and so on. When the Minister meets Dr. Brian Gibbons, the new Health and Social Services Minister, will she take the opportunity to bolster his good work on waiting times by discussing the excellent initiatives in England such as targeted waiting times and mobile units?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-02_para1">
Does she think that some matters will be off the record in those discussions&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="50222-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. That is three supplementaries; we will not go into a fourth.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-02_spnew2"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I am sure that the staff will appreciate my hon. Friend&#039;s comments, because NHS staff are too often not thanked for their work. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will meet the Health and Social Services Minister in the Welsh Assembly Government, and I am sure that he will be happy to discuss how we have made dramatic improvements on waiting lists, which is a problem that we inherited, by setting clear national targets and adopting innovative approaches such as mobile units. I am also sure that he will be happy to discuss improvements to public health in Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-02_para2">
My hon. Friend asked which matters will not be on the agenda. The introduction of patient charges in the NHS, taking &#163;1.2&nbsp;billion away from the NHS and the&nbsp;dreaded patient passport will certainly not be on the agenda, because, unlike the Conservative party, this party believes in the NHS being free at the point of need.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-02_spnew3"><b> Chris Grayling  (Epsom and Ewell)</b> 
 (Con): While the Minister is discussing public health, will she undertake an urgent review of strategy for health protection and food safety with the devolved Administration in Wales and its counterpart in Scotland in the light of this week&#039;s contamination of the food chain? In particular, will she undertake to review the role of the Food Standards Agency, given the slow and chaotic way in which it has responded to the crisis?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-02_spnew4"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 The most important point is ensuring maximum protection for the public, and we expect the FSA to do just that. We will examine the episode to see what lessons can be learned, but we will take no lessons from the Conservative party, which brought us bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The Conservative plans in the James review include cutting the Meat Hygiene Service, which was set up to protect the public.

 (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree that it is not acceptable for patients from Wales who are seeing the same consultant as patients from England at the same hospital to wait twice as long to obtain similar treatment? Will she discuss that issue as a matter of urgency with the new Minister in the National Assembly for Wales and impress upon him the great success of the NHS in England in reducing waiting times?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-02_spnew6"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I hope that my hon. Friend recognises that those matters are obviously for the Assembly, and, if he feels it necessary, I am sure that he will make those points to Assembly Ministers. In March, guidance will be published on payments between Welsh and English trusts and on waiting times.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-02_spnew7"><b> Dame Marion Roe  (Broxbourne)</b> 
 (Con): How can the Minister possibly believe that the people of Wales are receiving value for money when, despite a 31&nbsp;per cent. increase in funding between 2000&nbsp;and 2003, the number of finished consultant episodes actually declined by 1&nbsp;per cent. in that time?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-02_spnew8"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 The hon. Lady knows that the matters that she raises are for the Welsh Assembly to determine. The Conservative party did not support devolution to Wales. We do, and those matters are for the Welsh Assembly.

<p>4. <a name="50222-02_wqn1"><b> Tom Brake  (Carshalton and Wallington)</b> 
 (LD): What his Department&#039;s policy is on reducing waiting times for diagnostics.  [216969]
</p>


<p><a name="50222-02_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. John Reid): </b> 
 By 2008, the maximum time from GP referral to the start of treatment will be down to just 18&nbsp;weeks. That includes diagnostic procedures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-02_para3">
To that end, I announced last week an increase of 2.75&nbsp;million extra scans and diagnostic procedures by 2008, all of which will be delivered to patients in the national health service free of charge at the point of need.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-02_spnew9"><b> Tom Brake: </b> 
 On the latter point, the Secretary of State knows of the grave concerns about the previous contract for MRI scans, especially the problems of hidden costs, staff leaving the NHS, tests having to be repeated and wrong diagnosis. Why is he confident that the same problems will not occur under the new contract?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-02_spnew10"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 Because there is not a shred of evidence to show that there were undue problems with the first contract. Twenty-five thousand treatments have been carried out under that contract and patient satisfaction is 96&nbsp;per cent., which is comparable with anything that we have ever done in the NHS. Of course, when one embarks on such an undertaking, there are teething problems. However, we should be careful to ensure that we are on the side not only of the health care providers in the NHS but of the patient. I know that the Liberals always put the interest of the patient second to that of the producer, but the 600,000&nbsp;extra scans that we procured for NHS patients means that, for example, in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 138</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Newham hospital, which I visited last week, people are now waiting less than one week. That is a huge improvement for patients. It is one of the reasons why, when purchasing another 2.4&nbsp;million scans, I was willing not only to extend the number of NHS scans by 1.4&nbsp;million but to procure another 1&nbsp;million from the independent sector, in the knowledge that they would all be delivered free&#151;with no charges, unlike what would happen under a Conservative Government&#151;to all patients in the NHS.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-02_spnew11"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): The constituency of North-West Leicestershire is mainly served by the University Hospitals of Leicester Trust&#151;one of the largest in the country&#151;which sees 2,500&nbsp;people a day as new or follow-up out-patients. It had a disappointing record until recently. Will my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State come with me to the hospital to see how the position has been significantly transformed? All waiting list targets have been fulfilled six months in advance of the Government&#039;s requirements, all suspected cancer patients are seen in 14&nbsp;days, and the management and staff are among the finest in the country. Will he accompany me to inspect what has been done?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-02_spnew12"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 I shall certainly try to arrange that in my schedule, but in any case I congratulate the staff not only in the hospital that my hon. Friend mentioned but throughout the country, who have matched the investment that the taxpayer has been prepared to invest in the NHS with reform and finding new ways of working so that output is greater, whatever the level of investment. The speed with which people can see GPs or be referred from GPs to consultants is light years ahead of what it was under the Conservative Government. However, I accept that, when more people are going through far more quickly, there is a potential bottleneck at the diagnostic level. That is why I am not only rapidly expanding the number of NHS scans, tests and diagnostic treatments but procuring from the independent sector. I stress to all hon. Members my pledge that, under this Government, charges will not be introduced for basic operations or basic treatments on the diagnostic side. To do so would be at odds with the founding principle of the NHS, and the Government will do no other than stand against such an outcome.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-02_spnew13"><b> Dr. Richard Taylor  (Wyre Forest)</b> 
 (Ind): The Secretary of State referred to the teething troubles with some of the reporting from private sector MRI scans. How will he tackle those troubles, especially given that there is no longer any contact between the referring clinician for the scan and the radiologist who does the reporting? In the past, that contact was incredibly helpful.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-02_spnew14"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 There is continual liaison with the Department on this matter. Before embarking on this course of action, the Department consulted widely on it, including with the royal colleges, and we will continue to try to identify any problems involved. We should not pretend that there are never any problems in diagnostics in the NHS. There are, and they include huge delays, but I can tell the hon. Gentleman that, as a result of the medical programme to which he referred, waiting times 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 139</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>for diagnostics have been cut right across the NHS. For instance, in Huddersfield, access times have been cut from 38&nbsp;weeks to eight weeks; in Ipswich, they have been cut from more than 30&nbsp;weeks to five weeks; and in Newham, they have been cut from 18&nbsp;weeks to less than a week. While I accept that we have to deal with the problems that arise&#151;including problems involving a degree of opposition to any novel procurement outside the NHS from people inside it; we have to take that into account&#151;the patient must come first. The patient is getting far better, quicker service than ever before and, I repeat, all of it is free at the point of need.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Paul Burstow  (Sutton and Cheam)</b> 
 (LD): These are the hidden waiting lists that the Government say they will finally publish. They will not, however, publish them until after the general election. The Secretary of State has just rehearsed some figures on improvements in diagnostics, but will he share all the figures that he has with Members of the House, so that we can see for ourselves how the NHS is improving? Will he also confirm that the announcement that he made last Friday in fact involves expending from existing NHS budgets to deliver the new contracts, rather than from new NHS funds? Will he allow the local NHS to take decisions for itself about how best to cut diagnostic waits, rather than bouncing it into a nationally arranged contract? Will he also ensure that all NHS scanning equipment is being used to the full, rather than sitting idle, as much of it is now?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-02_spnew16"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 On the hon. Gentleman&#039;s first point, the reason that we cannot publish comprehensive lists of waiting times for diagnostics is that, for 60&nbsp;years and under successive Governments, that information was never collected. It is unfair that we do not include that information when we calculate the waiting time for operations, and I therefore pledge that it will be published. By 2008, it will be not only published but included in the calculation of the waiting time, which will be counted not just from the last little bit of the journey but from the beginning right to the end. And we pledge that it will be 18&nbsp;weeks.
</p>

<p>

The hon. Gentleman also asked whether we would allow local providers of health care to have the power to choose how they would provide it. No, I will allow the patients to decide how, where and when they will gain access, and I will allow them to do that in days, in some cases, rather than weeks or months. I will certainly not do what some people in the Liberal party want to do, which is to break up the NHS by making it rely effectively on local authority control. That would allow inequalities to grow in the most impoverished areas, while the most affluent areas could provide better access. That, to me, is as bad as the charging regime that the Tories want to introduce.

Around &#163;5.4&nbsp;million of public capital has so far been provided to support the North Staffordshire LIFT project.

The House might be interested to know that the LIFT scheme is delivering new primary care facilities in some of the most deprived areas of the country, resulting in improved health care for patients in areas of greatest need: 75&nbsp;per cent. of the most deprived primary care trust areas are part of an NHS LIFT scheme.

For the 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08&nbsp;allocations, population data have been revised to take account of undercounting and projected increases in populations. As a consequence, Central Manchester PCT, North Manchester PCT and South Manchester PCT will receive increases of 26.4, 21.7&nbsp;and 28.2&nbsp;per cent. respectively, compared with a national average increase for all PCTs of 19.5&nbsp;per cent. for the same period.

<p><a name="50222-03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradley: </b> 
 I am grateful for that answer. The people of Manchester hugely welcome the incredibly large increases for the three PCTs, although they were concerned about the population base because of the Office for National Statistics failing to count the people of Manchester properly and missing out 20,000&nbsp;people who required health care in the city. I clearly welcome the fact that my right hon. Friend has now made the adjustment to that baseline figure. Can he confirm that

He might also be interested to know, as might my other hon.

My constituents, like those of my Manchester colleagues, will die younger than others and be sicker for large parts of their life. In that context, it is difficult for us to accept that, because of a failure of the ONS, moneys were withdrawn and will not be replaced.

</p>





<p><a name="50222-03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I can only say to my hon. Friend that Manchester PCTs are getting some of the biggest increases in resources that they have ever had. That is because of the additional resources that are available to the NHS and because we have also targeted additional resources on Manchester to deal precisely with the concerns that he has raised about the health inequalities gap, which separates Manchester from the rest of the country. It is true that a baby boy born in Manchester today will live seven years less than a baby boy born in Dorset. That is totally unacceptable. My right hon.

There has been a significant increase in the number of occupational therapists working in the NHS, and the number in training has doubled.

 (LD): What assessment he has made of waiting times for cancer treatment.  [216978]
</p>


<p><a name="50222-05_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. John Reid): </b> 
 In 1997, 63&nbsp;per cent. of people with suspected cancer were seen by a specialist within two weeks of urgent referral by their GP; today, that figure is more than 99&nbsp;per cent. Treatment for certain types of cancer&#151;breast cancer, for example&#151;is now provided quicker than ever before. Some 97&nbsp;per cent. of women start treatment within two months of an urgent GP referral. We are now ensuring that, through improved diagnostic and treatment services, this standard will soon be reached for all cancer patients.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-05_spnew6"><b> Mr. Gill: </b> 
 A Royal College of Radiologists report published last year found that waiting times for treatment had actually increased across the country. Ministers often cite the two-week wait for diagnosis, but it is still difficult to get a picture of how long constituents such as mine have to wait for different types of cancer treatment. When will the Secretary of State&#039;s Department publish all the waiting times for the different types of cancer treatment?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-05_spnew7"><b> Dr. Reid: </b> 
 I think that I answered most of those points earlier. It would be churlish of me to point out that if this matter were left up to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s colleagues, targets for waiting times would be abolished completely, which would cause such times to rise again. People are now seeing GPs more quickly than ever before. People with suspected cancers are being referred to consultants more quickly than ever before; indeed, 99&nbsp;per cent. are seen within two weeks. However, I accept that that means that we now have to tackle the backlogs and bottlenecks in diagnostics and radiotherapy, which is why we are putting in so much extra money and introducing so many extra diagnostic tests. I have just announced another &#163;1&nbsp;billion for 2.4&nbsp;million extra scans, all of which will be free on the national health service.

<a name="50222-05_head0"><h3 align=center>Prevention of Terrorism</h3>

<a name="50222-05_time0"><h5>12.31&nbsp;pm</h5>


<p><a name="50222-05_spmin4"><b>The Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Mr.&nbsp;Charles Clarke): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement about the Prevention of Terrorism Bill, which is being introduced today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para1">
On 26&nbsp;January, I told the House that I intended to bring forward a Bill as quickly as possible to repeal the powers in part 4&nbsp;of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001&#151;the 2001&nbsp;Act&#151;and to replace them with a new scheme of control orders applicable to all suspected terrorists irrespective of whether they are British or foreign nationals and, in relation to most controls, irrespective of the type of terrorism with which they are involved. The Bill is designed to meet the Law Lords&#039; criticism that the previous legislation was both disproportionate and discriminatory.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para2">
The Bill needs to be seen in the context of the scale of the continuing and serious threat to the security of the United Kingdom from terrorism. I will today publish a series of discussion papers that set out the Government&#039;s view of that threat and our strategy for reducing it. In 2004, I laid before the House a copy of the report of the noble and learned Lord Carlile of Berriew on the operation of the part 4&nbsp;powers in the 2001&nbsp;Act. Let no one be in any doubt that there are terrorists here and abroad who want to attack the UK and its interests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para3">
Some believe that the absence in this country of a terrorist outrage such as 9/11&nbsp;or Madrid means that the terrorist threat has somehow passed us by or failed to materialise. That view is short-sighted, complacent, ignorant of the facts and potentially cavalier in its disregard of the safety of this country. I pay tribute today to the vigilance and professionalism of our security authorities, including the police, for all that they have done and are doing to keep this country safe. It is their efforts, rather than any reduction in the ambition of terrorist organisations, that have protected us from such an attack.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para4">
My principal responsibility as Home Secretary is to protect this country and everyone within it. I am determined that we will take the steps necessary to ensure our safety. The Government&#039;s preferred approach&#151;our first option&#151;is to prosecute and convict terrorists. We are considering the scope for new offences, including that of being concerned in
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para5">
and other measures, with a view to helping the police and prosecuting authorities to bring more cases to court. I intend to bring forward further counter-terrorist legislation on those issues as soon as parliamentary time allows.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para6">
Some suggest that we could bring more prosecutions, if only we would allow intercept to be used in criminal proceedings. I have thought carefully about that, but for all the reasons set out in my written statement to the House on 26&nbsp;January, I do not believe that it is true. The reality is that intercept is only a part&#151;often a small part&#151;of the intelligence picture in such cases. Its main value is usually in helping the intelligence and law enforcement agencies to direct their resources, such as surveillance, most effectively to disrupt terrorist activities and gather evidence to support arrests and prosecutions.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 152</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para7">
The fact is that there will always be some people&#151;including some extremely dangerous people&#151;whom we cannot prosecute, either because the material that we have is inadmissible in criminal proceedings, or because it cannot be used for fear of revealing, and so endangering, sources and techniques. Some say that we should do nothing about those people, or that we should just monitor their activities through surveillance and so forth and hope to deflect them in that way. I do not accept that&#151;the risk is too great. That is the reason for the Bill that I am publishing today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para8">
The Law Lords&#039; judgment on 16&nbsp;December found that the part 4&nbsp;powers in the 2001&nbsp;Act were disproportionate and discriminatory in that they applied only to foreign nationals, and we had apparently managed to contain the threat from British nationals without detention. As I told the House on 26&nbsp;January, I accept that judgment, and therefore believe that it is important to address those concerns. We should not simply renew the current legislation, which the Law Lords so overwhelmingly regard as flawed. We should replace it&#151;with strong measures that are fully compatible with the ECHR, and applicable to both British and foreign nationals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para9">
The Bill that I propose empowers the Secretary of State to make control orders and to impose under them a range of controls on the individuals concerned that will be tailored to meet the threat that each poses. The purpose of the orders is to prevent an individual from continuing to carry out terrorist-related activities. The orders will be time-limited, but they will be capable of being renewed or remade if the threat posed by the individual justifies it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para10">
The Bill makes provision for a range of controls to be imposed. The list will include prohibitions or restrictions on the possession of specified articles or specified services or facilities, on association and movement, and on an individual&#039;s place of residence, place of work or occupation. Other restrictions will be placed on those individuals&#039; ability to travel, including abroad. A breach of a control order without prior consent will be a criminal offence, triable in the usual way through the criminal courts and punishable by imprisonment or a fine, or both.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para11">
At the top end, the obligations that could be imposed could include a requirement for the individual to remain in a particular place at all times, or some similar measure that amounted to a deprivation of liberty. The place in question will vary with the threat posed by the individual. It could be the individual&#039;s own home, or his or her parents&#039; home. It could even, in certain circumstances, be in accommodation owned and managed by the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para12">
However, such severe forms of control order would require a derogation from article 5&nbsp;of the ECHR before they could be implemented. As hon. Members know, article 15&nbsp;of the ECHR allows member states to derogate from certain aspects of the convention where there is a
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;state of public emergency threatening the life of the nation&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para13">
and the measures proposed are
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;strictly required by the exigencies of the situation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para14">
Therefore, the basis of any derogation would be those two conditions&#151;the threat to the life of the nation, and the necessity for measures that would deprive people of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 153</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>liberty. The Bill therefore provides that I can make orders that require a derogation only if the following factors apply: first, if there is a designated derogation in force from all or part of article 5&nbsp;in respect of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation; secondly, if the obligation imposed is such as has been described in that derogation; and thirdly, if I am satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities, the person is, or has been, involved in terrorism, and that the imposition of that obligation on that person is strictly required for the purposes of protecting the public from risks arising out of, or associated with, that public emergency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para15">
In the event that a derogation was necessary, I would make the designated derogation order. It would come into force immediately but under the Human Rights Act 1998, it would need to be confirmed by a vote in each House of Parliament within 40&nbsp;days of its having been made if it were to continue in force. So the conditions of any derogation&#151;that is, the threat to the life of the nation and the necessity for the measures that would amount to a deprivation of liberty&#151;would be considered, assessed and voted upon by every Member of Parliament if it were to remain in force. I believe that this framework is robust and enables the security of this country to be properly addressed in all foreseeable circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para16">
These are rightly onerous conditions, which Parliament will have to consider at any time when a derogation is made. I have, of course, carefully considered the current situation, and I have to tell the House that it is not my intention to seek a derogation at this time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para17">
I am clear that a derogation is justified on the basis of the threat that we currently face. As I told the House on 26&nbsp;January, there is a continuing public emergency as a result of the threat from al-Qaeda, its agenda and its adherents, including the different groups and linkages that make up the al-Qaeda movement in its broadest sense.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para18">
However, on the second criterion for derogation&#151;the necessity for the measures&#151;I have been advised by the police and security authorities that they consider that the control orders that will be established by this legislation are sufficient to deal with the individuals concerned and that deprivation of liberty, although valuable, is not &quot;strictly required&quot;, in the language of the convention. They support the measures in the Bill that allow me to impose obligations up to, but not including, a
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;requirement to remain in a particular place at all times&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para19">
and the flexibility that they give me to tailor the controls imposed under any order to the threat posed by the particular individual. The security authorities tell me that at this stage they do not want to add anything to the range of controls that I am suggesting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para20">
Of course, these circumstances may change in future, and quickly. Were the current situation to worsen, we could find ourselves in a position in which it was imperative that we were able to place a particular individual or individuals under an obligation to remain in their homes at all times, or to impose some other measure that amounts, in effect, to a deprivation of their liberty within the meaning of article 5&nbsp;of the European 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 154</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>convention on human rights. The Bill will allow me to impose such an obligation on a particular individual or individuals as appropriate, provided that a designated derogation order setting out such obligations is in force.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para21">
When considering whether to derogate, my starting point will be, as now, the threat that we face. I shall look to the security authorities to advise me on that and on the measures that they think are strictly required to meet that threat. I shall also take advice on the legal and other issues that arise in relation to any proposal to derogate before making a final decision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para22">
If my decision is to derogate, I shall make the necessary designated derogation order and lay it before Parliament. As I said, the order will come into force immediately but will continue in force only if it is confirmed by a vote in both Houses within 40&nbsp;days of being made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para23">
Any derogation from article 5&nbsp;of the ECHR raises serious issues. Were we to derogate, we would need to keep the need for such a derogation under regular review. The Bill therefore provides for me to lay an order, subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, before Parliament every year after the first to the effect that it continues to be necessary to have the power to impose derogating obligations by reference to the derogation. That derogating control order would have effect beyond the first year of the derogation only while such an order was in force, so Parliament would have an opportunity annually to have its say on whether any derogation continued to be necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para24">
The Bill gives certain responsibilities to the Secretary of State. I know that some hon. Members would prefer those responsibilities to be allocated entirely to the judiciary. I have listened carefully to all that has been said on this point, both inside and outside the House, and I have sought in the Bill to address the concerns that have been expressed. However, as I said, the Government&#039;s, and my, prime responsibility is to protect the nation&#039;s security. In many ways, that is our paramount task. Decisions in this area are properly for the Executive, who are fully accountable to Parliament for their actions. However, when an individual is deprived of liberty for any length of time that is, of course, also a matter for the courts. Everyone must recognise that in the interests of security and speed an order may need to be imposed immediately, but in those exceptional cases of a clear requirement to make an order depriving an individual of his liberty, the courts must determine as soon as practicable whether the order should continue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para25">
It follows that the judiciary has a critical role to play in the process. In relation to control orders not requiring derogation, its role is to review and, when appropriate, to confirm decisions made by the Executive. For derogating control orders, its role is to decide, on the merits, whether to continue the order or to refuse to confirm it. The Bill makes full provision for that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para26">
The Bill provides for non-derogating control orders to be subject to challenge in the High Court by the person against whom the order has been made, and for the Court to apply the principles of judicial review in hearing the case. The Court will be able to consider the issues in both open and closed session, with a special advocate representing the interests of the subject of the order in closed sessions.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 155</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para27">
Derogating control orders will be subject, as befits the seriousness of the issues raised, to a different form of scrutiny by the High Court involving an automatic two-stage process. On being made, the order will have to be referred immediately to the Court for consideration within seven days at a preliminary hearing to assess whether the Home Secretary had reasonable grounds, prima facie, for making the order. Both sides will be represented. There will be open and closed sessions and the interests of the subject of the order will be represented in closed session by a special advocate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para28">
If the Court were so satisfied, the case would be automatically referred to the High Court for a full hearing at which the Court would decide for itself, on an assessment of all the material, whether the order should have been made and what conditions should have been applied. Again there will be open and closed sessions and the interests of the subject of the order will be represented in closed session by a special advocate. It will be open to the Court at both stages to strike down the Secretary of State&#039;s order or give him directions to modify it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para29">
I have published the Bill today in full confidence that it meets the situation that we face in three important respects. First, I believe that it meets the judgment of the&nbsp;Law Lords. Secondly, the Bill rightly confirms that the security of this country lies with the Government of the day, fully responsible to Parliament and the country. The Government are fully accountable to Parliament for the way in which they carry out their responsibilities, and under the Bill that accountability will be manifest, demonstrable and timely. At the same time, the process of judicial scrutiny that I propose should meet the genuine concerns that have been raised. Thirdly, the Bill will ensure that the measures that we put in place fully meet the threat that we face from terrorism, both as we see it today and as it might, despite all our best efforts and those of other countries, develop and mutate over time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-05_para30">
This is an important Bill. It raises serious and difficult issues. But we must have the capacity to protect our people now and in the future. It would be the gravest dereliction of duty to wait until we have suffered a terrorist outrage here, and then respond only after the event. I am not prepared to take a risk of that kind, and I hope the House will join me in that. On that basis, I commend the Bill to the House.
</p>

I do not underestimate the difficulty of the problem facing the Home Secretary. I accept that there are no easy answers, and as far as I am aware, nobody is saying that we should do nothing. However, I have to tell him that I believe that he has settled on the wrong answers, which will sacrifice essential and long-standing British principles of liberty and justice in a way that is unlikely materially to enhance the security of our people&#151;indeed, which may act to reduce that security.

<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 156</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para1">
The Government have been forced to this point by the decision of the House of Lords two months ago. One of the comments by Lord Hoffmann is particularly relevant:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I said that the power of detention is at present confined to foreigners and I would not like to give the impression that all that was necessary was to extend the power to United Kingdom citizens as well. In my opinion, such a power in any form is not compatible with our constitution&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para2">
But that, in effect, is what the Home Secretary is doing. Although he has qualified it&#151;properly and in response to representations&#151;with some safeguards, under these proposals, for the first time in modern British history, a politician will be able by order to restrain the liberties of a British subject. He will do that on the basis either of balance of probabilities or even of simple suspicion. He will do it for reasons, and on evidence, that may not even be known to the British subject whose liberty is lost.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para3">
A further quote from the Law Lords, this time from Lord Rodger, highlights just how extraordinary that step is:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Government&#039;s assessment is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that it is not necessary to detain the British suspects in order to contain the threat that they pose. That is implicit in the entire policy that they adopted and emerges in any event from para 36&nbsp;of the Home Office discussion paper on Counter-Terrorism Powers: Reconciling Security and Liberty in an Open Society issued in February 2004: &#039;While it would be possible to seek other powers to detain British citizens who may be involved in international terrorism it would be a very grave step. The Government believes that such draconian powers would be difficult to justify.&#039;&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para4">
It should be noted that the Home Secretary told the Home Affairs Select Committee a few weeks ago that the terrorist threat has not materially changed in the last year, so presumably that comment is still true. The Home Secretary reinforced that point today with his comment that the security services do not believe that they need the full extent of the powers in the Bill at this point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para5">
The question that has to be asked is: what is the immediate emergency that demands that draconian powers against British subjects be rushed through these Houses of Parliament without proper consideration, scrutiny or debate? What is the emergency that has arisen in the past 12&nbsp;months that demands that, without proper debate, we give the Home Secretary the right to fetter the liberty of British subjects, from restricting their ability to communicate right up to and including house arrest? The only answer is, of course, the House of Lords&#039; judgment. It is very clear from what I have quoted already that the Law Lords themselves did not envisage or encourage the proposals that the Home Secretary has put forward today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para6">
Tomorrow, we will debate the details and principles of the Bill, but I want to raise one or two material concerns today. The first and most fundamental is the fact that the decision is to be made by the Home Secretary, not a court of law. The Home Secretary said that decisions that affect national security should be for a politician, not a judge, to make. That is a remarkable, novel and hazardous doctrine. Even in the second world war, when enemy spies threatened the lives of thousands, indeed hundreds of thousands, of soldiers and civilians, they were tried by a judge and jury under normal rules of evidence.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 157</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para7">
I have heard it said today that the power is designed to allow the Home Secretary to act quickly. The Home Secretary&#039;s proposals for the strongest powers, above the derogation level, require review by a judge within seven days, yet under laws passed by the Government the police are already allowed to detain a terrorist suspect for up to 14&nbsp;days without charge. It is, therefore, possible to detain a suspect for seven days, to bring them before a judge and have the judge make the decision, without giving the Home Secretary those powers&#151;so the Home Secretary is abandoning a key principle of British justice for no obvious practical advantage. That thread runs through the proposals&#151;a willingness to abandon proven principles of British justice, with little proven advantage in addressing the security threat.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para8">
Two weeks ago, the Prime Minister apologised for the Guildford four decision. He made that apology about a decision taken in open court, with a judge and jury, with a standard of proof based on &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;, but which was still a miscarriage of justice. Conventional wisdom says that that miscarriage of justice was in part caused by the emotions in the aftermath of a terrorist outrage. What if a decision, using these powers, was taken by a Home Secretary in the aftermath of another terrorist attack? Under these proposals, a British citizen could be confined at the behest of the Home Secretary, on a balance of probabilities, on evidence never seen by the accused. What then would be the odds on a miscarriage of justice?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para9">
The Government have quite properly and laudably put into effect measures to prevent the radicalisation of some groups in our society. These proposed laws, and the sense of injustice that they could create, could completely negate those efforts, and could indeed act as a recruiting sergeant for the enemies of the state.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para10">
I reiterate: the Home Secretary does not have an easy task here and he has my sympathy in that regard, but there are better ways to achieve what he seeks. First, the House should have proper time to consider these proposals carefully. To that end, we are willing to support renewal of part 4&nbsp;of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001&nbsp;for a limited period, specifically to allow time to get this right. The Home Secretary has said that he does not think that will work, which gives rise to the question of why, earlier this month, he laid the draft order for that renewal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para11">
We are willing, for that limited period, to co-operate in primary legislation that limits the bail conditions that the Special Immigration Appeals Commission can allow, in effect guaranteeing that the control orders the Home Secretary is outlining in the Bill&#151;up to and including house arrest&#151;would apply to the remaining Belmarsh detainees until properly considered legislation came into effect. That would limit the possible injustice to a small number of people for a short and limited time, and would also give the Home Secretary the certainty he is seeking for foreign nationals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para12">
Meanwhile, I ask the Home Secretary to give proper consideration to the proposals that all Opposition parties&#151;and, indeed, members of his own party&#151;have made to him: allowing the use of intercept evidence in court, along with all the other evidence that surveillance generates; the use of an investigating judge to marshal 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 158</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and vet evidence for the court, to protect the interests both of the security services and of the defendants; the creation of new offences, to which he alluded in his statement, such as that of &quot;committing acts preparatory to terrorism&quot;, or offences based on American anti-racketeering laws that deal with the same sort of problems in that country; and practical options, such as significant increases in the resources available to the agencies for surveillance and other purposes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para13">
All those proposals, and others, will receive a constructive response from the Opposition, if they are allowed proper time for consideration. Nobody is suggesting to the Home Secretary that we should wait for a terrorist outrage, but we must consider these matters properly. If however, the Government insist on rushing these measures through, I fear that they may do the opposite of what they want. They will create a sense of injustice among many British citizens, and do what I warned when we first discussed this: for every known terrorist that the Home Secretary confines, he may create 10&nbsp;unknown terrorists, free to do harm to our people and to our nation. That would be more than a mistake; it would be a tragedy.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-06_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am afraid to say that the right hon. Gentleman has confirmed what I said at the beginning. He and his party are in the do-nothing camp&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Oh!&quot;] Do nothing, first and foremost, about the Law Lords&#039; judgment&#151;saying that nothing should be done about the 8&#150;1&nbsp;judgment indicating that the existing legislation is both disproportionate and discriminatory. If the Law Lords say that we have discriminatory and disproportionate legislation, I believe that there is an obligation on the whole House, not simply on the Government, to address that, and that is what we are doing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para14">
Secondly, on the point of substance, I indicated, and the right hon. Gentleman knows, that there are cases in which we cannot prosecute potentially extremely dangerous people, either because the material we have is inadmissible or because it cannot be used for fear of revealing and endangering sources and techniques. He knows that extremely well, but his proposition in those circumstances is explicitly to do nothing whatever about people who offer that threat. He has made it clear, as has his right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Opposition, that they do not favour control orders as a device for dealing with the threat. They do not favour addressing the question directly at all. That is why it is fair to say that the right hon. Gentleman is not addressing the threat.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para15">
Thirdly, on the judicial point, I have indicated absolutely clearly, very explicitly, substantial judicial involvement in the decisions that the Home Secretary of the day will take, including, particularly at the level of deprivation of liberty, the ability of a judge to hold a full hearing, on the balance of probabilities, rapidly to consider the Home Secretary&#039;s decision. That is not the unvarnished decision of a politician; it is the decision of a Minister of the Crown accountable to the House, subject to detailed judicial confirmation in the fullest possible way, and it should not be portrayed as anything different from that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para16">
Finally, the right hon. Gentleman proposes renewing in the other place, and later in this place, the legislation that the Law Lords have struck down as discriminatory 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 159</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and disproportionate. As he knows, the fact is that were we to seek such renewal, and even were that renewal to be agreed by the House and elsewhere, despite the fact that that flew in the face of the overwhelming judgment of the Law Lords, for all the reasons that were stated, it would be entirely possible for the individuals concerned to appeal that Act to the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg directly in that time scale. Secondly, in that situation, it would be entirely possible for SIAC, when considering the case of the individuals currently in Belmarsh, to say that the position we had taken did not allow detention in those circumstances, despite the fact that the order had been renewed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-06_para17">
If we were to accept the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s advice, we would be establishing a regime that was uncertain and unsolid, and flew in the face of the Law Lords, for a period of three, four, five or six months while the Opposition made up their mind about what they wanted to do. Even at this point, I urge them to reflect again as parliamentarians on their responsibilities to this country and to our security, and to face up to those responsibilities rather than flying away from them.

 I thank the Home Secretary for being so generous with his time and for giving us advance notice of his statement. I hope that he knows that over the past week the Liberal Democrats have genuinely tried to find a real solution for this complex issue. We acknowledge that the Government have moved some way in terms of strengthening judicial review, but the difference between us remains that the Home Secretary still considers that the judge should review his decisions, while we believe that it should be judges who take the decisions, not politicians. If the Home Secretary is prepared to let a judge overrule his decision, I do not understand why he is not prepared to let a judge take that decision in the first place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-07_para0">
Does the Home Secretary realise that if he were to apply to judges for the control orders he would, in our judgment, still be meeting his responsibilities as Home Secretary in terms of dealing with national security? Again, I ask him to reconsider his position on that issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-07_para1">
Will the Home Secretary acknowledge that his current proposals are still based on &quot;reasonable grounds&quot;? Should not we be moving towards a higher burden of proof? Proof should be &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; when it comes to removing the liberties of people in this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-07_para2">
On intercepted communications, we disagree with the Home Secretary, but he previously said that he would leave the door open on the issue. I ask him today to go further than that: will he consider re-establishing the Newton committee to make specific proposals on how intercepted evidence could be used by the end of the year?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-07_para3">
The Home Secretary suggested that a derogation will not be needed for control orders that do not involve house arrest, but is he aware of Liberty&#039;s legal advice that indicates that, in fact, a derogation would be required for any control order? What legal advice has he sought on that issue?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-07_para4">
Finally, will the Home Secretary outline what his plans are if today&#039;s proposals are rejected by both Houses? Will seek a renewal of the part 4&nbsp;powers? If so, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 160</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>will he confirm what period he would require for that renewal? These judgments are all about the balance between the principles of justice and maintaining security. The proposals that the Government have outlined today get that balance wrong and that is why we cannot support them.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-07_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Let me first say that I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the approach that the Liberal Democrats have taken in the various conversations that we have had has been constructive, broadly speaking, in contrast to that of the Conservative party. Secondly, I accept that he and his colleagues have argued throughout that a judge, not a Minister such as the Home Secretary, should take these decisions in various areas. The reason why, ultimately, I do not agree is that the principle of Ministers&#039; accountability to the House and Parliament is important, particularly in cases of national security, where the Government are charged with the responsibility of addressing those questions. However, I accept that there is a genuine difference of opinion about the way to address and deal with those questions, and I hope that he will pursue that as we consider the legislation as it goes through both Houses of Parliament. That is the right place to have exactly that discussion and conversation. We are imposing a higher burden of proof than was previously the case, both at the level below the deprivation of liberty and at the level above it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-07_para5">
I believe that the Intelligence and Security Committee will look at the intercepted evidence issues and I await with interest what it has to say on the matter, but I can tell the House that I have made my decision, although I have also said in my written statement to the House that I will keep the matter under review because, on the balance of judgment, my assessment is that to admit intercepted evidence would not assist in getting convictions. However, I am absolutely ready to keep that position under review, and, as I say, I look forward to what the Intelligence and Security Committee has to say in due course on the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-07_para6">
The legal advice that I have received is clear about the deprivation of liberty. There are always legal arguments that will proceed&#151;we will simply see how that goes, as we move forward&#151;but we are absolutely clear that there is a difference between, for example, some form of requirement to stay in a home or, for that matter, in a prison and the idea of using an electronic tag or whatever. Those are qualitatively different in nature in so far as the deprivation of liberty is concerned.
</p>

 May I bring to my right hon. Friend&#039;s attention the case of Abu Qatada, who is one of those detained in Belmarsh? I am sure that my right hon. Friend will remember that, the night before the detention powers came into effect, Abu Qatada gave the security services the slip and was on the run for some nine months before he was detained. He is widely believed to be one of the key al-Qaeda operatives in Europe. Can my right hon. Friend assure us that his new powers, if they are introduced, will be sufficient to control Abu Qatada if he is released from Belmarsh and put under the proposed regime?

<p><a name="50222-07_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 First, I will not comment on individual cases. Secondly, I can give my hon. Friend the assurance that he seeks. The advice that I have received from the security services and the police in relation to the individuals with whom we are currently concerned is that the control order regime at a level of less than the deprivation of liberty would be sufficient to secure those people, control them and prevent them from engaging in terrorist acts. I would not have made my recommendation on this matter unless there had been such a clear recommendation from the police and security services.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-07_spnew4"><b> Mr. Douglas Hogg  (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con):</b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is suggesting serious restrictions on the liberty of the subject by Executive order. In exploring the risk of a miscarriage of justice based on suspicion, will he consult his right hon. Friend the Leader of the House? He will remember that the Leader of the House was brought to trial on a robbery charge in 1975. He was almost certainly framed and, in any event, he was acquitted, but there must have been reasonable suspicion or he would not have been brought to trail. Does that not emphasise the real dangers of taking away people&#039;s liberty based on suspicion? Surely we should accord the ordinary citizen the same protection that was accorded to the Leader of the House?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-07_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 First, there is absolutely no comparison between the two cases. The fact is that we are talking in the legislation that I am introducing today about people suspected of terrorism&#151;very serious events that require a different level of action from others. Secondly, I am explicitly proposing a level of judicial confirmation of the decisions that the Home Secretary takes that simply did not arise in the case that the right hon. and learned Gentleman identified.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-07_spnew6"><b> Alan Howarth  (Newport, East) (Lab):</b> 
 My right hon. Friend will accept that Parliament has a duty to be vigilant on behalf of civil liberties, but surely we need to be hard-headed and not just romantic as we acquit ourselves of that duty. Does he accept that some of his critics ignore the fact that it is far from unprecedented for the Executive to curtail freedoms in a national emergency, that his present proposals are a great deal more limited, focused and subject to scrutiny than those of many previous Administrations, and that he cannot ignore the real threats that the nation faces, whether by allowing those who would perpetrate atrocities to go about their business or by dumping the proper responsibility as an elected Government on to the judges when he has the primary responsibility?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-07_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I very much agree with my right hon. Friend. The historical examples are legion. I was reading the other day of the decisions taken by Abraham Lincoln when he was President of the United States of America in precisely this area. He was a great fighter for liberty and he justified exactly what we are doing on the basis of the need to defend liberty. I remind all Members that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. It is that vigilance against a real and substantial terrorist threat that it is my responsibility to carry through, and I will.

<p><a name="50222-07_spnew8"><b> Mr. Kenneth Clarke  (Rushcliffe) (Con):</b> 
 First, does the Home Secretary accept that we face no greater risk today from British citizens committing terrorist acts than we did before the House of Lords judgment? Does he therefore accept that he has made no case at all to explain why he comes here seeking greater powers than any Home Secretary in modern times has had over British citizens and greater powers than were ever sought by his predecessor, his Government or any other Government in modern times? Secondly, does he not accept that there is a huge gulf in principle between the Home Secretary having the authority to deprive the citizen of his liberty and then someone seeking judicial review and going before a judge to try to satisfy the judge that a mistake has been made, and the judge having the first responsibility? Surely it is practicable to devise safe, secure procedures of a confined, enclosed kind whereby the Home Secretary can go before a judge and satisfy someone who is independent, which is more important than answerability to the majority in the House, that it is right to deprive a citizen of his liberty.

On the question of the judge, I will give the right hon. and learned Gentleman a word of clarification. I quote from the Bill that I shall introduce later today: the powers of the court on an appeal under this section include power to confirm the Secretary of State&#039;s decision,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;power to quash the order&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. power to quash one or more obligations imposed by the order&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. power to give directions to the Secretary of State for the revocation of the order or for the modification of the obligations it imposes&quot;.</p>

<a name="50222-08_para2">
My final point is that there is a gulf. It was marked on 11 September 2001&nbsp;by the attack that al-Qaeda launched on the United States. The nature of international terrorism was transformed by that act and it led to a state of affairs that leads to a real and substantial threat to this country today. That real and substantial threat includes British citizens and not only citizens abroad. It is incumbent on me certainly, and I would argue on the whole House, to address that threat as robustly and effectively as we can, with the provisions for safeguards that are very much within the legislation carried through. The Law Lords&#039; judgment is an important consideration in relation to the changes, but the fact is that the threat is evolving and constant, and it involves UK as well as non-UK citizens.

 Does my right hon. Friend accept that many of us understand the great difficulty of the decisions with which he wrestles? Will he in turn recognise that those of us with first-hand experience of dealing with secret intelligence have great difficulty in accepting that something suspected should be the basis for on which liberty is deprived? I therefore warmly welcome his saying that he does not currently require the powers of detention. That being the case, is not the obvious way forward for him to confine tomorrow&#039;s Bill to those measures that the police and security services have told him are sufficient for the

<p><a name="50222-08_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I do think that the intelligence issues to which my right hon. Friend referred initially, particularly on weapons of mass destruction and the Iraq situation, have led to concerns about the security services and the quality of their intelligence on various issues. There can be no hiding that obvious point and I have said so previously to the House and to Select Committees. That does not, however, lead me to conclude that there are no security issues or that we can pretend that there is no threat whatsoever. That is why I will publish later today the issues papers to which I referred earlier. I think that my right hon. Friend will agree that there is a real and substantial threat to this country from international terrorism and that it is necessary to address and deal with it. The correct thing to do is to put in place a legislative framework that recognises that and gives us the means to address it. That is what my proposals today are designed to do.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-08_spnew3"><b> Mr. A. J. Beith  (Berwick-upon-Tweed) (LD):</b> 
 In considering how to deal with this difficult problem, does the Home Secretary recognise that it has never been the basis of the rule of law in this country that the Executive decide and are accountable to Parliament for which individuals are locked up on the ground of criminality? That power has been imported from immigration legislation, which was the original basis of the decisions on the Belmarsh detainees. We would look very carefully at whether the Home Secretary had fulfilled his responsibility entirely if he put before a judge a recommendation on which the judge made the decision.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-08_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I recognise the role played by the right hon. Gentleman through his membership of the Intelligence and Security Committee. He has paid great attention to these issues, so I hope that he would agree that there is an issue of threat that needs to be addressed through legislation of this type. I accept, too, that accountability to Parliament is important, which is why a set of measures has been introduced indicating how that accountability will work. Finally, I accept that there is a legitimate difference of opinion, which we have discussed before, about the relative roles of the judge and the Government Minister or the Home Secretary. That is not an unreasonable, wrong or ignoble difference, and we can debate it in Parliament just as it has been debated outside Parliament. The reason for my decision and my proposal is that the Home Secretary&#039;s Executive responsibility for the security of the country is a paramount issue and should be dealt with in that way. The right hon. Gentleman disagrees, and he is entitled to do so. Let us discuss that but, in doing so, we should not move away from the critical need for legislation of this type to address and provide controls over individuals who threaten our fundamental liberties.

Understandably, he has stressed more than once today his view that his duty is to protect people in this country, but does he accept that that makes him unfit to interpret the intelligence? That job must be given to someone with independence, such as a judge, so that they can interpret intelligence and will not be attacked for doing so, as the Home Secretary would be, if there were an event.

Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) that it could be introduced on a temporary basis&#151;he could get round the difficulty that he described in relation to the European convention on human rights by prefacing it with the words &quot;notwithstanding the Human Rights Act 1998&quot;.

It stated that the legislation under which people are held is flawed in the two important respects that I outlined earlier.

Although I will support the measure that will be laid before the House for reasons that I have just given, I hope nevertheless that the judicial aspect will be reconsidered in Committee, because it is important.

 My right hon.

 My hon. Friend is entirely correct to identify the balance between the judiciary and the Executive and between security and liberty.

Bearing it in mind that these are the most draconian, far-reaching and potentially dangerous provisions put before the House in the past half-century, why do we need to rush the Bill through between now and Monday?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-09_spnew8"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The short answer is the answer that I gave to the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis). In the view of the Law Lords, the existing powers are discriminatory and not proportionate. That means, in my opinion, that if we were to continue with renewal, we would be vulnerable both as regards the individuals concerned in that case and, more profoundly, in relation to the Law Lords generally and the European Court in Strasbourg.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-09_spnew9"><b> Mr. Robert Marshall-Andrews  (Medway) (Lab):</b> 
 Prior to the opinions of the Law Lords on 18&nbsp;December, no one in Government had suggested that it was in the interests of the state or necessary to enact legislation enabling Executive detention of British subjects without trial. When did it become necessary to introduce such legislation? Was it amazingly coincidental with their lordships&#039; opinions, or had it arisen before that? If so, why were we not told about it?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-09_spnew10"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 No, the situation is as follows. On 11&nbsp;September 2001, the threat that arose was from overseas nationals&#151;the people who were involved in the attacks on that day. That is why the legislation was passed in 2001&nbsp;to deal with it. Since that period, there has been a continuing involvement of UK nationals as well in that approach, and increasingly so. Before my time in my present office, the view was taken that, before considering how to deal with that situation, we should wait and see what the Law Lords judgment would be&#151;rightly, I think&#151;because it would be ridiculous to put legislation before the House while a Law Lords judgment was outstanding. As that case was going through the courts and finally to the Law Lords, the view was taken&#151;in my opinion rightly, as I say&#151;to await the Law Lords judgment. The Law Lords then gave their judgment, as my hon. and learned Friend knows. Their judgment was that the existing situation 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 167</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>was discriminatory as between UK and non-UK citizens. That provoked the need to rectify the situation, as I seek to do today.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-09_spnew11"><b> Mr. Richard Shepherd  (Aldridge-Brownhills) (Con):</b> 
 I absolutely accept that most of us who are in the Chamber today or who are Members of Parliament have no experience of intelligence matters or the assessments that inform them, but we can question the very fear that the Home Secretary exhibits, when no other common law country such as the United States has found it necessary to take the action that he is taking today. I ask him to reflect and tell us why he rejects the views of a former shadow Home Secretary, now the Prime Minister, who said that the liberty of the subject should be taken away not by the act of a politician, but by a court of law. That, he said, was a fundamental point about liberty, and it is what we are trying to weigh here today. It is the duty of the Home Secretary to demonstrate more openly why all this is necessary.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-09_spnew12"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I accept the duty. Both in my statement to the House on 26&nbsp;January and today, I acknowledged that there is an issue&#151;an issue that the hon. Gentleman raises&#151;of the right balance in these matters. I have not said that it is an open-and-shut situation. I have argued that there is a threat from international terrorism, with which we must deal. As I indicated in my statement, I shall publish later today a further set of documentation relating to the nature of that threat, how it operates and how we seek to prevent it. I say again, and it is a very important point, that the fact that we have not had a major terrorist outrage in this country since 9/11&nbsp;is not a consequence of terrorist organisations not wishing to bring it about. In fact, they have sought to bring it about. However, our agencies have been able to prevent it, and for that we should pay tribute to their work. That guides our judgment as to what should be the legal regime to strengthen us in that regard.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-09_spnew13"><b> Mr. Michael Meacher  (Oldham, West and Royton) (Lab):</b> 
 First, we all understand the difficult situation the Home Secretary is in, but why is he so adamant that house arrest must be retained as an option when it is not used by any other Council of Europe country facing exactly the same terrorist threat as we do and when no other country has seen fit to derogate from the European convention on human rights for that reason or any other? Secondly, how can independent judicial scrutiny protect basic legal and fundamental human rights when the judge cannot reveal the secret intelligence to the suspect and therefore, crucially, cannot test the evidence that is alleged against the suspect?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-09_spnew14"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 On the latter point, my right hon. Friend&#039;s comments miss a key point: there are cases&#151;I assure him there are&#151;where there is not sufficient evidence to bring about a conviction in court, for a variety of reasons that I have listed to the House, but where the individuals concerned remain a threat to this country. It is possible to argue, as do those on the Opposition Front Bench, that we should do nothing in those cases, but it is not possible, in my view, to seek to defend the national security of the country without taking account of that. Finally, in terms of other 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 168</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>comparisons, obviously there are entirely different judicial systems in the rest of the European Union. By the way, under those judicial systems, people are locked up in detention&#151;not house arrest or anything of that kind, but in detention&#151;for years and years. That is what those countries are doing.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-09_spnew15"><b> Mr. Peter Lilley  (Hitchin and Harpenden) (Con):</b> 
 Does the Home Secretary realise that this country is reluctant to entrust a Government who went to war on the basis of unfounded suspicion with a power to lock people up on the basis of mere suspicion? Can he confirm that he is under no legal obligation to change the law, since the Law Lords found his measures not unlawful, but simply incompatible with the European convention on human rights because they were disproportionate and discriminatory? Is it not barking mad to say that the remedy for disproportionate discrimination against a minority is to extend the same measures of harsh and disproportionate loss of freedom to the whole country? Does he realise that he is creating a precedent when there is no reason or justification for it?
</p>

<p><a name="50222-10_spnew0"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 First, I do not accept that it would have been appropriate to ignore the Law Lords judgment, as the right hon. Gentleman implied. It is not a good state of affairs when the Law Lords take one position and the Executive take another. We should try to bring matters on to a proper basis. I should have thought that that commanded general support across the House. On the second point that it is necessary to make in response to the right hon. Gentleman, I do not think&#151;he will correct me if I am wrong&#151;that he would argue that the issues around weapons of mass destruction in Iraq lead to the conclusion that there is no security issue here that needs to be addressed. There are security issues. If he is saying that no security assessment can be trusted, so no action should ever be taken, I cannot imagine a less responsible position for any politician to take.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-10_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clive Soley  (Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#039;s Bush) (Lab):</b> 
 It would be churlish not to recognise the very real steps that the Home Secretary has taken to bring in a judicial process at all levels and surround the power of derogation with strict controls. However, he seems to be arguing the importance of the Executive role as justification for not letting a judge take the decision. May I remind him that, under the old prevention of terrorism Acts, the exclusion orders, which in many respects were not dissimilar to what we are doing here, were profoundly unsatisfactory? If he can find a way of putting the matter before a judge, that would be helpful. Does he plan that the legislation will fall after a certain period, such as one Parliament, after which it will be renewed in another Parliament or envisage that it will be reviewed at some unspecified future date?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-10_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 We propose a series of reviews over time. On derogation, I said that there is an annual review and not simply a review at the end of a Parliament. Perhaps I am not being clear enough. The judicial powers that I suggest for the Home Secretary&#039;s decisions in relation to deprivation of liberty are very substantial indeed. They are for a full court, and it is for a High Court judge to go through the whole case and assess on the balance of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 169</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>probabilities whether the Home Secretary&#039;s judgment was right. They will then have the power set out in the Bill to quash or modify the order if necessary, and even to direct the Secretary of State if necessary. I think that that is a very powerful situation that does not bear comparison with the historically correct point that my hon. Friend makes about the way in which prevention of terrorism legislation worked in the past.

<a name="50222-10_time0"><h5>1.31&nbsp;pm</h5>


<p><a name="50222-10_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Paul Murphy): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-10_para0">
I came to this House on 11&nbsp;January to make a statement relating to the Northern bank robbery on 20&nbsp;December. To recall the background, a highly organised and brutal gang kidnapped the families of two staff from the bank&#039;s headquarters in Belfast, threatening them with death unless the individuals co-operated in the execution of the largest robbery ever seen in these islands.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-10_para1">
Since then, a major police investigation has been under way. As the House is aware, the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland made his conclusion clear that the Provisional IRA was responsible for the robbery. The Prime Minister and I have indicated that we accept the&nbsp;Chief Constable&#039;s judgment, which is also shared by the Irish Government and their security advisers. The Chief Constable&#039;s statement, seen in the context of other subsequent events, serves to reinforce the extent of the challenge that all of us face in working towards peace and stability in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-10_para2">
Earlier this month, on 10&nbsp;February, I laid before the House a copy of a report presented to the British and Irish Governments by the Independent Monitoring Commission. That report, which the commission had elected to produce in addition to its normal twice-yearly reports to the two Governments, concluded that the Northern bank robbery was planned and undertaken by the Provisional IRA and that this organisation was also responsible for three other major robberies during the course of 2004. I am very grateful to the members of the commission for their quick response to the very grave situation created by the robbery and its attribution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-10_para3">
The IMC concluded on the basis of its own careful scrutiny that Sinn Fein must bear its share of the responsibility for these incidents. It indicated that, had the Northern Ireland Assembly been sitting, it would have recommended that the full range of measures referred to in the relevant legislation be applied to Sinn Fein, including the exclusion of its members from holding ministerial office. In the context of suspension, it recommended that I should consider exercising the powers that I have to apply financial penalties to Sinn Fein.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-10_para4">
The House will recall that following the IMC&#039;s first report in April last year, I issued a direction removing for a period of 12&nbsp;months the block financial assistance paid to Assembly parties in respect of both Sinn Fein and the Progressive Unionist party. Having reflected on the IMC&#039;s latest report, I have concluded that it would be appropriate for me to issue a further direction removing Sinn Fein&#039;s entitlement to this block financial assistance for a further 12-month period, the maximum permitted under the legislation. I am therefore minded to make a further direction to come into effect on 29&nbsp;April&#151;the day after the existing direction expires. Before reaching a final decision, however, I will take into account any representations made to me by Sinn Fein by next Tuesday. I will make a decision on whether to extend the financial penalties imposed on the PUP last April when I receive the next IMC report covering all paramilitary groups, which is expected in April.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 171</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-10_para5">
The commission&#039;s report also refers to other public money that Sinn Fein receives, although recommendations on this are outside its remit. In this context, I am conscious that hon. Members on both sides of the House have raised concerns in the past about the payment of financial allowances to the four Sinn Fein members who decline to take up their seats here. I hope that the House will welcome the opportunity to debate in the very near future a Government motion proposing that these allowances be suspended on a time scale in parallel with the arrangements at Stormont, in recognition of recent events. The debate on that motion is for another day, but I should emphasise to the House, lest anyone accuse us of denying the extent of Sinn Fein&#039;s electoral support, that the measures that we are proposing are designed to express the disapproval of all those who are committed to purely democratic politics at the actions of the Provisional IRA. All in this House recognise the degree of support for Sinn Fein, but we also believe that the actions of the republican movement are letting down everyone in Northern Ireland, including those who vote for Sinn Fein.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-10_para6">
There are those who will argue that these financial sanctions are insufficient as a signal of the Government&#039;s and Parliament&#039;s condemnation of recent events. They may well argue that I should take steps to exclude Sinn Fein from the political process or from the Assembly now. I want to deal with those arguments directly, because they are sincerely made and with a strength of feeling that I understand.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-10_para7">
The Government&#039;s ultimate goal remains the achievement of an inclusive power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland. I need not remind the House that the robbery has set back the time scale for achieving that, but the reality remains that long-term stability in Northern Ireland will not come about if we focus on exclusion. That objective requires inclusion; dialogue with Sinn Fein must continue in order to see how that long-term goal can be achieved. But I am clear that this must be inclusion on the basis of a complete and demonstrable commitment to non-violence and exclusively peaceful and democratic means, that fundamental principle of the Good Friday agreement, enshrined in the pledge of office.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-10_para8">
Had the robbery occurred while the Assembly was in operation, however, the decision about exclusion would have been very different. It is inconceivable, in my view, that members of Sinn Fein could again hold ministerial office while the issue of paramilitary activity and criminality on the part of the Provisional IRA remained unresolved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-10_para9">
The suggestion is made in some quarters that I should restore the Assembly, and then, if the Assembly itself failed to take action to exclude Sinn Fein, that I should take action myself using the powers available to me to exclude it. This would be very difficult in the absence of a clear plan that would see the parties in the Assembly come together on a cross-community basis to form a Government in Northern Ireland, but as I told the House on 11&nbsp;January, I have not ruled anything in or out as we continue to assess possible ways forward for achieving greater local political accountability. As my 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 172</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has said, if we cannot achieve a comprehensive settlement in the short term, we need to consider other ways forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-10_para10">
In the meantime, our focus will remain strongly on dealing with the underlying issue of ongoing criminal activity in all its forms. The police investigation of the Northern bank robbery is the largest undertaken by the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which is continuing to follow up every lead. This is inevitably an intensive and time-consuming process, and in parallel with this, I am taking the opportunity to ensure that our arrangements for tackling organised crime remain fit for purpose, and I have asked the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South (Mr. Pearson), the Security Minister in Northern Ireland, to review the Organised Crime Task Force to see whether and how it might be strengthened.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-10_para11">
We continue to have excellent co-operation at both a political and operational level with colleagues from the Republic of Ireland. Yesterday, I met Michael McDowell, the Republic of Ireland Justice Minister, for a regular bilateral meeting, along with the police chiefs from both jurisdictions. At that meeting, I was pleased to see the further strengthening of co-operation, when the Chief Constable and the Garda commissioner signed protocols to facilitate the movement of officers between both forces through personnel exchanges and secondments with policing powers. That development can only serve to strengthen the existing co-operation between the two police services in tackling terrorism and other crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-10_para12">
Whatever our success in tackling criminality and paramilitary activity, the fact of the matter is that the commitment to peaceful and democratic means is not one that this Government need to make. As we said in the joint declaration of April 2003:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;ongoing paramilitary activity, sectarian violence and criminality masquerading as a political cause are all corrosive of the trust and confidence that are necessary to sustain a durable political process.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-10_para13">
In the present context, it is, as the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach have both indicated, for Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA to do that. They need to step forward and tell us how they will demonstrate their full commitment to all the principles of the Good Friday agreement and how they intend to demonstrate to all the other parties in the political process, and to the people of Northern Ireland, that the kind of behaviour identified in the IMC report is in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-10_para14">
Financial penalties of the kind that I have described today may signify our strong disapproval of what has happened, but they will not of themselves rebuild the trust that is necessary if confidence is to be restored. That is a matter for the republican movement in general, and for Sinn Fein in particular.

The IMC report of 10&nbsp;December could not have been clearer. It backed the opinion of both the British and Irish Governments, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda Siochana in attributing

<br>&nbsp;<br>responsibility for the biggest bank robbery in British history and for other serious crimes to the Provisional IRA. The IMC went further:

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-11_para2">
Does the Secretary of State share that grim assessment? Does he endorse the IMC&#039;s judgment that Sinn Fein leaders were personally responsible for those crimes? Does he agree with the Republic of Ireland&#039;s Defence Minister, who said at the weekend:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We are no longer prepared to accept the farce that Sinn Fein and the IRA are separate. They are &#039;indivisible&#039;&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-11_para3">
The Secretary of State will have noted Mr. Adams&#039; remarks at the weekend, when he denied once again that republicans are involved in criminality. We know from the recent comments of Mr. Mitchel McLaughlin that the republican movement still decides for itself what constitutes a crime, in the bizarre belief that it constitutes the legitimate Government of the whole island of Ireland. Does the Secretary of State recall how republicans initially denied responsibility for the murder of Garda officer McCabe, for the abduction and murder of Mrs. Jean McConville, for the Enniskillen bombing and for a catalogue of murders and other violent crimes? In the light of that record, does he agree that we should treat Mr. Adams&#039; weekend comments with utter disbelief?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-11_para4">
We shall support the sanctions announced by the Secretary of State today. Those of us who have advocated the suspension of parliamentary allowances for some time are glad that the Government have come round to our point of view, but it should not have taken Ministers so long to acknowledge that their decision to grant those allowances was badly misjudged. There is no statutory limit on the period for which parliamentary allowances, rather than Assembly allowances, can be suspended, so why does the Secretary of State propose to restrict that period to 12&nbsp;months only? Many hon. Members, particularly, but not only, on this side of the House, have consistently taken the view that Members who refuse to take their seats and accept responsibility for representing all their constituents should not be entitled to claim the allowances that go with the discharge of those responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-11_para5">
Will the Secretary of State say whether the Government&#039;s proposals mean that Sinn Fein MPs will still be entitled to offices at the Palace of Westminster and whether Sinn Fein MPs will still be able to give House of Commons passes to their staff, even if those staff salaries have to be met from Sinn Fein&#039;s alternative sources of funding?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-11_para6">
The reality is that the inclusive, power-sharing devolution envisaged in the Belfast agreement is sadly no longer practical politics until the republican movement has clearly and permanently put an end to its involvement in crime and its paramilitary structure. Does the Secretary of State agree that direct rule is now set to last for years rather than months? Given that time scale, is it not time for the Government to end the effective veto that they appear to have given Sinn Fein 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 174</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>over any political progress and to try to move forward with those parties that are committed to exclusively democratic and peaceful politics, so the people of Northern Ireland can get a greater say over the major public services on which they rely? Last autumn at Leeds castle, the Prime Minister said that if that attempt at a comprehensive settlement failed, the Government would look for a different way forward. He made a promise, and it is time for the Government to deliver on it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-11_para7">
Finally, the Secretary of State will be aware of the Irish Justice Minister&#039;s description of Sinn Fein-IRA as a &quot;criminal conspiracy&quot;. In recent days, we have probably seen only the tip of a criminal underworld of mafia-type dimensions that threatens the rule of law in both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. I warmly welcome yesterday&#039;s announcement of enhanced co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda, and I wholeheartedly support the efforts of the Secretary of State and Justice Minister Michael McDowell to strengthen the effort by the two Governments to combat organised crime in both jurisdictions. Will the Secretary of State give the House an absolute guarantee that the police and all other agencies will have his and the entire Government&#039;s unreserved support in their efforts to root out paramilitary crime, and that there will be no holding back in that effort wherever or to whomever those investigations might lead?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-11_spnew1"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 On the final point, the hon. Gentleman can rest assured that the Government will expend all their attention and effort on making sure that we root out organised crime in Northern Ireland not only in the republican movement, but elsewhere. Yesterday&#039;s co-operation at Hillsborough is important, because it is the best example for many years of co-operation in dealing with criminality.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-11_para8">
The hon. Gentleman asked a series of questions about the political process in Northern Ireland. I am not in a position to say that direct rule will go on for years, which is not something that I want to happen&#151;far from it. The people of Northern Ireland deserve their own Government and Assembly and to run their own affairs. To that end, different political parties and others in Northern Ireland make suggestions that the Government must examine carefully. However, if there is to be local Administration&#151;whatever form it takes&#151;it cannot happen without cross-community agreement about how it occurs. That depends especially on the SDLP&#039;s position and views on the matter.

The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) mentioned the IMC and referred to the link between Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA. I have no reason to disbelieve the IMC report.

The Government believe that that is exactly the case.
</p>

<p>

The hon. Gentleman is right to raise what constitutes crime and criminality. In answer to a question that he posed at Northern Ireland questions, I believe that the idea that individual parties can define what they believe crime and criminality to be is preposterous.

The IRA and Sinn Fein thrive on victimhood and grievances. The House should not facilitate that by handing them any more.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-11_para12">
On a matter of substance, the Secretary of State may recall that in the IMC debate on 17&nbsp;September 2003, I repeatedly asked why &quot;organised crime&quot; was omitted from the list of activities that article 4&nbsp;of the draft agreement and paragraph 17&nbsp;of the joint declaration specified. I did not get an answer. I shall try again. Why have not the two Governments specifically included &quot;organised crime&quot; as one of the issues to be monitored in the legislation that set up the IMC, in the joint declaration of 2003&nbsp;or in the so-called comprehensive agreement of 2004? When the Secretary of State answers that question&#151;I hope I will get an answer this time&#151;will he speculate on the effect it might have had on recent events if the two Governments had made it clear on those three occasions that organised crime was to be targeted in the same way as other matters?

Paragraph 13&nbsp;referred to, for example, so-called punishment beatings, which are criminal activities. All add up to a collapse of trust and confidence among parties in Northern Ireland. Paragraph 17&nbsp;also refers to such activities.

<p><a name="50222-12_spnew0"><b> Lembit &#214;pik  (Montgomeryshire) (LD):</b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for early sight of his statement and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 176</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>our constructive meeting this morning. As he knows, I have become increasingly frustrated because, despite eight years of Liberal Democrat support for the peace initiative, the Government have regularly not involved us and other Opposition parties on many issues at key stages of the process. I acknowledge that he and his fellow Ministers have gone some way towards rectifying that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-12_para0">
Given the gravity of today&#039;s statement, will the Secretary of State share evidence that shows that the IRA carried out the Northern bank robbery, at least with my party leader, the right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Inverness, West (Mr. Kennedy), on Privy Council terms? I do not understand why that would not be possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-12_para1">
Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that the Irish Government, Lord Alderdice, the IMC, the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Government share the view that the IRA was responsible for the Northern bank robbery? Does he have evidence to suggest that paramilitaries, specifically the IRA, have been involved in other serious breaches of law and order in the Province, for example, by protecting the killers of Mr. Robert McCartney from justice, and that they are responsible for a catalogue of other criminal activities in previous months? If he can prove and connect those breaches with the IRA, we will consider the sanctions sympathetically. However, I personally feel sad that it has come to that, given the unquestionable contribution that Sinn Fein has made to the peace process on many occasions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-12_para2">
Will the sanctions affect only allowances? The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) also asked that question. Will Sinn Fein Members of Parliament still be entitled to use their offices? Will their staff be entitled to retain their passes?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-12_para3">
Paragraph 13&nbsp;of the joint declaration was mentioned. Does the Secretary of State regard it as the true touchstone for what is expected from the IRA and, indeed, Sinn Fein, if the sanctions are to be lifted? I emphasise that paragraph 13&nbsp;covers criminality in all its forms and is therefore a clear statement of what is expected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-12_para4">
Should not we distinguish between the lawless behaviour of republican paramilitaries and the rights and interests of the Catholic community in the north of Ireland? Does the Secretary of State agree that we must recognise that nationalism and republicanism are legitimate political viewpoints, whether one agrees with them or not? In that context, does he accept that, even with the sanctions, Liberal Democrats will try to continue to work with representatives of those communities, including Sinn Fein representatives? Will he give an assurance that, notwithstanding the sanctions, he and the Government remain committed to working with Sinn Fein and other parties in the interests of peace?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-12_spnew1"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 On the last point, I said in the statement that we intend to continue to talk to all parties in Northern Ireland. The hon. Gentleman is right to point out that nationalists and republicans have every right to express their political point of view democratically. However, it is not legitimate for paramilitary activities or criminality to be linked to such parties. That is the difference.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-12_para5">
The hon. Gentleman referred to paramilitary activity in all its forms. He will recall that, when discussions were held between parties before Christmas, criminality formed an important part of any agreement that was to have been finalised. I failed to mention that in an earlier answer.
</p>

<a name="50222-12_para6">
I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s sadness on this occasion. I feel no joy or pleasure in coming to the House to make today&#039;s statement&#151;far from it. Everybody who has been involved in the past few years in trying to bring political stability and peace to Northern Ireland will experience no joy at today&#039;s statement. However, we must accept the reality of the current position.
</p>

On sanctions, the resolution that the Government will present to the Chamber deals with Sinn Fein Members&#039; allowances. Hon. Members will have an opportunity to discuss the detail when the debate takes place on the Floor of the House soon.

 Will my right hon. Friend look at the total finances of Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA with a view to extending mainland provisions on the monitoring and control of the funding of political parties to Northern Ireland? Will he also ensure that the Assets Recovery Agency directs its attention to Sinn Fein, the Provisional IRA and various individuals? That can be done on an all-Ireland basis because the legislation on which the Assets Recovery Agency is based was taken from legislation in the Republic of Ireland.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-12_spnew3"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s point about the funding of political parties. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State is dealing with the Irish Government on that matter. Dealing with party funding generally on the whole island of Ireland, and ascertaining where their income comes from, is obviously an important issue. I take great account of the point about the Assets Recovery Agency. Part of the discussion that I had yesterday with the Justice Minister and the Garda commissioner related to how the agency in Northern Ireland could work with its counterpart in the Republic of Ireland, the Criminal Assets Bureau.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-12_spnew4"><b> Rev. Ian Paisley  (North Antrim) (DUP):</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>leaders. The law-abiding people of Northern Ireland are sick of these insults. The leaders of IRA-Sinn Fein have stepped forward, and they have lied about the things that were brought to their attention. All that they could do was to malign the people who brought the charges. The time has surely come for this Government and this House to set their own affairs in order, and to say that there is no place in a democracy for armed terrorists and their campaign of crime against the decent citizens of Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-12_para10">
The Minister of Defence in the south of Ireland has said plainly that two of the people in question are in the army council. If that is so&#151;and I believe that it is; these charges were made long ago by those of us who come from Northern Ireland&#151;this House should rid itself completely of those who are in the IRA or any other terrorist organisation. They should not have membership of this House. I trust that, when the Bill comes before the House, we shall have the opportunity to deal fully with these matters. Those people should not receive any money from the House, and they should be stripped of their privileges here. The time has come for stern, straight action to deal with this matter, and until it is dealt with, there cannot be proper, democratic rule in Northern Ireland. I am disgusted with the attitude of the Liberal Democrats here&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="50222-12_spmin0"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker  (Sylvia Heal): </b> 
 Order. I must ask the hon. Gentleman to pose a question to the Secretary of State.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-12_spnew5"><b> Rev. Ian Paisley: </b> 
 My question is: why should I not, as an Ulsterman, denounce the Liberal Democrats for apologising for IRA murderers&#151;bloody murderers?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-12_spnew6"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 I shall keep out of that one, I think. I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that I could not agree more with his first point about the ordinary people of Northern Ireland who are decent, law-abiding citizens, whether they be nationalist or Unionist. Today must be a huge disappointment to those people in Northern Ireland who have taken great strides in the development of cross-community reconciliation, both in economic and social terms. I think that the hon. Gentleman would be the first to agree that every city, town and village in Northern Ireland has great examples of development and progress that many of us would have believed impossible many years ago. What we are having to discuss today is in many ways a slap in the face for the people who are making that progress. I also agree with the hon. Gentleman that we need demonstrable evidence of change. That is where the IMC comes in. Of course, I also agree that there is no place for armed terrorists in a democracy.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-12_spnew7"><b> Mr. Eddie McGrady  (South Down) (SDLP):</b> 
 The Minister said in his statement that the Government&#039;s objective was to have an &quot;inclusive power-sharing Executive&quot; in Northern Ireland, and that the test for such inclusion was a &quot;demonstrable commitment to non-violence&quot; and non-criminality. Does this mean that the Provisional IRA, which the Government state is indistinguishable from Sinn Fein, must decommission, de-structure and decriminalise before such an Executive can be set up? That appears to have been the intention of the joint declaration of April 2003, to which the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 179</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Secretary of State has referred. Yet the Government were willing to ignore criminality as recently as up to 8&nbsp;December, in spite of the knowledge of three major robberies attributed to the IRA and of other criminal activity. Will the Secretary of State tell us whether this is a permanent change of Government policy?
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050222/debtext/50222-13.htm"/>




<p><a name="50222-13_spnew0"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 My hon. Friend will understand, because he was deeply involved in the negotiations in the run-up to the signing of the Good Friday agreement, that the idea of an inclusive Executive&#151;based, as it must be, on non-violent, peaceful and democratic means&#151;was the objective of everyone in Ireland, north and south. That is what people voted for. The problem that we now face is that decommissioning has not happened in the way in which we all thought that it should, over a period of just two years, as we agreed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-13_para0">
My hon. Friend is also right about criminality. In 1998, everyone thought that there would be a transitional period in which there would be a withering away, as it were, of criminality and all the other activities that paramilitaries get up to. However, the reality is that the robbery of the Northern bank and other activities show that it has not gone away. Unless we address that issue, the trust necessary to restore the Executive will never be there. We must therefore emphasise to the Provisional IRA&#151;and, indeed, to loyalist groups&#151;that, unless criminality is abandoned, we shall not make any progress towards the political stability that we want in Northern Ireland.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-13_spnew1"><b> Mr. David Trimble  (Upper Bann) (UUP):</b> 
 We will, of course, support the sanctions that the Secretary of State has mentioned, but I have to say to him that he could have, and should have, gone much further. Perhaps he recalls the then Minister of State, the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), saying at the Dispatch Box on behalf of the Government in September 2003&nbsp;that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;we envisage no circumstances in which we would not exercise the power&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-13_para1">
that is, the power to exclude from an Executive&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;in a manner consistent with the IMC recommendations.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 17&nbsp;September 2003; Vol. 410, c. 982.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-13_para2">
Yet all that is saving Sinn Fein from exclusion from office in an Assembly now is the Government&#039;s decision to continue suspension. I regard that as a failure to comply with that undertaking, and I urge the Secretary of State to look again at the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-13_para3">
Does the Secretary of State also realise that his failure to act on this matter reinforces the suspicion that all that the Government want to do is to let a little time pass by before they reheat the DUP-Sinn Fein deal of last December? He must realise that that will not work. It probably would not have worked then, and it certainly will not work now. It is possible to establish a cross-community Executive, but not one including the republican movement. Consequently, if he will not recall the Assembly, we are left with the only realistic course, which is to try to democratise direct rule as soon as possible.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-13_spnew2"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 On that last point, I am sure that there is a lot of opportunity for debate on what democratising direct rule would mean. The earlier point represents the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 180</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>right hon. Gentleman&#039;s view, which he has held very sincerely over the last couple of weeks in particular, that there should an end to the suspension, that the Assembly should be recalled and that an attempt should be made, having excluded Sinn Fein, to set up a cross-community Executive. If I thought that was workable, I would think there was some merit in the point, but, as he knows, there must be cross-community support on that particular issue. Obviously, work has to be done with regard to that matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-13_para4">
As I said in my statement, we are not going to rule anything out or anything in. We must not have closed minds to any particular suggestions, because, whatever happens, it seems to me, direct rule is the worst of all options. There should be an attempt to plug that democratic deficit in whatever the best way possible. We will continue to consider different options in that respect.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-13_spnew3"><b> Helen Jackson  (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab):</b> 
 May I welcome in particular the part of my right hon. Friend&#039;s statement that sets out further strengthening of the Garda in the Republic and of the Northern Ireland police, especially as this phase can be brought to an end only when the perpetrators of the Northern bank robbery, and indeed of the recent murder in west Belfast, are identified, brought to trial and put behind bars? As the evidence for who those people are almost certainly rests with the Sinn Fein political party and the republican communities, is it not time for the Taoiseach and our right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to make it absolutely clear that now, any elected representative in either state will be expected to co-operate with the police in either country to bring those criminals to justice and put them behind bars? Is it not time to insist that elected political representatives take their full responsibility within their communities and do not pick and choose, saying, &quot;We can manage to avoid co-operating with the police against criminality&quot;?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-13_spnew4"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 On co-operation, my hon. Friend is right on two counts. The first is the question of co-operation between the two police services. It has never been better, and there was evidence for that yesterday in the signing of the protocols at Hillsborough castle. The success of the different police investigations over the last few weeks is also evidence of that close co-operation. Secondly, she is of course right that everybody in Northern Ireland, whatever their political or religious background, should be co-operating with the police to find the perpetrators of murder and of robbery.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-13_spnew5"><b> Mr. Robert Walter  (North Dorset) (Con):</b>

 Will the Secretary of State confirm that the comprehensive agreement, unlike the previous dispensation under the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble), which allowed Sinn Fein to be in government while it continued its criminal enterprises and terrorist activities, required of Sinn Fein-IRA that they decommission all their weapons verifiably and transparently, that they end all criminal and paramilitary activity before ever being in government, and that there would be a testing period so that the assessment could be made as to whether that was indeed so?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-13_para7">
Does the Secretary of State stand by the man whom he said in his statement he has some admiration for&#151;the Justice Minister of the Irish Republic&#151;who clearly, with the same information at his disposal as the Secretary of State, named Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and Martin Ferris as members of the IRA army council? Does not the Secretary of State fear naming those people in those positions because of the impact that that would have on the Government&#039;s policy of inclusivity? Does he not accept that many people in Northern Ireland are somewhat embarrassed that there is more robust action from the Government of the Irish Republic than from our own Government?
</p>

 I probably have enough on my plate at the moment so far as our own Parliament is concerned, and it is obviously a matter for the European Parliament how it deals with some of those issues. That is also the case for local government. Today, we are dealing with what the House itself can deal with. If the hon. Gentleman feels that there is a possibility of raising the issues involving the European Parliament, he may have the option to do so, if the rules permit, when we debate those matters in several weeks&#039; time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-14_para0">
I agree entirely with the Justice Minister about the linkage between Sinn Fein and the IRA. I also agree with the hon. Gentleman that the agreement we were negotiating before Christmas laid great emphasis on ensuring that we dealt with the issue of criminality and that we dealt also with the testing period between the time of the agreement and when it would come into force. However, I also have to say that no Member from any party in the House would disagree with my saying that we must emphasise the fact that criminality is at the root of our problems at the moment.

<p><a name="50222-14_spnew1"><b> Mr. Tony Clarke  (Northampton, South) (Lab):</b> 
 All of us in the House wish the PSNI and the Garda Siochana every success in bringing those responsible for these terrible crimes to justice.

Friend share the legitimate concerns of those of us who worry that invoking financial penalties and making links with individuals in the House at the same time as we are talking about those crimes only adds to the press and media speculation that there was a personal involvement linking Members of the House to those crimes? Will he take this opportunity to say whether he agrees or disagrees with the statement from the Justice Minister, Michael McDowell, that Members of this House are members of an illegal organisation?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-14_spnew2"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 In terms of the penalties, because the Assembly is not up and running at the moment, effectively the only thing that we can do is deal with the allowances and the position of Sinn Fein Members of the House. That is a matter for the House to decide. I have already made my point about the linkage between Sinn Fein and the IRA, but although we have had to discuss the question of sanctions, as that is the nature of today&#039;s statement, it is important that we never lose sight of the issue that has brought about those sanctions, which is criminal activity, whether robbing banks of &#163;26.5&nbsp;million or shooting young men in our cities in Northern Ireland through their hands, ankles or knees. Any form of such activity must stop. Unless it does, as I said earlier, any sort of inclusive Executive is simply impossible. It is important to bear that point in mind.

Can he explain to the House why there has been not one arrest or interview by detectives within the PSNI or the Garda Siochana of any member of the army council of the Provisional IRA, or not one serious investigation by the Assets Recovery Agency into the illegal financing of a political party that will give it an unfair electoral advantage, in a few months&#039; time, in the Westminster and local government elections, against the rest of us who must obey the law and adhere to the rulings of the Electoral Commission in this country?

<a name="50222-15_head0"><h3 align=center>Regulation of Laser Eye Surgery</h3>

<a name="50222-15_time0"><h5>2.27&nbsp;pm</h5>


<p><a name="50222-15_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody  (Crewe and Nantwich) (Lab):</b> 
 I beg to move,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to regulate laser eye surgery.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-15_para0">
Last year, in the United Kingdom, more than 100,000&nbsp;laser eye procedures were carried out. It is important to understand that laser eye surgery, in the hands of those who are properly trained and who have proper after-care and pre-care services, is a safe procedure; indeed, it is an entirely safe procedure. It is also important to realise that the United Kingdom is ahead in such procedures and is rapidly building a reputation for high-quality surgery of this kind.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-15_para1">
Some time ago, however, the House of Commons Tea Room, which has been the venue for many important meetings, was the establishment in which my hon. Friends the Members for Stockton, North (Mr. Cook) and for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) decided at a breakfast meeting that there were some real worries in this type of surgery. They decided, sensibly, first, to call a public meeting within the precincts of the House, but secondly, to set up a series of meetings, which turned into an ad hoc committee procedure to examine closely the question of making the United Kingdom the safest place in the world to have laser eye surgery.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-15_para2">
I was lucky enough to take part in that procedure a little way down the line, but I want to pay tribute to my hon. Friends the Members for Stockton, North and for Norwich, North, both of whom initiated a campaign that was undoubtedly needed. They did so because once they had called the meetings in the House of Commons, it became clear that not only members of the profession but members of the industry and the general public were very concerned. They had particular worries about advertising practices relating to laser eye surgery, standards of safety and regulation, and training of ophthalmologists and optometrists.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-15_para3">
My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, North will forgive me if I say that because he was not terribly well at one point, he was not able to sit through all the sessions that we arranged. I am enormously grateful to the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) and to Professor John Marshall, who did a great deal of work on the report. Without them it would not have been completed, and would certainly not have achieved the quality and depth that I think we were able to produce. I think I represented the vox pop: anyone who examines the qualifications of each Committee member will see that I was the only one with neither a scientific nor a medical qualification.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-15_para4">
We took a huge amount of very interesting evidence, some of which I found a bit disturbing. It became clear that we as a Parliament, and certainly the Government, should be looking closely at an industry that is growing exponentially, not just because of improvements in laser eye surgery generally but owing to the extension and development of new machinery. The report was given a great deal of secretarial support by Carl Zeiss UK, to which I pay tribute. At no point did it seek to influence either the choice of witnesses or the content of the report, but it underwrote our activities and gave us enormous help.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 188</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-15_para5">
Our report made a number of recommendations. We said that in patient counselling, advertising, patient consent forms and training there were gaps that worried us. We said that in the context of surgeon suitability and qualifications, we feared that members of the public were not automatically receiving the protections to which they were entitled, and highlighted areas in which such problems had arisen. We also pointed out that the matter could be dealt with in a number of ways, one or two of which I will identify now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-15_para6">
There is no doubt that we need stricter guidelines regulating clinical practice. Guidelines must be monitored and policed by the Healthcare Commission. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence published a report recently, and its guidelines could set a useful standard; but sanctions must be available when clinics flout the guidelines. It is essential for each clinic to have a senior consultant with specialist knowledge, training and experience in cornea and refractive techniques. He or she must take ultimate responsibility for patients in a system similar to that currently operating in the national health service, whereby NHS doctors receiving training report to a consultant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-15_para7">
We considered it important for all surgeons in this specialty to be suitably trained to an agreed standard. We decided that the Royal College of Ophthalmologists should approve and certify a training board procedure enabling us to maintain standards of care. It is essential to have a United Kingdom-wide training programme for ophthalmologists, and the RCO should approve individual clinic and manufacturer system-based training. It was clear that not all general practitioners were sufficiently well-informed, and that GPs should be offered a chance to expand their training and information. That would help them to know which referral and other procedures should be recommended.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-15_para8">
Laser surgery, although enormously successful, is obviously not suitable for all patients. It is therefore vital for procedures for accepting suitable patients to be standardised and clarified. Only patients who meet defined criteria should be routinely treated. Safe operating parameters should be set, and the position should be made clear to patients in whose case adverse conditions and syndromes could lead to complications and increase the risks associated with laser eye surgery.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-15_para9">
Clinics must be regulated. We laid down a series of parameters within which we thought that that could be done. We felt that the Healthcare Commission should have the power and authority to enforce regulations, and that clinics or surgeons failing to comply with those standards should be removed from the RCO&#039;s refractive surgery list. Those responsibilities would stretch the existing level of training and resources, but that, we concluded, was a demand that should be met by the state. The Healthcare Commission should be responsible for annual follow-up checks for laser safety, approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-15_para10">
It became clear to us that laser eye surgery was a useful and sensible procedure when properly carried out and organised, and when in the hands of correctly trained people. It has a lot to offer the House of Commons, but it is essential, before we experience serious problems, for the House as a matter of urgency to produce a useful and protracted scheme that will defend the interests of patients and the profession. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 189</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I&nbsp;hope that Her Majesty&#039;s Government will support us in ensuring that such surgery is regulated. It is important, indeed fairly urgent, and the House of Commons should take that responsibility now.
</p>

 I beg to move,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">That the draft Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order 2005, which was laid before this House on 1st February, be approved.</p>

<p><a name="50222-16_spmin0"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker  (Sylvia Heal): </b> 
 With this we may consider the draft Guaranteed Minimum Pensions Increase Order 2005.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-16_spnew0"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I am satisfied that both orders are compatible with the European convention on human rights.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-16_para0">
The uprating order will, as usual, increase most national insurance benefits by the retail prices index amount of 3.1&nbsp;per cent. and most income-related benefits according to the Rossi index, by 1&nbsp;per cent. The guaranteed minimum pensions increase order sets out the amount by which contracted-out occupational pension schemes must increase members&#039; guaranteed minimum pensions which accrued between 1988&nbsp;and 1997. Where the annual increase in the RPI exceeds 3&nbsp;per cent., the guaranteed minimum pensions indexation requirement is capped at that level under the primary legislation. This year&#039;s order therefore provides for an increase of 3&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-16_para1">
This year&#039;s uprating adds nearly &#163;3&nbsp;billion of extra Government spending, tackling poverty by helping those most in need. Of the &#163;2.1&nbsp;billion extra for pensioners, over half a billion pounds&#151;&#163;580&nbsp;million&#151;is above-inflation spending.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-16_para2">
Since 1997, our total annual spending on financial support for children has increased by over &#163;10&nbsp;billion in real terms. That is in stark contrast to the 1980s and 1990s, when child benefit was frozen for three years and pensioners received only inflation-level increases, even as social security spending spiralled out of control.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-16_para3">
When the Conservative party was in power, unemployment twice hit 3&nbsp;million and the numbers on incapacity benefit trebled to 2.6&nbsp;million. By 1997, one in five families had no one in work and one in three children were growing up in poverty. There are now more people in jobs than ever before. Unemployment is at its lowest for 30&nbsp;years, with long-term youth unemployment 90&nbsp;per cent. lower than in 1997. We now spend &#163;5&nbsp;billion less on unemployment benefits than we did in 1997. With almost three-quarters of the working-age population in work, our employment rate is the highest of any of the G8&nbsp;countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-16_para4">
Already our new deal for lone parents has helped nearly 300,000&nbsp;lone parents into work and helped to increase their employment rate to 55.8&nbsp;per cent.&#151;a 10&nbsp;percentage point increase since 1997&#151;with 200,000&nbsp;fewer lone parents claiming income support and nearly 1&nbsp;million lone parents now in work. However, we need to do more. We know that work is the best way to lift families out of poverty and nine out of 10&nbsp;lone parents tell us that they want to work, but to enable them to do that they need to have affordable and accessible child care.

We are committed to providing over 2&nbsp;million sustainable child care places by 2010&nbsp;and a Sure Start centre in every community across England&#151;an increase from 600&nbsp;to 3,500&nbsp;over the same period.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-16_spnew1"><b> Mr. Steve Webb  (Northavon) (LD):</b> 
 As the Secretary of State will know, this afternoon is an opportunity for thinking big picture about the approach to the welfare state. He mentions child care. Governments usually say that parents should decide what is best for their children. However, he has set a 70&nbsp;per cent. target for lone parents getting back into work. What if 70&nbsp;per cent. of lone parents do not come to the answer that he wants them to come to?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-16_spnew2"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I would not say that we have set a target of 70&nbsp;per cent. What we have pointed out is that the European Union average is 70&nbsp;per cent. We have said that one part of our objective of raising the employment rate from 74.9&nbsp;per cent. to 80&nbsp;per cent. would be moving another 300,000&nbsp;lone parents into work. I really believe that lone parents, if they get the right help and support, are pleased to do that. I will have more to say later about how we intend to tackle that, without interfering with the issue of choice for lone parents.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-16_spnew3"><b> Andrew Selous  (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con):</b> 
 I was under the impression, the last time the Select Committee on Work and Pensions visited Brussels, that there was a European target of 70&nbsp;per cent. of lone parents to be in the work force, to which the Government had signed up. Can the Secretary of State elucidate on that point?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-16_spnew4"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 There are so many targets in so many places, sometimes we all get a bit confused. The Lisbon process looked to get 70&nbsp;per cent of working-age people in the European Union back to work. We achieved that some time ago. I am not aware of a specific 70&nbsp;per cent. target in the European Union. If there is such a target, it has been met, because that is the average throughout the rest of the European Union. For various reasons, we have more lone parents in this country than most other European Union countries, but I see no reason why we cannot achieve that level.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-16_spnew5"><b> Mr. David Willetts  (Havant) (Con):</b> 
 As the Secretary of State said, there are many targets but, to confirm the point that was made by the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb), I think that what we are talking about is the target in the Secretary of State&#039;s own departmental five-year plan. That is a target and that is where the 70&nbsp;per cent. appears.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-16_spnew6"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 Good, I always welcome clarification from people who read our documents very carefully&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="50222-16_spnew7"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 Has the Secretary of State read the document?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-16_spnew8"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I wrote it.
</p>

<p>

Child care is not enough on its own. Lone parents need support in looking for work and they need to know that they will get a clear financial gain from work. Building on the success of the new deal for lone parents

<br>&nbsp;<br>and work-focused interviews, the work search premium, which we are currently piloting, means that lone parents who have been on benefits for a year or more are offered an extra &#163;20&nbsp;per week for up to six months in return for agreeing actively and consistently to look for work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-16_para7">
Our in-work credit, which we are also piloting, means &#163;40&nbsp;per week for a year for those who move into work of more than 16&nbsp;hours a week. That is paid on top of any out-of- work benefits that the lone parent may be entitled to and so represents a clear financial gain from work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-16_para8">
From this April, we are pulling together all the existing support for lone parents into an integrated package. The pathways to work for lone parents pilots will run in five districts: Bradford, Dudley and Sandwell, Leicestershire, north London and south-east London. Those pilots encapsulate our approach of rights and responsibilities, guaranteeing child care support, a clear financial gain from work and the ongoing help of trained professional advisers, all in return for a responsibility to engage more intensively with our employment advisers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-16_para9">
The ongoing professional support from trained personal advisers has been key to our success in increasing the lone parent employment rate. That new single package of initiatives gives our advisers the tools that they need to offer lone parents clearer, stronger and more comprehensive support than ever before. Additionally, for those with older children who are at secondary school, we will pilot automatic payment of an activity premium, on top of all existing benefits, conditional on taking up agreed activity to help them to move into work.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-16_spnew9"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 The Secretary of State referred to the pilot in my county. Can he tell the House at what stage he would envisage it being rolled out to other parts of the country because I fully expect and hope that it will prove to be a success in the terms that he has described?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-16_spnew10"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 We do not have any plans yet on the pathways to work for lone parents beyond the introduction of the pilots. We will see how the pilots go. In terms of pathways to work for people on incapacity benefit, we already have plans to roll that out to a third of the country.

From April, child tax credit will be increased in line with the growth in earnings while the maximum eligible child care costs covered by the working tax credit will increase from &#163;135&nbsp;to &#163;175&nbsp;per week for one child, and from &#163;200&nbsp;to &#163;300&nbsp;per week for two or more children.

<p><a name="50222-17_spnew0"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 We are in close liaison with Treasury over the issue for obvious reasons&#151;it links with our joint objectives on tackling child poverty. The Treasury&#039;s view is clear. As in all tax matters, adjustments are made in the following tax year without putting a burden on individuals. Indeed, there is the opportunity to discount the overpayment if that would bring unnecessary concern to individuals. That approach is no different from how every previous Government approached such issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-17_para0">
The maximum maternity pay and child benefits for mothers at home with their first baby will have risen by &#163;5,000&nbsp;in real terms since 1997. Therefore, we are committed to supporting parents both in fulfilling their parenting role and in fulfilling their aspirations in the workplace. With our record investment in the new deal and Jobcentre Plus, we have transformed the UK labour market. There are now 2&nbsp;million more people in jobs than in 1997&nbsp;and we have seen increased employment rates for lone parents, ethnic minorities, the low skilled and people aged 50&nbsp;and over.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-17_spnew1"><b> Mr. Webb: </b> 
 The Secretary of State is being characteristically generous in giving way. He mentioned fulfilling family responsibilities and career aspirations, and a classic case would be that of a woman who wants to go back to work and thinks that a family member&#151;perhaps her sister&#151;might be the best person to look after her young child. She can pay a complete stranger to do so and get thousands of pounds from the taxpayer, but if her sister puts in substantial hours each week caring for that child, there is no state support whatever. Does he think that the right balance to strike?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-17_spnew2"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 Such matters always have to be kept under review, and some&#151;including many Labour Members&#151;hold the view that family members should be included in the scheme and given such support. That said, Members have to accept that although we have made huge progress, certain issues still need to be looked at, so that we have a fairer system and meet the goal of providing proper child care, to allow parents to return to work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-17_para1">
For the fifth successive year, we are freezing non-dependant deductions to relieve the pressure on low-income parents who are housing their adult children. As a result of our roll-out of pathways to work for incapacity benefit claimants, together with the proposed reforms that I laid before the House when we published the five-year strategy, sickness and disability need no longer mean permanent withdrawal from work. In the pathways areas, six times as many people are getting back-to-work help, and twice as many are recorded as entering jobs as in the rest of the country.

Overall, new claims for incapacity benefit are down by one third since 1997, and the employment rate for disabled people seriously challenges the old stereotypes.

We are determined to ensure that everyone has the opportunity and incentive to work. We know that work helps to lift people out of poverty and to prepare for their retirement, but it is also the best pensions policy. Through the Pensions Act 2004, we have taken steps to bolster confidence in pension saving, helping people to make informed choices about saving more and working longer. The ground-breaking Pension Protection Fund, which will operate from this April, will revolutionise the security of occupational pension saving for some 10&nbsp;million members of defined benefit schemes, and the financial assistance scheme will offer some help to those who have lost the most in the past. We are the first Government to take action to deal with the problems of thousands of pensioners who were deprived of their savings and lost their occupational pensions along with their jobs.

Although in many cases, the trustees of such schemes are not yet able to provide detailed information on the scale of individual losses, we have always wanted to make clear as early as possible the position of older workers, who have the least chance to make up the shortfall.

We were originally promised a review of the scheme&#039;s structure, but is he now saying, in the light of the commitment offered to those about to reach retirement age, that there will be a funding review after three years?

 I thank my right hon. Friend for his comments. He is absolutely right: this news has been well received throughout the country by those closest to retirement, who were extremely worried.

However, will my right hon. Friend give a little more detail on the financial review, which is indeed very good news? If it is to meet the needs of people who are a little more than three years away from retirement, it will have to start sooner than in three years&#039; time. Otherwise, there will be a time lag between their reaching retirement age and their receiving the kind of support that those affected by today&#039;s announcement will receive. Will the review at least start within that time, even if it cannot conclude within it?

Perhaps I should say a little more about the FAS scheme before moving on to other issues. It will apply to pension schemes that started wind-up from 1&nbsp;January 1997&nbsp;until April this year. That was made clear in a previous statement, but it is as well to record it here. Depending on the pension age for their particular scheme and the date that wind-up started, members getting the 80&nbsp;per cent. that we are announcing today will currently be aged anywhere between 57&nbsp;and 73, so today&#039;s announcement gives real extra security to the significant number of people who are already in, or close to, retirement, and who face the most serious situation and, often, the biggest losses. Even after applying the minimum payment rule of &#163;10&nbsp;a week, we would expect some 15,000&nbsp;scheme members to be included.

Does he agree that 15,000&nbsp;people will benefit, who would have received nothing without the financial assistance scheme?

 I agree that this is good news for people who thought that they would receive no assistance whatever from 1&nbsp;January 1997. What we are doing is in tune with many other achievements in government that had seemed to drift past, such as trawlermen&#039;s compensation. That was sought for 25&nbsp;years; the men received nothing from the Conservative Government, but we provided it. Coal miners who had vibration white finger provide another example of a case in which we awarded compensation for the first time. Still another example is the Aberfan fund. The Coal Board took money from Aberfan families to clear the tips that killed their children, and nothing was done in 18&nbsp;years, but we restored it after just three months in government. We have a good track record in dealing with these claims. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Conservative Members should know which Government provided financial assistance and compensation. Those groups received nothing but a closed door and a shake of the head from the Conservative Government.

 The Government&#039;s achievements in tackling pensioner poverty have been remarkable and laudable, but is not most pensioner poverty focused on older women? Is it not the case that more than nine out of 10&nbsp;men eventually become entitled to the full basic state pension in their own right, based on their own contributions, while fewer than one in eight women are so entitled? Would it not be a good idea to extend the full basic pension to everyone of pensionable age by extending the contribution credit system to allow for those who have had part-time or low-paid jobs, or caring and other domestic responsibilities?

 My hon. Friend is probably aware that of the 2.7&nbsp;million pensioners living in abject poverty when we came into government, two thirds were women. That is reflected in the figures on pension credit. Of 3.2&nbsp;million individuals receiving pension credit, 2.1&nbsp;million are women. My hon. Friend is right that this issue must be resolved. Various ways have been proposed to achieve that, including the patching up system that he suggests. We are determined to tackle the problem, which cannot be allowed to continue. It is a scandalous situation, and we need to look further into which proposals to adopt in order best to tackle the problem.

The guarantee credit will rise so that no single pensioner need live on less than &#163;109.45&nbsp;a week and no couple on less than &#163;167.05&nbsp;a week.

 In view of the Minister&#039;s figures on pension credit, what is his estimate of the take-up among those entitled to it in the coming financial year? One of the main problems with it is that a significant number of people do not take up their entitlement.

<p><a name="50222-18_spnew5"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I was about to make the point that the guarantee take-up rates are running at 80&nbsp;per cent., and for single women in this group, the take-up could be as high as 90&nbsp;per cent. What we have done until now is publish the take-up figures for all the different elements&#151;guarantee credit, savings credit and the combination of the two&#151;in one figure. We are all keen to ensure that the poorest pensioners receive this money to lift them out of poverty, so we are concentrating on that particular element.

 I welcome the debate and I am grateful to the Secretary of State for setting out the Government&#039;s proposals on the uprating of benefits, which we will not oppose. We always wait to see whether the Liberal Democrats decide to oppose the increase in the value of the pension, but perhaps they are not going to repeat that mistake this year&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am being urged not to provoke the Liberal Democrats to carrying out such a perverse act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-18_para6">
We welcome the extra benefits and there is added drama to today&#039;s debate. The Secretary of State has chosen to debate the pension uprating on the day that the Conservatives launch the pensioners chapter of our manifesto. Of course I realise, Madam Deputy Speaker, that it would be out of order to take the House through all the imaginative proposals in that document&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Go on.&quot;]. I am being tempted, but must resist. I would, however, like to question the Secretary of State on some of the points that he raised. As the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) rightly said, we have an opportunity to find out the strategy behind the various specific announcements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-18_para7">
It is frustrating when the Secretary of State makes grand and sometimes refreshing statements outside the House about how everything needs to be changed because matters cannot carry on as they are, yet comes before the House with a wholly conventional uprating statement in which it is difficult to detect any movement towards the necessary reform.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-18_para8">
Of the pension credit, the Secretary of State said that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;we should not talk in euphemisms. It is a means test.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 13&nbsp;October 2004; Vol. 425, c. 302.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>

He also said that it would be &quot;crazy&quot; to say that it did not act as a disincentive to some people. He has also said:

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Government still has a take-up problem on pension credit.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-18_para10">
Those reflections show that the Secretary of State realised that there was a problem with mass means-testing. The Government are taking the benefit system in that direction, so it is sad that none of those reservations could be detected in his statement today.

<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 199</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-18_para11">
New estimates for benefit take-up rates were issued recently. Does the Secretary of State agree that it is unacceptable for the rates to remain so low? The figures go only as far as 2002&#150;03, but they show a take-up range among pensioner couples for the minimum income guarantee, as it then was, of between 55&nbsp;and 70&nbsp;per cent. Does he accept that that is very low indeed? He often tells us not to worry because the poorest pensioners are claiming, but does he also accept that the figures for the eligible non-recipients are very worrying too? In 2002&#150;03, 62&nbsp;per cent. of ENRs&#151;that is, pensioners entitled to means-tested benefits but not claiming them&#151;were below the poverty line of 60&nbsp;per cent. of medium income, as set by the Government. The problem is that poor pensioners do not claim the benefits to which they are entitled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-18_para12">
In light of recent remarks by the Deputy Prime Minister, will the Secretary of State&#151;or the Minister for Pensions, when he winds up the debate&#151;comment on the extraordinarily low figures for the take-up of council tax benefit? Does he realise that one reason why pensioners in particular feel the burden of council tax so badly is that many do not claim the council tax benefit to which they are entitled? The take-up range of that benefit among pensioners is, according to the Government&#039;s latest estimates, between 56&nbsp;and 62&nbsp;per cent. That is shockingly low.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-18_para13">
For owner-occupiers, many of whom are pensioners, the council tax benefit take-up is in the range of 37&nbsp;to 42&nbsp;per cent. I should be happy to be corrected, but I believe that that is the lowest take-up rate for any known benefit. It is very poor indeed, so what are the Government going to do to improve people&#039;s access to that benefit? One reason behind our proposal for a council tax rebate is that it is clear that means-tested benefits are not getting through to many of the pensioners and others who need them. There was no fresh thinking this afternoon in respect of the problem of take-up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-18_para14">
Outside the House, the Secretary of State has also said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We have to bite the bullet and look at the state pension system, certainly for the longer term, so that if you do a lifetime&#039;s work it will deliver a pension above the basic level of means-tested support.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-18_para15">
Again, today&#039;s announcement on the uprating of benefits does nothing to achieve that strategic objective. There is a general consensus in many parts of the pensions debate that people should have a pension above the basic level of means-tested support, but nothing that the Secretary of State said today takes us any way towards that.

<a name="50222-19_para0">
I want to ask the Secretary of State about his thinking on the future of the pension system. He has made bold and radical statements outside the House, but hon. Members would be pleased to hear him say something in the House about the future, and about the possibility, for example, that a citizen&#039;s pension will be introduced. It was reported in <i>The Sunday Times</i> that he was considering ideas for a citizen&#039;s pension payable to each individual pensioner, male and female alike, on the same basis. Is that true? If so, would it be an entirely individualised system? It would also be interesting to hear what the Liberal Democrats have to say about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-19_para1">
Moreover, it would be very interesting to hear from the Secretary of State, or the Minister for Pensions, what are the Government&#039;s thoughts about a citizen&#039;s pension. A system under which every pensioner received an individualised state pension would be very expensive indeed. In a written question on 7&nbsp;September last year, the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) asked for an estimate of the cost of extending the full basic state pension to all people of pensionable age, regardless of their national insurance contributions. The Minister for Pensions replied that the gross cost in 2005&#150;06&nbsp;would be &#163;7.3&nbsp;billion, and the net cost &#163;5&nbsp;billion. He said that that would rise over five years to a gross cost of &#163;11.9&nbsp;billion and a net cost of &#163;8.1&nbsp;billion. Is that what the Secretary of State is contemplating?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-19_para2">
If the right hon. Gentleman is thinking of something slightly less expensive&#151;and we have read about a figure of &#163;3&nbsp;billion in this context&#151;does he envisage that some money could be saved by paying to couples a pension that is worth less than two individual pensions? That would mean cutting pensions for some couples. Married women who chose to pay the full rate of national insurance contributions in return for a full pension in their own right would get less money than at present. Is that what the Secretary of State proposes?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-19_para3">
I believe that a lower rate for couples has been proposed by the Pensions Policy Institute and by the Liberal Democrats.

<p><a name="50222-19_spnew5"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 The hon. Member for Northavon nods, but that proposal would mean that we would have to be very careful about the definition of a couple. In other parts of the benefits system, we are familiar with all sorts of very difficult questions that arise in connection with cohabitation and the penalties incurred when people are in a relationship. Similar questions will arise in respect of pensioners.

<a name="50222-19_para4">
The great solution presented by the citizen&#039;s pension therefore raises many practical questions. The Secretary of State has floated the idea often enough outside the House, so I was disappointed that we heard nothing more about it today. I hope that at some point the House will be able to debate the matter, and I would be grateful if the Minister for Pensions will share his thoughts with us in the wind-up. I am sure that we would all enjoy that.

<a name="50222-19_para5">
When it comes to the contributory principle, I am a Blairite. I believe that rights and responsibilities go together. People pay money into the national insurance fund and in return receive a benefit as a reward for their contributions. That seems to me an admirable principle. At the next election, the Conservative party will be the only defender of the contributory principle for pensioners, which the other two parties propose to abolish. I think that those other parties will find their position distinctly uncomfortable as a result.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-19_spnew6"><b> Mr. Webb: </b> 
 It is very good to debate the wider issues, but I want to return to my previous question. The hon. Gentleman replied that both the means test and the pension would be linked to earnings, but his grand vision is to reduce dependence on means-testing. Because the pension is smaller than the means-testing, increasing both by the same percentage would mean that the absolute gap would grow. How does he reconcile that?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-19_spnew7"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 We do not want any pensioners to worry that the uprating of their benefits under a future Conservative Government would be any lower than what the Government propose today. We want the basic state pension to increase in line with earnings, which is why I have focused on take-up. Improving take-up would help those 1.6&nbsp;million pensioners entitled to the pension credit who do not claim it. They are the people who need to be helped above all. Our policy reaches the pensioners that the other parties&#039; policies do not reach, by extending the benefit, on a universal basis, to all pensioners who have made their contributions.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-19_spnew8"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 The debate is thoroughly enjoyable and linking the pension credit and the basic state pension with earnings will avoid the arguments about floating loads of people off means-testing. However, does the hon. Gentleman accept that his commitment to raising the basic state pension in line with earnings is for only four years? It would take 14&nbsp;years to get the basic state pension to the level of the pension credit, so does that not mean that he will have to retain a version of the pension credit&#151;for which he has professed his enthusiasm this afternoon&#151;far beyond 2008?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-19_spnew9"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 We have set out our plans for increasing the basic state pension at the same rate as the increase in earnings during the lifetime of the next Parliament. Provided that we can continue to identify the necessary savings&#151;I am confident that we can&#151;we would continue to increase the basic state pension at the same rate as earnings with the aim of reducing gradually the spread of means-tested benefits. Under the Secretary of State&#039;s approach, the problem will get worse and worse. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 202</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>We would, initially, at least stop it from becoming worse and we would then want to improve the situation. We envisage continuing to identify savings to enable us to continue to increase the basic state pension at the same rate as earnings. In the manifesto produced at the end of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the first Conservative Parliament&#151;a marvellous prospect&#151;we would set out proposals to show how we would continue to fund the increase in the basic state pension at the same rate as earnings rather than prices. If the House wants to discuss that today, I would very much enjoy that debate.

<p><a name="50222-19_spnew10"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman was in confessional mode a few moments ago and confession is good for the soul, if not for opinion poll ratings and electoral prospects. Will he confess to the House that his party would abandon the state second pension and, with it, the opportunity for millions of low-paid workers, disabled people and women to build up a decent pension? Does that show a commitment to the contributory principle?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-19_spnew11"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 There is a problem with the state second pension&#151;or S2P&#151;which is not unlike the problem with the basic state pension that we are trying to tackle. If means-tested benefits are linked to earnings in the long term, it is not clear that S2P would help many people, because many would be on pension credit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-19_para6">
We do not require any savings on S2P to deliver our earnings link for the basic state pension in our first term. I have made it clear that, during our first term, we would look at the future of S2P and whether it should be at a flat rate. I should be interested to hear from Ministers what their thinking is. At one point, they said that it would become a flat rate, but they seem to have lost their nerve. We would also consider whether we can incorporate S2P into a higher basic state pension. We would like to do that, but these are technical matters and we would not need to do that to finance our increase in the basic state pension during our first term.

 Given that all parts of the United Kingdom are expected to contribute to the savings that the hon. Gentleman says he can use to create the new benefit for pensioners and, as a believer in the contributory principle, why is he limiting the new council tax benefit to England?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 Council tax is a devolved matter for Scotland and Wales. We have set out carefully costed proposals for the earnings link of the basic state pension to show how that can be delivered. It does not involve savings on S2P, taking money from an earnings-linked pension credit to put into a price-linked pension credit, or any savings affecting Wales or Scotland particularly. We announced our costings 18&nbsp;months ago and they still stand.

 I want to be clear about what savings the hon. Gentleman is talking about. Is he talking about the &#163;35&nbsp;billion of savings that the Conservatives hope to make throughout all Departments and that when they have found those savings, pensioners may receive extra, but only after all those savings have been made?

Abolition of the new deal and replacing it with something more effective is one saving. Others were also identified. The figures in our original proposal stand and are independent of the David James exercise. They do not depend on that exercise and were set out clearly when we announced our policy. I am grateful for this opportunity to make it clear that the savings never required money to be taken from an earnings-linked pension credit and putting it into some other form of benefit. I was careful not to assume that.

 Is the hon. Gentleman saying, therefore, that part of the savings that he says his party will collect and use to pay for the new council tax benefit that they are proposing only for England will generate a Barnett consequence for Scotland and Wales, which the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly can use in any way they please?

<p><a name="50222-20_spnew5"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 Council tax is a devolved matter. We strongly support the proposals that have been put forward by our Scottish and Welsh friends. We know what they want to do. The council tax is an English matter and the basic state pension is a UK matter. I am happy to make that clear.

I hope that we might hear from the Minister and the hon. Member for Northavon their thoughts on the citizen&#039;s pension. It is so easily endorsed as a marvellous solution to all our problems in the pensions system and I would very much like to have some practical answers to questions about how it would work, whether it would be a completely individualised payment, and whether it would be at a lower rate for couples. If the rate for couples is to be lower, on what basis will that be because it is not obvious how that could be done? I hope that the Minister and perhaps the hon. Member for Northavon will refer to those points during the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-20_para1">
I want to ask the Secretary of State for more information about what he said about the financial assistance scheme. We warned all along that &#163;400&nbsp;million would not be enough. The Government were lucky to get away with their announcement of &#163;400&nbsp;million when it was perfectly clear that that was completely inadequate given the scale of the crisis. That is why we supported the suggestion of the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)&#151;he is no longer in his place&#151;of using the unclaimed assets of banks properly to replenish these funds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-20_para2">
It is useful to have the Secretary of State&#039;s belated announcement of how the scheme would work, but it will be an ad hoc arrangement. In his written statement this morning, he merely set out the basis for people aged more than 62&#151;he gave a slightly wider age range in his speech. People who are not yet in the final three years before retirement now have several more years of uncertainty before they know where they stand. Does that not tell him that there is something wrong with the fundamental design of the FAS and that it would have been better to have considered properly replenishing the funds of the pension schemes involved? Why was he unable to give any indication today of his thinking about how he would help the majority of people who have already seen their pensions wound up and who are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 204</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>already concerned about their financial future? It is not acceptable to leave people who are more than three years from retirement in a state of complete uncertainty about how the FAS may or may not assist them. I hope that we shall hear some more information about that from the Minister of State.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-20_para3">
It would also be helpful to have an update on the latest estimate of the number of people affected by pension wind-ups. If the Minister can provide a list of a large number of company pension schemes that are covered, it should presumably also be possible to offer an update of the figure of 65,000, which has been around for some time. It would be useful and interesting to hear his latest assessment of the total number of people who are likely to be eligible. As the 65,000&nbsp;estimate has had to be revised, are the Government hinting at having to increase the scale of the &#163;400&nbsp;million total, too?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-20_para4">
What about the interaction between the financial assistance scheme and the Pension Protection Fund? Can the Minister tell us more about that? What would happen, for example, if a scheme wound up before April 2005? It is possible that there could still be large schemes in those circumstances. At what point does the FAS stop and the PPF take over? The Minister has caused considerable confusion on that point over the past six months, so it would be helpful to hear his comments about that.
</p>

<a name="50222-20_para5">
I hope that it will not be too outrageous if I speak briefly about the other motion&#151;on guaranteed minimum pensions, often regarded as a technical subject for nerds and anoraks&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> We will not name names. In practice, the subject affects large numbers of people who contracted out of the state earnings-related pension scheme&#151;now the S2P&#151;into a funded company pension scheme and who may find that there is not even enough money in the company pension scheme to pay the guaranteed minimum pension to which they believed they were entitled as their minimum insurance, so to speak, when they contracted out. Ministers sometimes talk as though there was no pension insurance before the PPF, but the guaranteed minimum pension is in fact a type of insurance for people who contracted out of the state system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-20_para6">
People who contracted out and whose company pension schemes are winding up are experiencing many problems in securing the basic GMP. I hope that the Minister will comment briefly on that when he winds up. He will recall that in one of our least exciting parliamentary question and answer sessions, I put a question to the Secretary of State on 9&nbsp;June 2004&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It was indeed a classic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-20_para7">
My question was about deemed buy-backs, which occur when schemes have insufficient assets to secure the guaranteed minimum pension and the Department is asked for full reinstatement of the state pension. There is a strong feeling in the industry that the process of securing the deemed buy-back is slow and cumbersome. When the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions answered me in June, he said that the Inland Revenue had received expressions of interest in deemed buy-back from 59&nbsp;schemes, 33&nbsp;schemes had formally requested calculations and eight of those had been issued with the necessary calculations. The crucial sentence in his answer was the final one. He stated:
</p>
<ul>

May we have an update on that?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-20_para9">
There are rumours that one or two real human beings have actually received a payment under the deemed buy-back arrangements. If that were happening, it would be marvellous, but the Minister owes the House a fuller explanation of how deemed buy-backs are working, as well as an explanation of the workings of the GMP. The&nbsp;guaranteed minimum pension is not delivering the security that it was supposed to deliver. Does the Minister agree that it is outrageous that the Inland Revenue issued guidance that schemes could discharge their GMP liabilities by purchasing annuities that would provide an income well below the level of the GMP? In other words, the guaranteed minimum pension has turned out to be neither a guarantee nor a minimum for people who are having to manage on much lower incomes. How can the Minister defend those arrangements?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-20_para10">
What about the idea that has appeared in the pension press that people who have contracted out will be asked whether they have taken out additional voluntary contributions and that, if they have an AVC, it will be included in the calculation of their pension income and they will only be able to buy back into the state system if, even with their AVC, they are still below the level of the GMP? Those are important questions that are at least as relevant for the victims of pension wind-ups as the scale of the FAS. They can appear technical and are easy to gloss over but, between consenting adults, we should all welcome a bit more information from the Minister today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-20_para11">
I have a few brief questions on some other aspects of the benefits system that are relevant to the uprating statement. We did not hear about the Child Support Agency. We were all fascinated to learn that the chief executive of the CSA was no longer in place. The Secretary of State gave the Select Committee on Work and Pensions the distinct impression that that was so. But the chief executive is still in place, so perhaps the Minister can tell us how the search for his successor is going? When might we see the outgoing chief executive leave the CSA and a replacement arrive? We shall be interested to hear about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-20_para12">
I hope, too, that we might hear more about the Government&#039;s views on the problem of the 1&nbsp;million-plus young people who are not studying, working or training. Although the Secretary of State always praises the new deal, if there are now more than 1.1&nbsp;million young people who are not working, studying or training&#151;a higher figure than in May 1997&#151;surely that suggests, even to those on the Government Benches, who always go out of their way to speak so complacently about the new deal, that there is a problem. Will the Minister for Pensions reflect on why even more young people are part of the lost generation&#151;neither working, nor studying, nor training&#151;than in May 1997? Is it perhaps the case that the arrival of employment zones is a recognition by the Government that the new deal is not working, and that employment zones are intended as an alternative to the new deal and pilot a rather different approach? We would greatly welcome hearing from him on that.

<p><a name="50222-21_spnew0"><b> Mr. Steve Webb  (Northavon) (LD):</b> 
 Normally, when I see this annual event coming up on the parliamentary calendar, my heart sinks somewhat. We used to have an entire day of parliamentary debate on the two orders each year, but we started to notice that the debate ran out of steam about half way through the day. I notice today that there does not appear to be a single Back-Bench Labour MP trying to speak in the entire debate, even though we are talking about &#163;100&nbsp;billion or so of public expenditure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-21_para0">
None the less, the debate provides an opportunity, as we observed earlier, to reflect on strategy for reform of the welfare state somewhat more broadly. It has already been a rather revealing afternoon in that respect. In a sense, we are contrasting the three approaches to the issue. The one thing that has emerged this afternoon from the comments made by the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) is the issue of linking the pension credit to earnings and the basic state pension to earnings. That seems to me inconsistent with the assertion that 1&nbsp;million people will be lifted off means-tested benefits. I wonder whether we can get some clarification on that at some point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-21_para1">
The motions before us are about the rate of benefits next year and therefore we must start with some discussion of adequacy in benefits. The infamous person coming from Mars to look at our deliberations would see that we were talking about a very thick volume full of different rates for different sorts of people and would assume that those rates were based on something. In fact, they appear to be based on what they used to be, plus a bit. There is no objective, external basis on which we pay certain amounts to different groups. I have heard the Minister for Pensions on the radio saying that this is something that he did not go in for in a big way. However, I wonder whether, in the quiet watches of the night, the Secretary of State might reflect on the fact that, year after year, we have been paying people on, for example, incapacity benefit increases of 70p, 80p and 50p, and their position has been falling further and further behind that of pensioners on pension credit and families with children. There must surely come a point in that process when we say not that enough is enough, but that enough is not enough. In other words, the process of just adding, in this case, a very small percentage increase to incapacity benefit leaves those benefits too small.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-21_para2">
The Secretary of State got a bit cross with me when I accused him, at the time of the uprating statement, of saying that life on incapacity benefit was comfortable. He denied saying it. I went back to <i>Hansard</i> and I found him saying precisely that. He used precisely the analogy in the newspaper report that he used in <i>Hansard</i> when responding for the first time to oral questions. It is quite clear that it is something that someone said to him: being 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 207</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>on incapacity benefit is like falling in a ditch and then one starts to get comfortable. That is precisely what he said.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-21_spnew1"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 At last we get to the origin of the quote. A representative of the Leonard Cheshire association, who is a paraplegic, said to me and several other people, &quot;The problem with incapacity benefit is that it&#039;s like fool&#039;s gold. They send you away to lie in a ditch, without offering any helping hand, and after a while, lying in the ditch, you start to feel comfortable in it and so you get used to being on benefits.&quot; If people think that that is something that I have said&#151;if they think that I said that &#163;74.15&nbsp;a week is what people can live on comfortably&#151;I am grateful for what the hon. Gentleman said just now, because I was puzzled about when I had said that. It was not me who said that; it was a paraplegic who was describing his feeling about being on incapacity benefit.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-21_spnew2"><b> Mr. Webb: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Secretary of State, but he will accept that that obviously struck a chord with him, because he has repeated it twice&#151;once in the House, and once to a newspaper. I am trying to make the point that the word &quot;comfortable&quot;, even in that context, could not possibly be applied to that standard of living. The question is therefore: how long do we continue to increase incapacity benefit? It is a poor benefit, because every year we increase it by 50p or 70p, while pensioners&#039; benefits, family tax credits and benefits for workers increase in line with earning. Childless people on national insurance benefits are therefore left further behind the majority of the population, including pensioners, working families with children and other working people. That is unsustainable in the long term. The Secretary of State has properly admitted that the pension credit is not a long-term answer, and neither is a retail prices-linked incapacity benefit when everything else is earnings-linked. That cannot continue indefinitely.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-21_spnew3"><b> Kevin Brennan: </b> 
 Should the hon. Gentleman not concentrate on the fact that 80&nbsp;per cent. of people on incapacity benefit would like to work if they could? Schemes such as the want-to-work scheme in my constituency pays people &#163;60&nbsp;a week for the first four months that they take a job, &#163;40&nbsp;for the next four months and &#163;20&nbsp;for the next four months. If they cannot hold the job down, they can go back on to incapacity benefit. If we could get those people into work we could uprate incapacity benefit for the people left on it in line with earnings or perhaps even above that.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-21_spnew4"><b> Mr. Webb: </b> 
 No one disputes the fact that large numbers of people on incapacity benefit and other disability benefits would like to work. However, every time that the issue is raised in the House, I am struck by the fact that the same number is always cited. Seven years ago, we were told that 1&nbsp;million disabled people wanted to work, and that number is still cited today. Either the Government are using old research or they have not made any progress on the agenda for seven or eight years, which is a crime. We do not want people to have to claim the benefits in the order if there is a better alternative, but too many people get stuck on them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-21_para3">
There are anomalies arising from the benefit rates, and I shall deal with two of them. First, the under-25s are in an anomalous position, as people in that age 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 208</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>group receive lower rates of means-tested benefits. That derives from an essentially Thatcherite reform which, the hon. Member for Havant will recall&#151;I do not know whether his fingerprints are all over it&#151;said that young people should live with their mums and dads. It used to be the case that householders received more money and non-householders received less, but that was changed so that people aged 25&nbsp;and over received more money and under-25s received less. Those means-tested benefits carry through into the housing benefit system, so that a 24-year-old who tries to live independently&#151;they may have been thrown out of the family home or their parents may be unable to cope with them any more&#151;receives less help with their housing than a 25-year-old. I cannot see any justification for that entirely arbitrary cut-off, which has been in existence since 1988. I accept that the Government are not going to say that they will do something about that, but that Tory creation is an anomaly. At the time, the Minister for Pensions was probably working for the Family Policy Studies Centre, and I very much doubt that he thought introducing penalties for the under-25s was a good thing. Does he think that it is a good thing now?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-21_para4">
Another problem affects single, childless people under 25. Many lone parents are single and under 25&nbsp;when they conceive. For the duration of their pregnancy they are living on the lowest benefit rate in the entire system, of just over &#163;40. That is the environment in which their child grows before it is born, and I do not accept that that good for the health or welfare of young women who are about to become mothers. There is another anomaly in the linkage of benefits for childless people to the retail prices index and the linkage of pension benefits and so on to earnings. On her 60th birthday, the income of a woman on income support nearly doubles because means-tested benefits have been linked to prices for so long that they have become devalued. Money has been put into pension credit, so there is a huge jump in the benefits available to someone at the age of 60. It is hard to find a rational basis for determining that the 59-year-old woman needs only &#163;50&nbsp;or so, whereas the 60-year-old woman needs &#163;105. There needs to be some external look at what different sorts of people with different family compositions, different disabilities and so on need to live on, as a benchmark&#151;not so that we can immediately put everyone&#039;s money up to the enhanced level, but to identify the groups who are particularly badly done by under the present structure.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-21_spnew5"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is waxing eloquent about the cliff-edge effects on benefit changes at 25&nbsp;or 65. Will he confirm that under his party&#039;s approach to pensions, the gap between the income at age 74&nbsp;and the income at 75&nbsp;will gradually get greater and greater?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-21_spnew6"><b> Mr. Webb: </b> 
 Yes, that is correct, on a transitional basis. With pensions, as the hon. Gentleman well knows, one must set a destination&#151;that is, one decent universal state pension payable to all those over state pension age, linked to earnings, sufficient to lift people clear of the means test and based on citizenship rather than on contributions. Clearly, it is implausible to get there in one go, so on a transitional basis we start with those over 75. As the hon. Gentleman says, that creates as beneficial cliff edge at 75. The difference is that I do not want that to be a permanent feature of the system, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 209</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>whereas the cliff edge at 25&nbsp;and the current gap between 59&nbsp;and 60-year-olds are both permanent features of the system. If the Secretary of State can tell me that those are transitional features that the Government will deal with and get rid of, I shall be delighted to hear it.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050222/debtext/50222-22.htm"/>




<p><a name="50222-22_spnew0"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way a second time. I understand what he is saying, but moving from 75&nbsp;to a lower age will get more and more difficult and expensive to do as the gap gets wider. Although he wants to get rid of the cliff edge, it is getting higher as every year passes because the gap between the pension between the ages of 65&nbsp;and 74&nbsp;and the pension at age 75&nbsp;upwards will surely get wider under his approach.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. Webb: </b> 
 At the same time, however, there will be growing accruals of second-tier state pension rights as well. As the hon. Gentleman suggested, the goal must be not two grotty state pensions and a failing means test on top, but one decent state pension. That must be where we head.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-22_para0">
I return to the adequacy of benefit, especially for childless people. Because the Government rightly accept that children were very important, they have a child poverty target. Although they consider pensioners important, they do not have a goal of abolishing pensioner poverty, as far as I am aware, or perhaps that is another target in the statement that none of us can remember ever reading. There is no target to abolish poverty among childless people, but surely that matters as well. What are we doing about benefit rates for childless people who are left on benefit? Clearly, if they can get into work, that is great and we will support it, but not all of them will. It would be odd to have a big debate about the rates of benefit for next year without any of us raising the question of their adequacy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-22_para1">
I shall use two words that are seldom heard in the House: social fund. People on the social fund are, in many ways, the forgotten masses. I strongly suspect that many of them do not vote and are not floating voters. I do not suppose that any of the polling that any of the parties do flags the social fund as a big issue for target voters in marginal seats. In principle, access to cheap credit ought to be a good thing, yet people have accumulated so much debt that hundreds of thousands of them are not living at the benefit rates in the orders, but below those rates, pretty much indefinitely, because they have previously paid for so-called luxuries such as a cooker or a fridge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-22_para2">
The new Secretary of State has been commendable in the extreme for his willingness to look afresh at issues, but the social fund is one of the longstanding bits of the system that nobody dares poke around at, for fear of what they might find. Should the right hon. Gentleman have the opportunity to implement his agenda in future years, I hope he will have the social fund on his &quot;to do&quot; list.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-22_para3">
The hon. Member for Havant mentioned take-up. I think I have asked the Department&#151;I can never remember whether I actually tabled these questions or whether I just meant to&#151;to place in the Library the analysis that underlies the take-up numbers for pension 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 210</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>credit that Ministers keep quoting. The Government quote the bits that sound rather good, but do not publish the whole thing. The flip side of an 80&nbsp;per cent. take-up rate for the guarantee credit and a 65&nbsp;to 70&nbsp;per cent. rate for the whole thing must be a take-up rate for the savings credit of 50-something percent., I imagine. I fear that I cannot remember what the Minister may have said about this issue, but will he confirm that the Department will place the whole analysis in the Library, and not just give us bits that suit the Government&#039;s argument? In the spirit of openness&#151;he has been good in dealing with my freedom of information requests&#151;I hope that the Government will place those details in the Library.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-22_para4">
Tax credits were mentioned. The Secretary of State will be well aware that the only families in this country who do not get tax credits are poor families. The intention is to move children on income support over to the tax credits system. That system has now been running for two years, however, and we still do not know&#151;we did not hear it today&#151;why children on income support are getting the current rates of benefits and not moving over to the tax credits system, so that when the parents move into work, there is no disruption or change to the structure of their financial support. Is the tax credits system still such a shambles that we dare not risk including poor families? Is that really the state of play that we have reached? Why are children in poor families not yet on tax credits and when will they be?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-22_para5">
The financial assistance scheme has also been mentioned. The Minister for Pensions responded to a debate only this morning about the APW pensions scheme, and he confirmed that people who work for solvent employers will be excluded from the financial assistance scheme. He said that the door was still open, but gave no indication of an intention to include the workers with solvent employers. I asked him a question in that debate: where there is a parent company, can the regulator go back to the employer and chase them for the underpaid money? Although he finished his speech four minutes before he had to do so, because he had run out of things to say, he did not answer that question. It is not very often that we get two goes in one day at trying to get a question answered. Can the regulator go back to the parent company of a firm such as APW and say, &quot;You&#039;ve got to fill the gap to make up these pensions&quot;? If the regulator cannot do that, the workers will have no redress bar deemed buy-back. Clearly, that is not fair in relative terms with regard to other people covered by the financial assistance scheme.

<p>
<a name="50222-22_para6">
On the citizens pension, I welcome the fact that I keep reading in the Sunday papers about the Government&#039;s intention to follow the Liberal Democrats&#039; lead. We have been speaking about the position of women pensioners&#151;I have certainly been doing so, and I know that my colleagues have been&#151;over a long period. I am delighted by the Secretary of State&#039;s view that plugging the gaps in the contribution system is not the answer, because there are so many gaps and such an approach would make things even more complicated. The end result of plugging all the gaps is the number that one first thought of, or in other words, paying the full pension in the first place.

The hon. Member for Havant rightly pointed out that there are both cheap and expensive ways of dealing with the matter. As a transitional arrangement, we have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 211</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>proposed that the full rate would apply to a single person and that a 160&nbsp;per cent. rate would effectively apply to a couple. We have also proposed that where two members of a couple would already have more than 160&nbsp;per cent. between them, there would need to be a transitional protection to ensure that there are no cash losers. We have costed that into our policy costings.

On the earnings link, it was interesting to hear the Secretary of State confirm that the pension credit will be linked to earnings to 2008. I presume that that is the public expenditure planning horizon, but it is not the end of the Parliament. Will the Minister confirm whether he intends to link the pension credit to earnings throughout the next Parliament or whether the guarantee applies only for the first couple of years of that Parliament, after which there might be a change in policy?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-22_para9">
One of the things that strikes me most about the position of pensioners is that, while the Government boast that 80&nbsp;per cent. of those entitled to the guarantee credit are taking it up&#151;that was the figure that was used&#151;that means that 20&nbsp;per cent. are not doing so. Who are those people? They are the poorest pensioners in the land, by definition. When the Government managed to get 80&nbsp;per cent. of the poorest pensioners in the land to claim their means-tested benefits, they issued a triumphant press release. I think that that is a cause for shame. If 20&nbsp;per cent. of the poorest pensioners in the land, who are all drawing state pensions and could be lifted out of poverty in a guaranteed way by decent payments, are simply not claiming the complex means-tested benefits, those people are living in poverty. I strongly suspect&#151;I wonder whether the Department has commissioned any research on this matter&#151;that they may be a strong link between those people and the excess winter deaths that we shamefully see every winter in this country. The numbers fluctuate, but the very fact that excess winter deaths occur at all is a source of shame at the start of this new century. I strongly suspect that a link exists between the very poor, very elderly and very vulnerable pensioners who fail to claim those means-tested benefits and those who die from the cold in the winter.

 Earlier in my career, I researched hypothermia, and there is nothing about which I feel more strongly. Will the hon. Gentleman accept that many over-80s get a &#163;300&nbsp;winter fuel payment under this Labour Government?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-22_spnew2"><b> Mr. Webb: </b> 
 Indeed. The winter fuel payment is &#163;6&nbsp;a week, so elderly people who have a full basic pension and who fail to take up the pension credit are missing out on &#163;25&nbsp;a week, which means that the gap is &#163;19. The Minister looks puzzled: the basic state pension is about &#163;80&nbsp;a week this year; the means-tested benefit is &#163;105; and the gap is &#163;25. If elderly people do not take up the pension credit, they miss out on &#163;25, but the Minister has just told me that that is okay because they get &#163;6.

<br>&nbsp;<br>development of the subject. This is my 23rd uprating debate&#151;I may have missed one, so it might be my 22nd uprating debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-23_para3">
I know that the Secretary of State has got simplification in his sights because he said so at his last helpful appearance before the Select Committee on Work and Pensions. He gave us some comfort by saying that the Department is considering the matter, which is an easy but fundamental point to make.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-23_para4">
I have considered some of the information and communications technology processes that the Government and the Department have in prospect as part of the Gershon review, which I support in principle. The Gershon report is not all about job cuts; it also considers the more efficient use of technology to deliver public services. If we do not fundamentally simplify the current panoply of benefits and start from first principles, we cannot harness the power of computer technology to develop more efficient public services. The pensions transformation programme is a good example of that because it has the potential to improve services, and I hope that it will. However, a system that was more easily computerised could generate savings, which could be put into improving benefits. That would be beneficial to everyone.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-23_para5">
Simplification is therefore necessary not simply for its own sake but to make anything of the potential of future IT provision. I hope that the Secretary of State will keep that in mind in his five-year plan and start considering annually the simplifications he can make in the uprating statement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-23_para6">
I acknowledge that a huge amount has been done. My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon rightly said that the campaigns against child poverty and pensioner poverty clearly show results. I accept that they have not all appeared in the statistics yet because there is a time lag, but much has been done, which is welcome. However, parts of the system cause concern. My hon. Friend mentioned working age adults without dependant children. They have been left behind and are in danger of being stigmatised in the provision of benefits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-23_para7">
According to my arithmetic, jobseeker&#039;s allowance has increased by only &#163;7.75&nbsp;a week since 1997. The increase for adults on income support and JSA is only 55p a week. I have participated in such debates for 22&nbsp;years and that is the smallest rise that I have ever known for claimants in that category. If I am right, we need to tackle the matter urgently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-23_para8">
Broad inequality must also be addressed. The work of John Hills and his unit at the London School of Economics shows that, although poverty has been effectively and rightly targeted, we need to deal with the inequality that is beginning to emerge. It happens because people in the upper deciles of income storm ahead. People may say, &quot;That&#039;s fine. So they should. Good luck to them.&quot; However, it creates tensions in the system because people see others getting access to life chances that they do not have. I believe that frustration about that can drive them to all sorts of untoward activity, including criminality and the informal economy. In some cases, it can lead to mental illness. Some figures suggest that the inequalities for some 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 214</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>categories of claimants are getting worse. When the Secretary of State examines the uprating figures, year on year, he should consider the big picture of worsening inequality. He needs to think carefully about the way in which he can deal with that in future statements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-23_para9">
My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon asked for the basis on which the figures were presented. I have discussed the matter with Pensions Ministers over many years and in various circumstances. Many of our sister European nations effectively use modest but adequate budget standards to consider what is needed to provide a sensible income.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-23_para10">
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine recently produced a report that found that adults needed a minimum of &#163;91&nbsp;a week on which to live. That is almost twice the level of income support available to the family cited. That is the measure of the adequacy, or inadequacy, of the current level of benefits&#151;welcome though the increases may be. I am not saying that we should immediately move to using modest but adequate budget standards automatically. It would be difficult, and impossibly expensive, to do that all at once, but we should make more use of minimum income standard methods of determining what is necessary for a family budget. We have looked carefully at the benefits that the Government are using to measure child poverty in regard to the targets for the period from 2010&nbsp;to 2020, and they are better than they might have been. However, a proper assessed budgetary standard for child income would have been a more useful tool for measuring the Government&#039;s progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-23_para11">
The Government have a story to tell on incapacity benefit and on pathways to work, and I support all that, but it is disappointing that it will take until 2008&nbsp;to get that system rolled out across the whole of the United&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kingdom. The work done by the New Policy Institute in December 2004, which was funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, clearly showed that economically active people who want paid work but who are not officially unemployed are a big client group, and present a big problem. It is a matter of concern that we are not going to have a UK-wide system to deal with that until 2008.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-23_para12">
Although the policy of having an active labour market is right, and has been successfully operated over the past few years, it ignores the fact that the quality of jobs at the lower end of the employment market cannot provide the necessary long-term stability and adequate life chances for families on lower incomes. The Government should look carefully at the statistics that show that people who go into low-paid jobs often rotate through them in a relatively short time in a way that does not help them much. They still suffer poverty, and they are still in difficulties. It is therefore not safe to assume that the problem is fixed simply by getting people into work. Given the statistics on this large section of the community, it is demonstrably not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-23_para13">
I concur entirely with the point made by the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) about the lost generation of 1&nbsp;million young adults. The number of people with poor or no educational qualifications is an issue. I accept that it is not technically a benefit matter, but it plays into the new deal and some of the other issues that we are looking at this afternoon.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-23_para14">
I am worried that some of the wider indicators show that, although the benefit system has improved, it is still not adequate for the purpose. The problem of low birth weights, which the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) used to bang on about in earlier times, is getting worse. It is a matter of real concern that the problem is being exacerbated in families on low incomes, and we are storing up problems for the future in that regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-23_para15">
The number of households in temporary homelessness is a huge issue. We really need to look at the structure of the benefits involved, including some of those dealt with in the uprating statement. In fact, it is time that we started looking at the Rossi index again. People&#039;s housing benefit is being restricted for a variety of reasons, including rent restrictions, which we all know about. The costs of housing have increased substantially, and increasing means-tested benefits by 1&nbsp;per cent. using the Rossi formula might have been a safe thing to do five or 10&nbsp;years ago, but we need to reconsider whether anything better can be done to protect people who have real problems struggling to meet their housing costs. That need is reinforced by the fact that there is only a 50&nbsp;per cent. take-up of council tax benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-23_para16">
There is evidence to show that low income, bad diet, low birth weight, homelessness and temporary housing all lead to an exacerbation of mental illness. That is not a direct social security responsibility, but there is evidence that things are getting worse, which we cannot ignore.

Some capital limits in the order have been in place since time immemorial&#151;indeed, some of them came in with the 1986&nbsp;legislation, which I remember&#151;but it makes no sense to leave capital limits to languish to such an extent. They need to be re-evaluated and uprated in some way, even if only occasionally and not annually.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-23_para18">
A couple of Members raised the issue of tax credits and I have three questions to ask because I am very worried. The hon. Member for Havant alluded to the problems relating to the recovery of overpaid tax credits. This is a serious matter that impacts on the benefits uprating order, because some people on low incomes are not getting their full entitlement as overpayments are being clawed back at an unconscionable rate. I wonder whether the Department knows how many income support claimants are on a reduced income due to recovery of overpaid tax credits. That would be an important and interesting figure to know.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-23_para19">
I also do not believe that ordinary people on the high streets of the towns of Great Britain know that the Inland Revenue has the discretion to write off overpayments. I do not think anybody tells them that.

 It is not used very often.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-24_spnew1"><b> Sir Archy Kirkwood: </b> 
 Indeed, the Inland Revenue does not use that discretion very often, even when it is pointed out. I draw the Secretary of State&#039;s attention to the fact that, in evidence to the Select Committee, his predecessor gave us an undertaking to examine the situation relating to data on tax credit overpayments as soon as they became available&#151;they will be soon&#151;to ensure that people are not being landed in severe hardship as a result of that clawback.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-24_spnew2"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way because I agree with him about tax credits. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 216</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>There are clear examples of people who know that they have been overpaid tax credits, but who, as a result of receiving cash through overpayment, find themselves taken out of housing benefit. They then find it very difficult to get back on to the benefit. There are people who try to set money aside because they fear money has been overpaid, but that takes them over the capital limits. So, there are several interactions between tax credits and the benefits system. Ministers tend to wash their hands of this and say, &quot;That&#039;s a disaster of the Inland Revenue&#039;s making,&quot; but it affects people&#039;s entitlement to welfare benefits and it is causing genuine distress.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-24_spnew3"><b> Sir Archy Kirkwood: </b> 
 Not for the first time, the hon. Gentleman makes the point more eloquently than me. I concur with all that. It is becoming an increasing problem&#151;it is not going away and it is not a glitch related to the introduction of a given proposal. Indeed, the evidence available to me suggests that the problem is not getting better at all. If anything, it is getting worse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-24_para0">
I have two other quick questions. As my hon. Friend&nbsp;the Member for Northavon said, the migration of income support and income-based jobseeker&#039;s allowance cases on to child tax credit is also a considerable concern. There are 900,000&nbsp;families to transfer. A few moments ago, we said that from our experience the tax credit system is shambolic, so there is a genuine worry about when those people will be transferred. The Government&#039;s position, I understand, is that the date still remains uncertain, but it certainly will not be in 2004&#150;05&nbsp;and we have yet to receive an exact timetable showing when in 2005&#150;06&nbsp;the transfer will begin. When that transfer begins, the one thing that must be absolutely guaranteed is that there will be no delays or any other administrative problems, because those families are among those with the lowest income in the land. The House would welcome assurances on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-24_para1">
Finally on tax credits, the Public Accounts Committee got an undertaking from the Inland Revenue that once some of the data started to become clearer, there would be a case for reviewing the tax credits scheme. I hope that the Department is alive to that inquiry and that it will encourage and support it, because I detect in all parts of the House evidence of concern about tax credits and how they have been delivered recently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-24_para2">
I recognise that a huge amount has been done to improve the incomes of many households across the United Kingdom over the last few years, but a lot more work remains to be done. If we do not make sure that we can provide adequate life chances for a whole section of society, we will end up driving people into criminality, as I said earlier, and driving people into the grey economy and not paying taxes. Worse than that, we will disrupt families, producing mental illness and marriage break-up, the consequences of which the taxpayer ends up paying for. It is money well spent to have proper, adequate benefits that are fit for the purpose and set at appropriate levels on which people can live. The Government still have some work to do before they achieve that.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Benchers are making speeches in the debate this afternoon. I am in a charitable mood, however, and I will pick up on the Select Committee Chairman&#039;s comments that this is becoming such a complex area that it is one in which many Members fear to tread, as they feel that they will not be as knowledgeable as they should be or have all the facts at their fingertips that they feel they should have.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-24_para3">
A more important point lies behind that, as the people who take up these benefits&#151;our poorest and most vulnerable constituents&#151;are not well able to navigate the minefield of regulation and rules that surrounds many of these benefits. On a cross-party basis, we should try to simplify much of the social security system so that it is more easily understood. If we do so, we will see higher take-up. Along with simplicity, we need computer systems that are reliable, that work and that get benefit through to recipients in a timely and correct manner. Whether in relation to the Child Support Agency or the tax credit computers, there have been too many instances in which the technology has let down some of our most vulnerable constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-24_para4">
I was also interested that the issue of income adequacy was touched on briefly, and I commend the two Members who raised the subject. We need to examine that for people who will be out of the labour force through no fault of their own for long periods. We need to be honest and transparent with our constituents about how we will pay for that, and perhaps identify some parts of current Government expenditure that we want to slim down to make moves in that direction. Collectively, we need to turn our attention to that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-24_para5">
We are covering a wide variety of social security and pension issues this afternoon, and I will inevitably repeat some of the points already made. First, on the pensions side, we understand the Government&#039;s arguments about why they felt compelled to introduce the pension credit. A wide consensus now exists among people from many different parts of the political spectrum, however, that that has not been the most sensible way to go. We know that 1.63&nbsp;million pensioners are not taking up pension credit, which results in many constituents being &#163;25&nbsp;a week less well-off than they would be otherwise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-24_para6">
We are also aware of the disincentive effect of pension credit. Even the Prime Minister said on 8&nbsp;February to the Liaison Committee:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;You obviously don&#039;t want a situation where the majority of people are on means-tested pensions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-24_para7">
I wonder whether he is aware of the fact that nearly half of all pensioners are on means-tested pensions. My hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) said that he was a Blairite on some matters relating to pensions. In this case, the Prime Minister is clearly a Conservative. He has recognised what we have been saying for quite some time, so I think we can trade a bit of party-political allegiance in today&#039;s debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-24_para8">
The new deal is still the subject of heated debate between the parties. We have said that we will get rid of both the new deal for young people and the new deal 25-plus.

As guardians of the public purse, responsible for helping some of the most vulnerable members of society, we should be looking for value for money and ensuring that we have the most efficient policies and systems possible.

The question is, &quot;Is the new deal the most efficient and effective way of doing that?&quot; On the evidence that I have given, which has not been disputed either by the hon. Gentleman or by Ministers, I do not think it is. I think we should be grown up enough to admit that although parts of the system work well, those two parts are clearly not working well.

I entirely agree with what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Havant and the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Sir Archy Kirkwood). Two Fridays ago, a young lady who came to my constituency surgery told me that having applied for various tax credits and returned to work, she faced such a large repayment of money paid to her that she was close to throwing in the towel and leaving the labour force altogether. She is so cross that she has asked me to refer her case to the parliamentary ombudsman. She is not alone: there are many like her. The Government ought to consider an amnesty for those who, through no fault of their own&#151;I do not think there was any fraudulent intention&#151;have been asked to repay large sums.

<br>&nbsp;<br>rehabilitation support allowance. Clearly, the name &quot;incapacity benefit&quot; has the wrong connotations. What the Government are planning to do to get people into work is excellent. However, the numbers keep rising. We must comment on the fact that in August 2004&nbsp;there were 140,000&nbsp;more people on incapacity benefit. The latest figure is 2,403,000&#151;that is 140,000&nbsp;higher than when the Government came to power.

 I am interested in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s analysis of incapacity benefit and welcome his support for our proposals. Given the figure that he has just mentioned, what would be his explanation of why, under the previous Government, the number of people on incapacity benefit rose threefold?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-25_spnew1"><b> Andrew Selous: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will realise that the United Kingdom economy has been through a period of great transition over the past 15&nbsp;to 20&nbsp;years. Certain restructuring needed to take place. It would have taken place under a Labour Government had one been in power at the time. I do not know whether he is suggesting that some of the industries of that time should be carrying on with large state subsidies. Necessary transformations took place. They would have taken place whichever party was in power. If he is fair in his assessment of recent economic history, he will probably agree.

I come back to economic activity and to the intervention from the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones). We know from labour market statistics released only last week, on 16&nbsp;February, by the Office for National Statistics that 1,126,000&nbsp;of our young people aged between 16&nbsp;and 24&nbsp;were not in work, not studying and not training in December 2004. That figure is 44,000&nbsp;higher than when the Government took office. In the trade, they are known as NEETs&#151;not in employment, education or training.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-25_para1">
I wonder what all those people do. I wonder where they are. I have to think quite hard of the type of families that those 1,126,000&nbsp;young people are in. What is their situation? That is a fantastic waste of potential for the UK labour force. We need to make a much greater effort to get those young people into employment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-25_para2">
The Government say that we need migration. It is clear that we do in certain parts of the economy but we need to look to our own resource within this country and to get those young people into the public service jobs that we need and into areas where there are skills shortages. We should make a far greater effort to do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-25_para3">
The hon. Member for North Durham talked about unemployment. I come on to that willingly. We need to remember that we are in the 13th year of growth, which was set on a good curve in 1992. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the record, he will find that, between 1993&nbsp;and 1997, when we were in power, unemployment fell by 908,000. There was a 31&nbsp;per cent. fall. Between 1997&nbsp;and 2004, it fell by 607,000. That is a 30&nbsp;per cent. fall. Therefore, there was a 31&nbsp;per cent. fall under us and a 30&nbsp;per cent. fall in slightly more than seven years under this Government. He will see that the curve has carried on and that our record stands up well. We are obviously delighted that all those people have jobs but, as I said, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 220</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>those statistics speak for themselves and they are based on the back of 13&nbsp;years of growth, established originally under a Conservative Government.

<p><a name="50222-25_spnew2"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones: </b> 
 I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has recognised the good job that the Labour Government are doing in getting people back into work, but the fact is that the last Conservative Government wrecked my constituency by throwing people on to the dole, and used incapacity benefit to massage the figures and to write off a generation of people who were still economically active. Will he now admit that the last Tory Government used incapacity benefit in the cruellest way in constituencies such as mine, which led to many people thinking that they had no future in employment at all?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-25_spnew3"><b> Andrew Selous: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is keen to trawl through recent economic history, but as I said in response to an earlier intervention, I suspect that, whichever party had been in power, it would have been necessary to take difficult decisions about restructuring across the economy. Those were indeed difficult decisions, and I am aware that they hugely and painfully affected many people&#039;s lives.

 I have given way to the hon. Gentleman twice, and if he will allow me I will wind up my remarks. For the record, I repeat that there was a fall in unemployment of 908,000&#151;some 31&nbsp;per cent.&#151;between 1993&nbsp;and 1997. I am of course delighted that it has continued to fall, but it has done so from the firm base established under a Conservative Government, with growth starting in 1992.

 I am delighted to be able to take part in this debate, although I am saddened that it has not attracted the depth and width of interest that it might have done among Members. It is of particular concern that not a single Government Back Bencher has thought it necessary to make a proper speech on uprating; their constituents will wonder where they were this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-25_para4">
The social security bill is growing. The Prime Minister said at his party&#039;s 1996&nbsp;conference that that would not happen under a Labour Government, but the opposite has proved the case. There is growing means-testing throughout the entire social security world, and the related expenditure is often self-defeating. As my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) made clear, we will not vote against the uprating, although it remains to be seen whether the Liberal Democrats will, as it has been their habit to do so. However, it is a concern that so few Labour Members have felt it necessary to take part in this debate.

<a name="50222-25_para5">
I want to touch on several matters that have been raised. This has, rightly, been a wide-ranging debate, and those of us who have taken the trouble to be present throughout have covered a galaxy of different issues.

<a name="50222-25_para6">
As is often the case, the Government have produced a high-flown ambition: they want to abolish child poverty. However, they are setting about achieving that, in part, by changing the target. They want to exclude housing costs, which appears to lift about 1&nbsp;million children out of poverty simply at the stroke of a pen. As Conservatives, we believe that the conventional way&#151;focusing on those below 60&nbsp;per cent. of median income&#151;should be maintained, and that the Government are wrong to move the goalposts in the middle of trying to implement their high-flown policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-25_para7">
There has already been some discussion about the myriad failings of the Child Support Agency. In my other role as a member of the Work and Pensions Committee, I have had the pleasure&#151;if that is the right word&#151;of hearing evidence about IT and managerial failings from a series of people, including the Secretary of State, his predecessor and, of course, the much-discussed Mr. Doug Smith, whom I believe is still the CSA chief executive. We know that of the 478,000&nbsp;applications to the new scheme since April 2003, only 61,000&nbsp;non-resident parents had made a first payment. We also know that there has been a 30&nbsp;per cent. increase in the number of complaints to the independent case examiner since 2003. Behind that figure, there must also be many people who have simply given up altogether. There must be many who have given up trying to contact the CSA by telephone, who have given up trying to get any sense out of the person to whom they are talking&#151;if they do manage to get someone on the other end of the telephone&#151;and who have certainly not gone as far as contacting the independent case examiner. When Mr. Smith gave evidence to my Committee, he said that the Child Support Agency had an aspiration to deal with these matters in an average time&#151;between first contact with the parent with care through to having payment arrangements in place&#151;of six weeks. At the time he gave that evidence, it turned out that in the real world, the average was somewhere between 15&nbsp;and 22&nbsp;weeks. I am not aware how long it takes at the moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-25_para8">
The annual report and accounts for the CSA showed an outstanding debt of &#163;720&nbsp;million in March 2004, with a further &#163;947&nbsp;million classified as uncollectable. My Committee had a lot to say about that, but I shall not go into all the details on this occasion. We had much to say about the failings of enforcement and&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am talking about the Select Committee on which I have the honour of serving under the distinguished chairmanship of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Sir Archy Kirkwood). Peebles used to be somewhere in that constituency name, but it seems to have got lost in the wash.

<p>
<a name="50222-25_para9">
I am not just talking about figures, or beating up high-flown officials within the CSA for their apparent ineptitude, as the fact remains that the CSA has failed to collect &#163;750&nbsp;million owed to some of the poorest families in Britain.

When the Secretary of State came before the Select Committee side by side with Mr. Doug Smith, the body language was fascinating to watch.

 I would like to acquaint my hon. Friend with my constituency case of Mrs. Little, who tried for months to get the Child Support Agency to take some notice of her claim for her four children. When eventually the CSA took notice of it, it wrote back to apologise for the fact that the computer had broken down. She was told that her claim would have to be dealt with manually and it would be another 20&nbsp;weeks before she would receive any money at all. Does my hon. Friend regard that as acceptable?

<a name="50222-26_para0">
Let us return to the chief executive and the Secretary of State giving evidence to my Committee about the overall performance of the CSA. In his usual skilful fashion, the Secretary of State tried to draw the fire away from the chief executive and himself by announcing at the beginning of the evidence that Mr. Doug Smith would be leaving the CSA&#151;to spend more time with his family or some such reason. That was on 17&nbsp;November 2004. The transcript was read to me by several BBC journalists, and I accept that no one said expressly that Mr. Smith would be leaving quite soon, but I must admit to being pretty surprised to find that he is still in post, apparently barricaded in his office at the CSA and saying, &quot;I&#039;m not coming out.&quot;
</p>





<p><a name="50222-26_spnew2"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I distinctly remember the hon. Gentleman being present at the meeting, so perhaps he will recall my saying that the current chief executive would be handing over the reins to the new chief executive, which suggests that the new chief executive has to be appointed before the old chief executive moves on.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-26_spnew3"><b> Mr. Waterson: </b> 
 I am certainly not suggesting that the Secretary of State was trying to mislead anyone, but I was left with the distinct impression that it would not be a lengthy process and that Mr. Smith had had enough, that the CSA had had enough, that its clients had had enough, and that the Secretary of State had certainly had enough. I leave aside any speculation as to what useful tips Mr. Smith might be able to pass on to his successor in handing over the reins. As I understand it, there has not exactly been a queue of qualified applicants for this particular job, but I express my surprise that Mr. Smith is still there, rather than facing new challenges in another job.

I turn to the debacle of the overpayment of tax credits. As my hon. Friend the Member for Havant noted, many hon. Members encounter this matter at their constituency surgeries, and in correspondence. People with delicate family budgets face real hardship as a result of this problem. What is being said to people about their overpayments? That question was asked earlier by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. How many claimants of income support or income-based jobseeker&#039;s allowance are on reduced incomes as a result of the recovery of overpayments? If the Minister does not have the figures to hand, I should be grateful if he would write to us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-26_para2">
What steps are being taken to ensure that income support claimants know that the Inland Revenue has the discretion not to recover overpayment in cases of hardship?

I do not want to repeat the arguments that have already been made about incapacity benefit, but as my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) said, some elements in the Government&#039;s proposals&#151;such as those to take away some of the stigma associated with the title of the benefit&#151;are to be welcomed. However, the number of people on incapacity benefit has risen significantly under this Government. The present proposals apply only to new claimants, and contain nothing that affects the 2.7&nbsp;million existing claimants.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-26_para4">
Will the Minister confirm that in 1997, 47&nbsp;per cent. of people claiming incapacity benefit were unemployed, and that that figure has risen to 60&nbsp;per cent.? Will he also confirm that the number of people leaving incapacity benefit has fallen, and that as a result, the number of claimants has risen by 140,000&nbsp;since May 1997?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-26_para5">
I now turn to questions arising from the new incapacity benefit system. It was stated earlier that under the new system, severely sick or disabled people would receive more money. However, the rates for the new benefit have not been set yet. What evidence will be used in deciding the rates paid under the new regime that will replace incapacity benefit? What assurances can the Minister for Pensions give that sick and disabled people will not lose income under the new scheme? Will the Department set expenditure targets for the new rehabilitation support allowance and the disability and sickness allowance? How long does he envisage that it would take claimants on rehabilitation support allowance to move beyond the basic rate, which is paid at JSA levels, and reach the higher levels equivalent to long-term incapacity benefit?

The separate issue of economic inactivity is one of those dialogues of the deaf, which we seem to have regularly in the Chamber, between Ministers who are happy to crow and issue press releases about the headline level of unemployment, but are reticent in talking about the large number of people in this country who do not find their way into those statistics because

<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 224</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>they are economically inactive. The crying shame, as my hon. Friends have said, is that more than 1.1&nbsp;million young people are neither working, studying nor training. When will the Government have a proper thought-out strategy to deal with that lost generation, which is apparently doing nothing and is not included in the unemployment figures?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-26_para7">
While I am on the subject of employment and unemployment, it is worth quoting what <i>Labour Market Trends</i> concluded this month:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;while unemployment levels have generally been increasing over the past four years, the rate of increase has been no more than in line with population growth, leaving the trend in the employment rate largely flat since 2000, following stronger growth through much of the 1990s&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-26_para8">
That is the context in which all employment and unemployment issues should be considered. The Government do not have some great success story; they are simply talking the credit for a trend that has been flat since 2000, and is based on the successes of the 1990s.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-26_para9">
On pensions, the quote given by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire bears repetition. The Prime Minister told the Liaison Committee recently:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;you obviously don&#039;t want a situation where the majority of people are on means-tested pensions&quot;.</p>
</ul>

<p>
<a name="50222-26_para10">
Presumably on planet Blair, they are not. However, we know that at least half of pensioners are on means-tested benefits and that the proportion is destined to rise inexorably under this Government&#039;s policies, subject to one issue to which I shall return.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-26_para11">
We know that the latest figures show that one in five of the poorest pensioners are not claiming the means-tested assistance to which they are entitled. During the past three months, only about 30,000&nbsp;new people have signed up for the pension credit. Despite all the bally-hoo, all the advertising&#151;which I see regularly in my local paper in Eastbourne&#151;and all the efforts of the Pension Service, which is doing an excellent job in my area, the application rate is tailing off. As Gordon Lishman of Age Concern said recently:

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Around a third of pensioners who are eligible for pension credit are still not receiving it.&quot;</p>

 Obviously, in view of my party&#039;s recent announcement and the Government&#039;s equally recent announcement, that figure will have to be changed, but that does not mean that it will be zero.

Will it be one year, five years, 10&nbsp;years or 20&nbsp;years?

On take-up, it is clear that pensioners are missing out on almost &#163;3&nbsp;billion-worth of benefits. Some charities have described that as unforgivable. About 2&nbsp;million pensioners, about half those eligible, fail to claim a total of &#163;870&nbsp;million in council tax benefit. No one tried to disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Havant when he said that council tax benefit had the lowest take-up of any means-tested benefit in the system. There is a particular problem because take-up is so low among owner-occupiers. We are all familiar with such people. There are many in my constituency&#151; elderly people who own their homes, but do not have much cash or many savings. That is why our party concluded that the only way to deal with that problem, especially in the light of the 70&nbsp;per cent. average rise in council tax bills since 1997&#151;it is more like 87&nbsp;per cent. in my constituency, with a little help from the Liberal Democrats on occasion&#151;is an age discount, to halve bills in households with members aged 65&nbsp;or over, up to a &#163;500&nbsp;maximum.

Finally, I turn to the FAS, as the Government call it, or &quot;farce&quot; as some of us prefer to pronounce it&#151;the financial assistance scheme and the protection of people&#039;s pensions. This is really part 2&nbsp;of a debate on the APW scheme&#151;an unfortunate state of affairs&#151;that we began in Westminster Hall this morning. Is it not typical that, although at that stage we had not seen today&#039;s written statement on the FAS, it emerged in the Minister&#039;s winding-up speech that although there are, I think, 380&nbsp;schemes listed in the statement today, APW is not one of them? Why not? Because that is classed as a solvent wind-up. We are talking about people who, as I understand it, have lost 80&nbsp;per cent. of their pension rights through absolutely no fault of their own.

<a name="50222-27_para7">
As my hon. Friend the Member for Havant was saying, this seems to be an exercise in ad hocery. The original announcement in May last year happened in a rush because the Government were facing defeat in the House over the Pensions Bill. We have had various announcements over the intervening months, which have slowly dragged out of the Government precisely how they think the FAS would work. A lot has changed in that time. The Government have quite properly commissioned research, which came up with a figure of 65,000&nbsp;people. Other high-profile schemes, such as APW and Turner and Newell, have hit the news, and I am sure there have been many others, less well publicised. Only one thing has remained unchanged and unchangeable: the amount originally set for the FAS itself, which was &#163;20&nbsp;million over 20&nbsp;years&#151;a total of &#163;400&nbsp;million.

<p>
<a name="50222-27_para9">
One thing that we do agree with the Government about is that the taxpayer cannot be regarded as a bottomless pit, to keep contributing money to compensate people for losing their pensions. At the same time we recognise that those people have a clear moral and perhaps even legal case to be compensated. That is why we revert again to our policy on the use of unclaimed assets&#151;the &#163;15&nbsp;billion of unclaimed assets reliably estimated to exist in this country. Ireland began by simply taking the interest on those unclaimed assets. Of course, we would require various safeguards as part of our policy to ensure fairness. The Treasury is already well advanced on that process, but for different reasons. The Chancellor wants to get his hands on unclaimed assets to use them for charitable purposes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-27_para10">
Yet again, we plead with Ministers not to set their face against the use of unclaimed assets, but finally to agree to consider them as a possible source of compensation for those people. As I said, only this morning we heard about APW and the very sad situation that those people find themselves in. One thing that I can confidently predict is that they will not be the last. The Government have constantly been trying to catch up with events, rather than sitting down at the very beginning and working out a scheme that will be enduring, successful and achieve the objects required of it.

I do not want the House or the massed ranks of my colleagues to think that I am going soft on the Liberal Democrats, as I may speak slightly differently about the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb). The Government faced a strategic challenge, as too many British citizens were born poor, had an impoverished and diminished childhood&#151;often, but not always, in fragile families. As a result, they achieved little at school and ended up with poor educational attainments. Some, but not all, of those children were at risk from evils in our society, and when they left school, sometimes before 16, they did not take up education, employment or training. That is a problem&#151;it may not be as sizeable as some have said, but that is not the point. The Connexions service in England and the learning and skills councils were established in part to tackle such issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-28_para1">
As a result of those diminished childhoods, too many of our citizens end up without work or with poor job opportunities. They often have poor skills and are on low pay. That cycle ends with many people becoming impoverished in old age and receiving poor pension entitlements. The challenge for those of us interested in a modern welfare state is a traditional one&#151;how do we break the cycle of poverty and deprivation and try to move towards a cycle of achievement and opportunity for all our citizens? We have not entirely met that challenge, which still faces us, but we have made progress. I am proud of our record on children and the fact that total spending on financial support for children has gone up by over &#163;10&nbsp;billion in real terms since 1997. I am proud of the fact that, since 1997, families with children will on average be &#163;1,300&nbsp;a year better off, while the poorest fifth will on average be &#163;3,000&nbsp;a year better off. It is notable that, in December 2004, nearly 20&nbsp;million people, including 10&nbsp;million children, benefited from the new tax credits. I accept that there have been problems with tax credits, but many people have benefited from them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-28_para2">
I noted carefully, as did the Secretary of State, the issues surrounding the overpayment of tax credits. The Department is not responsible for that, but we share concern about it. I shall investigate the adverse impact and interaction with other benefits that have been mentioned, as well as issues about capital that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) raised. I accept that we need to look at that.
</p>

<a name="50222-28_para3">
The child trust fund will make a meaningful difference to the savings environment in future generations by promoting positive attitudes towards savings. This is not an occasion to debate the Child Support Agency, but my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has read carefully the excellent report from the Select Committee, to which we will respond in weeks. We are not happy with the performance of the CSA. Those children need support from both parents, wherever possible. We must make progress and we intend to do so. I have mentioned some of what we are doing for children. I cannot deal with the subject holistically as that would mean speaking more about education.
</p>

<a name="50222-28_para4">
As regards people of working age, we are again proud of our record. Unemployment is at a 30-year low. The number of people in work is up by 2&nbsp;million since 1997. There are more than 28.5&nbsp;million people in work, the highest number ever. Compared with the G8&nbsp;or the

I do not know whether my Secretary of State has visited Iceland&#151;I refer to the country, not the superstore&#151;but our ambition now is an employment rate of 80&nbsp;per cent.

Opportunities for people with disabilities will be greatly increased by the measures in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. That is very relevant to our employment ambitions. By focusing on what people can do rather than on what they cannot do, we are determined to help the many who are currently on incapacity benefit and want to return to work to do so. We are doing that through our pathways to work and new deal programmes. I was pleased to hear the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire comment favourably on aspects of our policy in this regard. It is a challenge for all of us to recognise that, although there is much discussion of the appropriate retirement age, too many of our citizens are effectively retired in their 50s, rather than their 60s.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-28_spnew2"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 The Minister referred to the Government&#039;s target of 80&nbsp;per cent. employment in the document which, we discovered today, the Secretary of State wrote. Will he explain to the House how that target was reached? Will he confirm that it is an extrapolation of a long-established trend?

</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-28_para6">
The new deal has been a tremendous success, with more than 1.2&nbsp;million people helped into work through that programme. Sadly, Opposition Members want to scrap that policy. Since 1997, long-term youth unemployment has fallen by two fifths. The new deal for young people has helped more than half a million young people into jobs. We are engaged in making work possible, making work pay through tax credits and the minimum wage, and making work skilled. That is the challenge for us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-28_para7">
Over the long term, the more successful we are in our policies for children and people in work, the more successful we will be in overcoming pensioner poverty. As the Secretary of State said, the best pension policy of all is a job. For the current group of pensioners, the pension credit is a success. It now reaches 3.2&nbsp;million people and, as has been noted, two thirds of those people are women, partly because they live longer, partly because they do not have full national insurance contribution records&#151;hence the important debate about the future of state pensions&#151;and because in their careers many men have been nowhere near a decent works or occupational pension. The Opposition parties criticise us for using pension credit because it is means-tested. As we have said before, in the short to medium term, it plays a vital role in tackling pensioner poverty. Since 1997, our policies have lifted 1.8&nbsp;million 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 230</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>pensioners out of absolute poverty. Now, through pension credit, 2.4&nbsp;million people in almost 2&nbsp;million households are receiving more money than before.

As a result of the measures that we have introduced since 1997, an extra &#163;10&nbsp;billion will be spent on pensioners in 2005&#150;06. Almost half that extra spending&#151;about &#163;5&nbsp;billion&#151;is going to the poorest third of pensioners. As we have said, we think that 80&nbsp;per cent. of those entitled to the guarantee level are claiming, and 90&nbsp;per cent. of the poorest women are doing so. Many people are &#163;36&nbsp;a week or more better off as a result of our policies.

 On the state second pension&#151;I often feel that we do not talk enough about this&#151;we believe that designing a policy that helps low earners means that 5.8&nbsp;million people are now building up a state second pension.

The shadow Secretary of State, whom we wish a long career in that role, is very interested in deemed buy-back, which was a feature of our warm-up debate in Westminster Hall, which had a slightly larger crowd than we have now at some stages, on the APW case. We have spoken about the issue, and although I am a master of detail, it may be that there are some other things about which I could write to him. We think that 800&nbsp;individuals have so far been offered deemed buy-back. We think that only eight individuals have so far taken up the offer. The majority of the rest are still considering their position. I am taking a good deal of interest in the matter so that we can facilitate movement in this area.

The shadow Secretary of State also asked me about the total numbers that we had unearthed, to put it rather badly, in our research exercise on the financial assistance scheme. The list that we published today indicates that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 231</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>there are at least 380&nbsp;defined benefit pension schemes whose members should potentially be eligible for financial assistance. There are about 70,000&nbsp;non-pensioner members in the schemes. The figure is therefore more or less consistent with the estimate that we published last June, suggesting that there were about 85,000&nbsp;non-pensioner members in affected schemes, about 65,000&nbsp;of whom were facing significant losses. It looks like our early estimates were broadly correct.

I have talked about today&#039;s pensioners, but in terms of today&#039;s work force and tomorrow&#039;s pensioners, the Pensions Act 2004&nbsp;is of enormous significance. The new regulator will have sharper teeth than the old regulatory framework, which is a significant development. The Pension Protection Fund is a landmark reform offering security and helping to build confidence for some 10&nbsp;million pension scheme members in defined benefit or what are sometimes known as final salary schemes. That is a major new part of our welfare state architecture, and one day we will look back with some pride on legislating for it.

Meanwhile, as we know, for groups of workers already in very debilitating circumstances who could not be helped by the PPF because it was not yet there, we have the financial assistance scheme, which has excited considerable interest today. The scheme is important. We will provide those people who are around pension age&#151;some of them are coming up to it and some of them have already passed it&#151;with a core pension entitlement of some 80&nbsp;per cent. I hope that that meets my pledge to this House that the help for those groups would be &quot;significant&quot; or &quot;substantial&quot;. I hope that we have kept our word, and I am sure that we have. The possibility of reviewing the finances in the short to medium term is a further step in building confidence.

Even when we say, with some pride but no complacency, that we are pleased that 80&nbsp;per cent. of the poorest pensioners now get pension credit, the response is, &quot;It&#039;s only 80&nbsp;per cent. What about the 20&nbsp;per cent.?&quot; Hon.

I shall be brief, and I hope that we can achieve consensus on this issue. We want to ensure that we guarantee the three hours of debate on the Drugs Bill. There was extensive discussion in our six sittings in Committee, including a very long discussion on the reclassification of cannabis. That was also voted on in Committee. The programme motion allows us three hours of debate on the Bill. It also allows us to deal with the most important issues in an appropriate order.

<p>
<a name="50222-29_para9">
A number of the issues raised in Committee gave me pause for thought, and I have tried to capture our response in the Government amendments, to show that we have been listening to the concerns that were raised. I hope that Opposition Members will agree that that is what we have achieved.

I would like to apologise to Opposition Members for the late arrival today of a letter that was based on issues raised in Committee. I want to offer my unreserved apology for that, and I hope that it will not happen again in my ministerial career, however short or long that might be.

<p><a name="50222-30_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan  (Chesham and Amersham) (Con):</b> 
 The Minister has just said that she wants to dispose of this motion quickly because she wants to guarantee three hours of debate on the Bill. If that is what she wanted, it would have been quite simple not to have tabled this programme motion at all. So I do not agree with her basic premise, and it would be quite remiss of me to pass up this opportunity without making some further comments. I note that the Minister has apologised unreservedly on a particular matter, and I shall refer to that matter in the course of my remarks on the programme motion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-30_para0">
I believe that it was only yesterday evening that the official Opposition discovered the details of the programme motion that is on today&#039;s Order Paper. The motion limits the entire Report stage and Third Reading of the Bill to a mere three hours. If I have read it correctly, it provides 45&nbsp;minutes for this debate on the programme motion. The Report stage can take up to two hours from the time this debate started at 5.25, and there will be an hour thereafter for our Third Reading debate. It is interesting to see that the Government have protected the Third Reading debate, because on another Bill recently, they completely failed to do so. They have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 236</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>obviously learned from their mistakes. I had to weigh up whether to debate this motion, thereby using up part of that precious time, and I decided that the time allotted was so meagre that I ought to make this protest, and to put on record the views of the Opposition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-30_para1">
There is no doubt that the programming device is the subject of a great deal of controversy. It is neither an equal nor a fair process, and it certainly enables the Government to impose a timetable irrespective of the&nbsp;views of the Opposition. That is, of course, if the Opposition have had an opportunity to put their views.

The report on the programming of legislation was published in July 2004. It was the product of the Procedure Committee, of which I was a member many years ago and which does sterling work.

 I have support in the Chamber, and I am pleased to see the Chairman of the Procedure Committee, my hon.

I am also pleased to see other Members who have been members of the Procedure Committee from time to time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-30_para3">
Page 3&nbsp;of the report carries the summary and a recommendation from the Committee, which says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We recommend that programming motions should be decided without debate only when there is cross-party support; on other occasions the Government would, if necessary, have to justify such a motion in a one-hour debate.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-30_para4">
That recommendation has been completely flouted, because we have only 45&nbsp;minutes in which to pursue the matter of this programme motion. The report continues:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;In exchange, we would expect parties to adopt a constructive approach to programming.&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-30_para5">
It is fair to say that during consideration of the Bill&#151;the Minister can intervene if she disagrees&#151;the Government received good co-operation from the Opposition. We have attempted to improve hastily drafted and inadequate legislation.

 From a sedentary position, the Government Whip says, &quot;No,&quot; but there was absolutely no problem with the programming other than when he got a bit hot under the collar when we appeared to be debating at length matters that needed closer examination.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-30_para6">
We have tried at every stage to improve on hastily drafted and inadequate legislation. Indeed, so hastily drafted was it that the Minister herself accepted Opposition amendments&#151;as drafted and in principle, as shown by the Government amendments on the amendment paper today&#151;but at no stage was such extreme timetabling in the closing stages ever discussed. In fact, the opposite impression was given: if more time was required it would be given, although that is clearly not the case, as we see today.

 My hon. Friend makes a timely intervention to highlight a pattern that is repeated by the Government on so many occasions that they are too numerous to mention. I shall refer to that later. We did not complete the scrutiny of the Bill and today&#039;s debate will be truncated by the Government&#039;s programme motion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-30_para8">
At the beginning of the debate on the programme motion, the Minister apologised. She did so because she has not been entirely fair and square with the Opposition on the Bill&#039;s passage. I need to ask her why I received her office&#039;s e-mail at 11.41&nbsp;this morning. The e-mail says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I attach a copy of the letter to Cheryl which was signed in Caroline&#039;s absence regarding the Drugs Bill. It has been brought to my attention that due to an administration error it is possible that you did not receive this letter last week. It is vital that this is drawn to Cheryl&#039;s attention before Third Reading this afternoon.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-30_para9">
Well, that is an extraordinary letter to get from a Minister&#039;s office on the day of Report and Third Reading. Attached to it was an undated seven-page letter from the Minister, signed in her absence, which purports to deal with the issues raised in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-30_para10">
First, sending out that letter at the last minute is discourteous at the very least. Secondly, it would appear to be a way to avoid further debate, substantiated not least by the truncated timetable motion today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-30_para11">
I refer once again to the admirable work of the Procedure Committee:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;For report stage and third reading, we recommend that the Government should table its amendments in good time and that the House should be provided with a factual statement of which clauses and schedules were not considered in committee because of the operation of the programme; and we believe that the House will usually want to spend most of the time available on report stage rather than third reading.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-30_para12">
Well, the amendments were not tabled in good time. In fact, I am not sure when they were tabled, but I was notified of them yesterday morning. E-mails were sent to my office last Thursday, which were inaccessible by me as Parliament was in recess and the parliamentary data and video network was down until Monday morning. Therefore the first notification that I received of those amendments was first thing on Monday morning. Given 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 238</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that those amendments were tabled so late in the day, and that the letter to which I referred was sent at the last minute, it is not possible to table further amendments on Report. Were I to wish to do so, the timetable motion would now prevent any possibility of their discussion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-30_para13">
Matters arise from both the last-minute letter and the amendments tabled by the Government that need exploring. Let me give as an example those relating to clause 5. I had asked about the implications of the costs of the proposed X-rays and scans, and about whether they are paid for by the police or the national health service, which we know is very pressed at the moment. The Minister&#039;s responses in her letter deal with issues in relation to medical emergencies when people are arrested, but still do not deal specifically with situations envisaged in clause 5&nbsp;in which a police officer decides that there is a reason to X-ray or scan an individual. How were we to know that the answers would be inadequate, as the information only arrived just before midday today?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-30_para14">
The timetable motion might also prevent us from reaching one of the most important amendments for which we would wish to argue&#151;the proposed reclassification of cannabis in new clause 1. The Minister referred to that specifically in her opening speech on the programme motion debate. She was pleased that we voted on it in Committee&#151;well, we voted on it, but we did not have an extensive debate. If she would like to refer to the <i>Official Report</i> of the Committee, she will see that there was a short, rushed debate, right at the end of the Committee. It was only because I stood up and asked how I could have a vote on the new clause that we managed to get one in right at the tail end of the Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-30_para15">
We believe that the Government have made a grave mistake in reclassifying cannabis as a class C drug. Our concern has been that the reclassification will be a green light to young people, which is indeed the case. If young people are more likely to try cannabis, they are more likely to become involved in the drug sub-culture. We will reclassify cannabis back to class B, and would wish to have more time to deploy those arguments and discuss them with the Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-30_para16">
This timetable inhibits debate on a subject which should be of great importance to every parent throughout the country. We know of its great importance, because although the Minister did not have time to answer questions posed properly during Committee several weeks ago until nearly midday today, she did, however, have time to send out a press release about the success of Operation Crackdown at 9.54&nbsp;this morning. We therefore have a situation in which the Minister can do her press and publicity about Operation Crackdown, but she cannot be bothered to get the letter to the Opposition about points raised in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-30_para17">
I am pleased by the results that the police are achieving in tackling class A drugs, although I must admit that, on the basis of the statistics I have, I am not sure that they were worth a press release. I understand from the press release that 17&nbsp;kg of heroin were captured by the police in the first four weeks of Operation Crackdown, but having looked at the statistics I discovered that in 1999&#151;

<p><a name="50222-31_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I agree, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The fact is, however, that the Minister is able to get press releases out and not leave time for them to be discussed, and was not capable of producing from her office&#151;throughout the recess&#151;the information that she had promised in Committee. I know she is sorry, I know she has apologised and I accept that apology, but it is still absolutely appalling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-31_para0">
Let me end by returning to the Procedure Committee&#039;s excellent report, which made certain recommendations. For the sake of the Minister and those who support her, I should say that page 21&nbsp;needs to be read carefully. At paragraph 13&#151;unlucky for some&#151;the Committee said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We recommend that the Government should table its amendments for report stage in good time.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-31_para1">
At paragraph 15, it said:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We believe that the House will usually want to spend most of the time available considering amendments on report, rather than debating third reading at length.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-31_para2">
We are left with a programme motion that ensures that the Third Reading debate will be longer than the debate on Report, which is directly contrary to the Committee&#039;s recommendations. That does not surprise me, however. Only yesterday, the remaining stages of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill did not complete their course here. The Prevention of Terrorism Bill is to be rushed through in two days, and because of a programme motion part 2&nbsp;of the Civil Contingencies Bill was not discussed at all, although it involved serious constitutional issues. What hope have we for the Drugs Bill, which deals with a matter that is so important to families and communities up and down the land?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-31_para3">
This is a pattern with the current Government, who wish to stifle debate and, dare I say it?, diminish the standing and powers of Parliament. No doubt the Drugs Bill will be added to the wonderful table in the Committee&#039;s report, table A on page Ev5. It gives a long catalogue of Bills in the 2002&#150;03&nbsp;Session parts of which were never reached and never discussed in the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-31_para4">
I invite my hon. Friends, and anyone else who cares to join me in the Lobby, to vote against the motion as a matter of principle. Once again the Government have been discourteous to the Opposition, have shown that they are not organised or competent, and have sought to stifle debate about something on which I believe Conservative policies are winning hearts and minds throughout the country. I think people believe that the Government have failed to act successfully on drugs.

We had ample time to explore the issues in Committee, and the Government deserve credit for that. As the hon.

For the entire proceedings on Report to be given at most two hours is not adequate. To include in that two hours the debate on the programme motion means that we may have no more than one and a quarter hours for consideration of matters on Report.
</p>

Matters on Report are important. If matters have been dealt with in Committee, that has been the preserve of a small number of Members.

The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham referred to the correspondence from the Minister&#039;s office. I am quite happy to favour cock-up rather than conspiracy as far as that is concerned, but it highlights the danger of proceeding in the manner in which the Government wish us to proceed today with a highly timetabled debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-31_para8">
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham said that we had protected time for Third Reading. That is not necessarily the case. If she looks at the motion, she will see that proceedings on Third Reading must be concluded three hours after the commencement of debate on the motion. Proceedings on Report must be concluded after two hours. If we were to have a vote after two hours, that would mean that Third Reading would not start until probably about 15&nbsp;minutes into the one hour. At best, there will be 45&nbsp;minutes available.

A number of issues have come to mind as I have considered the Minister&#039;s correspondence this afternoon. On first reading, I thought that it was fairly innocuous. The more I read it, the more I think, &quot;Perhaps there is a point to be asked about here and a point to be asked about elsewhere.&quot; I hope that, when the Bill leaves the House, as I think it inevitably will tonight, and goes to the other place, the matters that we are not able to deal with today but that have been raised in correspondence from the Minister will get a fuller hearing and that there may be an opportunity for us to deal with those matters during consideration of Lords amendments.

 The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr.&nbsp;Carmichael) was right to pick up the point that the Minister made briefly and rather weakly that, because matters have been considered in Committee, why should 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 241</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>we delay ourselves much on the Floor of the House&#151;that was okay, was it not? That prompts a number of questions, one of which we need not discuss here: was the amount of time even in Committee adequate? My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr.&nbsp;Bellingham) pointed out that his excellent new clause was not considered in Committee because of the Government&#039;s vicious timetabling of the Committee itself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-31_para11">
In a sense, however, that is beside the point because the whole purpose of the Report stage, as my hon. Friend pointed out, is to give Members who did not have the privilege of being on the Committee the opportunity to consider what it did and to submit further amendments. Indeed, even the Government themselves now routinely table amendments on Report for consideration. Therefore, we should look at what we are expected to consider on the Floor of the House in the&nbsp;time allotted by the Government. We should notice that under these so-called timetable motions the Government are graciously allowing the House of Commons a certain amount of time to do its job of scrutinising the Government&#039;s legislation.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-31_spnew5"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I am most grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way. He might want to consider that, first, the Minister was interrupted in mid-flow on a new clause in order for us to vote on the reclassification of cannabis; I have referred to the record in that regard. Secondly, does my right hon. Friend agree that, given that part of the Bill refers to provisions in Northern Ireland and that no Northern Ireland Member served on the Committee, it is even more important that consideration on Report be allowed to run for some time, so that Northern Ireland Members can make points on behalf of their territory?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-31_spnew6"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is of course correct. The point is that the Government are now deciding how much time they themselves will allow Members to do the job that they have been elected to do, which is to scrutinise the Government&#039;s legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-31_para12">
Let us examine the specifics. There are five groups of amendments. They are not trivial and they cover some important and fundamental points. The first group deals with provision for schools and with children, and the second deals with dangerous driving. The third group concerns our old friend&#151;substituting &quot;shall&quot; for &quot;may&quot;. That always sounds trivial and innocuous, but it rarely is because it is almost always of extreme importance. The fourth group deals with the role of the Secretary of State, which is also a matter on which we should dwell. The final group consists of new clause 1, which deals with, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham pointed out, the extremely important issue of the classification of cannabis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-31_para13">
Any one of those groups could easily justify at least an hour&#039;s debate in the House&#151;if not several hours&#151;because in theory several hundred Members might want to debate these matters, and they would be entitled to do so. Instead, the Government have said, &quot;You will be allowed a maximum of two hours to consider all of these matters.&quot; That is 24&nbsp;minutes per group, and if time is allowed for contributions from the Minister and other

The Government are saying that they do not think that Members need to bother turning up to debate these matters, because they do not think that time should be given to do that. That is the essence of the motion.

<p><a name="50222-32_spnew0"><b> Mr. Crispin Blunt  (Reigate) (Con):</b> 
 Would my right hon. Friend care to reflect on the fact that although the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)&#151;he is in his place&#151;has special expertise in this area, he did not serve on the Committee, whereas two Back-Bench Government supporters from Scotland did, even though the Bill does not apply to Scotland? This point surely relates to precisely the argument that my right hon. Friend is making. Today constitutes an opportunity for experts in this House who have not yet had a chance to contribute to do so, yet the time available for debate will be limited to one hour. I am thinking in particular of Members who represent points of view on which Committee members received a great deal of advice. Despite that, no Committee member supported the case put forward by concerned lobby groups and members of the public.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-32_spnew1"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important and interesting point on which I will allow myself to be drawn briefly. He is referring to the mysterious ways in which membership of Committees is decided by this House&#151;or, indeed, by the usual channels. The important point is that, sadly, it is therefore likely that members serving on Committees dealing with Bills such as this might not represent views generally held throughout the House. In particular, as my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) suggested, distinguished Members such as the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)&#151;he is present now and smiling at me, and I am smiling at him&#151;have a unique contribution to make. Today&#039;s debate should be an opportunity for such Members. It should not be time-limited by the Government.

 The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) touched on a serious issue relating to Northern Ireland. I have a letter from the Northern Ireland Office confirming that permission has been sought and obtained for the extension to Northern Ireland of certain provisions in the Bill. However, the right hon. Member, who always reads legislation very carefully, will have noted that clause 24(6) makes it clear that the Bill

 I am grateful to the hon. Lady, who makes an important and different point about the extent to which the Bill covers Northern Ireland.

It should not be a matter of a nod and a wink here and a moment there. These matters deserve proper deliberation and consideration by Members of this House. The programme motion will simply not allow that.

 The hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) raised an issue that the Minister certainly must answer, and I believe that it should be answered during the course of her remarks this evening. Clauses 4&nbsp;and 6&nbsp;specifically relate to powers in Northern Ireland. Indeed, I raised in Committee a matter that the hon. Lady had mentioned about the nomenclature of police officers in Northern Ireland. If the qualifying clause at the end precludes the Bill&#039;s extension to Northern Ireland, it shows once again the poor drafting and haste with which the Bill has been knocked up, thrown together and slipped through the House.

<p><a name="50222-32_spnew5"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 I suspect that the best opportunity for the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) may be on Third Reading, when there may be a chance for the House to press the Minister on matters that are not necessarily covered by the selected groups of amendments on Report. Subject to your discretion and decision, Mr. Deputy Speaker, it may be appropriate to pursue the matter of Northern Ireland with the Minister on Third Reading. In my view, that would be entirely appropriate.

Key issues in the Bill&#151;including the selling of drugs to children, the impact of drugs on driving, the role of the Secretary of State and, not least, the classification of cannabis&#151;are of great substance and importance in their own right. Members who did not sit in Committee&#151;not least, the hon. Member for Newport, West&#151;should now have their opportunity to contribute to the debate in the Chamber, but I suspect that none of that is going to happen. There will be no proper opportunity for debate and Members at large will have little chance to contribute. Sadly, that will once again make an absolute nonsense and a farce of the proper role of the House of Commons in scrutinising legislation.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-32_spnew6"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton  (Macclesfield) (Con):</b> 
 Is it not appropriate for the Opposition, including Liberal Democrat as well as Conservative and Unionist Members, to make representations through the Minister to the Government to the effect that they should urgently review the programming procedures of the House to meet the perfectly reasonable deliberations and recommendations of the Procedure Committee? I believe that the Minister wants good legislation, but she will not get the best legislation if we proceed in this way.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-32_spnew7"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is characteristically more generous than I am, as I gain no sense that the Minister is anxious for any proper or detailed scrutiny of the Bill. In fact, I gain almost the opposite sense&#151;that what we are being allowed to do today is almost too much for the Minister to bear and that she wants us to nod it all through so that she and her colleagues can get away as early as possible. That was my impression, but we may hear more from the Minister either on Report or on

</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-32_para2">
I make no apology for that, as this system of so-called timetabling has confronted us time after time with the absurdity that we are not able to discharge fully and properly our responsibilities as Members of Parliament to scrutinise legislation. The system makes life easier for the Government and makes nonsense of our role. That saddens me.

<p><a name="50222-32_spnew8"><b> Mr. Henry Bellingham  (North-West Norfolk) (Con):</b> 
 I had the pleasure of being a member of the Standing Committee considering this Bill, and I listened with great interest to the contributions that were made. I listened with special interest to what the Minister had to say in respect of a measure that is not particularly controversial. The Bill has received substantial all-party support, with the few exceptions to which my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) alluded a moment ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-32_para3">
I do not understand what is going on. Why on earth is it necessary to apply a timetable motion to a Bill that has all-party support and which is not controversial? Furthermore, many hon. Members are extremely interested in the subject of drugs and know a great deal about it, but, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) said, only a few of them were fortunate enough to serve on the Committee. As a result, many hon. Members would like to contribute to the debate this evening and they might have hoped against hope for a debate on Report that was not timetabled. They will have been sorely disappointed when they saw the business of the House for this week, as it was clear that an extremely tight timetable would leave little chance for a constructive and positive contribution.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-32_spnew9"><b> Lady Hermon: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a particular problem in Northern Ireland? The Assembly there was suspended in October 2002, and this House alone has responsibility for the criminal law in Northern Ireland. Does not it therefore ill behove this Government to rush through legislation in an area as important as drugs control? I remind the House that cannabis use is the main drug problem in Northern Ireland, yet there is no time for proper discussion of the extension of the Bill&#039;s key provisions to Northern Ireland.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-32_spnew10"><b> Mr. Bellingham: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I am indeed aware of what is happening in terms of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and I was a member of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee early on in this Parliament. I am aware of the background, therefore, and the point that she makes is absolutely spot on. Given that the Assembly is suspended, surely the Government should be doubly cautious, sensitive and understanding when it comes to the needs of the Province. They should therefore ensure that proper time is given for a Bill of this nature, which is not controversial.

<a name="50222-32_para4">
In her excellent speech a moment ago, my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham pointed out that several other Bills&#151;the Civil Contingencies Bill and the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill, to name but two&#151;have been subjected to the same timetabling tactics. Earlier in this Parliament, I belonged to the Standing Committee considering the Adoption and Children Bill, which was also uncontroversial and given all-party support. Many hon. Members were keen to ensure that this House produced good law that would endure and command respect. Laws like that are effective and can be upheld in the courts, but they cannot be achieved if the Government are always trying to rush them through the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-32_para5">
There is no good reason for the Government&#039;s determination to rush this Bill through&#151;apart from the possibility that the Minister and her team just want to go back to their offices or their homes early. The Bill&#039;s Report and Third Reading should be considered over a prolonged period of time, as there are many additional points that need to be discussed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-32_para6">
My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham pointed out that we made good progress in Standing Committee and that the Bill enjoyed all-party support. However, some aspects of it were not properly debated. We should have liked more time in Committee, but the Opposition co-operated with the Government as much as we possibly could. We went out of our way to be co-operative and responsible and, to the extent that it is possible for an Opposition to do so, to help the Government get the Bill through Committee. That is why I am appalled by the letter that my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham received from the Minister and the notification of the amendments. What is going on? We have just had 10&nbsp;days off for half-term. Did the Home Office simply close down during that period? What were the Minister&#039;s civil servants doing? Why on earth could they not have contacted members of the Committee in good time, given us plenty of warning and behaved more imaginatively and proactively, which might have led to better legislation? What the Government are doing this afternoon is likely to lead to bad legislation and that is why I shall support my hon. Friend in the forthcoming Division.

<p><a name="50222-33_spnew0"><b> Mr. Crispin Blunt  (Reigate) (Con):</b> 
 The way in which the Bill has been conducted is a great shame because much of the conduct in Committee was exemplary. The Minister considered points seriously, listened to concerns raised in the Committee and on one occasion accepted, unusually, an amendment tabled by the Opposition. The Committee tried seriously to improve a Bill that showed all the evidence of being drafted in a hurry. It is partly to the Government&#039;s credit and to the rather mysterious ways in which the Committee of Selection works that sitting behind the Minister were the hon. Members for Bassetlaw (John Mann) and for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) who demonstrated considerable expert knowledge in debate. It was a shame 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 246</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) was not a member of the Committee, given his expertise and his contribution on Second Reading.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-33_para0">
During the Committee&#039;s deliberations, when we had a great deal of contact with people who were concerned about the change to the legislation covering magic mushrooms, the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael), who was representing the Liberal Democrats, moved an amendment with which he did not agree to enable a debate to take place. The two issues in the Bill that raised the greatest public concern were the reclassification of cannabis and khat, and the classification of psilocybin-related drugs to group A, and they were dealt with during the Committee&#039;s final sitting. Those issues were of great public concern, but no one was genuinely advocating the interests of people who will be affected by the Bill, except academically and artificially, because no one on the Committee agreed with the point of view put forward by a number of concerned members of the public. Therefore, it is important to have sufficient time to discuss such issues when the Bill returns to the House on Report.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-33_spnew1"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 In the interest of accuracy, during an earlier intervention, the hon. Gentleman said that the Bill applies only to England and Wales. Under clause 24(7), clauses 1, 2&nbsp;and 21&nbsp;also apply to Scotland.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-33_spnew2"><b> Mr. Blunt: </b> 
 The vast majority of the Bill is a matter for England and Wales and only a limited number of provisions, mainly covering repeals, apply to Scotland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-33_para1">
When there is concern about such issues from public lobbies whose views are not over-represented in this Parliament, they deserve the opportunity to have their point of view taken into account. The Government may have an argument for programming if there is adequate pre-legislative scrutiny and an opportunity for interested lobby groups to make their case and to have meetings with hon. Members to ensure that their concerns have been properly taken into account. However, there is no case for this Bill to be rushed through when Transform, a drugs policy organisation, legitimately expresses its concerns about the Bill as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Its criminal justice focus appears to be motivated by election-time populism rather than evidence of effectiveness or the needs of the drugs field. The result is a series of reforms, most of which will be ineffective or actively counterproductive. They hold no prospect of addressing the very real issues around drug misuse and related offending in the UK.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-33_para2">
That is a proper line of criticism of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-33_para3">
The measure has been put together in a great hurry and has more to do with appearance than substantive, considered changes to the law. Expert bodies and people with a particular interest in the Bill should have had the opportunity and time to consider it carefully. If that had been the case, they would not have said that there had been lack of consultation.

<br>



<p>Amendment No. 6, in page 2, line 4, leave out subsection (5).</p>





<p>Government amendments Nos. 11&nbsp;to 18.</p>





<p><a name="50222-34_spnew0"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Clause 1&nbsp;stipulates the circumstances that a court must treat as aggravating factors when considering the seriousness of the offence of supply of a controlled drug when the offence is committed by a person aged 18&nbsp;or over. It will be an aggravating factor where the dealer uses a person under the age of 18&nbsp;as a courier to deliver a controlled drug, or in a drug-related consideration, or where the offence of supply occurs on or in the vicinity of school premises during the relevant times.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-34_para1">
Recognising that schools are often used by young people outside conventional school hours, the clause establishes the relevant time as any time when the school is in use by a young person and one hour before or after that time. Because the clause focuses on protecting children at school, we have not included in its scope the supply of drugs at times when young people under 18&nbsp;are not present at the school, but the clause would cover activities outside the normal school day and in the school holidays when young people are involved in an activity at the school.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-34_spnew1"><b> John Robertson  (Glasgow, Anniesland) (Lab):</b> 
 I have great sympathy with amendment No. 4&nbsp;because it is much more protective of the child than the wording of the Bill. Can my hon. Friend allay my fears, so that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 252</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>places such as clubs where young children are brought together are not seen as easy prey for the kind of person we are talking about?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-34_spnew2"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The clause deals with the vicinity of a school. We are focusing on the school as a place in the community that is a visible and known building where young people assemble to attend school and for other legal purposes. We discussed in Committee&#151;and I shall go into this further&#151;how we might extend the provisions to other places where young people go, such as a cinema or a swimming pool. As I shall explain, part of the problem is how we define that, as it could be anywhere that children go.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-34_spnew3"><b> John Robertson: </b> 
 The places that concern me particularly are sports clubs and sports centres, where there are large numbers of young people in an area that can also be attended by adults, some of whom might not be as nice as those looking after the children.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-34_spnew4"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 We recognise that drug-related activities can, unfortunately, take place at any time and anywhere in our communities. I share my hon. Friend&#039;s concern. It is important that the police and others work to make sure that, using local intelligence, they identify where those activities take place. There is already protection for young people, and account must be taken of aggravating factors such as dealing directly to vulnerable people. That includes people under 18. Dealers would be caught by that if they were dealing to young people in areas such as my hon. Friend mentioned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-34_para2">
In the clause we are focusing on the school, which is a premises where children are expected to go by law. It is a visible building in the community which is known to be used by children. We are considering how we might best create a safe zone around it.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-34_spnew5"><b> Several hon. Members </b> 
 <i>rose&#151;</i>
</p>





<p><a name="50222-34_spnew6"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 I wish to make a little progress.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-34_spnew7"><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan  (Chesham and Amersham) (Con):</b> 
 Will the Minister give way on that specific point?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-34_spnew8"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 I wish to deal further with some of the points that have been made, as this matter was dealt with extensively in Committee. I ask hon. Members to please bear with me.

<a name="50222-34_time1"><h5>6.30&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-34_para3">
The Bill does not define what constitutes the vicinity of school premises, so it will be for the courts to make a determination on a case-by-case basis. I shall return to that point in relation to amendment No. 3. The clause will catch all school premises, including buildings, main and ancillary, playing fields and dormitory buildings. It will also encompass the use of school premises for community purposes, provided that a young person under 18&nbsp;is participating in that use.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-34_para4">
In Committee, the hon. Member for Upminster (Angela Watkinson) gave the example of a community church using school premises and asked whether it would be caught by the provision. Initial advice 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 253</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>suggested that the answer was no, but I sought further advice from parliamentary counsel, and they said yes. As far as I am concerned, on the basis of that second opinion, any activities taking place within what are defined as school premises will be caught by the clause as long as they involve under-18s.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-34_para5">
The courts may already take into account aggravating factors when considering the seriousness of an offence of supplying a controlled drug. The clause recognises public concern, particularly about aggravating circumstances in which children are exposed to risk, even if they are not directly involved in drug-dealing activities. We hope that the clause will provide a measure of reassurance to parents and a deterrent message to dealers, as well as offering protection to young people.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-34_spnew9"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland) (LD):</b> 
 May I offer to the Minister the example of the school in my village that my children attend? As well as the school, there are various play facilities that are frequently used by children after hours. Presumably, given the terms of subsection (5)(a), a time when the children are playing there would constitute a time when the school is in use by persons under 18. Is she satisfied that that definition gives sufficient legal certainty, particularly given the fact that the provision extends to an hour before the start of such use? If there is no fixed start time, it will not be possible for a person to regulate their conduct according to the subsection.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-34_spnew10"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 I am convinced that the provision would apply to play activities of the sort that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. If hon. Members remember, we discussed in Committee the defence of not knowing that young people were present at any given time, and I accepted an Opposition amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-34_para6">
It is necessary to recognise that the provision is about creating safer zones. Our intention is that, as far as is possible and practical&#151;there are issues about how far the areas can be extended, what is practical and how wide the range should be&#151;we should protect young people, particularly when they are attending school but not exclusively, from exposure to drug dealing. It is therefore important that all premises should fall within the scope of that approach. I think that the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) spoke about her own school, Cheltenham Ladies&#039; College&#151;I think that it was in relation to the cash issue&#151;and she pointed out that accommodation in boarding schools may be located on a different site from that of the school and asked whether such buildings would be covered. I sought additional advice as to whether ancillary school buildings such as accommodation provided by boarding schools and remote playing fields&#151;when I was at school in London, we had quite a trek to our playing fields&#151;are caught by the clause. I am assured that they are.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-34_para7">
I have considered the point further, and I have taken the view that it is helpful, in order to avoid any doubt, to table an amendment. At the same time, it will also help to resolve any possible doubt about whether the provision catches over-18s who are dealing on such premises. Government amendments Nos. 9&nbsp;to 11&nbsp;and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 254</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>17&nbsp;mean that an aggravating factor that a court must take into account when deciding a serious drug supply offence will be the fact that the offence was committed on or in a facility, which is covered by Government amendment No. 9, and that it was committed at a relevant time, which is covered by Government amendments Nos. 10&nbsp;and 11.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-34_para8">
It is always worth working through the different scenarios. It is possible that a teacher or caretaker might occupy solely as a dwelling, accommodation owned by the school, which is school premises, but which is not on or in the vicinity of other school premises. In an inner-city area, for example, a school might own accommodation that is not in the vicinity of the school or on the school plot itself. In recognising that such accommodation could be on the far side of town, our aim is to protect and provide a safe zone for children and young people, so that there is no need to catch premises used solely as a dwelling by a caretaker or teacher that are not on or in the vicinity of other school premises, although such a person might be defined as living in school premises. I hope that is clear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-34_para9">
The basic idea is to draw a distinction between catching those people who have accommodation on a site where children actively go to school or engage in activities and a situation in which a caretaker lives 10&nbsp;or five miles away from his job, but his accommodation is linked to the school.
</p>

<p><a name="50222-35_spnew0"><b> Lady Hermon  (North Down) (UUP):</b> 
 Will the Minister clarify once and for all whether clause 1&nbsp;will apply to school premises in Northern Ireland? Clause 24&nbsp;is ambiguous about whether some or all of the provisions will extend to Northern Ireland. Will she put on the record that every school premises&#151;as she has explained this evening, &quot;school premises&quot; is widely defined&#151;includes school premises in Northern Ireland?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-35_spnew1"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Lady for giving me an opportunity to set the record straight. I am pleased to say that clause 1&nbsp;will apply to Northern Ireland, as will clauses 2, 4, 6, 8&nbsp;and 21. Clauses 4&nbsp;and 6&nbsp;mirror clauses 3&nbsp;and 5, so they have an identity in their own right. I agree that the wording of clause 24&nbsp;is not as clear as we might all want, but sometimes we are all hostage to the legalistic wording used in such legislation. Many clauses amend existing legislation, and where the scope and range of that legislation applies to Northern Ireland, those changes will apply to Northern Ireland too. I reassure her that the measures in clause 1, which attempt to create safer zones around schools, will apply to Northern Ireland.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-35_spnew2"><b> Lady Hermon: </b> 
 Earlier, I referred to a letter that I received from the Northern Ireland Office. I must apologise, because it was actually a written answer from the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, who is responsible for this particular subject. On 24&nbsp;January 2005, he stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I have sought and obtained approval for the extension to Northern Ireland of the following provisions in the Drugs Bill&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-35_para0">
He listed several points, including the
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Creation of aggravating circumstances in which a dealer will face an enhanced sentence&#151;such as dealing near a school or using young persons as couriers&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 25&nbsp;January 2005; Vol. 430, c. 302W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 255</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-35_para1">
Given the clear import of that reply, will the Minister reflect on making it clear in the Bill that the provisions extend to Northern Ireland? The Police Service of Northern Ireland must apply those provisions, which are not clear.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-35_spnew3"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Clauses 1&nbsp;and 2&nbsp;amend the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971&nbsp;and therefore apply to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It is not necessary to specify Northern Ireland because we are simply amending existing legislation, which already applies to Northern Ireland and Scotland. I hope that that makes it clear that Northern Ireland is not excluded from the provisions that deal with the vicinity of schools and the possible use of children and young people as couriers by drug peddlers and dealers. I hope that that reassures the hon. Lady and conveys a strong message to her local community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-35_para2">
Let me be clear. Premises that are occupied solely by a teacher or a caretaker as a dwelling and are on or in the vicinity of other school premises that children and young people use would be caught by the measure. Government amendment No. 17&nbsp;therefore defines school premises more closely and exempts from that definition land occupied solely as a dwelling by a person who is employed at the school. It is not unusual for buildings that are used solely as a dwelling by a member of staff to be distinguished in legislation from other school premises.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-35_para3">
Amendment No. 3&nbsp;defines &quot;in the vicinity&quot; as
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;(a) within one mile of the school; or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (b) within five miles of the school when on a route known to be used by pupils accessing the school; or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (c) on a vehicle used by local education authorities to transport children to school.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-35_para4">
The question of what constitutes &quot;in the vicinity&quot; was thoroughly aired in Committee and I have, perhaps rather belatedly, written to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham about the matter. I am concerned about the definition and I held extensive discussions about whether it was possible to include one in the Bill. After much discussion, I am worried that attempting a definition runs the risk of undermining our purpose. A definition could exclude a set of circumstances that may currently be difficult to foresee or a position that arises from local circumstances, which a court might want to include.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-35_spnew4"><b> John Mann  (Bassetlaw) (Lab):</b> 
 I want to raise a point of clarity that was not made in Committee about definitions of vicinity, especially in view of Government amendment No. 9, in relation to school athletics and sports facilities that are used by adults&#151;through community use&#151;and children, for example on a Saturday morning. Am I right that, if the measure were passed, this country would have the strongest anti-drugs-in-sport legislation anywhere in the western world? Anyone who dealt in performance-enhancing drugs on a sports field owned by a school&#151;that applies to all athletics facilities and most rugby and football fields in my constituency&#151;would be liable for conviction for aggravated supply. Will my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary consider whether such a provision could eventually be extended to cover professional sports, such as those football teams that are playing tonight?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-35_spnew5"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right that the Bill covers sports activities that take place on school 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 256</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>premises&#151;playing fields, sports halls or facilities that are open to community use. As long as young people who are under 18&nbsp;are engaged in those activities, clause 1&nbsp;will apply. My hon. Friend mentioned performance-enhancing drugs. If they were illegal, the clause would apply in the circumstances that he outlined. I shall draw his final point about other sporting activities to the attention of my hon. Friends in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-35_spnew6"><b> John Mann: </b> 
 My hon. Friend will recall that I was somewhat sceptical about the parental fear of drug dealing outside schools and I gave examples from my constituency. I believed that the Government risked falling into the trap of overplaying a fear that was simply that and not a reality. My hon. Friend will be pleased that I am convinced by her arguments about tackling drugs in sport. Will she consider how best to publicise this to the sporting world? The issue did not come up in Committee, but it could represent a significant change in dealing with drugs in sport.

<a name="50222-35_time0"><h5>6.45&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="50222-35_spnew7"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 I will think about the issue that my hon. Friend has raised. It will be important to make the provisions of the Bill well known, should it become law. That is an ongoing challenge for us, with regard not only to the new provisions but to the fact that record amounts of money are now being spent on all aspects of dealing with drugs, including prevention, treatment and building capacity. I know that my hon. Friend has played a huge role in this in his constituency, which I hope has been helped by the Government&#039;s determination to bear down locally on what can be achieved if people work together better to identify the problems and use the funds that we are providing to tackle them wisely. I will think about what he has said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-35_para5">
I would also like to point out to my hon. Friend that a conference is being held this week on the positive futures scheme, which we in the Home Office are funding, as well as Sport England and others. The scheme identifies young people who are at risk of drug involvement or who have already become involved with drugs. It is a sports-based scheme, and 50,000&nbsp;young people have gone through it so far, with tremendous results. An awareness of the dangers of drugs&#151;not only heroin and crack cocaine but performance-enhancing drugs&#151;is an important part of the role of sports coaches, alongside providing brilliant sports coaching.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-35_spnew8"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 The Minister is showing a great deal of concern for children by introducing this legislation, and we are now being led down the sporting route. She has also embarked on looking at &quot;what if&quot; scenarios. Will she clarify what would happen if children from a school were invited to play sport at a private sporting facility, for example, or a well-known football ground? If the children were going there as part of their school activities, would those premises be covered by the Bill? If not, why not? Why will the Minister not consider our amendment to make the clause apply to places where children congregate?

<br>&nbsp;<br>facilities. The Bill covers school premises, and I have already attempted to explain what we understand by that term. The provision would capture the scenario that my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) outlined, but it would not apply to that suggested by the hon. Lady. I shall explain later our views on places where young people congregate and on other places that have been mentioned, including community centres. We are trying to focus on what is practical and what we can actually deliver.

What constitutes &quot;in the vicinity&quot; could vary from location to location. For example, a dealing site might be close to a school&#151;and let us not forget that we are talking not only about someone dealing directly to young people, but about the exposure of young people to drug-related activities going on around them. An aggravating factor may already be taken into account by the courts during sentencing in cases involving dealing directly to a vulnerable person, including those under 18. These provisions are an attempt to tackle the problem of young people on school premises having to walk past or be exposed to dealing activities that might not directly involve them. This is about the risk of exposure, and the creation of safer zones around those areas.

<p><a name="50222-36_spnew0"><b> Angela Watkinson  (Upminster) (Con):</b> 
 The clause relates to the supply of a controlled substance by a person who has attained the age of 18. However, it does not cover the supply of such a substance by someone who has not attained that age. We know that when pupils in schools have been tempted into drug use, it is common for them to sell on their surplus to their friends, thereby creating more and more people with a drug habit. Will the Minister tell us how the provision relates to people under the age of 18?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-36_spnew1"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 With the indulgence of the House, I will deal with that point, but I do not want to lose sight of the Opposition amendments. As the hon. Lady is aware, we had a discussion in Committee on that issue. We have to decide whether we accept that the law contains procedures that recognise how we might deal with under-18s in terms of sentencing, and how they are dealt with by different agencies, compared with over-18s.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para0">
There are enough examples of how we try to deal with young offenders, but that does not mean that we excuse for one moment the activity of someone under 18&nbsp;who might be supplying drugs. That will be an offence for which&#151;if they are caught and there is evidence&#151;they can be charged. We had a discussion on this in Committee, and I do not think that applying to someone who is himself identified in law as a vulnerable person the aggravating factor of supplying to a vulnerable person is the right approach to take.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para1">
Do not forget that that is an aggravating factor linked to a charge for an offence. In dealing with under-18s, it is important that we charge them for the offence, but we should also consider what their involvement is and how they got involved. We should consider them as we do in other areas of law&#151;in a way that understands that their actions are wrong, but at the same time they are young people, and perhaps even children. We need to deal with 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 258</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that appropriately. We have had that discussion, and although we may disagree, I think this is the right approach. So we are talking here about people over the age of 18&nbsp;in respect of whom we believe such issues should be taken into account when they are involved in dealing activity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para2">
A dealing site may be close to a school as the crow flies, but might be separated from it by a railway line that is not bridged for some distance from the school, and may therefore, for practical purposes, not be in its vicinity. Conversely, a dealing site may be some distance from the school using conventional footpaths or roads, but be easily accessible by less conventional means. In my constituency, young people going to school do not necessarily follow the paved route. They cut across fields and parks, and that becomes their normal route to school. If someone wanted to be involved in dealing activity, they might choose such an area for that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para3">
Amendment No. 3, in attempting to define &quot;in the vicinity&quot;, illustrates the dangers of doing so. As I have said, distance may not always be the only determining factor. If we were to go for a fixed distance, from what point on the school premises would a mile be measured, and who would have the authority to carry out that measurement? How would passengers on a bus know when they were within 5&nbsp;miles of a school? Furthermore, the amendment would catch only buses provided by an education authority, but not public transport used by pupils on their way to or from school.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para4">
In addition, if there were active dealing on a school bus&#151;we might presume that, apart from the driver, most of the people on it were under 18, and it might be the driver who was dealing&#151;that would be caught by the aggravating factor of dealing to vulnerable people, which means those under 18. We also know that young people use other forms of public transport, such as trains or buses, and children could be exposed to dealing activity from which we need to protect them near a local train station, which is the dropping-off point for those making their way to school, or on buses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para5">
We are talking about situations in which the young person is not directly engaged, but is exposed to the risk. We all want to try to deal with those situations, when young people experience those things around them. We need to consider how to ensure that they are seen as not acceptable and not a normal part of everyday life.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-36_spnew2"><b> Paul Flynn  (Newport, West) (Lab):</b> 
 I am following my hon. Friend&#039;s argument carefully. We would all agree that we do not want our children or grandchildren to be exposed to drug pushing, but as she is referring to the vicinity of schools and colleges, the route to school for all children and the means of transport to school, it seems to me that this measure will cover an enormous area. Has she calculated the percentage of urban areas that the ban will cover? It strikes me that a very small area would be excluded from it.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-36_spnew3"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Well, some Members might be quite happy about that. The facility will be linked to the issue of risk to young people and children. Rather than having carte blanche, the risk of young people being exposed would have to be set against the activity and where it was located. Because those issues are complex, we feel that that is a matter for the courts to decide. I will 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 259</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>refer later to some other pieces of legislation in which &quot;in the vicinity&quot; is also used to provide coverage in a certain area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para6">
The way forward is to allow the courts discretion to decide what constitutes &quot;in the vicinity&quot;, not to remove that discretion as the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham suggests. Following the Committee stage, I sought further legal advice on the matter, and I am 100&nbsp;per cent. certain that it is not sensible to provide further definition of the term in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para7">
As I said, there is legal precedent for that approach elsewhere. For example, the term is used in section 42&nbsp;of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, under which a constable may give a direction to a person who is present outside or &quot;in the vicinity&quot; of someone&#039;s home if he reasonably believes that the person is there to represent something to the resident or another person or to persuade such a person to do or not to do something. I have experience of that in relation to animal rights extremists setting up a vigil outside someone&#039;s home. The police have used that direction widely, even when someone is not in the particular street or outside the person&#039;s home but has been there and in that vicinity previously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para8">
The term &quot;in the vicinity&quot; is also used in section 60AA of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994&nbsp;as inserted by section 94&nbsp;of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. Section 60AA provides police with the power to require persons to remove disguises in certain places and under certain circumstances. Section 60AA(8) provides that a member of the British Transport police has those same powers in any locality &quot;in or in the vicinity&quot; of any police premises and in police premises themselves. We have done a search of case law to show that the term &quot;in the vicinity&quot; was used.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para9">
It is right that we should indicate the intention behind the clause, and the Home Office will draw up, consult on and issue guidance indicating particular concerns in that regard. I would like guidance to indicate that distance from the school is the key but not necessarily the determinative factor, and that the practical accessibility of a location to young people is an important factor. The risk posed by drug dealing to young people when attending schools is a primary concern, premises such as caf&#233;s and private dwellings that are in the vicinity of schools could be covered, and other points in the vicinity of a school at which young people gather regularly, such as a bus stop on the way to or from school, are also a concern. As for whether a place is one at which young people gather, we should also consider informal routes that they may take to the school premises, which would include public footpaths and roads and, dare I say it, trespassing across private land. Transport used by schoolchildren should also be caught within the definition when such transport is in the vicinity of a school.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-36_spnew4"><b> Lady Hermon: </b> 
 May I clarify, for my peace of mind, one point that bothers me? We are considering clause 1&nbsp;on aggravated supply of controlled drugs. Is my interpretation of that clause correct that if a defendant is able to argue successfully that a location is not &quot;in the vicinity&quot; of school premises, that affects sentencing only? In view of the wide interpretation that the Minister has given, and her confirmation that it applies to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 260</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Northern Ireland, for which I thank her, will she confirm that even if that argument is successful and a court does not hold that such a location is in the vicinity of school premises, it is still an offence for a defendant to supply controlled drugs?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-36_spnew5"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Certainly it is still an offence for someone to supply controlled drugs. Such a person would be arrested and, I hope, charged with a drug offence, and it would be for the courts to take that into consideration as an aggravating factor, along the same lines as the aggravating factor of using children as couriers. The purpose is to focus the minds of those in our legal system on the importance of these issues, which should be reflected in sentencing. In Committee, the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) raised the issue of transparency, and I have agreed to write to the Sentencing Guidelines Council about how aggravating factors apply to sentencing. I felt that the hon. Gentleman had made a fair point.

<a name="50222-36_time0"><h5>7&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para10">
Before issuing guidance my officials have already begun to consult Adfam, Turning Point, Drugscope, the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Youth Justice Board. During initial discussions with a number of those bodies, none of them supported a definition of &quot;vicinity&quot; in the Bill; they felt that that should be covered by the guidance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para11">
As for amendment No. 4, I understand the desire to protect young people from dealers operating in the vicinity of places other than schools, but feel that there are real practical difficulties in establishing what constitutes such a place. What constitutes a congregation of young people&#151;three or 30? Moreover, as I have said, the current sentencing guidelines list, among other aggravating factors, &quot;deliberately targeting vulnerable victims&quot;. I believe that that gives courts discretion to deal with young people appropriately.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para12">
Unfortunately, as I said earlier, we live in a time when drug dealing can take place in any location where there are young people. The aim is to come up with a focused practical measure that can be enforced in a way that does not dilute what we are trying to do. That is why we have singled out schools for the purposes of this offence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para13">
Amendments Nos. 5&nbsp;and 6&nbsp;would require a court to identify an aggravating factor increasing the seriousness of an offence of supplying drugs when a person commits the offence in the vicinity of a school at any time. As we have acknowledged, schools are not the same as they were in our time, when the school day lasted from 9&nbsp;am until 3.30&nbsp;or 4&nbsp;pm. I think we are all pleased that schools are now live buildings that operate outside the normal school day and are open to the wider community, and we have covered that in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para14">
Again, however, we do not want to dilute the aggravating factor. On occasion a school may be closed, with no one on the premises. To apply the aggravating factor when young people are not exposed would, in my view, undermine the clause. We should not forget that someone dealing in drugs outside a school at any time is liable to arrest and prosecution, but we do not think it appropriate for a court to apply the aggravating factor to those dealing at 2&nbsp;am, when children are not using the premises. There must be a link with the risk of exposure.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para15">
Amendments Nos. 5&nbsp;and 6&nbsp;go beyond the intention of the clause. Because the clause catches all who deal in the vicinity of schools, the amendments would establish an aggravating factor when an adult dealer supplied drugs to another adult in the vicinity of a school, even if he did so when the school was shut and no young persons were present and exposed to risk. We must not lose the focus of the clauses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para16">
As for Government amendment No. 12, clause 1&nbsp;makes it an aggravating factor&#151;which a court must take into account when deciding the seriousness of a drug supply offence&#151;to use a person under 18&nbsp;as a courier. I know from what people have told me that there is concern about the use of children by adults wishing to avoid prosecution, and I think that that is terrible. We had a productive discussion in Committee, and I agreed with a number of points that were made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-36_para17">
New section 4A(6) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, which clause 1&nbsp;inserts, provides that a person uses a courier in connection with an offence

In Committee the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland tabled an amendment that sought to strengthen the word &quot;requests&quot;, to make it clear that all acts of both commission and omission that a dealer might undertake in order for a young person to act as a courier were considered to be an aggravating factor. I acknowledged the merit of what the amendment was intended to achieve, and I hope that our amendment will achieve the same objective. It would replace &quot;requests&quot; with &quot;causes or permits&quot;, so that the clause would catch not just any positive act that a dealer might commit to force or persuade a young person to act as a courier, but a dealer who accepted an offer from a young person to act as a courier. In Committee, we discussed circumstances in which young people might wish to ingratiate themselves with, say, someone with a fast car, and might offer to be used in that way. This provision would capture that possibility, and I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for raising the matter in Committee.

On Government amendments Nos. 13, 14, 15, 16&nbsp;and 18, again, the Bill deals with young people under the age of 18&nbsp;who are used as couriers. New section 4A, which is inserted by clause 1, provides that for this purpose, drug-related cash is cash obtained in connection with the supply of a controlled drug or intended to be used to obtain a controlled drug. New section 4A(8) defines cash as including inter alia notes and coins and any monetary instruments specified by order made by the Secretary of State.

We had a discussion about &quot;a consideration&quot; in Committee as well, and I have sought and obtained definitive legal advice. We are clear that it would not be appropriate to define the term &quot;consideration&quot; in the Bill. I understand&#151;as a lawyer, the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland will probably know better than me&#151;that it is a standard legal term that should properly be interpreted by the courts. It is used without definition in much other legislation, such as the Criminal Law Act 1967, the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979&nbsp;and the Criminal Attempts Act 1981. To attempt to define &quot;consideration&quot; would call into question some of those other pieces of primary legislation.

Amendment No. 15&nbsp;widens the definition of &quot;a drug related consideration&quot; to cover that which is intended to be used in connection with obtaining a controlled drug as well as that to be used to obtain a controlled drug. The detailed definition of cash in new section 4A(8) is therefore no longer required, and amendment No. 16&nbsp;deletes it. The new section contains a power for the Secretary of State to make an order specifying monetary instruments that fall within the definition of cash.

I welcome the Government amendments. We spent a lot of time on this clause in Committee because the Government made it a flagship clause. The Minister has admitted that there were some problems with its drafting. I find that extraordinary because the provision to make an aggravated offence for dealing around schools has been on the drawing board for some time. To have brought it to the House in such an imperfect form is extraordinary, but I admit that the amendments 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

I am particularly pleased that the Minister has caught up with the 21st century and realised that her original drafting, which included the exchange of bankers&#039; drafts and bearer bonds and bearer shares by dealers in and around a school, is not today&#039;s reality. Her reality check has brought her to use the words &quot;a drug-related consideration&quot;. That is an excellent development that recognises that youngsters deal in and exchange many other things, from mobile phones and the new iPods, to cash or anything else that happens to be at hand. I must say that bearer bonds and bankers&#039; drafts are used rarely.

I thank the Minister for her letter of 17&nbsp;February dealing with some points raised in Committee, which I did not receive until yesterday morning. Despite those comments to me at that late stage and her comments at length just now, the clause is still imperfect and certainly not strong enough. I want to consider the amendments that I tabled, which would widen and strengthen the clause. I hope that I will be able to press the House to a Division when the time comes, particularly on amendment No. 5, if not also amendment No. 6, because nothing that the Minister has so far said has led me to believe that my amendments will do anything other than strengthen this part of the Bill, which is what we have been seeking to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-37_para3">
Amendment No. 4&nbsp;would widen the protection afforded to children where they congregate, or receive instruction or training. In her letter of 17&nbsp;February concerning clause 1, the Minister said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I am advised that the clause does not include school premises which are in community use (eg a community church), even when the persons under the age of 18&nbsp;are using the premises for such community purposes. This is because the term &#039;use&#039; implies &#039;use as a school&#039;. Children will be protected by this clause so long as they are using the school for some school-related purpose (eg., night class/drama rehearsal).&quot;</p>

That is not the comfort zone that I was seeking concerning the interpretation of this clause. It is my understanding that the Minister is actually saying that the aggravation factor will not apply if, for example, the children are at a school premises and attending a Sunday school.

<br>&nbsp;<br>any activity taking place on school premises, whether or not it was organised by the school.

Information has been introduced at this late stage and the Opposition were not notified; in fact, the material provided to us was obviously inaccurate. I am pleased that the Minister has explained the situation, which may lead me to withdraw amendment No. 4.

Examples have been one of the Minister&#039;s strong points and I would like to discuss another example, which I hope that she will be able to tell me will definitely fall within the ambit of the Bill. For example, I want to be able to protect children when they are in a learning environment that is not necessarily on school premises. The Minister confirmed earlier that, if children from a school were playing sports at a private club, they would not be covered by the Bill.

<br>&nbsp;<br>youngsters are in another learning environment outside the school&#151;and they have been taken outside of school by the school itself&#151;they will not be covered. Once again, the issues have not been thought through.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-37_para7">
I want the Minister to respond, if she has time, to amendments Nos. 5&nbsp;and 6&nbsp;because they are designed to strengthen clause 1. The Minister says that she wants to protect children and that clause 1&nbsp;is all about protecting children, yet she places a whole series of provisos on that protection by using the phrase &quot;at a relevant time&quot; at the end of subsection (3) and by including in subsection (5), the phrases
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;any time when a school is in use by persons under the age of 18&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-37_para8">
and
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;one hour before the start and one hour after the end of any such time&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-37_para9">
That effectively removes from the Bill&#039;s protection the very premises that attract children out of school hours.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-37_para10">
Many of our youngsters feel safe and secure in the environments in and around school premises. The Minister must know that, because she must have seen, as I have, children congregating in and around school premises long after the school has closed. That is the very time&#151;late at night&#151;when these children are most vulnerable and when the dealer will have greatest access to them. Dealers well know that children can be found in and around a set of premises with which they are familiar. Why on earth is the Minister cutting off her nose to spite her face over this matter? It would be simple to remove the term &quot;at a relevant time&quot; and remove subsection (5) so that the provisions would apply in, around or in the vicinity of school premises. I cannot understand why she is resisting and providing the dealers with a loophole. The dealers will find it easy to set up their places around schools at 11&nbsp;o&#039;clock at night, after they have shut down at 8&nbsp;pm, yet they will not qualify for additional sentencing on grounds of aggravation under clause 1.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-37_para11">
I sincerely ask the Minister to reconsider my amendments Nos. 5&nbsp;and 6, on which I hope we will be able to vote. The common sense of the amendments has attracted some interest from Labour Members because they realise that they are proposed sincerely to protect children in and around schools. I hope that, if we vote on the amendments, Labour Members will join us in the Lobby.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-37_para12">
Amendment No. 3&nbsp;attempts to define the term &quot;vicinity&quot;, and I listened to what the Minister had to say. She quoted a lot from her 17&nbsp;February letter, but I am no longer sure which parts of that letter are accurate and about which she has sought further advice from parliamentary counsel. One part of the letter refers specifically to the matter addressed by amendment No. 3. She wrote:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Where a school has residential accommodation which is not on the site where teaching takes place, then this will also be caught so long as it is not occupied solely as a dwelling by a person employed at the school.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-37_para13">
Why is that exemption made? If a school&#039;s caretaker were a drug dealer and lived in a nearby dwelling provided by the school, the drug deals are more than likely to happen at that dwelling.
</p>

<p><a name="50222-38_spnew0"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 That would be another consideration for the courts to take into account. A caretaker in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 266</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>circumstances that the hon. Lady describes&#151;living near the school and known to the students&#151;would be caught by the Bill, even if he dealt only to adults and not to young people. It has been brought to my attention that a caretaker&#039;s accommodation is not always near the school at which he works. As a result, the exposure of young people to the dwelling is not always apparent.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-38_spnew1"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 Once again, the Minister is not on the side of child protection but of the drug dealers. She has missed an opportunity with this clause. She has tried to be tough but she has failed. She is not tough geographically, because she has not sought to define what &quot;vicinity&quot; means in the context of a school&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="50222-38_spnew2"><b> John Mann: </b> 
 Will the hon. Lady give way?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-38_spnew3"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 No, as I have nearly finished and I want to leave a little time for my hon. Friend from the Liberal Democrats, the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael).
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-38_para0">
The Minister has not drafted the clause widely as far as time is concerned. It is a half-hearted attempt to pay lip service to protecting children near schools. She has missed a great opportunity. I hope that we can divide on amendment No. 5, if not on amendment No. 6&nbsp;as well.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-38_spnew4"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 I want to make a few brief remarks in the time that remains. Before that, I want to say that I agree with the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) about the timetabling of this part of our deliberations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-38_para1">
As the Minister fairly said, the bulk of the Government amendments in this group had their genesis in amendments tabled by me or the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham in Committee. They are to be welcomed, and they greatly improve the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-38_para2">
I have some concerns about Government amendment No. 17. The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham explored that very briefly earlier, but there are a number of school hostel premises in my constituency that are at some distance from the schools that they serve. However, there is often accommodation&#151;either on the premises, or in the grounds&#151;for a teacher or a janitor, or someone of that sort.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-38_spnew5"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 That would be covered, because the boundary around the accommodation for young people is taken into account and if the accommodation is on that site, the provision would apply.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-38_spnew6"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 I am grateful for that clarification. The matter is not as cut and dried as the Minister is suggesting, but we can deal with that on another occasion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-38_para3">
Amendments Nos. 5&nbsp;and 6&nbsp;were tabled by Conservative Members and we anticipate a Division on them. They have some merit because the inclusion of a reference to time in addition to place leaves the provision open-ended and makes it difficult for citizens to regulate their conduct. For reasons other than those for which they were tabled, I would be minded to support the Conservatives if a Division were called.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 267</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-38_para4">
I accept the Government&#039;s reasoning concerning the definition of &quot;vicinity&quot;. It is sensible not to include a definition, but I wonder whether the third part of the Conservatives&#039; amendment No. 3&nbsp;relating to school transport is not consistent with the Government&#039;s approach, although not just vehicles, but many other modes of transport&#151;

<p><a name="50222-39_spnew0"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-39_para0">
I understand the concerns that have been raised today but, overall, there has been a constructive approach to the Bill both on Second Reading and in Committee. I hope that I have responded positively in the areas that we have covered to many of the points made by hon. Members. I accept the role of scrutiny and the fact that other parties have something to offer, but it seems that, on the Bill&#039;s return to the House, the fact that I have listened is not welcomed. That is an important part of the process. The Bill is not, as the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) suggested, badly drafted, but sometimes things are left out of Bills or require clarification. We have certainly tried to deal with that. The Bill is not the only representation of the Government&#039;s efforts to tackle the problems of drug abuse in our communities.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-39_spnew1"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 That is a relief.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-39_spnew2"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 It is important that we look at what we can do to augment our achievements. It is acknowledged that we have devolved considerable amounts of Government funding to the local level through drug action teams and by pooling different moneys available for prevention and treatment into a single young people&#039;s partnership fund. We have enhanced powers for testing on arrest and for mandatory assessment of people who have tested positive for class A drugs. Those are significant efforts to break the vicious circle in which people commit offences to feed their drug habit. I am pleased that the drug intervention programme is beginning to bite, as an increased number of people are taking up treatment&#151;a process that the Bill&#039;s provisions will only enrich. There are 54&nbsp;per cent. more people in treatment than there were a few years ago, which demonstrates how importantly we take this issue. Even though people think it is important, drug treatment is not always a popular issue. It takes many forms&#151;it is sometimes available in residential centres, but it must be supported within the community as well. We are committed to supporting and enhancing such initiatives. We are also building capacity, as we have not ceased in our ambition to grow the necessary treatment for people, whatever their age.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-39_para1">
We are also keen to educate young people about the dangers of drug abuse so that they do not become problematic drug misusers. I am not complacent, but I am pleased to say that the use of class A drugs, which increased enormously in the 1990s, has stabilised since 1998&nbsp;after years of increased use by young people. There is evidence to suggest that there has even been a drop in the use of cannabis by young people. We are reducing the supply of drugs in the UK, and Operation Crackdown, which we announced today, is showing impressive results. It is implementing the powers that the Government introduced effectively to shut down premises that are used to encourage drug dealing and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 272</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>other activities that are a blight on communities. We have had tremendous success in the past year, with 150&nbsp;crack houses shut down. Today we announced further results provided by the police forces engaged in this important work.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-39_spnew3"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I appreciate the fact that in her busy day the Minister had time to issue the press release first thing this morning, but she did not have time to properly inform the Opposition about matters pertaining to the Bill. I question the success of the operation, as reported in the press release. It states that in the past four weeks the police seized 17&nbsp;kg of heroin. I understand from the statistics that back in 1999&nbsp;the police seized 1,500&nbsp;kg of heroin&#151;that is, 160&nbsp;kg in a month, so 17&nbsp;kg is not that good. Likewise, the press release states that in the past month 413&nbsp;people were charged with supplying class A drugs. Back in 1998, 7,230&nbsp;people were charged&#151;a rate of 605&nbsp;a month. I am not sure that the statistics are as wonderful as the Minister trumpets them to be.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-39_spnew4"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 I shall have to look at the hon. Lady&#039;s reference sources. We are dealing here not with the whole picture, but with the specific campaign to focus on houses involved with drugs. That is where the police focus has been for the past four weeks. The results that we outlined today are due to that intervention. They do not account for all the other activities in which the police are involved, including the middle market drug units and the seizures taking place in other areas. The press release is designed to let people know about a particular campaign, which has been welcomed by police forces as a focus for their attention. It has also led to the seizure of firearms found at the same locations.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-39_spnew5"><b> Lady Hermon: </b> 
 The Minister rightly pointed to the success of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, which enables police forces in England and Wales to close down crack houses. May I draw to the hon. Lady&#039;s attention the fact that none of the 2003&nbsp;Act extended to Northern Ireland? Will she give a commitment to look again at the needs of Northern Ireland in the absence of an Assembly? Given the activities of some bank robbers and those who are connected with them, it is highly unlikely that we will have our Assembly back in the near future. The issue is a serious one that must be dealt with by means of the legislation that goes through this House, so that commitment will be most welcome.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-39_spnew6"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 I will consider what the hon. Lady said and discuss with my hon. Friend the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety and others the impact of the legislation on England and Wales and the effect of its not applying to Northern Ireland.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-39_spnew7"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way again. The statistics that I obtained are taken partly from the information in the drug seizure and offender statistics, United Kingdom, 2001&nbsp;and 2002, second edition. It is a Home Office statistical bulletin. May I ask the Minister where table 2.3&nbsp;is in the statistical bulletin? That is the table that enables us to see what the police seize and what Customs seize, and it is missing from the Home Office&#039;s paper. I thought it was a mistake in my downloading, but the specific amount of drugs that were seized by each of those two operations is in table 2.3, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 273</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>which has been dropped from the paper. Will the Minister undertake to write to me, and will she provide us with the full details of how Operation Crackdown compares with the previous five years?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-39_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b> 
 Order. This is a Third Reading debate with a limited amount of time&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Order. With limited time and three long interventions such as those that we have had, we may not make progress as we should.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050222/debtext/50222-40.htm"/>




<p><a name="50222-40_spnew0"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 I am mindful of what you say, Mr.&nbsp;Deputy Speaker. I shall look at <i>Hansard</i> and reflect on what the hon. Lady said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-40_para0">
The Bill builds on a strategy dealing with better enforcement in relation to supply and with how we might better engage young people, as well as get those who are addicted to drugs into treatment. That applies to those who are committing crimes, but our intervention in building capacity is also having a knock-on effect for those who are addicted to drugs but are not committing crimes. As I said, the Bill builds on that strategy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-40_para1">
Several measures in parts 1&nbsp;and 2&nbsp;are a direct result of working with and listening to groups such as police forces from around the country and other organisations in respect of the need to have specific targeted powers to tackle the problems of street-level dealing of class A drugs. We had a wide-ranging discussion earlier about the vicinity of schools and part of a discussion about children being used as couriers, so I shall not expand any further on those issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-40_para2">
We are also giving police and courts additional powers to tackle drug dealers who swallow drugs or conceal them about their bodies, and we believe that the measures in the Bill will send a clear message to street-level drug dealers that it will be more difficult to hide evidence and escape prosecution where they have committed an offence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-40_para3">
On the powers for testing on arrest and follow-up assessment, we have again learned from experience. While we were making in-roads with those whom we were testing on charge, who would perhaps present themselves for voluntary assessment if they were found class A positive as a result of such a test, we felt that we wanted to tighten that procedure. That is why we believe that testing on arrest is important and that making the assessment following a positive test should be mandatory, rather than voluntary. Of course, that links to the other measures that we already have on bail conditions at court, as well as other provisions in the Bill allowing for police bail to take into account someone&#039;s co-operation in dealing with their drug misuse problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-40_para4">
Since antisocial behaviours were introduced, they have become a vital tool. The hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) is obviously aware of that, and she would like to see them extended to Northern Ireland. The new civil intervention order that we are seeking to introduce will allow us to continue tackling the underlying causes of a person&#039;s antisocial behaviour. There is already provision for such an order to apply to young people with drugs problems who are involved in antisocial behaviour, but we felt that there was a gap in respect of some adults for whom there might be a problem.

<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 274</b>

<p>
<a name="50222-40_para5">
Clarifying the status of fresh magic mushrooms is an issue that we debated in Committee. The issue is not defining magic mushrooms as a harmful drug. It is a harmful and hallucinogenic drug that is on a par with LSD, but what we are trying to do is close a gap whereby some 400&nbsp;outlets have developed&#151;I was going to say mushroomed&#151;in the past year. The outlets are selling the mushrooms fresh and not in a prepared state, thereby exploiting a loophole in the current law. We are closing down that avenue as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-40_para6">
The Bill adds to what we are already achieving. It is based on gaps that people have identified and experience of implementation of the law as it stands. I hope that it sends a strong message that illegal drugs are a blight on our communities and that they have to be tackled not only on an international and national level, but also on a community level. I believe that we now have the framework in place to tackle the issue on all fronts. I was involved with the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill. The fact that the serious organised crime agency will have as its priorities drug and immigration crime will be an important contribution to this area, and through the Bill before us, we can further seek to deal with these problems in a real, practical and meaningful way.

<p><a name="50222-40_spnew1"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I say to the Minister that I am not being curmudgeonly. I acknowledge that she has listened to what the Opposition had to say. As I said, we conducted the passage of the Bill in relative harmony until the past few hours, but we have rehearsed in the Chamber the problems with her administrative arrangements, and I am sure that she will try in future to do better.
</p>

<a name="50222-40_para7">
We have not however had time to discuss the Bill. For example, we have not had the opportunity today to discuss new clause 1, an important clause which indicates that the Conservative party would reclassify cannabis. I felt that is was important to discuss that subject in the context of the Bill, not least because yesterday&#039;s <i>Daily Mail</i> trumpeted the success of the Government&#039;s drugs policy in an article entitled, &quot;Cannabis sales bonanza&quot;:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The supply of cannabis has turned into a boom industry since the drug was downgraded, it was claimed yesterday. Police have made several large seizures in the South East since it was reclassified from a Class B to a Class C drug in January last year. They believe criminals are trafficking huge quantities because they think law enforcement agencies &#039;have taken their eye off the ball&#039;. Officers have been under orders to stop arresting adults for possessing cannabis, except in exceptional circumstances, and to let them off with a warning and confiscation instead. The idea was to give police more time to tackle the trade in hard drugs such as heroin. But Scotland Yard chiefs believe the switch has sent out the &#039;wrong message&#039; to criminal gangs, who are now focusing their attention on the softer drug. &#039;One of the biggest growth areas in the shifting of organised crime towards cannabis importation,&#039; a senior Yard source said yesterday.&quot; <i>[Interruption.]</i></p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-40_para8">
The fact that the Whip is scoffing from the Front Bench shows that he does not think that the use of cannabis is a problem, which reflects the Government&#039;s attitude. Fortunately, that is not the Conservative party&#039;s attitude towards cannabis, and it is a shame that we were not able to have the discussion that we deserved on the Bill.

Few problems facing our society today cause so much crime, misery, pain and the squandering of human talent as drug abuse and addiction, and one has only to

<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 275</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>examine the statistics for the prison population to see the evidence. More than 55&nbsp;per cent. of convicted prisoners report committing offences connected with their drug taking, with the need for money to buy drugs being the most commonly cited factor. Shoplifting, burglary, vehicle crime and theft are all linked to drug misuse. Think of all the victims who are affected by drugs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-40_para10">
At the same time, the number of people imprisoned for drugs offences is high and growing. Back in 1993, drugs offences accounted for 7&nbsp;per cent. of male and 27&nbsp;per cent. of female sentenced prisoners. By 2002, the percentages had grown to 16&nbsp;per cent. of male and 40&nbsp;per cent. of female sentenced prisoners. The criminal possession and use of firearms is rising, particularly in urban areas, and the price of drugs has dropped alarmingly. Drug trafficking continues to be highly profitable and attracts more and more recruits from street dealing to manufacturing and importing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-40_para11">
The Government have offered up a very small and very thin Drugs Bill in the shadow of a general election. Why has it taken so long to introduce this particular Bill? I have a BBC news item from 21&nbsp;May 2002, which stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Drug dealers who target children at the school gate could face longer jail sentences under a new law being considered by the government.&quot;</p>
</ul>

At that time, my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) was shadow Education Secretary. He said that

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the government had clearly not thought the matter through and accused ministers of operating &#039;a media-driven stunt&#039;&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-40_para13">
Today, we can see that it was a media-driven stunt, because the Government have had two years in which to introduce the provisions around schools. They did not choose to do so, and now they have introduced the Bill, they have not offered the full protection that we expect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-40_para14">
I am disappointed that the Under-Secretary would not accept amendments Nos. 5&nbsp;and 6. I do not want to rehearse the arguments, but it is obvious that she is leaving loopholes in the measure. She has not drawn up clause 1&nbsp;in a way that will protect our children adequately.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-40_para15">
The Bill is a missed opportunity. It has missed the opportunity to protect children wherever they congregate. The Under-Secretary has not protected even the most obvious places. On Report, she suggested that even a project to which schoolchildren are sent because they do not respond to teaching in school will fall outside the provisions. That means that vulnerable children will not be adequately protected in an educational environment. She has failed to grasp the opportunity to protect even youth clubs or other places where young people gather.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-40_para16">
The hon. Lady has failed to reclassify cannabis. She has spent a lot of money on telling people that it remains illegal, but the latest reports make it clear that cannabis use and importation are growing. She failed to reclassify even khat, which was raised in Committee.

<p><a name="50222-41_spnew0"><b> Caroline Flint: </b>

<p><a name="50222-41_spnew1"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 I agree that the Under-Secretary said that she would consider the matter, but it is a little late. Introducing a Drugs Bill now and pushing it through so rapidly without taking advice on one of most obvious matters that was raised on Second Reading is unforgivable. Failing to consider reclassifying khat constitutes another missed opportunity.

<a name="50222-41_para0">
The Under-Secretary has missed the opportunity to increase residential rehabilitation and to encourage schools such as the Abbey school to introduce random drug testing.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-41_spnew2"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The hon. Lady accuses me of missing an opportunity to increase the provision of residential rehabilitation as a form of treatment. We are putting a record amount of money into communities to develop drug treatment, which includes residential treatment. The issue is about not including a provision to increase residential treatment on the face of the Bill, but putting in the money to invest in the treatment so that it can be provided. The National Treatment Agency is considering that, too. Provision exists and we are increasing capacity. That does involves not a Bill but the Government&#039;s commitment to provide the resources to make things happen.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-41_spnew3"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 The Under-Secretary&#039;s words are hollow and I shall set out our intentions shortly. There has been a missed opportunity and the Minister&#039;s comments are mere bluff and sentences thrown out purely for media benefit, not long-term benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-41_para1">
The Under-Secretary has missed the opportunity to set mandatory sentences for repeat drug offences by drug dealers. She has missed the opportunity to provide for automatic custodial sentences for those who deal to children. She has missed the opportunity to convince me that she has more plans for increasing the training and supply of suitably qualified drugs workers and assessors. We discussed that in Committee, and nothing she said will increase the qualifications and standards of people who treat drug users.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-41_para2">
The Government should make a clear statement about drugs. They should have welcomed my suggestions for strengthening the Bill&#039;s provisions for dealing with drugs. The Government&#039;s message has failed the clarity test on many occasions and it lacks urgency. If I am in charge of drugs policy after the election, we will convey a clear message to people about drugs. We will reclassify cannabis to end Labour&#039;s confusion and send a clear message that the drug is dangerous.We will ensure that the message gets across that drugs are dangerous and illegal, that they ruin lives and that people should not take them. We will also ensure that random drug testing is supported for schools, and we will certainly allow head teachers to have the final say on expulsions. We will also provide the resources to enable drug addicts who wish to get off drugs to take up residential rehabilitation, by massively expanding the number of places available above and beyond the 2,500&nbsp;that exist at present.

<br>&nbsp;<br>provisions and perhaps add to them. Rather than being a comprehensive attempt to tackle a growing problem, this is a Bill that has been slipped in to try to boost the illusion that the Government are taking action when, in fact, very little has occurred. It is basically a cynical electioneering platform. After the election, however, we will have the opportunity to put forward a well thought through, resourced programme of action to help the addicts who wish to reform, to punish the dealers who peddle misery and death, and to protect our children. That day cannot come soon enough.

I have found working on the Bill to be both an enjoyable and a frustrating experience. Our proceedings in Committee were remarkably good-natured and constructive, and in that regard, I give due credit to the Minister and to the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Heppell). I enjoyed working with them both, and we were able to improve the Bill. Credit for that must also go to those on the Conservative Front Bench. I found the experience frustrating, however, because we could have done so much more.

Controlled drugs blight many of our communities. In my professional experience, I am aware of a number of fishing communities in the north-east of Scotland where such drugs have taken hold and destroyed otherwise highly coherent and strong communities. In my constituency, we often congratulate ourselves on our good quality of life, but we have also seen the growing presence of drugs. I am reassured to some extent, however, when I see a determination to tackle the problem, particularly in Shetland. I am thinking particularly of the dogs against drugs project, in which local people have rallied against the growing threat of class A drugs in their midst. I want to place on record, however, that it is unfortunate that some of the funding that could be made available to such projects has not been made available&#151;in this case, from the Scottish Executive, who have been asked, and have hitherto refused, to make funds available from the money recovered under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.

 The hon. Gentleman says that we are part of the Scottish Executive. He is very perceptive: I have never sought to deny that. However, the Liberal Democrats do not have to pretend that everything that we do in Government is correct. There is occasionally scope for improvement, and I would commend such an approach to Back-Bench Labour MPs, if any were in the Chamber to hear it.

<a name="50222-41_para6">
Others have observed that this is an election Bill. I drew that inevitable conclusion on Second Reading, and I am afraid that everything I have seen subsequently has served only to reinforce that view. We need something rather more comprehensive. Every 10&nbsp;years or so, we have a revision of the Road Traffic Acts, but it is now more than 30&nbsp;years since we had a comprehensive review of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, and such a review is long overdue. The best illustration of that came from our discussions on classification, particularly of psilocybin, or magic mushrooms. If we are to classify drugs according to their harm, the classifications A, B and C under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971&nbsp;manifestly are no longer sufficient.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-41_para7">
Instead, the Government propose revisions of the 1971&nbsp;Act in clauses 1, 2&nbsp;and 21. I feel that clause 1&nbsp;is an exercise in window dressing that does not achieve a great deal. I was reinforced in my view when I read <i>The Press and Journal&#151;</i>a publication that I commend to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham as being infinitely superior to <i>The Daily Telegraph&#151;</i>which reported on its front page of 29&nbsp;January 2005, &quot;Sheriff Lashes Out At Cannabis Confusion&quot;.
</p>





<p><i>The Press and Journal</i> reported a case from Aberdeen sheriff court, where the presiding sheriff was Sheriff Douglas Cusine, who in a previous incarnation as Professor Douglas Cusine was foolish enough to try to teach me conveyancing, but who otherwise is a man of blameless judgment and reputation. It will be of interest to the hon. Lady that the sheriff said that the reclassification of cannabis from B to C
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;caused confusion in the minds of some&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-41_para8">
He went on:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I myself have some difficulty in understanding precisely what message it is the Government was intending to convey because cannabis is no less dangerous than it was before and the penalties for being involved in cannabis are exactly the same.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-41_para9">
The case was brought against Craig Meldrum, who was sentenced to two months&#039; detention in a young offenders&#039; institution for supplying cannabis&#151;presumably cannabis resin&#151;at Ellon academy in Aberdeenshire. Sheriff Cusine observed that drugs are the scourge of many schools and have to be tackled. He also said that supplying is serious, particularly when the &quot;targets&quot; are schoolchildren.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-41_para10">
I bring that matter to the attention of the House because here we have an example of a sheriff applying the law as it stands and giving a more serious sentence&#151;an aggravated sentence&#151;where the supply in question concerns children in school. In other words, the law as it exists operates quite adequately to protect against the mischief that the Minister seeks to remedy. That is why I say that so much in Bill is in many ways merely window dressing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-41_para11">
I also have reservations about the operation of clause 2. Those were rehearsed on Second Reading and in Committee so I shall not go over them again, but I take issue with the claims made on behalf of the clause by the Minister in her letter to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham, dated 22&nbsp;February 2005, which has already been referred to. I draw the attention of the House to paragraph 5, where the Minister states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Nonetheless our view is that this clause is a sensible step to take. It has advantages in that (a) not all defendants will be able to successfully&quot;&#151;</p>

I am not quite sure why that is considered relevant. If it is perhaps being suggested that people who are not possessed of intent to supply will still be convicted I would have concerns.

<a name="50222-41_para18">
The classification of magic mushrooms as a class A drug does not make ready sense to me. Putting them in class A, where they are on a parallel with heroin and cocaine, is difficult to justify and eloquently shows the inadequacy of the law as it stands.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-41_para19">
As I have said, there is no doubt that drugs are a growing menace in our society. However, little that has been done in the 33&nbsp;years since the enactment of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971&nbsp;seems to have been particularly effective. Nothing seems to have stopped the growing menace that permeates so many parts of our society. Drugs dealing seems to be a many-headed hydra&#151;for every dealer who is removed, another three take his or her place. Surely this is a time to stop, take proper stock and proper consideration, and to ask whether things might be done better were much of this consideration removed from the political forum, which, notwithstanding the good nature of these proceedings, has been shown to be wholly inadequate to the task.

I very much regret that not a lot in the Bill will make an awful lot of difference in the long run. I am not opposing the Bill; I just wish that the Government had introduced something that the House could have approved and supported rather more enthusiastically than I am able to do tonight.

 No doubt like many other Members, I represent a constituency in which heroin use is quite a serious problem in the villages of south Bedfordshire that I represent and in the former market towns in my constituency. Tonight, however, I want to speak about cannabis. The Government&#039;s declassification of cannabis from class B to C, and the consequences of that, is one of the actions of their term in office about which I am most upset and angry.
</p>

<a name="50222-42_para0">
About a year ago, I attended a mental health carers support group meeting in my constituency. About 12&nbsp;people came to the meeting that evening, all of whom cared for sufferers of mental illness, mainly family 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 280</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>members. Some eight or nine out of the 12, when they explained the situation of their son, daughter or partner, were absolutely clear that cannabis had been the cause of the mental illness from which they were suffering. I see the Minister shaking her head when I say that, but an increasing amount of research evidence also points to that, and the fact is that cannabis today is considerably stronger and more dangerous than that which was smoked many years ago.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-42_spnew1"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 May I ask the hon. Gentleman what evidence he has for his allegation that cannabis is stronger now than it was years ago? We take samples from police forces&#039; seizures, which are examined by the Forensic Science Service and others, which show that the vast majority of cannabis used in this country is no stronger than it was 10&nbsp;or 20&nbsp;years ago.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-42_spnew2"><b> Andrew Selous: </b> 
 The Minister will be aware that there is research that disputes that. She will have seen such research reports, but it is not the time, with a few minutes remaining, to go into that in great detail. The fact is that there is a considerable body of opinion that believes that cannabis is stronger now and causes mental health problems. It worries me massively that the Minister sits there shaking her head and denying it. I wish that she could have come with me to that mental health carers support group meeting and met the families caring for the people concerned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-42_para1">
I shall tell the Minister about one more individual, and I would be grateful if she could listen to this story. A young man who came to see me with his mother about three weeks ago had been on the threshold of a very bright future&#151;he had been the head boy of his school and all set for a career in the armed services&#151;but he is now completely in the hands of my local community health trust. He has a very serious mental illness problem, which is desperately sad for him and a great source of worry to his family, and which consumes a considerable amount of public funds. I spent half an hour with his mother two weeks ago, and she is adamant that what switched her son&#039;s future from being bright and promising was falling in with the wrong crowd and taking cannabis. That is the mother&#039;s view. The Minister can sit there and shake her head, but I ask her to consider the feelings of the families involved. She asked me about the research evidence. According to reports I have seen, there is research evidence suggesting that cannabis is causing such problems. I know that many of her hon. Friends feel as strongly as I do about that.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-42_spnew3"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 Just about everything that the hon. Gentleman has said, including what he said about availability and increased strength, could equally be said of alcohol. Is he suggesting that we should prohibit alcohol?
</p>





<p><a name="50222-42_spnew4"><b> Andrew Selous: </b> 
 What I am saying is that the declassification from B to C has sent entirely the wrong message. The hon. Gentleman will know as well as I do&#151;indeed, he said as much in his own speech, to which I listened with great interest, when he spoke about the sheriff in Aberdeen&#151;that many people, including young 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 281</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>people, who do not read the minutiae of the law gain the general impression from this place that cannabis is more generally acceptable than it has been.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-42_spnew5"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Although cannabis has been reclassified, it is still an illegal drug, and our post-reclassification evaluation shows that 93&nbsp;per cent. of young people recognise that. The hon. Gentleman should also acknowledge that there are different types of illegal drug. We have heroin, we have cocaine, we have amphetamines and we have cannabis. We should have a credible message for young people about recognising the different harms that those drugs cause&#151;for they all cause harm&#151;so that we can engage with them better about the consequences of using the various drugs, and explain how they can protect themselves. That is not to suggest that young people should take cannabis; they should not. We must send a credible message about the different drugs, however&#151;and amphetamines, heroin and crack cocaine could also exacerbate a mental illness.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-42_spnew6"><b> Andrew Selous: </b> 
 Of course I accept that neither the Minister nor any other Member present wants to encourage young people to have contact with cannabis or any other drug, but that is not the impression that most young people have.
</p>





<p><a name="50222-42_spnew7"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 The Independent Drug Monitoring Unit estimates that we spend between &#163;2&nbsp;billion and &#163;5&nbsp;billion a year on cannabis. According to European Union figures, one in 10&nbsp;British adults is using cannabis. I think that that justifies the points that my hon. Friend is making.
</p>

 I am glad to hear that.

<p>
<a name="50222-42_para2">
I think that there is now confusion in the minds of the police, a point made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan). Let me give another example: that of a rather nasty divorce case, in which a departing father is turning a blind eye to his 17-year-old son&#039;s smoking of cannabis in the presence of his 11-year-old daughter. According to reports I have received, when the police have visited the premises they have been confused about exactly what powers they have and do not have as a result of the reclassification of cannabis. The Minister may be unhappy about that and say that it should not be the case, but it is a further example of what is happening on the ground.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-42_para3">
On the basis of the evidence on mental illness and the reaction and attitude of the police, I must tell the Minister that there is great confusion about the issue, and that she really should think again.

In the short time that I have left, I want to correct a few points. A point was made about articles in the press about a drugs surge following the change in the law relating to cannabis. I assure the House that I do not know which senior member of the squad expressed those views; it would be nice if that person could be named. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 282</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>What I do know is that those views do not reflect the view of the Metropolitan police or, for that matter, that of the Association of Chief Police Officers, which supports the policy of reclassification of cannabis.Since reclassification, an additional 199,000&nbsp;police hours have been saved. I am quite happy when I hear of attempts by the police to run operations to identify and catch people who are supplying huge volumes of cannabis&#151;

<p>
<a name="50222-42_para5">
I am happy about that because it shows that the police are diverting their activity to where it is most necessary: to the import and distribution of drugs&#151;cannabis or any other drug. The people involved in the distribution of drugs deal not just with cannabis but with heroin and cocaine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-42_para6">
In relation to mental health, there is no proven causal link between cannabis and mental health problems but we recognise that people who have an underlying mental health issue and use drugs can exacerbate their problems.

<p><a name="50222-43_spnew0"><b> Mr. Robert Walter  (North Dorset) (Con):</b> 
 The subject of the debate is of much interest in my constituency, particularly in the Blandford area. May I express my thanks to the Bishop of Salisbury, the Rt. Rev. David Stancliffe, who is a member of the other place, to his director of education for Salisbury diocese, Mr. Simon Tong and to the director of education for Dorset county council, David Goddard, for their help in preparing me for this debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-43_para1">
Capital funding is applied to voluntary-aided schools via three routes. There is the devolved formula capital, which is allocated directly to schools by formula on an annual basis for their discretionary use on a range of capital items. That is typically about &#163;25,000&nbsp;for a primary school and &#163;90,000&nbsp;for a secondary school at current rates. There is then the more important local education authority co-ordinated voluntary-aided programme, known as LCVAP, which is allocated annually to local education authorities by formula and distributed by them and the dioceses for expenditure on agreed middle-range capital projects, usually up to about &#163;400,000&nbsp;each. There is a restricted number of projects annually under that programme. The third route is the targeted capital funding, which is allocated centrally against bids by the local education authority and the dioceses for major capital projects.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-43_para2">
The main capital baseline for voluntary-aided schools covers the LCVAP and the targeted capital funding. The devolved formula capital is funded in addition to those. That is a complex system that has, I am told, proved difficult for the Department for Education and Skills to control and monitor. The annual announcements have become increasingly erratic in their timing, often coming months after their scheduled dates.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-43_para3">
I am told that a point was reached in June last year at which no further funding could be allocated, a moratorium on targeted capital funding bids was called and the LCVAP allocations summarily reduced. Only the devolved formula capital continued unabated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-43_para4">
That has caused great problems for the dioceses and indirectly for the local education authorities. For example, my own Salisbury diocese is owed some &#163;200,000&nbsp;by the Department for outstanding works at Verwood Trinity Church of England first school in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope). I understand that liability is accepted but that payment has not yet been approved because of lack of money in the VA capital budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-43_para5">
Although that crisis has forced the setting up of a joint working group between the Department and the dioceses to create a more manageable system, and although the latest announcements by the Government indicate some cause for optimism, the current situation is extremely difficult. It will continue thus until greater clarity emerges.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-43_para6">
The Salisbury diocese, which covers my constituency, has so many Church schools that any local education authority initiative that is not matched by voluntary&#150;aided funding could result in a disparity of

<br>&nbsp;<br>provision, even within the same town or area. Until now, the main driver of improvements to the diocesan building stock has been the LCVAP, but the national allocation has been drastically reduced in the current year and beyond. In 2003&#150;04, it was &#163;210&nbsp;million; for 2004&#150;05, it is &#163;108&nbsp;million; and in 2005&#150;06&nbsp;it will be &#163;80&nbsp;million. In 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08, the estimated allocation is &#163;66&nbsp;million. The LCVAP allocation for Church schools in Dorset is &#163;0.6&nbsp;million for 2005&#150;06, &#163;0.5&nbsp;million for 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and &#163;0.51&nbsp;million for 2007&#150;08. There were successful targeted capital funding bids in Dorset of &#163;1.2&nbsp;million in both 2003&#150;04&nbsp;and 2004&#150;05, but no bids are allowed for 2005&#150;06. It was only the diocese&#039;s ability to carry forward &#163;1.1&nbsp;million that enabled it even to look at any projects under the scheme. I understand that TCF bidding rounds will take place only every two years.

There has been a major crisis at Beachcroft primary school in Weymouth, which is in the constituency of the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight). However, he has made representations on this issue, so I do not want to dwell on it. Rather, I want to deal with the practical implications for major projects in my own constituency. Dorset local education authority is reorganising education in the Blandford area from three-tier to two-tier. That will incur significant building costs as first schools become primary schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-43_para8">
The diocese and the local education authority committed to this reorganisation in the expectation that TCF would be available to them, as it was in the previous year for the reorganisation of schools in the Shaftesbury pyramid, which is also in my constituency, and for the reorganisation of schools just across the border in west Wiltshire and Salisbury, which feed the Shaftesbury upper school. In that situation, the LCVAP could have covered the costs if the TCF had not been granted, but the 2004&#150;05&nbsp;bidding round was cancelled without warning, the LCVAP allocation was halved and a Church schools&#039; private finance initiative was axed. There is currently no funding stream in place for these school improvements.

In summarising the situation in Blandford, I want to express my thanks to the head teachers of those four schools: Richard Chapman, of Archbishop Wake school, Judy Baker of Blandford St. Mary school, Neil Tarchetti of Durweston first school, and Sue Tipping Spetisbury Hall and Slater&#039;s school.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 286</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>bids to that fund have been stopped this year and the system is currently under review. As a group of schools, they entered into the reorganisation on the understanding that the required capital works, which are considerable, would commence in the academic year 2005&#150;06. Work starting at this time is essential, because it is when the reorganisation takes place and the time at which this group of schools has to start providing a first-class education for the additional older children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-43_para12">
Now that the funding has been withdrawn, the expected date for the completion of the work could be as late as 2008; without the target capital funding money, the diocese does not have the funds to carry out the work. That is particularly disturbing for a number of reasons. More than half the children in the Blandford pyramid are educated in voluntary-aided schools, and they will suffer from the lack of funding. As a pyramid of schools, they ensured complete unity and parity in the process up to now. The funding problem will prevent them from continuing in the same manner.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-43_para13">
The reorganisation appears to fit in with the Government&#039;s education policy, but the funding is not secure to carry it through. The lack of parity is made worse as the local education authority appears to have other ways to fund the required works for its schools. That means that the Church schools are disadvantaged when the LEA initiates a reorganisation, as it does not have a duty to the Church schools to see that it is carried through successfully. The Department for Education and Skills demands that LEAs remove surplus capacity, but what happens when 50&nbsp;per cent. of the schools are actually voluntary aided? The LEA has a duty to reduce surplus accommodation, but no responsibility to the voluntary-aided schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-43_para14">
I put these questions to the Minister. Why has this funding been reduced at a time when the Government claim that they are spending more on education? Where has the money gone? Why, when Dorset receives the lowest central Government grant of any English local education authority, is the problem compounded by the adverse treatment of the diocesan schools&#039; budget? What hope can I give to my constituents?

<p><a name="50222-44_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Derek Twigg): </b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) on securing this debate on such an important issue. It gives me an opportunity to remind all hon. Members of the record levels of investment that the Government are making in all our schools. The voluntary-aided schools&#151;the category that most people think of as &quot;Church&quot; schools&#151;are receiving their fair and proportionate share of the investment. I appreciate that we have had to make some short-term adjustments to the balance in the various elements of that programme, and I will explain why in a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para0">
The capital programme for all voluntary-aided schools has increased from just above &#163;100&nbsp;million in 1996&#150;97&nbsp;to well over &#163;0.5&nbsp;billion pounds this year&#151;in fact, some &#163;540&nbsp;million. Voluntary-aided schools in Dorset are receiving their share of that money. Indeed, since 1997, the Department has approved major capital projects at voluntary-aided schools in Dorset with a total value in excess of &#163;19&nbsp;million.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 287</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para1">
We are aware that there are plans in parts of Dorset that may need major investment. We are announcing this week the details of the next round of bidding for the associated funding. Officials are prepared to work with the local authority and the relevant dioceses to ensure a consistent approach and consistent outcomes. I am particularly concerned that the voluntary-aided sector should not be at a disadvantage in relation to other categories of school. That is why I am keen that we reach agreement on funding for the planned reorganisation in the Blandford area. I shall say more about that shortly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para2">
I should also set the particular issues in a wider context. The capital programme for all maintained schools has gone from a totally inadequate base of less than &#163;700&nbsp;million in 1996&#150;97&nbsp;to &#163;5.5&nbsp;billion in the coming year. That will rise to &#163;6.3&nbsp;billion in 2007&#150;08. That is enabling us to begin a radical programme, &quot;Building Schools for the Future&quot;, to bring every secondary school in the country up to 21st-century standards. This programme will include all schools, including those that are voluntary-aided.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para3">
I appreciate that it will be some time before Dorset schools benefit from the programme, but departmental officials are meeting local authority representatives early next month to discuss what we can do to help target the most pressing needs. More than a quarter of all local authorities are making a start with the programme now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para4">
This increased funding also has wider benefits. Support is being provided for a more diverse range of faith schools to become voluntary aided. They include Muslim, Greek Orthodox, and Seventh Day Adventist schools. In addition, more than &#163;3.5&nbsp;million has been provided to support the first Montessori school proposed to join the state sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para5">
On top of the &#163;19&nbsp;million, we have increased the amounts that we pay to individual voluntary-aided schools by way of devolved former capital grant. The amount going to schools in Dorset has increased from &#163;419,000&nbsp;in 2000&#150;01, when the grant was introduced, to &#163;1.6&nbsp;million in the coming year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para6">
The money enables schools to decide their specific priorities for smaller-scale investment. A typical primary school will receive &#163;34,000&nbsp;in 2007&#150;08, compared with &#163;12,000&nbsp;when the grant was introduced five years ago. A typical secondary school will get &#163;113,000, compared with &#163;35,000&nbsp;in 2000&#150;01. I shall say something in a minute about the improvements that we plan to make to the way in which we pay the grant to voluntary-aided schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para7">
The hon. Member for North Dorset asked about another part of the capital programme for voluntary-aided schools&#151;the local education authority co-ordinated voluntary aid programme, or LCVAP. The aim of LCVAP is to allow local decisions to be taken to prioritise need and ensure that locally agreed capital work is carried out. The sums are calculated by formula, and are normally used for medium-scale capital works, although bigger projects can be funded by spreading the costs over more than one year. The money is allocated to individual projects by partnerships between local authorities and voluntary-aided sector representatives. At present, the Department retains the money, which is then paid direct to schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para8">
We are aware that the voluntary-aided sector prefers to manage and prioritise work through this programme. For a number of years, the level of LCVAP has 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 288</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>increased significantly. In Dorset, the amount has risen from some &#163;200,000&nbsp;in 1996&#150;97&nbsp;to &#163;1.8&nbsp;million in 2003&#150;04. However, pressures elsewhere in the voluntary-aided capital programme meant that although the total programme had been increasing, we had to reduce the LCVAP element from this year, to ensure that the total programme for the voluntary-aided sector was not overspent. We also had to stop approving new projects towards the end of last year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para9">
One of the pressures on the voluntary-aided schools capital programme has been the devolved formula capital. Schools are allowed to roll their entitlement for up to three years, but the annual nature of public sector funding meant that there were difficulties in carrying forward the corresponding amounts of money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para10">
The sector has already benefited from the money in other ways, of which extra funding through LCVAP is one, but the difficulties also coincided with the large backlog of commitments built up on the bigger projects approved in earlier years. That mainly resulted from progress on building works being slower than expected&#151;because of unexpected increases in costs, the vagaries of the weather, or delays arising from local issues, such as securing appropriate planning permissions. A combination of those factors meant that, to ensure that we did not overspend, it became necessary to reduce LCVAP. That was the only option available to us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para11">
The sector has generally understand that we had to do something. To resolve the problem, we have allocated additional money to the voluntary-aided capital programme for 2006&#150;07&nbsp;onwards. For the coming year of 2005&#150;06, we have had to retain the reduced level of LCVAP, but we have announced that there will be a minimum level of LCVAP for 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para12">
We have established a voluntary-aided capital working group, with representatives from the stakeholders in the voluntary-aided sector. It now includes a representative from the Dorset local authority. At its meeting last week, the group confirmed its wish to see as much as possible being paid through LCVAP. In light of that discussion, officials are working out the details of how the voluntary-aided capital programme could be divided into various elements. We will announce the final programme to 2007&#150;08&nbsp;by the end of next month.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para13">
I fully expect that we will be able to increase LCVAP very substantially. Not only does that demonstrate our investment, it shows that we value the views of our partners in helping us to get the right balance between formulaic and targeted capital programmes that will ensure that the sector&#039;s needs are met. We are also arranging a conference in March for the major stakeholders in voluntary-aided schools to explain to them in detail how the voluntary-aided capital programme is formed, so that they understand the parameters within which we need to work. I am sure that it will be helpful to all those involved in the process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para14">
I understand that plans had been in place to use Dorset&#039;s share of the LCVAP programme to fund a planned reorganisation in Blandford, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. Inevitably, considerable disappointment was felt when that could not proceed as planned. Although we had suggested alternative solutions to the problem, one of the options may no 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 289</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>longer be available. It was to use funds from an existing project in Dorset that has not been able to progress for one of the reasons that I mentioned earlier. That money is not now available because there has been a fire at the school and some immediate funding is needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para15">
It is therefore important that we work together to ensure that the best possible case is put forward, if it is still appropriate, for funding through our targeted capital funding route. Alternatively, those involved might think that the matter is better left until LCVAP funding is available again. That is why I have asked officials to work together with local stakeholders, as I mentioned earlier. I should also say that, as a general principle, we have also strengthened our internal processes to ensure that different outcomes do not arise for voluntary-aided schools if there is a clear link with decisions to be taken on other funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para16">
I will ensure that the hon. Gentleman is made aware of the outcomes of the discussions that take place between officials and those representing the local authority and the diocese. I wish to make it clear again that I understand the concerns that the hon. Gentleman has expressed about the apparent reduction in capital funding for voluntary-aided schools in his constituency. He also mentioned that my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight) had made representations to colleagues in the Department about the funding in Dorset and the implications in his constituency. However, in the bigger picture, there is no reduction, but the money has, of necessity, had to be reallocated in different ways to meet the sector&#039;s needs. As I have just mentioned, however, we are putting in even more 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>22 Feb 2005 : Column 290</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>money&#151;another &#163;80&nbsp;million over the two years 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08&#151;to help to ensure that the problem does not arise again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para17">
The debate gives me the opportunity to remind the House that in 2002, the Government introduced a major reform of the basis for funding voluntary-aided schools through one of the first orders under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. We are building on that, together with the relevant stakeholders, and looking at the scope for simplification of the processes used to allocate and pay grant to those schools. Our aim will be to place as much responsibility for decision making and funding as possible where it should be&#151;at local level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para18">
For example, I mentioned earlier the devolved formula capital grant that all maintained schools receive. For the voluntary-aided sector we propose to pay that money directly to the individual schools, without the need for a claim. We are also looking at the possibility of paying all capital grant to the voluntary-aided sector in a way that is much more in line with that used for other types of schools, although that will not entail any changes to the underlying principles relating to the voluntary-aided sector. The very simple aims are to cut out any unnecessary bureaucracy in the processes and to ensure greater consistency of treatment&#151;I am sure that we would all agree with that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50222-44_para19">
I acknowledge the problems that have occurred. I hope that I have been able to assure the hon. Gentleman that we are aware of them and are trying to arrive at solutions that will benefit Blandford in particular and Dorset in general.
