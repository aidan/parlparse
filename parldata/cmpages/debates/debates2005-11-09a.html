</p>


<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51109-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development  (Hilary Benn): </b> 
 Malawi had a poor harvest earlier this year due to severe drought. Almost 2 million people have received food aid since June and that figure will rise   to more than 4 million before the next harvest in April 2006. A new assessment published this week indicates that some additional maize is needed due to an increase in the price. The Department for International Development&#039;s commitment of &#163;15.2 million to help deal with the food crisis is the largest donor contribution and we are ready to do more if required.
</p>





<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51109-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 This year&#039;s harvest in Malawi was exceptionally poor and the Secretary of State will be aware that there are another five months until the next one. The situation is bad and getting worse. Given that the Church of Scotland estimates that some 5 million lives may be at risk in Malawi, what steps can he take to ensure that those people are not left to die?
</p>





<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51109-01_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern about the seriousness of the situation. The harvest was down by about a quarter and Malawi now seems to suffer a very severe drought every 10 years. However, the assessment system for anticipating the scale of the crisis has worked quite well. We currently estimate that, overall, about 4.4 million people will require food. Of course, the problem is not just the failure of the harvest but the impact of AIDS on people&#039;s capacity to cope, along with the high price of maize. From memory, maize costs some 16 kwacha per kilo in the north of the country and 46 kwacha per kilo in the south, where the   problem is most acute. Trying to bring down the price so that people can afford to buy maize is important, but above all, it is about ensuring that food is distributed. I spoke to the Malawian President last week, and to the Finance Minister this morning, about the situation. The steps that are being taken suggest that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 288</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the international community and the Government of Malawi, working together, will be in a position to deal with the crisis, but we keep the situation under very close review.
</p>





<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51109-01_spnew2"><b> Hugh Bayley  (City of York)</b> 
 (Lab): Drought is not the only cause of the food crisis in Malawi&#151;a population weakened by AIDS is one that cannot get good agricultural yields. What longer-term help will my right hon. Friend&#039;s Department give to increase irrigation in Malawi, so that farmers are less subject to the vagaries of rainfall?
</p>





<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51109-01_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a good point about the importance of ensuring that farmers have the means to get the most produce out of their land. That includes trying to harvest water where possible, but drought clearly makes doing so difficult. It is also about providing and distributing seeds and fertilisers, and part of the money that we have made available in response to the current crisis is for that purpose, so that farmers, particularly those who may have had to eat the seeds or who cannot afford to buy fertilisers, are in a better position in the new planting season to plant and&#151;if the rains come, which I hope they will&#151;to get a better yield next year.
</p>





<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51109-01_spnew4"><b> Pete Wishart  (Perth and North Perthshire)</b> 
 (SNP): The Secretary of State will be aware of the Scottish Executive&#039;s useful and timely mission in Malawi just now. Can he assure me that he, his Department and the   Foreign and Commonwealth Office are doing all that they can to encourage and support the Scottish Executive in that mission? Does he further agree that the success of the mission demonstrates that the Scottish Parliament and other devolved institutions have a real   and meaningful role to play in international development?
</p>





<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51109-01_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I welcome the initiative on the part of the   Scottish Parliament and Executive to build on the historic links between Scotland and Malawi. My view is very simple. In the field of development&#151;in trying to help people around the world to build for themselves and their communities a better life&#151;there is more than   enough work to be done, so I welcome the Scottish   Executive supporting health and civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations and others. Everybody wants to contribute and we should welcome that fact.
</p>





<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51109-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Andy Reed  (Loughborough)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): My right hon. Friend is right to concentrate on the long-term solution to the situation in Malawi, but is he aware that   the World Food Programme estimates that it is $165 million short this year, while there is a food surplus in South Africa, just a few hundred miles away? Will he apply pressure internationally to ensure that enough money is put into the WFP, so that that short-term solution to the situation faced by 2 million Malawians is brought to fruition sooner, rather than later?
</p>





<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51109-01_spnew7"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The overall position is that the United Nations Malawi appeal asked for $88 million, only about half of which was directly related to the food crisis; the rest was for funding other development and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 289</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>humanitarian activities. The UN has received $29 million so far, but the Government of Malawi have received $60 million, so, overall, Malawi has $89 million with which to respond to the crisis, rather than the $88 million that the UN asked for. I know from talking to the Malawian President and Finance Minister that   every effort is being made to procure maize from   wherever it can be found. Indeed, part of the procurement process in which DFID and the European Union have been engaged is resulting in trucks carrying maize entering the country almost daily. I also pay tribute to the United States of America, which is doing a great deal in this crisis.
</p>





<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51109-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering)</b> 
 (Con): The Secretary of State&#039;s Department has been criticised for the use of consultants in Malawi and for the extensive expenses that were built up. Can he tell the House how many consultants his Department employs around the world and what safeguards are in place to ensure that their expenditure is spent effectively?
</p>





<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51109-01_spnew9"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The number varies from time to time and I will see whether I can come back to the hon. Gentleman with a figure. DFID&#039;s total expenditure on consultants as a proportion of our bilateral budget has fallen from 10 per cent., as I recollect it, in 1997&#150;98 to about 5 per cent. now, so it is a falling share compared with the position that we inherited in 1997. We use consultants for a range of activities, partly to help deliver programmes and partly to give us advice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">In respect of Malawi, I have to say that some of the   criticism was ill founded, because the training programmes that the National Democratic Institute was   engaged in were supporting civil society and parliamentarians in Malawi to think about how they could do their jobs more effectively. It included hiring rooms for training courses and feeding people who were attending them&#151;a normal day-to-day activity that Members of the House and of all organisations engage in. The feedback from participants in those programmes was that that support and training was very helpful in assisting them to do their job as elected representatives.

In the Minister&#039;s dealings with the UN and international donors, will he urge them to stress to recipient Governments that commitments to children suffering from or orphaned by AIDS and to the most vulnerable people affected by it should be met, as it is all too easy for those commitments to fall behind in comparison with those of more vocal sufferers?
</p>





<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51109-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 I join the hon.

He may know that we have committed, with UNICEF, to host its annual global partners forum, which looks at the specific needs of orphans and vulnerable children. This year, we will look at some of the blockages in getting the aid through to the non-governmental organisations working with orphans and vulnerable children at the grass roots. I am sure that he will also be aware that we have committed &#163;150 million over the next three years specifically for assistance to help orphans and vulnerable children affected by AIDS.

 I recognise the campaigning work that my hon. Friend has done on this issue. As I told the hon.

Friend has worked for and consistently advocated. On my recent visit to Malawi and Zambia, I   saw that delivery is speeding up, but more remains to be done. As she says, that will be the focus of our global partners forum meeting with UNICEF in February.

 (Con): Effective prevention, education and treatment in respect of HIV/AIDS are essential if we are to progress control of the   disease and Opposition Members welcome the aspirations in that regard at the G8 summit and the global fund replenishment summit. Increasingly, however, DFID&#039;s budget is being spent through partnerships with Governments, multilateral organisations and institutions, and NGOs&#151;channels that have minimal accountability. Will the Minister say what progress DFID has made since the critical report of November 2003 in monitoring and evaluating the channels through which British taxpayers&#039; money is spent? How will partnership performance be assessed and resources allocated to ensure maximum prevention, and maximum treatment, of HIV/AIDS?
</p>





<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51109-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#039;s premise that there is minimal accountability for the aid   that we dispense through budget support or multilateral organisations. There is a whole process of   auditing and assessing how the Government deliver aid and whether our arrangements are appropriate. Where our arrangements in-country are not appropriate, we will not dispense aid through budget support but work through NGOs or UN organisations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">I absolutely accept the point about the need to continue to focus on prevention of HIV/AIDS as well as on treatment. Over the past two years, significant attention has rightly been given to the question of how we get more access to antiretroviral drugs. We need to continue that work and to return to the question of how we can ensure that people have more access to the various prevention measures, such as condoms. We must also step up our research into developing a workable vaccine and an effective microbicide. In the run-up to world AIDS day, we are hosting an event for EU Development Ministers to look at that precise issue.

</p>


<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51109-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development  (Hilary Benn): </b> 
 The education for all global monitoring report, published today, highlights the continuing problem of children learning to read and write in sub-Saharan Africa. The UK is helping African countries to strengthen basic education, particularly for women and   girls. For example, in Zambia, where we support teaching children to read and write in their mother tongue before learning English, the programme has dramatically improved literacy rates.
</p>





<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51109-02_spnew0"><b> Barbara Keeley: </b> 
 There are two objectives in the children&#039;s literacy strategy&#151;to ensure that low literacy levels are lifted and, as my right hon. Friend noted, to close the gender equality gap. One of the millennium development goals is to close that gap by 2015, so will he say what progress is being made in that direction?

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 292</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>those objectives depends on the capacity of the Governments of developing countries to raise the finance, employ the teachers and build the schools. In particular relation to girls, the task is to address the other factors that prevent girls from getting to school. Something as practical as a lack of toilet facilities can make parents reluctant to send their daughters to school. Another factor could be the lack of clean water, because if water has to be fetched and carried from somewhere else, we know that that burden falls on girls and women. If girls have to fetch and carry water, they cannot go to school.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_2">School fees present another obstacle that has to be overcome, as they prevent poor families from sending their children to school. If those poor families have to make a choice, they may choose to pay fees for a boy but not for a girl. Those are the problems that we must address if we are going to help developing countries reach the 2015 target.

What steps could be taken or incentives offered to encourage trained teachers to remain in their countries and help increase literacy across Africa?
</p>





<p><a name="st_24"><a name="51109-02_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern about the problem. As he knows, the real problem involves the factors that drive teachers and other skilled professionals out of developing countries, such as poor   pay and working conditions, and the lack of opportunity for career and professional development. In the course of 2005, various commitments have been made to help developing countries improve pay and working conditions for teachers and provide more career and professional development, and the British Government have also increased aid to that end. Another obstacle is the lack of housing for teachers in rural areas: if there is no house to live in, is it any wonder that teachers are reluctant to go and work in a remote rural community? That is what we have to address, and our increased aid is supporting that effort.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-02_para1">
<a name="stpa_3">For example, the new president of Burundi has just abolished school fees. On the first day, 500,000 children turned up for school, 300,000 of whom had not been to school before. Although there is still the same number of teachers in the schools there, we have given the country some financial assistance to help it to begin to address that enormous challenge.

 I can tell the hon. Gentleman what we   have done. Two days after the earthquake struck, we issued a presidency statement and I have now written twice to EU Development Ministers. Along with Jan   Egeland, I briefed them at the informal meeting of EU Development Ministers in Leeds on 24 October. The   issue was also raised by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 18 October. Every country should look deeply into its conscience and ask itself if it is doing all that it can to help people who are in desperate need.
</p>





<p><a name="st_40"><a name="51109-02_spnew17"><b> Mr. Mitchell: </b> 
 May I suggest to the Secretary of State a specific way in which he could assist with that matter? After the Asian tsunami, the EU considered several trade measures to improve market access for the affected countries. Will he press the EU to liberalise its trade with Pakistan to promote economic recovery in that country? In particular, will he consider the inclusion of Pakistan in the generalised system of preferences&#151;the GSP-plus&#151;from which it was excluded earlier this year?

 I am sure that, as the European Union   considers how it may provide support to the reconstruction process, it will be happy to look at all possible measures. Issues, and some difficulties, would arise from the proposal that the hon. Gentleman makes, but I simply say to him that the task of reconstruction will be big and take a long time. Our immediate concern has to be with helping to save the lives of those who are in desperate need as we speak. The time will come for reconstruction and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will attend the conference in Pakistan being held on 19 November. We will make a commitment there to support the reconstruction, in the same way as Britain has played an honourable role in helping to save the lives of those affected by that terrible catastrophe.

 (LD): I agree with the   Secretary of State about the ongoing gravity of the situation, but he should bear in mind the fact that small charities such as Shelterbox are delivering more tents than big Government in the UK. When it takes three weeks to deliver Chinooks to the region, does the Secretary of State agree that lessons need to be learned from the response to the emergency? When the dust settles, will he review the

<p><a name="st_43"><a name="51109-02_spnew20"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I am happy to review the effectiveness, but I emphatically reject the implied criticism in the hon.   Gentleman&#039;s comment that somehow the British Government have been slow. The fact is that we were the first country in the world to send search and rescue teams. We have provided 5,500 tents, 27,000 blankets and 30,000 tarpaulins. We could do that so quickly precisely because we had prepared and we had those things in stock. We have now funded 65 flights for the   Disasters Emergency Committee, helping the NGO sector to bring in supplies. We are currently trying to find a way to lift the shelterboxes waiting to go. I simply ask Shelterbox to link up with one of the DEC agencies, as that is the most effective and easiest way of getting help to the region.

 The parliamentary skills group, which I   chair, has just published a report showing that MPs and businesses are concerned about funding and training in adult skills and learning, especially given the huge proportional rise in the population of older people that will occur over the next 10 years. Does the Prime Minister agree that we need to get rid of age barriers in apprenticeships and training, and does he accept that the Government need to bring the same passion and commitment as they have to other areas of education, and improve even on what they have already done in funding further education?

 I agree with my hon. Friend and I   welcome the publication of his report.

I   am delighted that, last week, figures showed that the milestone of 1 million adult learners achieving their first qualification had been exceeded. All that is good news, but my hon.

 We have made changes to try to reach a compromise; that is true. But I want to explain to   the right hon. and learned Gentleman and to his hon.   Friends why I believe this is so necessary. Let me emphasise again to the House: this proposal did not originate with the Government, it originated with the police and those responsible for anti-terrorist operations in our country. If I may quote from those responsible for conducting those operations, I will do so. The chief constable of Manchester, for example, said:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;The reality of the terrorism threat that we currently face is so horrendous in terms of the implications that we are having to intervene far earlier in the investigation than we ever would have during IRA campaigns . . . because with mass casualty terrorism we cannot afford to take any chances.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_8">And what we seek to do&#151;this ought to be capable of cool and rational debate&#151;is to test the extent to which the 90-day proposal can be justified. So let me ask the Prime Minister this specific question: can he identify a single case in which it has taken the police 90 days after arresting a suspect to find evidence sufficient to charge that person with a terrorist offence?
</p>





<p><a name="st_53"><a name="51109-03_spmin4"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I really have to say to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that I find it quite extraordinary that he seeks to suggest that there is somehow no evidence that the police are putting forward for the case that they are making. They have put forward detailed reasons as to why they believe these powers to be necessary. For example, just this last weekend, we arrested people on a terrorist operation. There were 750   gigabytes of data&#151;that is 66,000 ft-worth of data&#151;that would be printed out and have to be investigated. Just with the events of 7 July, there are two warehouse-fulls of exhibits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-03_para4">
<a name="stpa_9">We know that each of these terrorist operations has links to abroad. We know, for example, that it took two weeks, just in respect of the bomb factories in Leeds, to make them safe. That is what the police have set out time and again. That is why it is important that they have this power, as they say, to make our country safer, and they have given details of why they say that these powers are necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-03_para5">
<a name="stpa_10">Yes, it is true that we have agreed a sunset clause. Why? Because it is important. If people have these concerns, and I understand them, let us test it over the year. Let us see if the worries that people have are justified, or not. That is a reasonable thing to put forward. We have an independent review of the system&#151;Lord Carlile will also report on it&#151;but let us send out a signal from the House that, when it comes to defeating terrorism, we are going to give the police the powers that they need and back them.
</p>





<p><a name="st_54"><a name="51109-03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 Does not the Prime Minister recognise that it is the duty and responsibility of every single Member of this House to test the arguments that are put forward by the police? The Prime Minister and the Home Secretary have published various papers from the   police. None of those papers includes a single case about which the police say that it took 90 days after arresting someone to find the evidence required to charge them. I think that there is a general mood in the House for an increase in the time during which the police should be entitled to hold people without charge. The question is whether that period should be 90 days.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-03_para6">
<a name="stpa_11">I ask the Prime Minister again a very specific question. Can he provide the House with a single case in which it has taken the police 90 days after arresting a suspect to find evidence sufficient to charge that person with a terrorist offence?

<p><a name="st_55"><a name="51109-03_spmin5"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I suggest, before we have the vote, that Opposition Members and the right hon. and learned Gentleman once again read the report that Andy Hayman provided that gave precise examples of the circumstances in which he needed a detention period of up to 90 days.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 299</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>want it, we&#039;ll do it.&quot; This has been done on the basis that the police have put forward a cogent and intelligent argument as to why they need the power.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-03_para9">
<a name="stpa_14">We have already indicated that there will be a sunset clause, so we can judge what happens over the year. Every seven days that someone is held, they will go back in front of a High Court judge. Hon. Members talk about civil liberties, and of course it is important that we protect the civil liberties of terrorist suspects. It is also important that we protect the civil liberties of this country and the right to life and protection from terrorism. That is why we have put the proposals forward. We do that in a reasonable way and I ask, yet again, for the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s support.
</p>





<p><a name="st_56"><a name="51109-03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 We all want to fight terrorism effectively, but we do not have to look very far beyond our shores to see what happens if minority communities are alienated. What is likely to be the state of mind of someone who spends the equivalent of six months in prison on the basis of no evidence whatever and is then released without charge? What will that person&#039;s friends, relatives and community think? How likely would we be to receive intelligence from such communities? How does the Prime Minister think that we can effectively fight terrorism without intelligence from those communities?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-03_para10">
<a name="stpa_15">The Prime Minister referred to the document from Mr. Hayman. I have read the document very carefully. It refers to the difficulties caused by the inability of the police to question after charge; we have tabled amendments to deal with that. It refers to the difficulties caused by the disclosure regime; that, too, can be remedied. What it does not do is justify 90 days. Does not the inability of the Prime Minister to identify a single case in which the police have needed 90 days go to the heart of his failure to justify the 90-day period? Does that not prove beyond doubt that the Home Secretary is right when he says that there is nothing crucial about 90 days?
</p>





<p><a name="st_57"><a name="51109-03_spmin6"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 First, Andy Hayman&#039;s letter and document set out very clearly why the 90 days are necessary. Let me explain again the basic argument of the police. Most reasonable people would see what they are trying to say. Because of the nature of the new terrorism that we face, because the terrorists want to kill people without limit&#151;in July they killed 50 people in London, but they would have killed 500 had they been able to do so&#151;when the police are investigating whether or not a conspiracy is taking place, they are naturally inclined to charge these people, to take them and arrest 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 300</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>them, earlier than they otherwise would. If they make a mistake about the particular gestation period of the conspiracy and they get it wrong&#151;they might think that the conspiracy is in its early stages, but in fact it is well advanced&#151;we could end up with mass casualties on our streets. For that reason, the police say that this is a completely different situation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-03_para11">
<a name="stpa_16">We need to be able to lift these people earlier and accumulate evidence to charge them after arrest. The number of people, for example, who have been kept for over seven days since the new powers were introduced is just over 30, so we are not talking about large numbers of people, but they may be the crucial difference between saving this country from a terrorist attack and not doing so. The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that we will alienate minority communities, but it is sad that he   should make that argument.&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Muslim community in this country is as determined as any other part of our community to defeat terrorism. Its members do not want to be told that they are against this because it alienates them&#151;they want these people dealt with and arrested. In the end, if this is the best argument that the right hon. and learned Gentleman can make, I   suggest that he and his colleagues ask themselves whether they really think that this is where the Conservative party should be.
</p>





<p><a name="st_58"><a name="51109-03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 I agree with the Prime Minister that we face a new situation, which is why we and a majority of hon. Members on both sides of the House accept that there is a case for extending the period. The question that we face, and the question that the Prime Minister has not specifically answered, is why the period should be 90 days. In September, the Home Secretary said that he would seek to compromise, and that he would not rule out a detention period of one month. Last month, he said that 90 days was &quot;not a God-given amount&quot;. Last week, he said that the figure of 90 days was &quot;not crucial&quot;. On Monday, he said that he would table an amendment to reduce the period from 90 days. Why was that amendment not tabled?
</p>





<p><a name="st_59"><a name="51109-03_spmin7"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 For the simple reason that all the way through we have said that 90 days are right. It is detention of up to 90 days: every seven days the person has to be brought back before the court. The right hon.   and learned Gentleman asked why 90 days&#151;it is for the very reasons that the police have given. That is   the right period to allow them to conduct their operations and investigations properly. That is where the 90 days comes from. I am afraid that in the end he and his hon. Friends must decide whether on this particular issue they are going to back the police and those charged with fighting terrorism in our country, who tell us&#151;in my view, rightly&#151;that they need this power to make our country safe. He and his hon. Friends must make their decision today. We have made ours: we believe that this is right for our country, we believe that it is necessary to protect our country from terrorism, and I am only sorry that he does not agree.

So there is much on which we can reach agreement, but he must surely understand that there were those who thought we would have an opportunity to record a vote last week, which we did not because of what the Home Secretary had to say. He told the House&#151;in all sincerity, I am sure&#151;that he would have urgent discussions with colleagues in his own party and other parties to see whether consensus could be reached. Is the Prime Minister seriously saying today, when we will come to the vote later, that the Home Secretary ever thought that a consensus would be reached over 90 days?
</p>





<p><a name="st_63"><a name="51109-03_spmin9"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 As the Home Secretary has explained, it was not possible to reach a consensus. I am sorry about that. The right hon.

When he says that they agree with large parts of the Bill, that is fine. Perhaps they do. According to the police and those charged with fighting terrorism in this country, however, this is not a peripheral matter. It is central and vital. It is not just about my leadership; it is   about the leadership of other political parties too. It   is   about the leadership of every single person in the House, who will have to make a decision today about the interests of this country. I know where I stand on that.

Even if the Prime Minister is successful in getting the measure through today, he will not carry it in the House of Lords. What will he do at that juncture?

All of us have to make that   decision. The right hon. Gentleman asks whether we should simply accept what the police put forward. We are accepting what the police put forward because, to any reasonable person, the reasons they give are compelling. We face a different type of terrorism. It requires them to arrest people earlier, to develop the evidence and to charge them later. That is why they need the power. In circumstances where we know and it is accepted that we face a continuing terrorist threat in this country, I find the position of the Liberal Democrats unsurprising, and I find the position of the Conservative party surprising.

That is the reason for tightening up the gateway. We have put an awful lot of money into the new deal and other programmes designed to help people off benefit and into work. It has been very successful; indeed, it is the reason why we now spend about &#163;5 billion a year less on benefits than we did in 1997.

<br>

<br>
Mr. Secretary Hain, supported by the Prime Minister, Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Secretary Clarke, Mr. David Hanson, Mr. Shaun Woodward and Bridget Prentice, presented a Bill to make special provision about certain offences committed, or alleged to have been committed, before 10th April 1998 in connection with terrorism and the affairs of Northern Ireland; and to provide for the amendment of the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998: And the same was read the First time; and ordered to be read a Second time tomorrow, and to be printed.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Today the Government have published a Bill that will loose murderers on to the streets of Northern Ireland.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51109-04_spnew3"><b> Charles Hendry  (Wealden) (Con):</b> 
 I beg to move,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision for the mental health and special learning needs of convicted prisoners; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The Bill is specific in trying to address the problems that affect a significant proportion of our prison population. I introduce it because I believe that the way in which our penal system cares for those with mental health needs at the start of the 21st century is a stain on our society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Daniel Meehan, a young constituent of mine, had always been a troubled young man. He had a history of   mental illness and drifted in and out of prison throughout his adult life. Daniel had been diagnosed as suffering from a series of mental illnesses, including the antisocial personality disorder, Tourette&#039;s syndrome, from the age of 17. He had spent around half his life in prison but he never received the help and treatment that he needed to tackle his problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Instead of rehabilitation, Daniel was left exposed and fell foul of the problems that, all too often, vulnerable people face in prison. He developed a heroin addiction while in jail and started to abuse alcohol. In September last year, on his discharge from prison, he was left homeless, without his medication or even any clothes. He was bailed by the courts to his father&#039;s address. When his father was not at home, he looked for somewhere else to stay and, as a result, he was rearrested for breaking his bail conditions and taken back into custody. His mother and sister desperately tried to arrange specialist care for Daniel and eventually arranged for a social worker to visit him in Lewes prison. However, on the same day the social worker was due to visit, he was moved to Her Majesty&#039;s prison Weare, a floating prison off Dorset.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">Neither the social worker nor Daniel&#039;s family had been made aware of the transfer, yet the prison system somehow expected a prisoner with a long history of mental illness to rearrange the appointment himself. Daniel&#039;s complex needs were never properly assessed. Alone and without the support he needed, Daniel died at his father&#039;s house in January this year, aged 29. The coroner returned an open verdict on the death, but to most of us who had seen his case develop, we have no doubt that suicide would have been the more appropriate verdict.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">Daniel&#039;s family freely admit that he was a difficult man, but time and again, over almost 10 years, the prison system consistently failed to address his problems. As Daniel&#039;s sister, Mrs Meehan-Bissett, said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;Prison was not the answer for someone like Daniel, he needed rehabilitation. He died due to neglect. The prison authorities cannot be bothered with someone like Daniel . . . There needs to be somewhere for people like Daniel to go. If you need to lock them up, lock them up, but not without anything to do all day.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">The Government response to the Home Affairs Committee report on the rehabilitation of offenders, which was published in January 2005, stated that there were firm commitments that, by 2004:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;All prisoners with severe mental illness would be in receipt of treatment and that no prisoner with a serious mental illness would leave prison without a care plan&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 307</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">In Daniel&#039;s case, it is all too clear that those rules were not followed. Many hon. Members are aware of similar cases from our constituencies, so it is important to understand the extent of the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">Last year in a written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan), whom I am pleased to see on the Front Bench, the then   Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;A survey of mental ill health in the prison population of England and Wales, undertaken in 1997 by the Office for National Statistics, showed that around 90 per cent. of prisoners sampled displayed evidence of at least one of the five disorders&#151;personality disorder, psychosis, neurosis, alcohol misuse and drug dependence&#151;considered in the survey. There will, at any one time, be around 5,000 prisoners with a severe mental illness&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 2 December 2004; Vol. 428, c. 247W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">Similar findings were published in a report by the Prison Reform Trust, supported by the Nuffield Foundation, into the mental health of women prisoners. It found that two thirds of women in prison show symptoms of at least one neurotic disorder such as depression, anxiety and phobias. More than half suffer from a personality disorder. Yet, among the general population, less than one fifth of women suffer from those disorders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">The report found that half the women in prison are on   prescribed medication such as anti-depressants or anti-psychotic medicine and there is evidence that the use of medication increases while in custody. Of all women who are sent to prison, a terrifying 40 per cent. say that they have attempted suicide at some time in their life.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">Research by Oxford university into suicide rates for younger offenders is even more shocking. The analysis of suicide rates in England and Wales from 1978 to 2003 found that the difference was particularly striking in 15 to 17-year-olds. Offenders in that age group were 18 times more likely to kill themselves than those in the general prison population. Depressingly, the report concluded that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;half those who commit suicide in prison have a treatable mental illness.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">If those illnesses were indeed treatable, it means that those suicides could have been prevented.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">The problem goes far beyond mental health; there are also too many prisoners who have serious learning difficulties. According to Home Office statistics, the prevalence of poor educational attainment among prisoners is shocking. Fifty-five per cent. of prisoners had a reading ability of level 1 or below&#151;the educational level for an 11-year-old. That proportion rises to 67 per cent. in young offenders&#151;in other words, two thirds of young offenders have the reading ability of an 11-year-old or younger child. In spelling, 79 per cent of prisoners were at level 1 or below, with that figure rising to 87 per cent. in young offenders. In numeracy, those rated at level 1 or below represented 69 per cent. of the general prison population, and 78 per cent. of young offenders, so the frightening truth is that about three quarters of young offenders are illiterate and innumerate. Despite this, however, the average hours of education in prison were under six hours a week per prisoner in 2002, and only slightly higher in young offender institutions. As a result, most of them are almost as illiterate and innumerate when they leave prison as when they start their sentence.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 308</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">This Bill is not about making excuses for those who   break the law. One essential pillar of prison is that it should act as a deterrent to those thinking of committing crime and punish those who have broken the law. But prison works only if it also rehabilitates. As one governor said to me:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;We are very good at incarceration, but not at rehabilitation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">A prisoner without rehabilitation is a prisoner who will offend again. So, the mental health and learning needs of prisoners must be addressed if we are truly to have a prison system that meets those two core goals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">The Bill that I am proposing is a simple one. Where it has been established that a criminal has mental health needs, there would be a legal requirement for those needs to be professionally and thoroughly assessed at the start of their sentence. For all prisoners, an assessment would be required of their educational needs. Those with mental health requirements would be detained only in an establishment with specialised facilities, and with staff trained to deal with them. A pathway programme of support would have to be developed to ensure that their mental needs were met. Those needing educational attention would receive a   more focused programme of tuition, instead of the haphazard tuition that they currently receive, and it should focus on skills training as well, to give them some hope of employment when they leave. As prisoners with mental health problems are now treated by the NHS, the primary care trust budgets covering this treatment should be ring-fenced to ensure that the funds to finance prisoner care cannot leak away into other areas of health care.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">The objective of the Bill is not to create prison asylums surrounded by barbed wire&#151;far from it. The Bill seeks to ensure that prisoners with mental health needs are kept in an establishment in which those needs are addressed first and foremost, and which works to   support their rehabilitation. In no way does it undermine the principle that many people need to be kept away from society, for the good of society and for their own good, but it does mean that they will be given the care and medical support that they need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para17">
<a name="stpa_17">I have visited a number of young offender institutions. They are the most depressing places I have ever been to, and I certainly do not know how we can   rehabilitate someone if we lock them up in a 9 ft by 5 ft cell for 18   hours a day or more. And when those prisoners have mental health problems or special learning needs, this becomes a hopeless task unless rehabilitation is at the forefront of the approach. Through specialised and focused rehabilitative methods, the prison system can make major inroads into reducing reoffending. But rehabilitation must be more responsive to the often complex problems of prisoners, which have all too often contributed to them being in prison in the first place, and will have them returning there time and again if they go unresolved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-04_para18">
<a name="stpa_18">The case of Daniel Meehan is a tragic one. A young man with profound mental health needs died because he did not receive the help that he needed. At the start of the 21st century, that is something that should shame us all. We have the power to do something about this. I   commend the Bill to the House.

<a name="stpa_21">I know that Opposition Members object frequently to every programme motion, but I suggest that even they would find it hard to fault this one. The effect of this programme motion is to increase the amount of time that the House will have to consider this Bill on Report.

 I will not seek to divide the House on the programme motion, but I should point out to the Home Secretary that while we welcome the concession that has been made, the practical reality is that we still have far too short a time to consider the amendments tabled for this afternoon. Even at this late stage, I hope that he might consider taking advice on whether further time can be made available. Let me explain why.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-05_para5">
<a name="stpa_24">We will start with a debate on the period of detention, which is a subject of considerable controversy. Given the way in which the procedures of the House operate,   and the fact that the Government have tabled   amendment No. 55, which changes the period from three months to 90 days, anyone wishing to have the 28-day amendment considered must first vote on Government amendment No. 55. We will therefore have to have two votes, whereas one on the 28 days alone might have been necessary otherwise. I am not clear as to why that has come about, except to provide a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 311</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>delay   mechanism in the time that the House has for consideration. As a consequence, the reality must be that new clause 8 on stop and search, which was tabled by a Government Back Bencher, and which, I believe, merits the consideration of the House, is most unlikely to receive any consideration whatever. In the context of   trying to build consensus, that must be highly regrettable. There is no reason why that should have to happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-05_para6">
<a name="stpa_25">When we move on beyond the three-hour break, when we will probably have had a couple of votes, and the stop and search matters will not have been considered, we will have five groups of amendments to consider, all of which are of importance, and three hours in which to do it. We might well have time to deal with the offences under clauses 1 and 2, which remain controversial because the Government concessions do not appear to change radically the way in which indirect incitement to terrorism can still be committed negligently. If we have a full debate on that subject, however, which greatly exercised the Committee last week, there must be a danger that we will never get to the glorification clauses, which, as we know from last week, were the subject of enormous controversy. If the Home Secretary wishes to avoid the suspicion that the Government are trying procedurally to close down the   debate on those clauses, it would be wise to give us more time. Without filibuster in any sense, we will have difficulty in reaching those clauses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-05_para7">
<a name="stpa_26">I worry, and I shall judge the matter by what happens this afternoon, that we might see a procession of Government Back Benchers put up to prolong the debate on offences under clauses 1 and 2, so that debate is prevented on the question whether a glorification element in incitement to terrorism should remain in the Bill. That would be a scandalous state of affairs. I look to the Home Secretary to provide guidance, as the debate takes place, to ensure as far as is possible that that does not happen.
</p>





<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51109-05_spnew1"><b> John Bercow  (Buckingham) (Con):</b> 
 My hon. Friend will agree that it is important that our proceedings today should be intelligible to the country at large. Given that we have no fewer than 60 amendments and new clauses to consider, and only six hours in which to do so, the arithmetic is obvious. Does my hon.

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51109-05_spnew2"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b>

<a name="stpa_27">Even after the glorification amendments, there are important amendments dealing with the endorsements of publications and the defences that may exist, issues that were of great concern to the House last week. There is also the question whether there should be any defences in relation to training for terrorism: there are currently none. Last but not least, although last week the right hon.

As I said to the Home Secretary last week, the controversial nature of the Bill makes it immensely desirable that, if at all possible, this House should reach an agreed position so that we can all vote for the Bill on Third Reading tomorrow. But to do that we must debate, and if the debate is curtailed so that important parts of the Bill are never considered at all, that will place those who wish to consider them in great difficulty. As the Home Secretary knows, because the Bill is so controversial, there must be a risk that the other place will take over the responsibility that we have shirked&#151;and that we shall find ourselves involved, as we have too often in the past, in late-night spats as we try to sort out the differences between this House and   the other place. Let me say sincerely to the Home Secretary that I think that that can be avoided, or largely avoided, if there is sufficient time, but I do not think there is at present.

It was clear in Committee that the provisions relating to offences committed abroad were an extremely controversial part of the drafting, and would merit discussion and refinement on Report. The other place will have to consider the provisions if we fail to do so.

 I took exception to very little that was said by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve). Like him, we consider the timetable motion defective, but like him I   see no reason for us to divide the House on it. I accept the Home Secretary&#039;s point that some small measure of protection for the business has been made available, and that small amount of extra time is indeed welcome. Nevertheless, without second-guessing the way in which today&#039;s business will proceed, I think it very likely that we shall not go beyond the first string of amendments before the first knife falls after three hours. As the hon.   Member for Beaconsfield pointed out, that will leave the stop-and-search provisions proposed in new clause 8 entirely undiscussed. Surely that is too important a subject to leave this House without any proper discussion being placed on the record.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_29">I also think that a great deal of important business will remain undiscussed under the second group of amendments. The House will have to choose between holding its tongue and restricting its comments on clause 1 and the question of intention if we are to secure any meaningful discussion on the crucial question of glorification. As a result, questions as fundamental as the definition of terrorism itself will almost certainly be left undebated. And as a result of that, the only meaningful scrutiny will be carried out in the other place. If the Government are content to proceed in that way, they cannot then complain that the unelected House has interfered with or changed the Bill when it makes the amendments that are inevitable.

Twenty years ago, such an allocation of time for a Bill of this kind would have been regarded as laughable, and it would not have been entertained by the usual channels during the Thatcher Government. Thirty years ago, if a Conservative Government had proposed a Bill of this kind, several days of debate would have been allowed before any guillotine curtailing debate would have even been contemplated. Had anyone tried to force through a guillotine of this severity, I should have expected the sitting to be suspended as Labour Members caused disorder and began to run away with the Mace, or something of the kind, to give visual expression to their constitutional outrage.

The suspension of the rule to allow us at least to sit on through the evening until such time as the Government&#039;s business managers decide to try to call a vote to end the debate would constitute a very elementary extension of debating time, which would cause merely minor inconvenience to a few Members and no real affront to the House.

No one assembled here in the House doubts the importance of the issues before us. In fact, the Bill has many of the features that would, in the old days, have made it be viewed as a constitutional Bill. As a general rule, such constitutional Bills of major importance were never guillotined. Every one of us should have the opportunity to justify, query or give reason to our anxieties about the Bill.

As I said in an earlier intervention, it became apparent to the House last week that in respect of the commissioning of offences abroad, there was greater concern than had first appeared when the Bill was probed in Committee. It is disappointing that the Government are introducing a programme motion that almost guarantees that there will be no follow-on from last week to this week.

I well remember the days when Jim Callaghan, the late Lord   Callaghan, would sit in the Chamber for an hour or two at a time to listen to even rather insignificant debates. Other Prime Ministers have done the same, but not Lord Callaghan&#039;s successor.

<p><a name="st_30"><a name="51109-08_spnew3"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 I only wish that this Prime Minister would do that. I repeat that I respect his motivation, and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 320</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>think that he is motivated by the highest considerations of national protection and public service, but neither he nor the Government have made much of a case for the central components of the Bill. Why cannot the Prime Minister be here? If he respected the House, the House would respect him.

<p><a name="st_31"><a name="51109-08_spnew4"><b> Simon Hughes  (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD):</b> 
 I endorse what has been said so far, and wish to make two other brief points. I also have a question for the Home Secretary which I hope will shorten the debate to come.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_57">Colleagues from three different parties on the Opposition Benches have argued that they accept that the programme motion gives more time for debate, but   that we will still be hugely constrained. The Government&#039;s approach has two obvious defects. First, people outside the House who are not satisfied with Parliament and who have little respect for it will be able to say much more easily that we do not do our job properly or thoroughly and that we rush through important legislation. The central proposition for debate today is that we should make the period for which a person can be detained without charge six times as long as it currently is. Surely that merits a debate that is not constrained? There is no need to constrain debate, and the view that the Government should adopt a different approach is widespread.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_58">Secondly, the Government and the Home Secretary often criticise the House of Lords for being unelected and for interfering in the decisions of the elected House. It is impossible to criticise the Lords validly if this House cannot debate properly all the propositions that the Government put to it. The House of Lords then has an additional duty to make up for our failure in that respect.
</p>





<p><a name="st_32"><a name="51109-08_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ronnie Campbell  (Blyth Valley) (Lab):</b> 
 How long will the House of Lords debate this matter for?
</p>





<p><a name="st_33"><a name="51109-08_spnew6"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 The House of Lords does not have a guillotine procedure. The debate there will go on for as long as people want to contribute to it. If ever there were a Bill that needed to be debated at somewhat greater length&#151;and for which time was available&#151;this must be it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_59">I turn now to my question for the Home Secretary, which follows the question posed by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) about the advice of the Scottish law officer. The right hon. Gentleman&#039;s answer to that question might shorten debate later: his answer to my question will do the same, and make it easier for him to make his case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_60">The Home Secretary got into difficulties last week when it came to explaining the legal advice that he received and its provenance, but my question does not ask him to reveal the content of the advice from the Attorney-General. It is this: who gives him advice as to whether the Bill, or any part of it, complies with the European convention on human rights? Is it internal legal advice from his Department&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_34"><a name="51109-08_spnew7"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. The hon. Gentleman is going wide of the programme motion.

Government amendment No. 62.</p>





<p><a name="st_65"><a name="51109-09_spnew0"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 All the amendments in this group relate to the complex and contentious question of pre-charge detention in terrorist cases. Government amendments Nos. 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60 and 62 provide that extensions of detention beyond 14 days must be approved by a High Court judge or, in Scotland, a judge of the Court of Session. That responds directly to concerns raised in the Chamber at Committee stage. Any application that would extend detention beyond 14 days will need to be made to the senior judge. If, for example, on day nine, the police thought that they needed only another couple of days before they would be in a position to release a suspect or suspects, they could still apply to a district judge. If, however, the police were clear at that point that they wanted a further seven days, the application would need to be made to the senior judge.
</p>





<p><a name="st_66"><a name="51109-09_spnew1"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland) (LD):</b> 
 I am grateful to the Home Secretary for giving way at this early juncture. Why is application in Scotland to be made to a court of civil jurisdiction&#151;namely, the Court of Session&#151;for what is essentially a criminal matter?
</p>





<p><a name="st_67"><a name="51109-09_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Following our exchanges in Committee, I   set out clearly to all Scottish Members&#151;I think that the hon. Gentleman will have received my correspondence&#151;the range of issues relating to that particular set of questions. I believe that that addresses the question that he has raised. If not, and he is indicating that it does not, I shall come back to him on the point later in the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_66">In Committee, it was suggested that it was not only the level of judge that was important, but his experience of handling terrorist cases. It was suggested that there should be a cadre of judges designated for that purpose. We have explored that suggestion with the Department for Constitutional Affairs, but it and the judiciary rejected that approach, so it has not been pursued.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-09_para7">
<a name="stpa_67">Another option raised in Committee, following Lord   Carlile&#039;s recommendation, was for decisions to be taken by senior circuit judges, with an avenue of appeal to a High Court judge. In our view, that would lead to   an appeal in virtually every case with the cases eventually being decided by a High Court judge, so we have achieved the same result with fewer hearings. I can easily explain the effect of the amendments and I have also dealt explicitly with the proposals made by the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash).


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 327</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-09_para8">
<a name="stpa_68">It was also suggested that judges should give reasons for their decisions to extend detention. The clear advice we have is that that would open up an avenue of appeal. There is also the risk that the judge might have decided to grant the extension on the basis of sensitive material, so we have decided not to proceed with that suggestion.
</p>





<p><a name="st_68"><a name="51109-09_spnew3"><b> Mr. Dominic Grieve  (Beaconsfield) (Con):</b> 
 Can the Home Secretary amplify the exact procedure before the   High Court judge? Will it be possible for submissions to be made by the person under detention pending charge? Will he be represented? How will the procedure operate and will the Government publish further material on that point, if necessary?
</p>





<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51109-09_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The answer is yes. On the procedure, I   shall come shortly to the codes of practice that will apply&#151;a point that the hon. Gentleman pressed in Committee and to which I am keen to respond.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-09_para9">
<a name="stpa_69">I turn to Government amendments Nos. 51 and 58. As the Bill is currently drafted, extensions of pre-charge detention are for seven days unless there are &quot;special circumstances&quot; that warrant a lesser period. The amendments remove the word &quot;special&quot; so that a shorter extension period would be granted if the judge felt that circumstances warranted it. The amendments are identical to ones tabled by the Opposition in Committee, so we are responding to the debate on that issue.

<p><a name="st_70"><a name="51109-10_spnew0"><b> Lady Hermon  (North Down) (UUP):</b> 
 The Home Secretary will know that successive Chief Constables in Northern Ireland have had to fight terrorism in that part of the United Kingdom. What view does the present Chief Constable, Sir Hugh Orde, have on the renewal of detention every seven days and extensions to 90 days if needed?
</p>





<p><a name="st_71"><a name="51109-10_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The hon. Lady has more personal experience of the dilemmas caused by such questions than most hon. Members. I have spoken to Sir Hugh Orde on that point, because of his particular experience. He was unequivocally clear, and he authorised me to say so in the House, that the legislation is&#151;in his experience and from   his point of view&#151;necessary, and that includes the   extension to 90 days. He is also of the view that the seven-day review by High Court judges is the right way to proceed, and that the flexibility that I am discussing is necessary. I hope that Members from Northern Ireland will take account of those views when they vote this evening.
</p>





<p><a name="st_72"><a name="51109-10_spnew2"><b> Clare Short  (Birmingham, Ladywood) (Lab):</b> 
 Can my right hon. Friend tell the House whether any of our police officers have suggested that we have a power of internment? If they did, what view would the Government take of it?
</p>





<p><a name="st_73"><a name="51109-10_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 Since I have been Home Secretary, there have been no suggestions from any source, the police or the security services, that internment be adopted as a measure to deal with any of these questions. Were that suggestion to be made, I would consider it, but I am sure that the House will agree that the assessment of the   operation of internment in the period in which it operated was that it was a counter-productive approach 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to terrorism in the circumstances. By the way, I reject the   rhetorical comment&#151;made not by my right hon. Friend, but by others&#151;that the measures we are discussing today can in any sense be equated with internment. That is simply not the case.
</p>





<p><a name="st_74"><a name="51109-10_spnew4"><b> Sir Patrick Cormack  (South Staffordshire) (Con):</b> 
 Further to the point raised by the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon), Sir Hugh Orde will appear before the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee this afternoon and will doubtless be asked many questions. Are there any chief constables who take a directly contrary view on this issue?
</p>





<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51109-10_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I am not aware of any. I have not personally spoken to every chief constable, so I cannot put my hand on my heart and say that not one of them takes a different view, but all the chief constables to whom I have personally spoken about it take the strong view that the provisions are necessary. The Association of Chief Police Officers also strongly takes that view, which is held most strongly by those people who have been most directly involved in fighting terrorism.

</p>





<p><a name="st_76"><a name="51109-10_spnew6"><b> Mr. Peter Lilley  (Hitchin and Harpenden) (Con):</b> 
 The Home Secretary has just said that the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland had reached his conclusion based on his experience. The letter that we received from Hayman of the Met said that the experience in Northern Ireland was totally different and not relevant. We now face new circumstances. What relevant experience has the Chief Constable had? Does he believe that the new powers are necessary in Northern Ireland and, if so, did the Home Secretary refuse to give him those powers?
</p>





<p><a name="st_77"><a name="51109-10_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I regret to say that the right hon. Gentleman has misunderstood the point that assistant commissioner Hayman made. His point was that the modern terrorism that we face is different in certain important respects from the terrorism that we had to face in the past in Northern Ireland. It is the case that the modern terrorism that we face is a challenge for police in Northern Ireland today in a very direct way, which is   why the Chief Constable is entitled to make his comments, not as a point of general principle but in terms of dealing with the modern terrorism that he has to face.
</p>





<p><a name="st_78"><a name="51109-10_spnew8"><b> Mr. William Cash  (Stone) (Con):</b> 
 The Home Secretary may recall that under schedule 8 it would be open to the   judicial authority to exclude any person to whom the application relates&#151;the suspect&#151;or anyone representing him from any part of the hearing. How can he reconcile that with the provisions in the European convention on human rights on fair hearings?
</p>





<p><a name="st_79"><a name="51109-10_spnew9"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I shall come on to the amendment tabled by the hon. Gentleman in a few moments. I believe that the two can be reconciled, which is why I have provided the certificate for this legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_70">In answer to the earlier question from the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), I want to say a few words about codes of practice. He also raised the point with me last week. In Committee, it was suggested that we needed a code of practice to govern the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 329</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>treatment of those held under the Terrorism Act 2000. We welcome that suggestion. Powers for that already exist in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Under section 66 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the Secretary of State can issue a code of practice in   respect of those detained under schedule 8 to the 2000 Act if he so wishes. Existing PACE code C already applies to those detained under the Terrorism Act 2000, but we can see grounds for having a separate code for that purpose, as the hon. Gentleman argued earlier in our proceedings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_71">Such a code would be laid before Parliament and be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Similar provisions exist for a code that would relate to the Northern Ireland (Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland)) Order 1989. In Scotland, codes of practice are not generally used. Instead, the Lord Advocate, as the head of the systems of criminal prosecution and investigation of deaths, has a statutory power to instruct the police in relation to the investigation and reporting of crime under section 12 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 and section 17 of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967. Constables must perform their duties subject to the directions of chief constables, and chief constables must comply with all lawful instructions, in relation to the investigation of offences, from the appropriate prosecutor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_72">The Lord Advocate takes the view that it would be inappropriate to have different powers and periods of pre-charge detention in Scotland from the rest of the UK in terrorist investigations and, in considering appropriate guidance to chief constables in the Scottish context, he would want to maintain a consistent position north and south of the border, as far as possible. His officials would expect to work closely with Home Office officials on the preparation of a code of practice for England and Wales and any equivalent guidance to be issued by the Lord Advocate in Scotland. For those reasons, we are not tabling amendments at this point, but I can give a firm guarantee that the appropriate codes and their equivalent will be brought forward.
</p>





<p><a name="st_80"><a name="51109-10_spnew10"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The Home Secretary will remember that last week we discussed the possibility of altering the rules about interviewing detained people after charge so   that it facilitated inquiry after charges had been brought. Will that be part of the subject matter of the codes that he is bringing forward and, if so, does not it have some bearing on the total length of time for which we may need to detain people?
</p>





<p><a name="st_81"><a name="51109-10_spnew11"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I do not expect that aspect of the code to deal with the particular point that we debated. Unless I   have misunderstood the hon. Gentleman, I think his position is that we need, because of the particular situation of a possibly extended period of pre-charge detention compared to already existing detention, to have a different approach to PACE in certain regards. I   shall say later&#151;

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_73">The question of judicial scrutiny is important and becomes more and more pressing at each stage of the process, as time moves on, and the judge needs to deal with that directly as we move forward. I am ready to have discussions on that point, too. The proposal is not designed to address the issue of questioning pre and post-charge that we have already discussed.
</p>





<p><a name="st_84"><a name="51109-10_spnew14"><b> David Davis  (Haltemprice and Howden) (Con):</b> 
 That is an extremely important point, which was twice raised by Mr. Hayman in his letter. It was raised during the Privy Council briefing that the Home Secretary organised for the Leader of the Opposition and me. The question of interview post-charge has clearly had a major effect on the attitude of the police to charge and to the proposal that we are discussing. It is clearly the case that if we alter the ability of the police to interview after charge, it will open up to them much evidence and procedure that will act to stop terrorism. Can the Home Secretary please give the House an undertaking that he will put that in process?
</p>





<p><a name="st_85"><a name="51109-10_spnew15"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I agree with all that and, as I said to the House both on Second Reading and in Committee, we think the case for the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s point is well made. Application of the procedure that he set out may mean that it would be less necessary in a given case, and thus there would be fewer cases where there was an   extended period of pre-charge detention. The key point, however, is that it does not remove the need for pre-charge detention in certain circumstances, although I agree that the number would be limited. Nevertheless, I accept the integrity of his point; the view is shared across the Government that we need to achieve the state of affairs that he described. It is none the less important to note that there are implications for other aspects of the conduct of our legal process and they, too, need to be considered.

<p><a name="st_86"><a name="51109-11_spnew0"><b> Keith Vaz  (Leicester, East) (Lab):</b> 
 We have heard a lot about the views of the police on the extension of the detention period. Given that my right hon. Friend cannot tell us what the Attorney-General has told him, has he spoken to the Director of Public Prosecutions? The Solicitor-General, who has responsibility to the House for the views of the Crown Prosecution Service, is sitting next to my right hon. Friend. What are the views of the DPP about the 90-day period? Secondly, given that the provision will disproportionately affect members of the Asian community, what steps will my right hon. Friend take to ensure that when the police have those additional powers they will engage fully, at a local level, with the Asian community?
</p>





<p><a name="st_87"><a name="51109-11_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I can give my hon. Friend the specific assurance that he seeks on his first point: the CPS strongly supports the proposed extension to 90 days.

That is their clear and unequivocal position, explicitly and directly.

<p><a name="st_89"><a name="51109-11_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I want to finish answering my hon. Friend&#039;s question. His second point was very important. Without any encouragement from me, the police, over a period of 10 to 15 years&#151;perhaps since Scarman, perhaps for even longer&#151;have been working extremely hard to transform their relations with various minority ethnic communities in particular cities. Obviously, that is patchy and there are areas where not as much has been done, but some of our great metropolitan forces have made massive strides in developing relationships between operational policing and particular communities that did not exist previously. Moreover, the major faith leaders, nationally and locally, in most of our communities&#151;not all&#151;are working hard to find ways to co-operate in addressing the issues on a basis of respect for different faiths. To be candid, the comparison that was made earlier with current events in France is utterly unhistorically based when we consider our achievements in the UK.

 The Home Secretary was right to seek the views of the CPS in England and Wales, and it is right that the House should listen to them.

 May I   take the Home Secretary back to the issue of the Lord Advocate? From what he told the House a moment or two ago, it appears that the Lord Advocate&#039;s view is that the period should be the same both north and south of the border, and that the authorities in Scotland should co-operate with the authorities in England. But it does not appear that the Lord Advocate endorsed the principle of 90 days. Is that correct?

<a name="stpa_75">Amendment No. 63, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), addresses an important point that a large number of people have raised with me&#151;compensation in the event that someone was held incorrectly. The amendment provides that those held for more than 14 days and released without charge should be entitled to compensation. That is my hon. Friend&#039;s principal proposal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_76">I have much sympathy with the idea, but there are some issues regarding its implementation. Thus far, we have never paid compensation, other than in cases involving malpractice, to people tried and acquitted, even though they may be held in custody for far longer periods than we are considering in these circumstances. We may or may not agree with the justice of that position, but it has been the case for a long time. We need, therefore, to consider carefully the precedent that we might set if we agreed to the amendment. However, I accept, first, that my hon. Friend is making a serious point and, secondly, that by hypothesis we would be dealing with a very small number of cases indeed&#151;the very small number of cases where people are held, say, for more than 28 days pre-charge and within that group the very, very small group of people who were wrongly held and subsequently not charged. For that reason, because the provision would apply to such a small group of people, I am prepared to look carefully at my hon. Friend&#039;s suggestion and will report back to him and the House as soon as I can. I hope that he will understand that we need to take the operational implications fully into account, so I cannot give him an unequivocal commitment at this stage, but on the basis of that proposal, I ask him to consider withdrawing the amendment.

 My hon. Friend makes two points, one of which I do not accept and the second of which I do accept. I simply do not accept her description of the Prime Minister&#039;s motivation in terms of party politics. I   do not think that it is accurate; I do not think that it is his personal motivation; and I certainly do not believe that it is the Government&#039;s motivation. As I said on Second Reading, in Committee and at other times, the question that all Members must address is, how can we do our duty as Members of Parliament in dealing with the national interest and national security.

We only have to look at the media on any day of the week to see that they provide a prism through which they say that all this debate is about party politics in some respect or another. I have tried personally, when interviewed on the media, to rebut that suggestion because I do not think that it is true. I do mean that I   think that it is right but not correctly done; I think that it is an inaccurate description of the state of affairs.

I believed and hoped as late as last Thursday that we could achieve a consensus with the main Opposition parties about the length of time that should be used. I also agree with her point that I was talking about consensus with Labour Members as well as with the Opposition parties on this question. That is what motivated me in the way that I operated. She may recall&#151;I think that she will&#151;that I asked every Member of the House to go back to their constituencies last weekend and take the view of their constituents, talk to them and ask their police and whoever else about these questions. I hope that she would agree that many Members have done precisely that: they have gone back and talked to people&#151;I am sure that she is one of those who have done just that&#151;and everyone will make their judgments on that basis.

That was their considered view. There was a discussion about the period between 14 and 28 days. I was of the view, which has been my view throughout, that 28 days is not long enough to deal with the police case that we have, but I was ready to entertain discussions of a shorter period that could arise.

The Home Secretary must know that the case to which he refers does not in any way justify the 90-day period. The evidence did not take 90 days to materialise. Will he now confirm&#151;the Prime Minister refused to do so earlier today&#151;that there is not a single case to which the police or anyone else can point in which evidence that became available 80 or 90 days after arrest was sufficient to charge the person who had been arrested?

 Over the weekend, I sought the views of South Wales police and had a detailed discussion about the measure with them. They have no interest whatsoever in obtaining those powers for themselves, even though that is how the debate has been played. They are reassured, however, that the powers are in the hands of the judiciary, who will oversee the process and review it every seven days or sooner. I acknowledge what my right hon.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and I   should like to pick out a couple of points. First, he used the word &quot;rare&quot;. We are talking about a very small number of cases indeed, but by hypothesis we are trying to deal with some of the most dangerous people in the world. Secondly, we have not made as much of judicial oversight as we should have done, but we should address the powerful issue of a High Court judge reviewing the detention either every seven days or on the more flexible basis that I set out. It is very important indeed that we look at this in a balanced way, which is another argument for the sunset clause&#151;something to which, as I said, I am not usually sympathetic.

 I shall make some progress, but before I   conclude I shall give way to one or two of those who want to intervene.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_99">I emphasise, as I said on Second Reading, that we are dealing with a very different threat now from the one we faced in previous decades. Recent terrorist plots have been designed to cause mass casualties with no warnings&#151;I emphasise, no warnings, sometimes using suicide and with the threat of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_100">Some hon. Members have commented that terrorist cases are no more difficult to prosecute than complex fraud cases, but I argue that there is a very substantive difference between the two. In complex normal cases, the police may build a case before arresting an individual. It may also be possible to catch criminals red-handed in the act of committing a crime such as fraud, as the repercussions are not so great if the crime is committed. The need to ensure public safety by preventing mass casualty attacks that could be catastrophic in their effect means that it is necessary to make arrests in terrorist cases far earlier in the process than in other cases. That often means that much less evidence has been gathered at the point of arrest, so more time will be needed to gather sufficient evidence to   charge a suspect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_101">Moreover, terrorist networks are often international, which means that highly complex inquiries have to be undertaken in many different jurisdictions. I remind the House again of the investigations into the events of 7   and 21 July, which yielded 38,000 exhibits that filled two warehouses, and so on. Terrorist networks are also 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 343</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>now highly capable of using technology. In recent cases   a large number, sometimes in the hundreds, of computers and hard drives have been seized. Much of the data on such computers and hard drives have been encrypted and take time to decrypt. The data then need to be analysed to incorporate the outcome of that analysis into an interview strategy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_102">Following the debates in the House and the request from hon. Members in all parts of the House for more substance, over the past few days I have consulted advisers from the National Technical Assistance Centre, whose experts deal with the hardest and most important decryption jobs. Their advice has been unequivocal. A 14 or even 28-day period will not allow them the time they need adequately to investigate the most heavily encrypted data. They have made it clear to me that the use of advanced encryption technology by those who pose a threat to law and order or the security of the country is becoming more widespread and is growing rapidly. Encryption is more pervasive, more complex and easier to use than ever before.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_103">That poses a significant challenge to police and investigators on two fronts. First, it means that even sifting the evidence to identify which computers require specialist investigation and decryption usually&#151;the   experts&#039; word&#151;takes a number of weeks. Each computer must be examined to assess what data can be easily gleaned and where heavyweight code-breaking is required.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_104">Secondly, even after the protected data sources have   been identified, significant additional time may be   needed to decode potential evidence. NTAC has advised me that this is an extremely challenging and time-consuming task, running in the majority of the hardest cases into weeks at the very least, and often even into periods of months. Taking all this together, the technical judgement of the professionals is clear and simple. They need more time to be able to deal with such challenges. We must honour that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-14_para10">
<a name="stpa_105">Forensic requirements, too, are more complex and more time-consuming. My right hon.

We should take seriously the professional advice of the investigators, the police and the prosecutors about the   time needed to enable investigators to reach conclusions.

I say with humility that I do not need to give advice on that   to, for example, the west Yorkshire force, because I believe they are committed to doing it. But my hon.

As the Home Secretary said in relation to the national technical assistance centre, the police and security services need more time to scour CCTV footage and to crack encrypted messages. The international dimension of Islamist terrorism also brings new challenges. That is why my hon. Friends made it clear in Committee that we agree with the Government that the current 14-day limit is too brief and propose its extension to 28 days. I believe that that proposal will find widespread support among Members around the House, including on the Government Benches. But the proposal before the House is not ours but the Government&#039;s. The Government propose a full 90 days.

 The point was made best by the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, the right hon.

I have been through Mr. Hayman&#039;s evidence in some detail. The only quantification concerns a fictional case, not actual cases that have been presented, or might have been presented, to the courts.

We have heard his account of it, but the whole House knows the real reason. By yesterday, only a day after the Home Secretary signalled his desire to listen to the mood of the House, listening was off the agenda, because he had lost control of the matter. The whole House knows who has seized control and who has brought back the 90-day proposal that was withdrawn last week and introduced the fig leaf of the so-called sunset clause.

 My conversations with the police have been in order to seek evidence to support any case. I will tell the hon.

The suspect who ran off to Algeria was released after two days. It was intimated that the evidence material to that case was found after a few weeks, not after 90 days. On the decryption of hard disk data, we suggested using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, which puts a four-year sentence on withholding decryption codes. We suggested increasing that sentence, and that does now appear in the Bill. Then the police said, &quot;If we charge them, we can&#039;t interview them&quot;, so we raised the possibility of interview after charge.

 The right hon. Gentleman allows me, through his reference to the role of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, to make a point that I tried to raise with the Home Secretary. He will remember that, during the 1980s and 1990s, out of sincerely held conviction and principle, the Labour party consistently voted against the renewal of the terrorism legislation that related to Northern Ireland. At no time in that period, when Labour Members&#039; attitudes were clearly based on conviction and principle, did anyone accuse them of being complacent or pathetic. Such words lie ill in the mouths of those who criticise others whose opposition to the Government&#039;s proposal is equally based on sincere conviction and principle.

<a name="51109-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_121">Before 7 July, I analysed most of the instances of terrorism in the western world since 9/11 and examined the behaviour of the Opposition in the countries where they happened. I concluded that it was possible in some cases for Oppositions to score political advantage. Indeed, there was a change of Government in Spain. However, I also concluded that, whenever Oppositions did that, there was at least a risk, and generally a probability, that the primary beneficiaries were the terrorists, not western civilisation. I therefore took a   stance for which I have been criticised&#151;I believe by   hon.

Numerous conversations have taken place with the Home Secretary and the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety, as well as other Ministers, to   ascertain whether we could find solutions to the problem. There is evidence of that, too, and it reflects well on the Home Secretary from time to time. He altered the glorification clause to reduce the extent of its damage.

<br>&nbsp;<br>made &quot;no recommendation&quot; on the detention period. To return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron), let no one claim, either, that we need to bring our periods of detention into line with those of other countries. In Australia, where a murderous terrorist plot has just, mercifully, been foiled because of vigilant police action, there is   fierce debate about an extension from two days to 14 days. Most of the other countries with similar judicial systems to ours have smaller, not greater, rights to detain without trial. On the evidence that we have, 90 days is simply too long, and too long by an order of magnitude.

<a name="stpa_129">The relative leisure of the three-month time scale, compared with the present 14 days or&#151;for that matter, 28 days&#151;risks the imprisonment and consequent release without charge of innocent people. Those innocent people will be drawn disproportionately from one section of the community and there is a real risk in that community of a backlash on an unprecedented scale, not to mention the affront to justice that would be felt by all.

<a name="stpa_130">When this matter was raised with the Home Secretary, it was clearly a sore point, because he went into his high-decibel overdrive, as he sometimes does. He started talking about how the leaders of the community were entirely onside against terrorism. Of course they are. Of course the heads of the Muslim communities, in particular, are onside against terrorism. They fear this more than we do, I suspect. The problem that they face is the problem of radicalisation&#151;indeed, unknown radicalisation&#151;of very small but dangerous parts of their own community, involving young men in their community. We must not make those community leaders&#039; job more difficult, or, indeed, almost impossible.

I have been accused of opportunism; it is an odd kind of opportunism that takes the unpopular side of the argument, but never mind. A large number of people favour 90 days&#151;perhaps this is true in the Muslim community as well&#151;but they will do so only until the day it goes wrong, and we find that someone has been held for three months, lost his job, broken his family, yet comes out innocent. If he did not hate Britain when he went in, I suspect that he would have a grudge when he   came out. That is the situation that we have to look   forward to.

 The hon. Gentleman talks about the need for solid evidence and most of us would agree with that. Already in our legal system, however, is a recognition that getting the necessary evidence is not as straightforward as we would like. For example, we know that only 1 per cent. of people are convicted in child protection cases, but we also know that child abuse is widespread and a terrible thing. Our legal system deals with that by having common law family courts that are able, if necessary in the most extreme circumstances, to take children away from people who might harm them. We have a special system. Despite what the hon. Gentleman says about the need for evidence, the key is that we cannot always prove matters as simply or straightforwardly as we would like, even though we know that bad things are happening. Surely, terrorism provides a similar example: we know that terrible things can and may happen, so we have to ensure that our legal system can deal with them appropriately.

It will not have been lost on the House that on three occasions he gave no answer to that very straightforward question. I do not understand how the Lord Advocate can be asked for an opinion about the desirability of a uniform law to cover the whole of the UK without then being asked for a view on the issue of 90-day detentions.

I accept that that is difficult under the laws of evidence as they stand, but on the basis of my understanding of the law of England and Wales, I must say that it is not already impossible. Even if it were, or if there were difficulties, those difficulties could be removed by the Home Secretary coming forward with revisions to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act code under which questioning is carried on.

The notion that somebody who has been prepared to blow themselves up   will, after 10 weeks in custody, somehow be ready to co-operate, having seen the error of their ways with the police, when confronted with a piece of forensic evidence, I find it difficult to accept. That sort of spin and overselling should give us pause for thought. In my view, and this was the point raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie), it seems likely that the only basis on which that evidence might be forthcoming would be if the suspect had been ground down in the course of the 90 days, and that would constitute evidence that was unfairly obtained and which, as a result, would be inadmissible. That might leave us in a   position in which the only time a suspect spends in   custody is the 90 days prior to charge. How does that help the fight against terrorism? In our view, the bulk of cases are already adequately dealt with under the 14-day provision, and that will be sufficient.

I   am also on record as saying that, so far as I am concerned, the case for an extension from 14 days is irrefutable, but I have yet to hear enough convincing argument that 90 days is a totally justifiable time, which will guarantee that the police and security services can do all that they need to do to turn intelligence into evidence that can support charges. It is simply their best   professional estimate, and we must respect that. Indeed, the Home Secretary has said since last week that the 90-day figure is not crucial. So we are dealing with an estimate and it is up to us to make a judgment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_172">One of the reasons why so much heat has been generated about this issue is that the Government have, only very late in the day, realised the necessity to explain and persuade. I accept that the Home Secretary has made genuine attempts in the past few days to explain more fully why this is the Government&#039;s position, but it has been too little, too late for many hon. Members. I am personally better informed than I was last week&#151;I   stress that I am speaking entirely for myself, because the Intelligence and Security Committee has not come to   a view on this matter&#151;but I believe that there is much more that can and should be put into the public domain in a more comprehensive effort to explain the complexities of the problems that face the police and the   security services and why their professional advice is what it is.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_173">To be fair, the Home Secretary has gone further this afternoon than he went last week, but what we really need is a comprehensive description of the whole complexity of the problem, and what we are getting is bits and pieces&#151;the Metropolitan Police Commissioner comes to the Press Gallery; the Home Secretary comes here; someone else gives an interview to a newspaper&#151;but until someone produces the whole argument, I do not believe that any hon. Member can come to a complete and proper judgment. Whatever the result of the vote on the amendment may be, I urge the Home Secretary to do that before the Bill is considered further in another place and returns to the House. I shall be very happy to explain to and discuss with him some of the arguments that should be made public, but that would have to come from the Government, rather than from me.
</p>

<a name="51109-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_175">In Committee, many hon. Members agreed that the worst thing would be to simply arrive at a figure around which there was consensus, but which was not based on the needs and complexities of the situation that have led the professionals to tender the advice that they have. I   am completely satisfied that an extension is fully justified. I am also satisfied, from what I have been told, that an extension to 28 days would be wrong and would not give the police and security services the tools that they need to cope with such a complex matter.

However, if that amendment is incorporated in the Bill, there will be absolutely no chance of getting it out. That might be what some people want, but it is not what I want because I know that the   amount of time proposed in the amendment is inadequate. I still believe that provided that we can move the debate on, sensible people will be persuaded by fuller disclosure and argument.

 I agree. The Government have got themselves into this mess, and they have to get themselves out of it. I tried to make that point earlier in moderate terms, because their explanations are a case of too little and too late. We should not get ourselves into a situation which we cannot climb out of without giving the Government one more chance to be much more upfront and open about what they can tell us. Reasonable people will then be able to make a judgment on a much better basis than any judgment they will make today.

: I do not speak as a lawyer, although eminent lawyers have participated in our debate. I am certainly not a human rights lawyer like the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird), who may well   have campaigned against measures such as the Bill. I speak as someone who served in Northern Ireland, and was involved in the implementation of a number of counter-terrorism measures. I often had to stand on the   streets of Northern Ireland while members of the Labour party voted against important measures. Many members of the security forces risked their lives to work within the law, and we did so because we believed that   gathering evidence before arrest was the best way   to prevent and counter terrorism. Royal Ulster Constabulary officers and many other people in Northern Ireland learned that there are no shortcuts to counter-terrorism. One cannot wipe the slate clean or try to outmanoeuvre the terrorists in minutes or days, as we have seen in four days of debate on the Floor of the House. Have we forgotten the lessons that we learned in Malaya, Northern Ireland and even in Basra? Terrorism is defeated by winning hearts and minds, when the communities themselves stop people committing such acts. If the Government think that they will bring communities closer to the forces of law and order by incarcerating people for 90 days without trial they are badly mistaken. It is from communities that we get informers and tip-offs, and it is from the communities that we recruit members of the police forces and the security services that, in the end, defeat terrorism.

They will ignore the individual in the mosque who is starting to stir up trouble.

The way to solve terrorism is no different. It is only when communities engage with the forces of law and order that we start to head such people off. Whatever has caused the current problems in France, how much will the Algerian community, the north African and Muslim communities help the forces of law and order in the next year or two? The answer is very little. We must be careful how we proceed if we take individuals out of communities, which will be predominantly Islamic communities, some in my constituency, and hold them without charge for 90 days.

Let us consider one&#151;encryption. The Home Secretary will know that in some   serious crime cases, investigators have failed for two years to crack the computer encryption. The Government cannot guarantee that every encrypted device will be unlocked in 90 days, so are we to expect that they will return in a year and ask for the power to lock people up for a further year because a new encryption technique has been invented?

When that happens, it will render the whole exercise a complete waste of time. We must disapply the Human Rights Act.

 I   want to say at the outset that I shall support the Government in the Lobby this afternoon. However, I   have tabled an amendment, which would provide for

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 377</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a period of detention of up to 60 days. The reason for tabling amendment No. 33 is simple: we support the Government&#039;s position because we believe that the case is compelling and we want to support the police.

<p>
<a name="51109-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_199">Like other Lancashire Members of Parliament, I have a letter from the acting deputy chief constable of Lancaster, Julia Hodson, who urges us to support the Government so that she and her colleagues can protect the public in the way that they wish. My plea is simple: if amendment No. 55 falls&#151;I sincerely hope that it does not; it has my support&#151;28 days is not long enough because, as a Liberal Democrat Member said, it is insufficient for the police to do their work. In their recent evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the police referred to one case in which, if they had printed out the computer data that they had recovered, it would have made a pile 66,000 ft high. That is the sort of challenge that the police face and they need our help to meet it.

: The Government have treated the House badly in their handling of the matter. They have not briefed Members adequately. Had they done so, we might have reached a collective view.

 I am only sorry that this debate is not as much of a draw as the main attraction earlier, but I will do my best to make it as interesting as possible. The amendments build on some of the concepts that were contained in the amendments tabled in Committee by the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) and his hon. Friends.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_204">As the House will recall, we had quite a lengthy debate in Committee on the issue of intent and, more particularly, how we ensure that the offence of encouragement to terrorism in clause 1 of the Bill is workable&#151;which is what I said I wanted it to be&#151;but does not cast its net unduly wide. I undertook to examine that issue further because I wanted to ensure that we did not catch people who clearly were not in any way intending to encourage others to commit acts of terrorism. We have gone back to the drawing board and come up with a formulation that we hope meets those objectives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_205">The key amendment in this group is amendment No.   34, which replaces the existing clause 1(1). It provides that the offence in clause 1 can be committed in only two circumstances. Both of those circumstances were contained in amendments that we discussed last week, so the concepts have already been properly explored. The first set of circumstances is where a person makes or publishes a statement and intends it to be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 389</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>understood by its audience as an encouragement to carry out acts of terrorism. I do not think that anyone could object to that being a criminal offence, and we have put the word &quot;intends&quot; on the face of the Bill so there is complete clarity about the conduct that is meant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_206">The second set of circumstances is where a person makes or publishes a statement and is reckless as to whether or not it is likely to be understood by his or her audience as an encouragement to carry out acts of terrorism. Again, for clarity, we have put the word &quot;reckless&quot; on the face of the Bill, and that was a word drawn from Opposition amendments in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_207">We have also defined &quot;reckless&quot; for these purposes as being a case where the person could not reasonably have failed to have been aware of the consequences of his action. Again, I am sure that no one could object to this   provision. If an individual makes a statement encouraging others to commit an act of terrorism and could not reasonably have failed to realise the likely consequences of his actions, that should clearly be an offence.
</p>

<p><a name="st_386"><a name="51109-29_spnew0"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I was grateful to the Home Secretary when he said that he would amend the original clause 1, because it was very badly drafted, but I have some concerns about the amendments. The definition of &quot;reckless&quot; is completely contrary to the definition of recklessness in the recent case of R <i>v</i>. G and seeks to substitute the recklessness test in Caldwell, which has been discredited by the courts. It is extraordinary that Ministers should adopt a test for recklessness that the courts have said is the wrong test.
</p>





<p><a name="st_387"><a name="51109-29_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 As I continue, I hope that I will be able to convince the hon. Gentleman that the formulation that we have now covers intent and recklessness. It is important that we have an objective qualification of recklessness, but the words used raise the threshold and reverse the presumptions in the provisions. That series of tests should be sufficient to convince the hon. Gentleman that we have moved away significantly from the negligence test about which he and other hon. Members expressed concern in Committee. I hope to be able to convince him that the present formulation, which includes intent, recklessness and an objective assessment of recklessness, is sufficient to meet his concerns as well of those of the Government that we have a formulation that enables us to have some prosecutions of people who are clearly committing criminal acts.
</p>





<p><a name="st_388"><a name="51109-29_spnew2"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 Is not the difficulty that the right hon. Lady is trying to encompass with the same clause both a subjective and an objective test? In legal terms, that seems absurd.
</p>





<p><a name="st_389"><a name="51109-29_spnew3"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 No, I hope that as I develop my argument the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the provisions deal with intent and recklessness, with an   objective assessment of recklessness at a higher threshold. I am really trying to achieve a formulation that will command the support of the whole House. I   was concerned about negligence, and I shared those concerns, so we want a formulation that lifts the threshold but still enables us to prosecute people who, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 390</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>through their statements, are encouraging others to commit terrorist acts. That should command broad support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_208">I want to amplify those comments. We cannot allow people who could not reasonably have failed to realise the likely consequences of their actions to get away with that simply by saying that they did not know what effect their actions might have. That would enable people who   have encouraged or glorified terrorism to get away scot-free, without paying the penalty for their actions, by insisting, regardless of all the evidence, that they did not know the possible consequences of their actions. A provision that they should be caught if they could not reasonably have failed to know the consequences of their statements is the right way to avoid that situation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_209">I think that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr.   Grieve) said that juries are capable of considering such issues in context, and the provisions deal with the context and circumstances. The court will take all that into account. If we have only a subjective test, people will be able to say that they did not realise what the effect of their actions would be. We would then find it incredibly difficult to prosecute people who genuinely were encouraging other people, indirectly, to commit terrorist acts.
</p>





<p><a name="st_390"><a name="51109-29_spnew4"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 Every day of the week, juries conclude that people are not telling the truth when they claim not to have foreseen a consequence of their acts; otherwise, there would be no convictions at all. Why should the Government tinker with a definition that was approved by the other place? The House of Lords said that the Government&#039;s definition of recklessness in the provision is unjust and should not continue.
</p>





<p><a name="st_391"><a name="51109-29_spnew5"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 We explored those issues in detail in Committee and, as I told the hon. Gentleman then, if he looks at rape and other sexual offences, he will find that there is an objective test of recklessness. In rape, an offence is committed only if the person carrying out the act does not reasonably believe that the victim consents. A person charged with rape cannot say that they believed they had consent; they have to prove the objective test that their belief was reasonable. There is thus well-established law that it is perfectly proper to   have an objective test of recklessness and that we should not simply believe what a defendant says were the circumstances. The formulation of subsection (1A) moves things up a field, as the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge. We are not saying simply that there should be a reasonable belief, but that the defendant could not reasonably have failed to appreciate the effect of his words. We have genuinely tried to achieve a tight formulation that still enables us to prosecute. That is a   perfectly legitimate objective for the Government and   I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept it, despite his forensic examination of the legal niceties. That is legitimate, because we are talking about criminal offences, but it is my job to try to ensure that we have law that is practical, effective, workable and takes us away from the negligence provision, which I acknowledge was a concern. I think we have a good formulation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_392"><a name="51109-29_spnew6"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 As a matter of some pride, I state that I   am not a lawyer, but that does not preclude me from having legitimate concerns about the construction that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 391</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Government are proposing. I am unhappy&#151;as I   was   on a previous occasion&#151;about the reference to a statement and how it will appear to, or be interpreted by, &quot;members of the public&quot; to whom it is addressed. The provision does not specify which members of the   public; it does not specify that the statement should be made to a majority of the public, nor does it have the general threshold of right-thinking people. Is there not a danger that it is too wide?
</p>





<p><a name="st_393"><a name="51109-29_spnew7"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 As I say, we covered a lot of this ground in Committee, and I have genuinely tried to narrow the provision&#039;s ambit while trying to ensure that it is workable. I point out amendments Nos. 35, 41 and 42 to the hon. Gentleman. Again, they make an important clarification to the Bill. They make it clear that, for an offence to be committed, the audience has to understand that what is being said is an inducement for them and no   one else to commit terrorist acts. For example, no offence will be committed if a member of an audience at an academic lecture thinks, &quot;Well, I am not encouraged to commit terrorist acts, but I can quite imagine that, if this sentiment was expressed at a gathering of young Muslim men, it could have an encouraging effect on them.&quot; I think that that is implicit in the drafting, but those amendments make it absolutely explicit that the   likely effect must be on the people to whom the statement is addressed. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that that is another attempt by the Government to try to narrow the provision&#039;s ambit and focus it on the mischief to which this part of the Bill is addressed: those who directly or indirectly incite people to commit acts of terrorism. I hope that he will give us credit for seeking to narrow the ambit of the offence in those terms.
</p>





<p><a name="st_394"><a name="51109-29_spnew8"><b> Mr. Robert Marshall-Andrews  (Medway) (Lab):</b> 
 Will the Minister address a not-so-hypothetical example that concerns a lot of people? Given the state of the middle east at the moment, if someone&#151;for instance, myself&#151;says, &quot;I can well understand why decent Palestinians become terrorists&quot;, they would still fall foul of the test. In making that statement, I must be taken to know that someone may well be encouraged to act because they are mad or highly radicalised. In those circumstances, I   would be reckless according to the Bill. I should very much like the Minister to address that point and, if she   would be good enough later to take another intervention, to ask her about amendment No. 64, which I tabled, and what is wrong with it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_395"><a name="51109-29_spnew9"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 Again, we have trawled over this ground to a large extent, but the offence has two limbs: the making of a statement and the likely effect on the   audience. If someone says that they could not reasonably fail to understand or appreciate the effect of a statement on the audience, that is a fair test about the circumstances in which they make that statement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_210">I think that I went through with my hon. and learned Friend last week the number of hurdles that we would have to overcome to bring a successful prosecution, and the provision will be even tighter now. Someone must have an intention or be reckless, and there is an objective test of recklessness. The statement must be likely to encourage others. There must be a realistic prospect of conviction. The prosecution must be in the public interest and the Director of Public Prosecution&#039;s consent is needed.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_211">For my hon. and learned Friend simply to make a statement with which someone could empathise or sympathise without knowing or being reckless in its effect on the audience does not fit the definition and formulation that we propose. With respect, he is stretching the definition and the circumstances to an untenable extent if he examines the current formulation. I know that he does not like the whole principle of the clause, but he is stretching things beyond the bounds if he is saying that he understands why people might find themselves in that kind of mindset. That will not make him fall foul of such a criminal prosecution.

 I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation.

 I am glad that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that the formulation that we propose for the clause is fairly tightly drafted and does not cast the net too wide. Clearly, the individual circumstances are important. I have been asked on many occasions to speculate on what kind of phrases might make people fall foul of the provision. The only example that I have felt comfortable giving is where someone says, &quot;Wasn&#039;t it a fantastic thing that happened on 7 July?&quot; knowing that the likely effect is to encourage their audience to engage in acts of terrorism. We are genuinely trying to   aim this legislation at that kind of formulation, not at all the wider examples. Sometimes, the offence has been stretched beyond the realms of possibility, and we have genuinely tried to narrow it down to the mischief that we are trying to target. The amendments narrow the provisions on the audience itself. The likely effect on the   audience is the second limb of the offence, so there is a consideration of what is done and the likely effect of that on the audience.

 I do not think that that deals with the issue. I acknowledge that the Minister has worked hard to try to improve the Bill. I am happy to concede her good intent, but that does not mean that the result is satisfactory. I repeat the point that was implicit in what   the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr.   Marshall-Andrews) said. When a statement is published, its audience is necessarily wider and larger than that for a statement that is not published. Unless a more reasonable amendment is agreed to, surely we could be considering a mad, neurotic, or frankly hypersensitive individual who could be influenced to behave in a particular way, although that individual might well have behaved in that way anyway. The provision is too broad and an amendment such as that which the hon. and learned Gentleman has in mind would narrow it substantially.

<p><a name="st_401"><a name="51109-30_spnew5"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 I do not propose to narrow the offence to the point at which it would become impossible to prosecute. As I have said on several occasions, there is a real problem with people making statements that they know will encourage others to undertake terrorist acts. We need legislation that is focused on such mischief and able to deal with it. The hon. Gentleman might wish to narrow the offence even further, but I think that our formulation will address people&#039;s genuine concerns. He raises the prospect of one person who might take a statement in such a completely unreasonable way. I have set out the fact that there will be seven hurdles before there is a prosecution, so the likelihood of a prosecution for a criminal offence in such circumstances would be infinitesimal. It is not the business of the House to make legislation in such terms. There is a broad and reasonable case for our formulation. I have gone this far, but I am afraid that I shall go no further, not even for the hon. Gentleman.

Would not adopting such a provision, which is in the Council of Europe convention on the prevention of terrorism, deal with the problem that has been identified regarding one person who hears a statement?

</p>





<p><a name="st_405"><a name="51109-30_spnew9"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 I remember our discussion in Committee. I think that the response that I gave to the hon. Gentleman then still stands. If an actual danger had to be proved, it would set the threshold too high and the prosecution would find it difficult to bring a case. We are trying to get the balance right so that we can use the legislation to prosecute people who are causing a real problem in this country, yet ensure that we do not inadvertently bring people into the net who quite properly should be allowed to say the things that they want to say. That is at the heart of the Bill&#151;we are trying to get the right balance between the correct security measures and the protection of liberty and freedom of speech. I am trying to draw that balance correctly without erring in favour of either priority. I do not want the Bill to be a piece of legislation under which people can still say those things with impunity because they are clever enough to formulate their words knowing that they will have an effect on other people but   that they will escape prosecution themselves. It is   not in the interests of anyone in this country to allow   that situation to continue. Most of the remaining   Government amendments in this group are consequential, as the meat of the argument is contained in Government amendment No. 34. We have found a formulation that works, and I hope that it will be accepted by all hon. Members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_214">Amendments Nos. 19, 14, 2 and 21 would all have the same effect. Instead of allowing a recklessness test that would cover individuals who could not reasonably have failed to realise the likely effect of their actions, they limit the offence to people who intend or can be shown to have known the likely effect of their actions. As I said, that recklessness test is subjective, as opposed to objective. I have received advice that the formulation in subsection (1A) of amendment No. 34 is drafted to reflect the Caldwell case. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) will know more about that than I do, but it is right to include such a test. If we simply used a subjective test, individuals who brazenly encourage terrorism would be able to argue, despite the fact that they could not reasonably have failed to understand the likely effect of their comments, that they did not foresee the risk that members of their audience would be encouraged to commit acts of terrorism. The difference between that subjective test and the test in the   Government amendments is crucial to the success of the legislation. Without an objective test, people could simply say that they did not intend their words to have a particular effect on their audience, and that they did not have any idea what would happen. We all know of individuals who have made such statements, but we have found it impossible to prosecute them. We want to make sure, however, that we can do so in future.

<p><a name="st_406"><a name="51109-31_spnew0"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 As I said in my intervention on the Minister, I wanted to welcome the Home Secretary&#039;s conversion on clause 1 in the light of last week&#039;s debate.   Indeed, when I saw him on Monday I was overwhelmingly grateful because during a wide-ranging discussion he accepted the argument that the drafting of clause 1 was too loose. It took us some time to tease out the implications last week, but the upshot of our debate was that the offence could be committed as a result of negligence. Mindful of the amendment that I tabled last week, the Home Secretary accepted that the offence should only be committed intentionally or recklessly. I   was pleased with that result, and I thanked the Home Secretary. However, when I looked at the draft of amendment No. 34, I discovered that it reads very well only until the end of subsection (1). Subsection (1A) says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;For the purposes of this section the cases in which a person is to be taken as reckless as to whether a statement is likely to be understood as mentioned in subsection (A1) include any case in which he could not reasonably have failed to be aware of that likelihood.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_216">I always understood that in the normal test of recklessness, the word was to be given its ordinary English meaning. The problem has arisen because for a   period of 20 years, which I suspect was an aberration, as a result of the Court of Appeal judgment in Caldwell, it became possible for a person to act recklessly even though he never foresaw the risk of something occurring. In a sense it was an objective test. The jury could say, &quot;We accept entirely that in doing what you did, you never foresaw the risk of something occurring, but we can say that you are guilty nevertheless, because when we look at the facts, we think we would have foreseen that the risk would occur.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_217">That decision stood until last year, when the House of Lords examined it again in a case called R <i>v.</i> G. As the Minister knows, before the House of Lords looked at it, the test in Caldwell had come in for massive criticism over the years from both academic and judicial authorities. In R <i>v.</i> G the House of Lords looked at the entirety of it, and the upshot was that the authority of Caldwell was wholly overruled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_218">It is worth considering the reasons why the Law Lords decided to do that. They stated, first, that while the most obvious culpable state of mind was an intention to cause an injurious result, knowing disregard of an appreciated and unacceptable risk of causing an injurious result or a deliberate closing of the mind to such a risk would be readily accepted as culpable also. But it was not clearly blameworthy to do something involving a risk of injury to another if, for reasons other than self-induced intoxication, one genuinely did not perceive the risk.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_219">Secondly, the Caldwell formulation was capable of leading to injustice. Thirdly, the criticism of Caldwell by   academics, judges and practitioners was not to be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 396</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>ignored, and fourthly, it was clear that the majority&#039;s interpretation of &quot;reckless&quot; in Caldwell had been a misinterpretation of Parliament&#039;s intention in the Bill at   that time, which was to leave the essential law unchanged. Therefore the test of recklessness should return to what it had been historically for many years before the Caldwell decision took place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_220">I have a slight criticism, which is that it took me a phone call to the draftsmen in the Home Secretary&#039;s office to get finally an admission that it was true that they had put in not the current test of recklessness, but the old test of recklessness. I know the Government do not like the judiciary, and perhaps the House of Lords particularly, but that is a crazy course of action to adopt.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_221">In her comments, the Minister said, &quot;We&#039;ve done it in other cases, like rape.&quot; Yes, I acknowledge that. When we considered changing to an objective test in rape cases, there was considerable debate in Committee. The   reason we chose to do it was the nature of rape as an offence, its seriousness and all the surrounding circumstances. To equate rape with words used by an individual seems a very poor comparison. The equation given in the discussion in R <i>v.</i> G refers to criminal damage, which is a   good example of the narrow boundary between negligence and recklessness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_222">Where somebody is to be criminalised for something they said, on the basis that it might indirectly incite terrorism, we would be in danger of perpetrating injustice unless we said that the test that a jury has to apply is the current test, not the old test. The Minister will have to provide a compelling justification for me to be willing to accept the amendment. I questioned the draftsmen about the amended version. I do not think there is any difference between amendment No. 34 and the original draft. If there is, it is minute.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_223">The real criticism of the earlier draft is that it was incredibly sloppy, because the Minister&#151;I hope that she forgives me for saying this&#151;was attempting to conceal what the Government were trying to do, which is why   we ended up with the opaque language that I   complained about last week.

In light of the decision of the House of Lords in R <i>v.</i> G, the drafting is also unsatisfactory. Indeed, I   am almost forced to conclude that if that is really what the Minister wants to do, it would be better if the word, &quot;reckless&quot; did not feature.

 I accept that point, but the Minister seemed to hint that if we introduce a recklessness test, as defined by the House of Lords in R <i>v.</i> G, it would present insurmountable obstacles to prosecution and that all sorts of unsavoury people who had said things that they should not would get off. I do not accept that argument: when a defendant goes into the witness box and says, &quot;I   acted honestly when I walked out of the shop with the goods under my arm. It was all a mistake,&quot; juries have no difficulty in examining the circumstances and saying, &quot;Actually, you were dishonest, and that is a crime of specific intent.&quot;

<a name="51109-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_226">One can still be convicted under the subjective test. All that needs to be shown is that the defendant must have foreseen a risk in the course of carrying out a particular activity. It is even easier to convict under the subjective test, so I do not accept that it will lead to people whom the Government want to criminalise being   acquitted. Consider the example of a foreign preacher who does not know much about life in Britain and who has come over on a visit. If he said, first, &quot;I   never intended to incite terrorism,&quot; and secondly, &quot;I never foresaw that there was a risk of inciting terrorism,&quot; the jury could say, &quot;Although we see those words as incitement, we understand that he is telling the truth.&quot; The question is this: if the person is telling the   truth about it, is it right that he should be landed with a criminal conviction?

 Yes, it is. The convoluted drafting of clause 1 is going to be nightmare for anyone who has to deal with it in the courts. On the other hand, in a spirit of good will and compromise, I have not touched that provision in my amendment. I have simply added to it two completely unobjectionable paragraphs that would deal precisely with the point that I am making. This would simply import into the Bill the provision that recklessness would apply only if what   someone perceived as likely was inducement or encouragement to reasonable members of the public.

<p><a name="st_430"><a name="51109-33_spnew2"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 The Government are developing a prodigious talent for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. They undertake a listening exercise, and agree that something is wrong with their Bill and try to find a way to resolve it. They go almost all the way towards securing the support of Members in all parts of the House, then they ruin it by quite extraordinary drafting. That is very regrettable. I would have hoped that last   week&#039;s debate, which was perhaps in rather more high-flown terms than we are mustering this evening, might have persuaded the Government that they had to do the job properly. The result of last&#039;s week&#039;s vote might have indicated that were they not to do it properly, the Bill was highly unlikely to survive in this House or another place without further amendment. I   regret that the Minister has come to the House with a rather unacceptable amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_233">I want to return to the origins of what the Government are trying to do, with which I have a number of problems. First, I do not understand why the current incitement offences on the statute book are insufficient to deal with the issue, apart from the fact that they are not prosecuted. Many of us find ourselves increasingly impatient because the police and prosecuting authorities do not use the offences already there to deal with the problem. Undoubtedly, incitement offences could have been used on occasions against prominent individuals who would be caught by the prospective legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_234">Secondly, as the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) pointed out, incitement is the correct term in the context of such an offence, rather than encouragement. It worries me that such a mild term is used in a way that is open to all sorts of constructions, which we have yet to learn, as the matter has not been before a court. I also worry because we have still not secured&#151;and I do not think that we will do so this evening&#151;an adequate definition of terrorism and terrorist offences. Potentially, therefore, an offence can be drawn from a much wider field.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_235">I do not know whether the Minister intended&#151;or   whether she was simply wilfully reckless in the matter&#151;to bring forward an amendment with a self-contradictory internal structure. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) ably set out, it 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 402</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>applies two conflicting tests&#151;the objective test of recklessness and the subjective test of recklessness&#151;in relation to the same clause. It is recklessness of a high degree to consider what the court has expressly rejected and then to introduce that in new legislation, as though nothing had happened and it had never been considered. That might be part of the Prime Minister&#039;s declared policy, as expressed at Prime Minister&#039;s questions today&#151;that he would prefer to listen to police officers than Law Lords. I am sure that that will endear him to those who will consider this Bill later. Perhaps he believes that Law Lords simply do not understand law in the same way as police officers do. I must, however, counsel Home Officer Ministers that that is not a sensible way of approaching the issue.
</p>





<p><a name="st_431"><a name="51109-33_spnew3"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that it is appropriate to have an objective recklessness test in the sexual offences field, and in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 relating to money laundering? A range of issues in legislation have an objective recklessness test.
</p>





<p><a name="st_432"><a name="51109-33_spnew4"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 There are a number of points to make. First, we are dealing with a constraint on freedom of speech, which does not apply to those other offences. In the sexual offences legislation, we are dealing with a specific issue of an interaction between two people in which the critical issue is consent, and in which one person&#039;s word will often be used against another&#039;s, and in that instance it is absolutely appropriate for the jury to come to a view on an objective test. I really do not understand how the Minister can come to the Dispatch Box, apparently briefed by her civil servants, to proclaim proudly that what she hopes to enact is that which is within the Caldwell case, which the hon. Member for Beaconsfield has described as something that leads to injustice. The Minister parades case law that has apparently been interpreted as leading to injustice as an argument for including it in the Bill. The House deserves rather better than that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_236">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield made an interesting point about what a cleric newly arrived in the country might understand the clause to mean. As he said that, it occurred to me that the cleric might be quoting holy scripture.&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Mahmood) feigns incredulity, but I could quote a large amount of holy scripture that would fall within the constraints of the clause. That worries me. It also occurred to me to wonder&#151;this too is an aside&#151;what the position of an interpreter would be. Does an interpreter publish the words that he is asked to interpret? At what point does his understanding of what he has been asked to interpret become a potential offence under the clause?
</p>





<p><a name="st_433"><a name="51109-33_spnew5"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 Let us suppose that someone is called in to interpret a speech given in Arabic by a cleric to a British audience. As the translation proceeds, he realises that his action constitutes an incitement to terrorism. He will have to stop. That must be the answer, because otherwise he would commit the offence.
</p>





<p><a name="st_434"><a name="51109-33_spnew6"><b> Mr. Heath: </b>

 That sort of language should not be protected simply because it is in holy scripture if it constitutes indirect incitement according to a narrow intentional or subjective recklessness test.

 Strangely enough, I agree, but I do not entirely understand why it is a flaw.

The point is that if I perceive that there may be unreasonable people out there who will receive such a statement as encouragement or inducement to such behaviour, but I go ahead and make that statement, I   commit the offence under the terms of the Bill.

I would also like to put it on the record that I do not believe that either the Home Secretary or the Minister tried to deceive me; I think that there was a genuine misunderstanding between us as to what the Home Secretary was actually conceding. I also hope that the Minister will understand the reasons why, when I   was talking about recklessness, I meant the common-or-garden English term as interpreted currently by the courts. It is for that reason, and because it will not do any harm to the successful prosecution of offences, that I prefer my version in amendment No. 19.

<br>



<p><a name="st_454"><a name="51109-35_spnew0"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 These amendments address the important issue of the encouragement of terrorism. As the Minister will know, we have supported provisions on indirect incitement, even if we have had differences of opinion on whether it can be committed recklessly and what the definition of &quot;recklessness&quot; should be. The difficulty we have is with clause 1(2), which seeks to introduce into the definition of incitement statements that indirectly encourage the commission or preparation of acts, or glorify
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;the commission or preparation (whether in the past, in the future or generally) of such acts or offences; and . . . is a statement from which those members of the public could reasonably be expected to infer that what is being glorified is being glorified as conduct that should be emulated in existing circumstances.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_250">The difficulty, which was highlighted in Committee, is that the concept of an offence&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>





<p><a name="st_455"><a name="51109-35_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman. The hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) should not be discussing matters in sub-committee while this debate is taking place.
</p>





<p><a name="st_456"><a name="51109-35_spnew1"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The concept of unlawful glorification is alien to our law. On the whole, if people wish to go out and glorify something, they are free to do so. Indeed, as the House will be aware, the origin of the provisions seems to have come from a decision by the Government at some time in the summer that they wanted to make glorification a separate offence. That attracted much adverse public comment and, as a result, the Government decided shortly before the Bill was published&#151;a previous draft Bill contained the separate offence of glorification&#151;to collapse glorification into the single offence of encouragement of terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_251">The impression that was given at the time was that glorification had disappeared, but unfortunately it has not. It is present as a distinct subsection in clause 1. It is difficult to understand why it has been left there. I can easily think of examples of someone glorifying something that might amount to an incitement to commit a terrorist offence, because the words of glorification could clearly relate to incitement. But if there is indeed no incitement, to identify glorification as a form of incitement and as something that is likely to be understood by members of the public
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;as indirectly encouraging the commission or preparation&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_252">of an offence seems quite wrong. It imposes a burden on anybody who wants to glorify historical events to think carefully, because they may find themselves liable to criminal prosecution and subject to a term of imprisonment of seven years. That is not a reasonable way for Parliament to proceed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_253">If somebody incites terrorism, even by indirect means&#151;oblique references, nudges, winks or suggestions that terrorism is an appropriate remedy&#151;I am happy to criminalise them and happy that they should go to prison for seven years if the offence is serious enough. But it is not right that the mere glorification of the commission of a terrorist offence, which, under the Bill, could include the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 411</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>past activities of Robin Hood, Wat Tyler or Guy Fawkes, should be sufficient to found the basis of a criminal offence, if the statement was one from which
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;members of the public could reasonably be expected to infer that what is being glorified is being glorified as conduct that should be emulated&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_254">I am sure that there was a Wat Tyler society when I was up at Oxford and, as I said on Wednesday, many student societies of a slightly anarchic kind might have dinners or meetings that glorified Wat Tyler or John Bull&#151;names that used to have a great appeal for Labour Members, which has disappeared under new Labour.
</p>





<p><a name="st_457"><a name="51109-35_spnew2"><b> Lembit &#214;pik  (Montgomeryshire) (LD):</b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the provision would apply not only to Guy Fawkes and Robin Hood but also, at least in theory, to Gerry Adams? There is a difficulty for the Prime Minister and the Government, as it is unclear that the Prime Minister would not fall foul of his own law, given the fact that he has often praised, and expressed admiration for, the contribution of a man who is unquestionably a former terrorist. The courts could have a field day with the Prime Minister, who could end up behind bars as a result of the provisions.
</p>





<p><a name="st_458"><a name="51109-35_spnew3"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman raises a possible unintended consequence. In fairness to the Prime Minister, I do not think that he has ever commended Mr. Adams for having committed terrorist offences. He has commended him for being a reformed terrorist, which is a slightly different concept&#151;if indeed, Mr. Adams is reformed, a subject on which there is always a certain amount of speculation, given his membership, certainly in the past, of the IRA army council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_255">The scope of the definition of terrorism, which is linked to our other debate, is so wide that it encompasses all historical characters who took up arms against the state in any setting whatever.
</p>





<p><a name="st_459"><a name="51109-35_spnew4"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I was struck by the hon. Gentleman&#039;s recollections of his student days. When he was at Oxford, did he ever see a poster of Che Guevara in a heroic pose? Did he share that experience&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for East Lothian (Anne Moffat) says that this is serious. Taking away people&#039;s liberty is serious.
</p>





<p><a name="st_460"><a name="51109-35_spnew5"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 Che Guevara was a student pin-up when I was at university; indeed, there were Che Guevara societies. There were commemorations of what people claimed was his heroic death and life, and of the fact that he was a freedom fighter or, as some would say, a terrorist, using force to combat what were regarded as capitalist and tyrannical regimes. There is no doubt that if someone were to glorify the activities of Che Guevara at a meeting where
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;members of the public could reasonably be expected to infer that what is being glorified is being glorified as conduct that should be emulated in existing circumstances&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_256">they would commit an offence. Furthermore, in relation to the term, &quot;emulated in existing circumstances&quot;, one has to ask: existing circumstances, where? These are issues that the Minister really must address.

 I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman recalls the statement that Churchill made in the middle of the war: &quot;set Europe ablaze.&quot; That is what he said when he gave the job of running the Special Operations Executive to Hugh Dalton, who was a previous Member for my constituency. The SOE supplied the explosives for the resistance in Europe. That is particularly close to my heart since my Danish uncle used those explosives to blow up Nazi trains to disrupt Nazi communications. Would the hon. Gentleman like to comment on that example?

 The hon. Lady makes a serious point. During the war, the Germans described those who were resisting them as terrorists. Indeed, that issue was not necessarily free of difficulty. I am half French by background. General de Gaulle had concerns that the violence being used by the resistance in France should be proportionate and focused, otherwise those involved could be reasonably classified as behaving as terrorists. Indeed, he tried to moderate them by saying that they should use complete force only when the liberation was at hand and it could be shown to produce a military goal. I simply cite that as an example of the very difficult grey areas that we must consider.

 We still have a realistic case in Northern Ireland. A significant section of the community no doubt will hold commemorations to glorify the actions of the men of 1916. Clearly, that has a resonance with what is going on in our streets and towns in Northern Ireland today. Equally, others will celebrate the work of Carson and his volunteers, who defied Parliament and the Government. No doubt, that will have a resonance among many people in the streets and towns of Northern Ireland as well. The only defence that the Government have is that the DPP might not take a case to court in those circumstances. That is hardly a safe way for us to proceed, is it?
</p>





<p><a name="st_464"><a name="51109-36_spnew1"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is quite right. Of course, the commemorations of the Easter rising that are due to take place next year, sanctioned by the Irish Government, are undoubtedly a glorification of the actions of people who were regarded at the time as terrorist and, indeed, treated as terrorists during the rising by a large section of the Irish population. That is a simple truth. Subsequently, partly because of the folly of the British Government, those involved were turned into heroes, but that is not how they were viewed when the rising occurred. That absolutely epitomises the nature of the problem that we face.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_257">The Government&#039;s response has tended to be that we   need not worry because the DPP or the Attorney-General will deal with this problem in his selective application of the law, but that is not good enough. Glorification as an offence has no place in our law. I do not want to take up the House&#039;s time tonight&#151;this issue has been rehearsed before&#151;but the simple and easy solution is for Parliament and hon. Members collectively, and in no spirit of hostility to the Government, to say that we understand the origin of the idea that they have proposed but that, in truth, we do not care for it.

<a name="stpa_258">If the Government are not willing&#151;I think that they are not&#151;voluntarily to get rid of subsection (2) and the other subsections derived from it, we must do the job. That requires a vote, which is what amendment No. 3 is all about. I hope that the House, which has shown its   independence today, will simply say that, of course we support the offence of indirect incitement to terrorism, but this glorification notion is a muddle. It will not help to prosecute those who need to be prosecuted. It will cause endless bother and send out a slightly tacky signal about how Parliament and the Government view individuals who express opinions in a sense about past events. We can deal with clerics, British National party leaders and others who may wish to invoke terrorism, violence or whatever they wish to do   quite easily by keeping the Bill while deleting subsection (2) and the related subsections. That is why I commend amendment No. 3 to the House.

<p><a name="st_465"><a name="51109-36_spnew2"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I entirely concur with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve). There is no place for the offence on our statute book. I do not see the point of it, and that is not because I lack any vigour on fighting terrorism. I simply do not believe that it is a useful addition to the offences available to the police and prosecuting authorities to reduce the likelihood of terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_259">Let us make no bones about this. The provision is clearly a vestigial remnant of an idea that must have sounded good on the day on which it was put forward by the Prime Minister, but that has been expunged elsewhere. The fragment of the Prime Minister&#039;s idea remains in the Bill, but I hope that we will clear it up today, which is why we have put our names to amendment No. 3.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_260">The offence might have looked appropriate in 17th   century legislation because it is the sort of thing that Parliament passed at that time. Parliament could afford a little imprecision in its terms in those days because it knew that it had a compliant judiciary that could be relied on to do the Executive&#039;s bidding. I can imagine some of my ancestors being prosecuted for glorification. They were transported as slaves after the rebellion in 1685. We had a wonderful judicial system in those days because defendants were advised not to plead their innocence before the court because that would waste the court&#039;s time. We have moved on a long way since then.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_261">The provision is drafted in such imprecise terms that it undermines the Government&#039;s rational case behind other measures in the Bill. Its chilling effect is that it has the capacity to worry a great many people who will never be prosecuted under the Bill. We have considered such an effect when we have dealt with other legislation. The fact that it might be possible to bring a perverse prosecution under the Bill could mean that people would think it better not to say what they had intended to say. However, that would lead to the serious curtailment of our free speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_262">The Government have provided for other offences in   the Bill. We have just debated the encouragement of   terrorism. I have already said that I would prefer that   activity to be termed as incitement because 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 414</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>encouragement is a loose term. However, the concept of encouragement is a million times better than the strange offence of glorification. Labour Back Benchers made many valid contributions when we last discussed the matter and pointed out the dangers of the imprecision that was inherent in the measure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_263">I hope that the Government will be prepared to think again even at this late stage. I do not think that those in the other place who are well versed in law&#151;certainly better versed than I am&#151;will wear it for a moment. The provision will be struck out there, but as I have said on many occasions, it would be preferable for the elected House to do its job. Ministers claim to be looking for consensus on the Bill, but they know that there is a general consensus on the proper requirement to deal with people who incite terrorism in this country. They should listen to others and acknowledge that the provision will not achieve what they want.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_264">We have heard fanciful and hyperbolic examples of what could be caught by the offence. Although they are useful for illustrative purposes, I do not think that anyone seriously assumes that the Attorney-General would prosecute anyone for the flimsy reasons that have been adduced as behaviour that could be caught by the offence. Of course, such prosecutions would not be brought. When we are legislating in the House, particularly when we introduce new offences that curtail the power of free speech, which some of us hold dear, we must be extremely careful and precise. We should know what is intended in the measures, and if we use hyperbole to illustrate our case we should do so with the intention of bringing the House to its senses so that it can understand the consequences of ill-considered legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_265">My hon. Friends and I have tabled amendments Nos.   31 and 30, which deal with the use of the word &quot;glorification&quot; in clause 21. I urge the Government to   reconsider its inclusion, because we have terms to proscribe organisations under the Terrorism Act 2000. Only a few weeks ago, the Minister submitted to the House a further list of organisations that should be proscribed under that Act. The House agreed with her, albeit with concerns about one organisations. Generally, however, it was happy to accede to her view that those organisation should be proscribed under that   legislation. If she is going to extend the terms of   proscription to include the vague concept of glorification, a vast number of organisations around the world could be caught. Some of those organisations may have had a presence in this country, but that will not be the case for many of them, as we learned from the order that was laid before the House only a few weeks ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_266">If we widen the scope of proscription, there will be intense diplomatic pressure on the Government to proscribe many organisations of which we know little. Another country&#039;s Government, for example, may say, &quot;We have a problem with a certain organisation, which spends all its time saying what a wonderful thing it was that the statue of our President was blown up last week.   That is entirely unacceptable. If Her Majesty&#039;s Government are serious about terrorism, when will you take the necessary steps to proscribe that organisation?&quot; 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 415</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>If we wish to maintain a good diplomatic relationship with that country, the pressure on the Home Secretary to accede to that request will be very strong indeed.
</p>





<p><a name="st_466"><a name="51109-36_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gummer </b> 
: Is there not an important reason why this is not just a passing thing that can be ignored? The difficulty with effectively buying prosecution in this way is that we create circumstances in which political decisions appear to be made. Of course, that is not the case, but that is how it appears to other countries when they see that one organisation is subject to the law, but another is not. That is very dangerous: not only does it bring pressure to bear on the Government but it makes people feel hard done by if their organisation is dealt with in that way, while another is not.
</p>





<p><a name="st_467"><a name="51109-36_spnew4"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is right, and the provision will prejudice British interests in future. People whom we call terrorists today may be freedom fighters tomorrow and the Government the day after. The measure therefore puts the country in the difficult position of receiving requests that we cannot possibly fulfil in the interests of justice, but with which diplomatic pressure and the immediate national interest will urge us to comply. That puts the Home Secretary in a difficult position for the sake of a definition that is not worth the candle. If terrorist and other organisations are covered by the wide definition of support for terrorist activities in the Terrorism Act 2000, it is right that we should proscribe their activities in this country. However, we do not need the flimsy excuse of glorification to extend those provisions, because the House has shown that it is prepared to act responsibly when presented with information by the Government, even when, for reasons of security and the need to protect the provenance of the information, it cannot be given the full facts. The House has been prepared to take on trust the advice of this very Minister in extending the provisions of the Terrorism Act. That trust may be strained if we accept the provision, as the grounds for proscription would then be that much weaker. That worries me because it is a serious step that the Government are taking in these instances, and we wish to protect the strength of the arguments behind it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_267">For those reasons, we will support the hon. Member for Beaconsfield if he chooses to press his amendment this evening, but I hope the Government will pre-empt that by saying that they will reconsider the clause and do the job that at earlier stages they implied that they might do, and look again at clause 21, which is unnecessarily widened by the provision.

 If the Government were prepared to look again at the provision, that would be sensible. Clause 21 presents slightly different difficulties. There is agreement that the clause has some merit, but in its current formulation it is fundamentally flawed.

 Precisely so. That is why I hope that even at this late stage the Minister will give an assurance that she will look again at the clause. I treat such assurances with a little more scepticism now than I did last week, because sometimes the assurance and even the statement in public of an intention to revise do not quite materialise in practice. Nevertheless, I am prepared to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>take at face value any assurances that the Minister is likely to give this evening. The House will wish the Bill to be improved in the way that has been suggested, and if the House does not demand that in the Division Lobbies this evening, I am confident that the other House will.

 I support my hon. Friend the   Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) on his amendment No. 3. I would support him in the Division Lobby if he pressed the argument that we should remove the subsection referring to glorification because, as he said, of its dangerous vagueness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-37_para0">
<a name="stpa_268">I spoke on the subject last week during the Committee stage, so I will not repeat the arguments that I advanced and the examples that I gave of incidents that might be caught by the Bill, such as people holding dinners in favour of one national hero or giving speeches in praise of another historic hero. I trust that the Minister will address herself to some of those when she replies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_269">I agree with the Liberal spokesman, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), that one or two of the examples that we bandied about were rather fanciful. I doubt whether Robin Hood would fall within the clear definition of a terrorist, but some of the others were quite serious. I spoke last week about the Irish examples that could be cited on both sides of the political divide that has hitherto existed in Ireland, and there are other international ones as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_270">In addition to adopting the arguments that I made last week, which were not met, I seek clarification about how international the application of the clause will be. I   cannot anticipate a later group of amendments that deals in general with the commission of offences overseas, but in trying to envisage the problems that the insertion of the term &quot;glorification&quot; might create, it is important that we get clear in our minds whether we are speaking of incidents involving glorification in this country, or whether we are still liable to find that people are being prosecuted on allegations that they have glorified various violent people in their own territory, far away from this country.

<a name="51109-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_271">The Government have tabled, and we will discuss later, amendment No. 48, which seeks to move towards some of the arguments that we used last week about extra-territoriality.

<a name="stpa_273">I shall move on to one of the more tricky examples. If someone in the Caucasus were to praise the Chechen rebels and their struggle against the Russian authorities, they would arguably commit an offence, although they might not appreciate it at the time. They would have praised the commission of an act, because they would undoubtedly have praised people who had participated in terrorism in circumstances in which it might be inferred that they were encouraging other people to join. It is almost certain that they would not have the first idea that they were breaking British law or were making themselves liable to conviction in a British court when they stood up to speak in some far-away town in the Caucasus and became carried away with their own version of patriotic fervour.

<a name="51109-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_275">A Bill that seeks to define the encouragement of terrorism in such general and uncertain terms should not be allowed to create an offence of worldwide application. Furthermore, the British Attorney-General should not be put in a situation in which he or she is subject to political pressure from a foreign Government to start arresting people who come here, because, in that Government&#039;s opinion, one of their citizens has committed an offence under the Bill.

<p>
<a name="51109-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_276">Clause 1 would be improved by the deletion of subsection (2), but the key point is that subsection (2) should not be applied to the opponents of President Chavez in Venezuela or those who lead uprisings in   Chiapas in Mexico or in the Caucasus. It would be   preposterous if the Government were still contemplating the possibility of using that vague wording to start arresting people, if such people were unwise enough to visit this country after making over-stirring and over-excited speeches in the country from which they came.

 Would not the Government have to take for granted the information laid before them by a foreign Government?

 I agree with my right hon. Friend. That is one reason to be particularly cautious when hon. Members try to claim extra-territorial jurisdiction and give it to our courts.

That is a mean, unpleasant and unfair suggestion but it should nevertheless be avoided rather than encouraged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_283">Secondly, the provision becomes an even greater danger if extra-territoriality&#151;I am delicate in my references because of your earlier, proper restrictions, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;turns out to apply to the extent that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr.   Grieve) suggests. Those who may wish to put pressure on the Government are even less likely to understand the independent position of the Director of Public Prosecutions if they are from countries where such an independent position does not exist. The example given by my right hon. and learned Friend the   Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) of the Russians and the Chechen rebels, or my own example of the Rwandan authorities and the Belgian priest, would in those circumstances become even more germane. The Government would be likely to have pressure brought to bear on them by people who were not going to take seriously the fact that this great independent figure, the   Director of Public Prosecutions&#151;so unknown anywhere else&#151;was the gate that had prevented a prosecution from taking place.

<a name="51109-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_284">Thirdly, I beg the Minister to recognise that this legislation as a whole has struck a very sharp note for many people among the ethnic minorities in this country. The Home Secretary was utterly right, in answering an earlier intervention, to point out the enormous support for law and order and the opposition to terrorism that we find among the Muslim community. Unfortunately, he was not answering the question that he had been asked. It was a very good answer to a question on that subject, but that was not the question that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher) had asked him. I am not going to stray from the subject of glorification, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;

<a name="stpa_285">I was trying to say that what was true in that discussion becomes germane when we think of glorification. I cannot believe that a simple explanation or understanding of the word &quot;glorification&quot; would be universal among the Muslim community. It might be, among some people, but that would be unusual. I do not know what its translation into the various languages involved would be, and it would be improper to refer to them in the House in any case. However, glorification is a concept that is not easy to pass around between those who have lived all their lives knowing it in its ecclesiastical context, and far more so for those who have had no such knowledge. There is a real problem that glorification could easily be misinterpreted by those in the ethnic community when they came to explain to their friends what the word meant.

<a name="stpa_286">This is one of the most dangerous parts of the Bill. If the word &quot;glorification&quot; were misinterpreted by some, it could lead to people expecting a prosecution, because of the way in which they had interpreted it, only to have that expectation dashed because this curious figure, the Director of Public Prosecutions, had said, &quot;No, this is the sort of glorification that you can go in for. There are other sorts that you cannot go in for.&quot; The prosecution would therefore be prevented.

<a name="stpa_287">The whole of the Bill has been overshadowed by the misinterpretation of many of the Government&#039;s views. There is so much misinformation out there, and if we consider that alongside our discussions of other Bills&#151;which we shall no doubt discuss again here&#151;we see too many opportunities for misunderstanding being opened up among the minorities in this country. Clarity and sharpness in the language that we use is absolutely essential, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) so clearly pointed out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-38_para11">
<a name="stpa_288">I turn now to the breadth of the circumstances in which the concept of glorification could be used. Unlike some of her colleagues, the Minister is not someone who eschews history. There is a tendency on the Labour Benches to talk as though nothing that happened before last week actually counts or has any real reference to today. I am one of those who thinks that if everyone learned a bit more history, they would have a bit more humility about the excellence of today&#039;s ideas. History is important, and many of us like to be pretty biased about our history. I am pretty biased against Carson, and pretty much in favour of a number of those people whom I would see as freedom fighters in earlier years in Ireland. I have a pretty clear view of that, and history is made much more interesting if one takes sides in relation to it.

<a name="stpa_289">I have therefore been guilty of an offence under the Bill over many years, although I hope that the DPP will not enforce it against me. In my enthusiastic pursuit of history, I have glorified a number of people who, in fighting for freedom, behaved in a way to which we would probably object today, largely because we live in a democracy and there are alternative ways of putting one&#039;s case forward. One of the things that the Government have found so difficult throughout consideration of the Bill has been to understand that in many cases people have had to take action in a way that has meant the loss of life, because there was no other way of righting terrible wrong. In such cases, the fault lies with the system and the Government, rather than with those who took up arms to uphold such a right.

I seem to remember an occasion on which I graphically explained why I thought a certain product was safe by doing that. I believe that that is the only thing that a politician should do. When I say that I think this or that, I must ask whether I think it in relation to me. Earlier, many of us voted against the 90 days. In doing so, I was not thinking of people a long way away but of what I would think, or of what my children would think, if they were arrested and locked up for 90 days.

Part of my historical bias arises from a wish to fight out again the issues that mattered at the time. The glorification clause could so easily be seen as a restriction. I am sure that that will not be the case in the classroom or the local authority, but I warn the Minister that the BBC and organisations that deal with the national press are all too likely to say, &quot;I think this may be a bit dangerous. Let&#039;s not do it quite like that.&quot; Our experience of people allowing the public to see what an abortion is actually like&#151;which is not glorification&#151;shows what happens if organisations such as the BBC and ITV are allowed to control the expression of powerful feelings and emotions more than is absolutely necessary.

 It is a privilege to follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer). My objection to this clause is largely based on the fact that it is a pointless excrescence and a wholly unnecessary appendage. It resides in the Bill solely for the reason that the Government announced over the summer that they would criminalise glorification, and so had to leave some reference to glorification in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-39_para4">
<a name="stpa_294">It is clear on examining the relevant part of the clause that, in any event, it is used only as an example of the kind of conduct that the clause proscribes in an earlier part. It is an inclusive statement that simply points the way to the all-embracing umbrella section, which makes it an offence indirectly to encourage a terrorist act. As my right hon. Friend said, it is a pernicious and pointless appendage that has no place in legislation made by this House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_295">The common law has always been extremely careful to ensure that the proscription of speech is precise, carefully targeted and narrowly defined. That is why the common law has always proscribed the incitement of specific acts of violence. On examining the common law offence of incitement, one sees that the ingredients require that an accused person must&#151;must&#151;have incited a specific act identifiable and particularised by the Crown in the indictment. But the clause and this specific section of it simply enable the glorification of a type of conduct, with no need for a specific act to have been encouraged or incited.

<a name="stpa_296">The dangers have been dwelt on by Members in all parts of the House, but my right hon. Friend put his finger on a particularly important point. Among the many examples that Members have used, we have heard some that are fanciful and others that are more realistic. The glorification of some heroes of the past has been dismissed by Ministers as the product of fevered fantasy, but the truth is that a more subtle and insidious danger arises from this clause remaining in the Bill.

<a name="stpa_297">Let us suppose that a speech was made at Hyde Park corner by an English nationalist who wished to sing the praises of Hereward the Wake.

The Director of Public Prosecutions would greet with consternation and dismay any lunatic who even proposed the idea that a speaker on Hyde Park corner singing the praises of Hereward the Wake might invoke the penalty under this clause.

<a name="stpa_298">Let us suppose that the speaker on Hyde Park corner was not white.

Let us consider the   circumstances of the time and take into account the

<br>&nbsp;<br>particular factors of the speaker&#039;s audience, which might include not only ordinary Londoners going about their business, but one or two Muslims, perhaps some of   the Arab race and some who were susceptible to the message of waging a crusade against Christian civilisation. The speaker might notice them coming from the local mosque; he might see them gathering around his soapbox on the corner of Hyde park. I do not know whether there is, in fact, a mosque local to Hyde park, but let us suppose that there is one and that gathering around our speaker is a crowd of turbaned, Arab and Muslim people.

<br>&nbsp;<br>right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr.   Gummer) raised the fundamental issue about the clause when he asked what sort of action would be covered by the word &quot;glorification&quot; that would not be   covered by &quot;encouragement&quot; yet still attract punishment under the criminal law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-40_para4">
<a name="stpa_304">I believe that no action meets the circumstances of that definition. If that belief is correct, the Government are creating with this clause a piece of law that can have only two possible fates&#151;it will be misused, or it will not be used at all. If the latter is the case, the provision will simply gather dust. Prosecutors will not use it because it is inappropriate to put before a jury, but either fate is unacceptable for a facet of the criminal law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-40_para5">
<a name="stpa_305">My second concern has to do with the points raised already about the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I understand the Government&#039;s argument that there is no need to worry about the clause because, although it may be completely inappropriate in all sorts of circumstances, the DPP will put his foot down and prevent it from being used. That seems a profoundly unfortunate position for a Government to be in when proposing a clause to be part of the criminal law. It may be that the DPP currently in office will be able to protect us from all the different situations in which a glorification charge would be inappropriate. It may also be that the next three or four holders of the office will do so. Surely, however, we in this House must make law that will stand as good law, and not simply as law that needs to be propped up by the DPP, or, worse, law from which the DPP needs to protect us. It is fundamentally unsatisfactory to propose legislation that would have that effect.

<a name="stpa_306">If we are to look beyond the immediate compass of the current situation&#151;I accept that that situation makes the Government worry about how we deal with it&#151;it must surely be right to construct legislation today and this week that will stand the test of time and enable us to be confident that it will not be misused in future. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal said, the concept of glorification&#151;indeed, the term itself&#151;does not currently form part of the criminal law. It seems to me that there is good reason for that: it is too broad, too ephemeral and too difficult to define, and if that is so, the fact that it has no place in the criminal law is frankly because it deserves no place there. It will create difficulties in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-40_para7">
<a name="stpa_307">I ask the Government to reconsider that part of this clause. The Minister knows that there is a good deal of support for a great part of the Bill, and even for a great part of the clause. I fully appreciate that those who encourage terrorism should be penalised. We can, however, do that without needing to criminalise a concept called glorification, and I invite the Minister to consider what it is that is glorification but is not encouragement but should still be criminal. That is the crucial point of the debate, and without an answer on it, we cannot be confident that the clause should remain.

<p><a name="st_507"><a name="51109-41_spnew0"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The Minister must explain what its purpose is. If glorification can amount to incitement without being separately spelled out, the subsection simply is not needed and produces a misleading impression and places emphasis on a particular activity, when all sorts of other activities could also constitute incitement to terrorism.
</p>





<p><a name="st_508"><a name="51109-41_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman must have a little patience and allow me to explain the point. He has made that point on innumerable occasions, and I shall deal with it. I repeat that Lord Carlile thinks that the provision is proportionate and the proper thing for us to do.

<a name="51109-41_para0">
<a name="stpa_310">It is right to highlight &quot;glorification&quot; in clause 1 and I   direct the hon. Gentleman&#039;s attention to clause 1(2) which says that, for the purposes of direct or indirect incitement,

<p>
<a name="51109-41_para1">
<a name="stpa_311">The use of the word &quot;include&quot; means that we do not have a stand-alone offence of glorification, but statements of glorification are included within the ambit of the direct or indirect incitement in clause 1. That is the point that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) made in his thoughtful contribution. It is important to include reference to glorification for the very reason that it is a new concept to our courts and, therefore, we need to provide the courts with a guide to the kind of behaviour that we are trying to ensure is covered through the direct and indirect incitement provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-41_para2">
<a name="stpa_312">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said that he found the provision &quot;a distasteful concept&quot;. Well, most of us would find statements that glorify, praise and celebrate terrorism in a way that is likely to encourage others to emulate terrorism more than distasteful. We find them completely unacceptable. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth was generous enough to acknowledge that we do now face a new kind of threat from international terrorism, including people making the sort of statements that we have not heard in the past. Therefore, although the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) was kind enough to say that I am not the sort of person who ignores history, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 429</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I   am the sort of person who wants to ensure that our law is fit to address some of the new threats that we face as well as our experience in the past.

<p><a name="st_509"><a name="51109-41_spnew2"><b> Stewart Hosie </b> 
: I appreciate what the Minister says and what she is attempting do. However, given the wide definition of terrorism and the link to the very broad definition of glorification, the danger is that the Bill will catch not the people she is seeking to catch, but others. If I may give a more contemporary example, thousands of honest citizens in the UK supported the Chilean refugees who were on the run from the Pinochet regime, which deemed them to be terrorists. Is not that the problem with the Bill?
</p>





<p><a name="st_510"><a name="51109-41_spnew3"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 We debated that point at great length in Committee and we went through all the different examples. The glorification part of this offence also has to fulfil the other provisions of clause 1. That means that there has to be intent, or recklessness, or the objective definition of recklessness. A statement also has to be one that encourages terrorism and encourages people to emulate such behaviour. The offence contains a series of different elements that have to be completed before there is any prospect of a prosecution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-41_para3">
<a name="stpa_313">Several hon. Members have suggested that the only safeguard is the Director of Public Prosecutions. That is not the case. There is a series of seven hurdles, which I   have now set out three times at the Dispatch Box, of the different component parts of the offence, all of which have to be completed before a prosecution could be brought. Someone would have to condone or glorify terrorism in such a way that the persons hearing his statement would be encouraged to commit an act of terrorism or emulate that behaviour. It is not simply glorification or condoning that form the offence, because there is the second limb of the likely effect on the audience and what it would be encouraged to do.
</p>





<p><a name="st_511"><a name="51109-41_spnew4"><b> Stewart Hosie: </b> 
 It is helpful to have the list that the Minister has given. However, someone might say, to a person who was here in the circumstances I described a   minute ago, &quot;What you faced was terrible. I hope that you go home, take your country back and make it democratic.&quot; That short conversation would fulfil all the obligations for the offence, except the decision by the DPP.

 My hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), who is no longer in the Chamber, made an important point earlier when she said that someone could preface their remarks with the   statement that they do not condone or endorse acts of terrorism or encouraging people to kill others. They could express sympathy and even support for the activity, but not in a way that encourages people to commit acts of terrorism.

<br>&nbsp;<br>and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), as she has just provided a let-out for every person who wants to incite terrorism. If all that is required to get around the clause is to preface one&#039;s remarks with that saving clause, why are we passing clause 1 into law? That is a classic illustration of the muddled thinking behind the Government&#039;s approach. The Government should remove glorification and stick to   incitement, with proper terminology. They will then have an offence that works, that bites and, moreover, commands widespread respect.

<a name="51109-41_para4">
<a name="stpa_314">Unfortunately, there are young and impressionable people in our society who can all too easily be manipulated by people preaching or advocating a message of hate. Such people can create the climate of hate in which terrorism can more easily flourish. That is what we are trying to tackle with the offence. I remind the House that the terms of the offence are clear. Simply condoning terrorism, or even glorifying it, will not be   sufficient to constitute a criminal offence. The glorification must take place in such a way that the   person making the statement must intend it or be reckless as to its effect. The statement must have an effect on the audience, who must be encouraged to emulate the behaviour. Because the offence includes all those components, it would address all the illustrations bandied around the House to express genuine or, in some cases, not so genuine concern.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-41_para5">
<a name="stpa_315">The offence is complex. It has two limbs: what someone does and what the effect is. That combination should be sufficient to reassure people that we are trying to focus on the mischief of those who make statements to vulnerable young people that could draw them into extremism, without casting our net so wide that we catch people where it is inappropriate. I have genuinely tried to formulate the provisions so that they attack that mischief, which I hope everybody acknowledges is a real threat to us, but without drawing people in too widely.

<br>&nbsp;<br>encourage others to engage in acts of terrorism. That is what the provision is aimed at and it is perfectly proper to bring it into effect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-41_para6">
<a name="stpa_316">Some Members have suggested that the provisions are unnecessary. If that were the case, we would not have included them. They provide the courts with a useful guide as to the type of conduct that Parliament wants to cover in the new legislation. Moreover, if they were to be removed at this stage the courts could interpret that as meaning that we did not intend such conduct to be covered. If the provisions were removed, I am concerned that courts could consider that acts   of   glorification, celebrating, exalting and praising terrorism were not the type of behaviour that should be covered under direct or indirect incitement. They are an important illustration to the courts of the type of behaviour that we want to cover.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-41_para7">
<a name="stpa_317">The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 provides an analogy&#151;albeit on a difference scale&#151;that helped me to understand the clause, as the Act includes a description of the type of conduct involved in harassment. When the concept of harassment was introduced, it was new to the courts, so the Act described the type of conduct that would be covered, to assist and guide the courts in interpreting that criminal offence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-41_para8">
<a name="stpa_318">This provision is certainly similar because it would tell the courts that we are considering behaviour that glorifies, celebrates or exalts terrorism and that it should be included in direct or indirect incitement in accordance with clause 1, so it is very helpful indeed. Any suggestion that praising Robin Hood would fall into that category is very far of the mark.

I simply return to a point that has been made many times to which I have not yet heard the answer. What does glorification give us that encouragement does not?

<p><a name="st_522"><a name="51109-42_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 As I have tried to explain, the glorification provision is a guide to the courts that the   behaviour of celebrating and praising terrorism is the kind of conduct that would meet the direct and indirect incitement definition, so it is a useful addition because we now face the threat of people glorifying terrorism. Those people are very careful to try to ensure that they do not fall within the criminal definition, so it is important that we can tell the courts which sort of behaviour we want to outlaw.

<a name="stpa_319">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield said that, if someone&#039;s glorification of terrorism amounted to direct or indirect incitement, such behaviour should be criminalised. That is exactly what we seek to do in subsection (2), which says that glorification includes the behaviour set out in clause 1. He has said that he accepts that such behaviour ought to be criminalised. I can therefore see no reason why he has a problem with the   glorification provision. I cannot understand his fundamental objection, other than that he finds the

He will know that amendment No.   48 is an attempt to narrow the extra-territorial jurisdiction. The measures in clause 1 that we are discussing would apply only to convention offences because if we are to be able to ratify international conventions on the matter and comply with our international obligations, we have to ensure that there is extra-territorial jurisdiction. Other states will be doing exactly that, too. There are circumstances in which we refuse to extradite people to states in which offences take place, such as for human rights reasons. We thus must have the extra-territorial jurisdiction to allow us to carry out a prosecution here for an offence on which we are unwilling to extradite for good reasons. We have tabled further amendments on extra-territorial jurisdiction to narrow its reach as an attempt to address genuine concerns that were raised about the worldwide jurisdiction of the Bill.

We will then reach a proper view on the basis of the evidence. Clause 21 addresses the fact that promoting or encouraging terrorism will include glorification.

<p><a name="st_554"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now adjourn<i>.&#151;[Gillian Merron.]</i>
<a name="time_40">

</p>





<p><a name="st_555"><a name="51109-43_spnew5"><b> Helen Jones  (Warrington, North) (Lab):</b> 
 After the excitements of today, my hon. Friend the Minister and I come along like sweepers-up after the Lord Mayor&#039;s procession. I am grateful to have the opportunity to discuss the closure of the Bruche police training centre and its effect not only on the people who work there but on those who live in the surrounding area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para1">
<a name="stpa_327">The training centre at Bruche has been a feature of Warrington life for a good many years. It provides the residential stage 2 of foundation training for probationary officers. It is a large site that caters for the needs of several police forces and employs, I believe, 60 people directly, with about 55 working for contractors. I say, &quot;I believe&quot;, because it has proved extremely difficult to get accurate information from Centrex on such matters. There are also 70 police officers stationed there, as well as about 10 security staff.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para2">
<a name="stpa_328">Because of the position of the site in the midst of local housing, the prospect of its closing became a matter of concern to staff and to people in the area when it appeared that changes to police training meant that recruits would no longer be sent for residential training at regional centres. However, it has proved extremely difficult in the run-up to the announcement of closure to get accurate information about what Centrex plans to do. I had raised the matter on several occasions, but I   reverted to it with a number of parliamentary questions, which I tabled in July last year because the staff from the centre had approached me, greatly concerned about their future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para3">
<a name="stpa_329">Unfortunately, answer came there none from the Home Office. I wrote again in August and, after much to-ing and fro-ing, I received a reply on 18 November. It stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50">&quot;It has not proved possible to respond to my hon. Friend in    the time available before Prorogation.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 18 November 2004; Vol. 426, c. 2080W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para4">
<a name="stpa_330">That is extraordinary. If the Home Office cannot answer a simple question in more than four months, I worry about the rest of its work. On 26 November that year, I   received a letter from my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety, in which she apologised for the delay and said that the Home Office had lost sight of the questions over the summer months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para5">
<a name="stpa_331">The letter raised more questions than it answered, however. It said that the matter had been given detailed consideration over the summer. If that was true, I do not understand why I did not receive an answer to my question in November. The letter was unenlightening in other respects. It said that Centrex had been discussing what should happen to police training with the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Police Authorities and other stakeholders. I am never sure what &quot;stakeholder&quot; means. It is one of those words that, like some of Lewis Carroll&#039;s verse, means whatever one wants it to mean. The letter mentioned neither the trade unions at the centre nor the staff. They were not mentioned in a parliamentary answer that I received later that month.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 441</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para6">
<a name="stpa_332">I was approached again by the staff, who were concerned that they could not get information about what was happening. I tabled another question to ask who had been involved in the meetings and what options for the future of the centre had been discussed. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will be pleased to hear that the Home Office answered that. I suppose that that is a step in the right direction. However, I was not much further enlightened because, again, there was no mention of what was happening or of any negotiations with the staff. That is unacceptable. The staff have families to keep and bills to pay, just like the rest of us.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para7">
<a name="stpa_333">I know that the Home Office will say that that was the   responsibility of Centrex, but it cannot be shrugged   off in that way because, after all, Centrex is a non-departmental public body which manages public assets and has strong links to the Home Office. If no one at the Home Office asked what steps were being taken to consult and inform staff, they should have done so. They should be reminded that we are in the 21st century with a Labour Government, and it is unacceptable to treat people in that way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para8">
<a name="stpa_334">The failure of Centrex to be open about what was happening caused a great deal of consternation in the local area. The centre is set in the middle of a lot of local housing. Rumours circulated about what would happen to it. That allowed some evil-minded people to spread the rumour that it would be turned into an asylum centre. I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety quashed that rumour in a letter to me on 13 July this year. However, the anxieties remain and they need to be tackled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para9">
<a name="stpa_335">Not only was Centrex less than open about its plans, it sometimes actively misled people. In November last year, it told the <i>Warrington Guardian</i>, my local newspaper, that the centre was &quot;absolutely not&quot; closing in 2006. In the same letter on 13 July, in which my right hon. Friend dealt with the rumour about the asylum centre, she wrote that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51">&quot;there are currently no immediate plans to close the Bruche training centre.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para10">
<a name="stpa_336">A week later, on 21 July, Centrex sent out an e-mail at 6.4 pm&#151;only four minutes after the House had risen for the summer recess&#151;announcing the closure of three training centres, including Bruche.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para11">
<a name="stpa_337">I find it astonishing that a public body should behave in that way. I can think of no explanation for that other than a desire to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. That is not surprising when Centrex and the Minister&#151;presumably relying in good faith on what it had told her&#151;previously said something entirely different. Centrex also wrote to me on 21 July announcing the closure. In that letter, it responded to a letter that I had sent to it on 26 June. However, it responded to it in a postscript, which I am afraid is typical of the kind of dismissive attitude that my constituents have had to put up with all the way along.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para12">
<a name="stpa_338">I am sorry to say that that kind of attitude extended even into parts of the Home Office. When I rang the private office of the Minister of State the day after the   announcement, I received what I can only describe as a curt dismissal. I asked to speak to the Minister 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 442</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and   was told that she was in her constituency. When I   suggested that her staff contact her&#151;she was in Salford, after all, not Timbuktu&#151;I was told that I   should write in. To her credit, the Minister did telephone me, albeit a week later when I was no longer around. However, I have to say that I have never before encountered that sort of behaviour from the private office of a Minister. It is entirely unacceptable for Centrex and the Home Office to behave in this way when we are talking about people&#039;s livelihoods and the future of their communities. I hope that this can be prevented from happening again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para13">
<a name="stpa_339">I wrote again to the Minister on 26 July&#151;there has been a lot of correspondence on this matter&#151;to ask why I had been told that there was no immediate prospect of the centre closing, when in fact the announcement was made a week later. I also raised my concerns about what I saw as an attempt to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. The answer that I received was very revealing. It said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52">&quot;Given the timing of my letter and of the announcement, it would have been more accurate to have said that no decision had yet been taken.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para14">
<a name="stpa_340">It certainly would. However, I give Ministers credit by assuming that, if they sign a letter, they will have checked the facts and that that is what they have been told. We need to know what happened to change matters between 13 and 21 July. Until that is cleared up, we are all left with the impression that Centrex has been, and is continuing to be, less than frank about its plans.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para15">
<a name="stpa_341">I was also concerned about what was said in that letter about parliamentary scrutiny. It said that the decision to close the centre had been taken at the Centrex board meeting on the morning of 21 July. It went on to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53">&quot;The timing of the announcement relates only to the timing of that decision.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para16">
<a name="stpa_342">But it does not. If the decision was taken in the morning, I can see no reason to wait until just after the House had risen for the recess to announce it. I have asked for the reason, and I was told by the Minister that she was
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54">&quot;certainly clear that Centrex had not timed the announcement to avoid parliamentary scrutiny&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para17">
<a name="stpa_343">If the Home Office is &quot;certainly clear&quot; about that, it needs to give me the information as to why, because I   have not had it, and neither have the people I represent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para18">
<a name="stpa_344">I received a letter dated 5 September, signed by the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), in the absence of the Minister of State. The explanation that I was given was that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55">&quot;it would have been unacceptable either to make an announcement before the board had made a decision or to delay the announcement until after the parliamentary recess.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para19">
<a name="stpa_345">Frankly, that is Home Office gobbledegook. A decision cannot be announced before it has been taken, and no one suggests that it can. However, there was an alternative&#151;a third way, if you like. It could have been announced when the House was sitting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para20">
<a name="stpa_346">I am equally concerned that that letter shows an unacceptable attitude towards parliamentary scrutiny. It goes on to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56">&quot;I do not believe that it is an announcement that needed to give consideration to parliamentary timetables&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para21">
<a name="stpa_347">I beg to differ. When my constituents are losing their jobs, and when decisions are being taken that will affect a whole area, it is not only the right but the duty of their 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 443</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Member of Parliament to raise the matter in the House. My constituents would expect no less. I am very disappointed that any Minister should think differently. That was a most unfortunate turn of phrase to use.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para22">
<a name="stpa_348">Because of all this, and because of the way in which Centrex has behaved since the announcement, it is difficult to have faith in what it is doing. I still have staff approaching me who are very demoralised about what is happening, and people who live in the area are deeply concerned. The chief executive of Centrex wrote to me in August to say that he had briefed the staff on what was happening, and that he had set up a programme board. He did not, however, answer any of the points that I put to him about what was happening to the staff or about the future plans for the site. He told me that I would get information about those matters at the appropriate time. I happen to think that the appropriate time to answer queries from a Member of the House is when they are asked, not when some unelected person decides to answer them. That is treating my constituents with a fair amount of contempt, which is unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para23">
<a name="stpa_349">Since then, Centrex has not engaged with the local council&#039;s redundancy support service, the job centre or our economic development authority, until yesterday, when it sent an e-mail to the council in response to an e-mail that had been sent weeks earlier, saying that it looked forward to working with Warrington borough council. It is a miracle what getting an Adjournment debate can do, but I would prefer not to have to have one every week to ensure that that process continues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para24">
<a name="stpa_350">The sad thing is that we have a good record in Warrington of getting people into jobs following redundancy, but engagement between all the partners involved is needed. If I make a comparison with what happened when Marks and Spencer closed a call centre in my constituency, there was immediate engagement with all the partners in the area, and we had a lot of support from my right hon. Friend the Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers), who was then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. I expect a public body to do no less than that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para25">
<a name="stpa_351">I want to turn to the future of the site. As I said, it is surrounded by housing, with only very limited access. When it was transferred to Centrex, I understand that the written-down value was &#163;3 million. It might now be worth much more, depending on the future use of the site. I wonder whether my hon. Friend can tell me what will happen to any windfall profits from that, whether local people will be able to benefit in any way, and whether any of that will be used to help to find jobs for the staff involved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para26">
<a name="stpa_352">There is a further problem, however. As well as the rumours that have circulated about this site, there is a real concern about over-development in the area, which I believe is well founded. The adjoining roads already have a lot of traffic problems. For any future development at the site, we need proper community engagement. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State said in one of the numerous letters that we exchanged, the date of which now escapes me, that she was
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57">&quot;keen that there should be proper community engagement&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para27">
<a name="stpa_353">in any future planning application. I would like to see that keenness translated into reality, however. Although I know from the parliamentary answer of 17 October that Home Office officials and Centrex have had 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 444</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>discussions about the future of the site, there has been no contact with the local planning department, let alone with people in the community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-43_para28">
<a name="stpa_354">I therefore hope that my hon. Friend will accept that this matter has so far been very badly handled. It has not increased confidence, either in the staff or the community, about what Centrex will do in the future. We now need to put that right. I hope that he can assure me that he will ensure that Centrex now engages with all local partners in order to make sure that the proper procedures are in place to find jobs for people who are made redundant at that site. Far from dismissing concerns raised with it, I hope that it will now engage with the local community and have a proper discussion on what should happen there in future, so that whatever is done with the site, it can be for the benefit of the local community and not to their detriment. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#039;s reply.

<p><a name="st_556"><a name="51109-44_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Paul Goggins): </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen   Jones) on securing the debate. She has raised an issue that is of concern locally and to her, and I am glad that she has had an opportunity to raise it in a characteristically forthright way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para0">
<a name="stpa_355">Let me give some of the background to the decision to close Bruche and the other training sites that my hon. Friend mentioned. Given the points that she raised and the copious correspondence between her and Home Office Ministers, I should say something about how the decision was made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para1">
<a name="stpa_356">Until recently, police probationer training was split between an officer&#039;s home force and the Central Police Training and Development Authority, known as Centrex. Once officers are recruited, they undergo two weeks of induction and familiarisation in their own forces. They are then sent to Centrex for 12 weeks&#039; residential training, which is followed by a couple of weeks in their own forces learning about local procedures before they go out on patrol with a tutor constable for 10 further weeks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para2">
<a name="stpa_357">That system is now changing. In the summer of last year, five forces began piloting the initial police learning and development programme. That moves stage 2&#151;the residential stage with Centrex&#151;back into the force. Officers learn in their own force and their own community, often in conjunction with members of that community. That is a huge change in the system and the culture, but I believe that it will help to foster a meaningful connection with police officers in training and the communities that they will serve. It is important for the police service to develop a culture of training and qualification so that we have a fully professional service. I am pleased to say that the Adult Learning Inspectorate has evaluated the effectiveness of the pilots. It considers them to have been highly successful, and welcomes the enthusiasm and commitment of the staff involved in the programme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para3">
<a name="stpa_358">Working to identify and address the huge challenges involved in the change, the Government and the police service are rolling the programme out across all the forces in England and Wales. Thirteen forces have already gone live, and nine more will adopt the same 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 445</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>approach over the next five months. From April next year, the remaining 21 forces will be ready to go live. We are changing pretty dramatically the way in which probationer police officers are trained. One of the main consequences of that approach is that officers will no longer be sent to Centrex for their initial training. The last probationer officers to go through the old system will leave Centrex on 26 May next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para4">
<a name="stpa_359">Centrex has a number of sites around the country. Three have been used almost exclusively to provide foundation training: Ashford in Kent, Cwmbran in south Wales and Bruche in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency. There are two other sites, Ryton near Coventry and Bramshill, where Centrex&#039;s headquarters are sited. They will continue to be used for other purposes because they are multi-functional sites.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para5">
<a name="stpa_360">For all those reasons, the chief executive of Centrex and his senior management team have been considering the future needs of the Centrex estate for some time. They reached what I judge to be the entirely logical and sensible conclusion that there was no value-for-money argument for retaining the three sites at Ashford, Cwmbran and Bruche. On 21 July, the Centrex board considered a paper from the chief executive that recommended the closure of the sites. I should explain that the board consists of a number of independent members, including the chair, and includes representatives from the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Police Authorities and the Home Office.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para6">
<a name="stpa_361">The Centrex board agreed with the recommendation from the chief executive that the sites should be closed. Home Office Ministers were made aware of the decision as soon as it was made, and the chief executive then informed the staff. He wrote to staff, spoke to them   directly by means of a DVD, and later visited each site in person to discuss the implications with them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para7">
<a name="stpa_362">Police staff at the three sites have been given notice that their posts are likely to become redundant by 26 May 2006. On or before that date, up to 175 seconded police officers will return to their forces. Forty of those officers are employed at Bruche, and 40 further police staff at Bruche have been given notice that they are likely to be made redundant. In addition, between 30 and 40 subcontracted workers involved in security, catering and so on face redundancy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para8">
<a name="stpa_363">Shortly after the chief executive informed the staff, he contacted Members of Parliament representing the areas affected to make them aware of the announcement. A public announcement was made once staff had been informed, and the head of Bruche training centre also wrote to local residents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para9">
<a name="stpa_364">I want to make it clear to my hon. Friend that Home Office Ministers apologise for any difficulties or misunderstandings that occurred as a result of correspondence, particularly the letter sent on 13 July by the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety, my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford (Hazel Blears). That reply followed a conversation between the Minister and my hon. Friend, in which she raised some of the concerns that she has outlined this evening. It is true that in that letter, my right hon. Friend said that

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para10">
<a name="stpa_365">Of course, when she wrote that letter on 13 July, that was true. Although discussions were taking place within Centrex, no decision had been taken, and none was taken until 21 September. As my hon. Friend pointed out, such a decision is entirely a matter for Centrex, as a non-departmental public body; indeed, Home Office officials were informed of it only after the meeting on the morning of 21 July concluded. I am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Minister has been able to write since and to set the record straight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para11">
<a name="stpa_366">My hon. Friend also raised the concern that the timing of the announcement, which was made on the   day that this House rose for the summer recess, was such as to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. My right hon. Friend the Minister explained in her letters, and in answer to parliamentary questions tabled by my hon. Friend, that the decision was taken by the Centrex board on the morning of 21 July. Quite apart from the fact that, as my hon. Friend pointed out, it would have been impossible to make an announcement about a decision that had yet to be taken, it would of course have been wrong to make a public announcement until the staff themselves had been made aware of that decision. My hon. Friend will agree that it would also have been wholly unfair to hold back that decision or any announcement until October, when the House returned from its recess.
</p>





<p><a name="st_557"><a name="51109-44_spnew0"><b> Helen Jones: </b> 
 I understand what the Minister is saying, but does he agree that what happened was at the very least unfortunate, and will he give an assurance that the Home Office will do its best to avoid such things happening again in future?
</p>





<p><a name="st_558"><a name="51109-44_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point, because it is precisely the one that I   was going to make. This was not in any way an attempt by Ministers to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. However, there is a lesson to be learned here for Government agencies, including non-departmental bodies of this kind. When they are taking such key decisions, they should have half an eye on the fact that Ministers and Parliament may need to be informed, and they should also keep an eye on the parliamentary calendar. Although I cannot give specific assurances about particular bodies, this is a lesson that the Home Office and perhaps other Departments can learn. We need to ensure that a connection is made between decisions taken outside Government Departments, and the importance of Ministers being accountable and able to explain those decisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para12">
<a name="stpa_367">I turn to the future use of the site, which my hon. Friend also mentioned. Rumours circulated that plans were already in place to turn the centre into one for use by asylum seekers. As she has made clear&#151;I thank her for doing so in the manner that she did&#151;there are no such plans, as my right hon. Friend the Minister also pointed out. No decision has yet been taken about the future use of the site. The centre will be in use and fully operational until roughly the middle of next year. It will of course need to be put up for sale before we can know who is likely to purchase it. Only then will we begin to know its possible future uses.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para13">
<a name="stpa_368">My hon. Friend rightly points out that any future change in use would require planning permission. It is important that both she and local councillors in the area are fully committed to consultation with local residents on any proposals. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend and her colleague councillors for the assiduous way in which they will follow up this issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-44_para14">
<a name="stpa_369">Finally, my hon. Friend is quite right that the staff of Bruche&#151;both the current staff and their predecessors&#151;should be commended for the tremendous work that has been done over many years. They have trained many thousands of police officers, who have worked in my hon. Friend&#039;s, my own and many other constituencies. We are deeply grateful for that. We owe them a debt of gratitude and all the help and support that we can provide to enable them to find alternative employment. It is important that Centrex adopt a positive and proactive approach to providing support and help for those trying to find new posts. That will include consulting Jobcentre Plus. I noted my hon. Friend&#039;s comments about other local economic development agencies. No stone should remain unturned in our efforts to find suitable employment. Centrex is taking a number of initiatives: paying for a consultant to work with the staff, opening a careers room, offering other employment training opportunities and developing links with other local employers.

<a name="stpa_370">In closing, I would like to reassure my hon. Friend that every effort will be made to ensure that those who face redundancy can work through this period. Hopefully, with some new skills and new opportunities, they will be able to find local employment. As my hon. Friend rightly says, they have bills to pay and families to keep, so we are obliged to try and help them to remain in employment.

<p>Official Report, 8 November 2005: In col. 257, before &quot;Question put, That the amendment be made&quot;, insert:
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para0">
<a name="st_560">Mr. Heath: I am grateful to all those who participated in this brief debate, but hearing the Minister say that it was outrageous to suggest that an electoral experiment&#151;a pilot&#151;should be extended to anything as large as a region when the Government had no compunction about forcing four regions through an electoral experiment only a little while ago against the express views of the Electoral Commission and every single party represented in the House other than the Government takes the biscuit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para1">
<a name="st_561">David Cairns: We did not move immediately to all-postal regional pilots. They were piloted at a local and voluntary level and lessons were learned before the regional voting pilots that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. It would help if he were to clarify that that was the point that I was making.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51109-45_para2">
<a name="st_562">Mr. Heath: The hon. Gentleman again attempts to clarify what he said, but the fact remains that, following that election, we had the biggest crisis of confidence in the electoral system of this country that we have ever seen. For the first time, we had people genuinely doubting whether the election in which they had just taken part was conducted freely and fairly. We should not tolerate that. What is the Government&#039;s response? Are they prepared to go into the next general election with the same postal voting precautions in place? Yes, they are. Their answer is,   &quot;We&#039;ll do something, but manana&#151;tomorrow, whatever.&quot; That is not a satisfactory position. We need to do something urgently. The Electoral Commission has given us a clear steer about how we should go forward and I wish to test the opinion of the Committee.
