 I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s concern, which is shared by many. However, murder is a unique crime of particular moral and social significance, and the mandatory life sentence reflects society&#146;s abhorrence of it. Within the mandatory life sentence, of course, each individual case is given a tariff by the judge, who is in the best position to know the circumstances of the case. That gives the kind of flexibility that my hon. Friend suggests is sensible in certain instances.</p>

from 24 per cent. testing positive 10 or 11 years ago to 9 per cent. There are now 141 intensive drug treatment programmes in 99 prisons. Last week, I published the report of a former chief constable of West Mercia, David Blakey, on what more we had to do. I accepted all 10 of his recommendations.

 I thank my right hon. Friend for that answer. When I visited HMP Norwich a few years back, it was clear that drugs were coming over the walls inside tennis balls or dead pigeons, and horrifyingly, were being brought in even in the mouths of infants. Given the ingenuity of the suppliers, does my right hon.

 Yes is the answer. As my hon. Friend indicates, prisoners are adept at using every means that they can to ensure that drugs get into prisons, sometimes by means that are grotesque to imagine, but which take place. That is why, alongside the maintenance of mandatory drug testing, which, three years ago, was found by the Office for National Statistics to be &#147;robust&#148;&#151;in its words, not mine&#151;I asked David Blakey to conduct a review. His report, with its 10 recommendations, is about how we build on the strengths of the current system for preventing drugs from coming into prison, to enhance and improve it.</p>

 As one in five men reporting drug use admit that they started taking drugs in prison, we still clearly have a real problem.

 Whether that figure is correct or not&#151;self-reporting of levels of drug abuse, particularly by prisoners, tends to be rather imaginative to say the least&#151;there is no doubt that we have a drug problem in prisons, which I do not underestimate. In the past 11 years, we have sought to strengthen the means of enforcement and greatly to improve treatment. I will certainly think about whether the sort of incentive&#151;such as it would be&#151;that the right hon. Gentleman mentions would work. In respect of indeterminate sentence prisoners and others who have to apply for parole, their behaviour in prison, and their readiness to undertake treatment programmes and comply with them, is one consideration in the determination of their release.</p>

 We have got the level of enforcement up, and treatment as well, but none of us should be complacent about the continuing problem of drugs in prison because 55 per cent. of defendants who go to prison have a drug problem, and in some local prisons that figure is as high as 80 per cent.

We have increased prison numbers by well over a third in the last 11 years, which is the fastest rate of increase since the war, and we continue to expand the prison population. Meanwhile, because we are tough on crime, the number of defendants who are, rightly, sent to prison continues to rise.</p>

 In 2007, the last year for which information is available, the Ministry of Justice announced that 5,528 drug seizures took place in the prison estate in England and Wales. Of those, only 1,641 were reported to the police, and only 304 prosecutions were brought in respect of the possession of those illegal drugs. Does the Secretary of State agree that, if we are trying to reduce the dealing, consumption and existence of illegal drugs in the prison estate, it is simply not good enough if prosecutions are not brought for what is a crime outside and inside the prison estate?</p>

 I agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman that we need to be tough on the introduction of drugs into prisons because it is obviously an offence in prison as much it is outside. However, although we want police and prosecutors charging and prosecuting in all appropriate cases, he knows that there are other means whereby prisoners can be brought to justice through the use of independent adjudicators, which is often a swifter method of punishment because prisoners who are found guilty can have days added to their prison sentence more quickly. Although charging and prosecution can be considered in each case, there are clear sanctions, which I first tightened in 1999&#151;I wish them to be tightened again&#151;against visitors who abuse the regime.</p>

 We certainly will be tough on shoplifting and, indeed, the causes of shoplifting. The hon. Lady knows that in 1997, the last year in which a Conservative Government were in power, only 12 per cent. of people went to prison for shoplifting. Last year, under the Labour Government, 19 per cent. of people convicted went to prison for shoplifting.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman that criminal gangs who get involved in shoplifting should be tackled. Shoplifting is a crime that has an impact on all members of society because when those goods leave the shop, ordinary law-abiding citizens pay the cost on their purchases. In the past three years, for example, the total number of shoplifting offences whose perpetrators have been brought to justice increased from 112,000 in 2004 to 142,362 in 2006.

Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) mentioned to do with drug and alcohol abuse, which is one of the key drivers of shoplifting crime. I do take shoplifting seriously. It is theft, and it is a loss that imposes a cost on the ordinary, decent taxpayer who shops in those shops and pays extra costs for goods because of the loss through leakages and theft. Shoplifting is something that we need to tackle, and I will happily look into the suggestions that she has made.</p>

 First, I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s premise that the drop in the number of cases going through the courts is due to the fees. In fact, the drop in the number of cases going to court happened before the new fees were implemented, which happened only in May this year. We are looking to see what the reasons behind that are; one reason may be that people were gearing up for the publication of the public law outline, which encourages local authorities to use other means to look after and protect children, rather than taking them through the court system.</p>

 A total of &#163;40 million is being given to local authorities this year, which will also be given to them next year and the following year. That money is the total allocated, should every case go right through the whole system to the end of court proceedings. In other words, that amount is more than I would expect the local authorities will need if they use other possibilities to deal with the children, rather than taking them through the courts. By monitoring the process, we will be able to see exactly how much money local authorities spend on it. I should also point out to the hon. Gentleman that local authorities take umbrage at the suggestion that they would not use the court system for financial reasons, when they see, rightly, that their statutory duty to protect the child is paramount.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has commissioned my noble Friend Lord Bradley to examine mental health issues in prisons and young offenders institutions. We need to consider not only what should be done to improve services in prison, but which people are going to prison who might be better served elsewhere. I hope that Lord Bradley&#146;s report will help us to involve the national health service in England, Scotland and Wales, as well as other agencies, in providing aftercare and treatment for people with severe mental health problems while they are in the prison system. In many instances mental health problems lead to offending behaviour and, in tackling such behaviour, we should bear in mind that it is as much a mental health as a criminal justice problem.</p>

 That was snappy too, Mr. Speaker. What the public understand is that as a result of the action the Labour Government have taken over the past 11 years, we have become the first Government since the war to see a reduction in crime, rather than an increase. Every Conservative Government since the war presided over an increase in crime, and the last Administration saw a doubling in crime. We have seen a consistent reduction in crime including&#151;according to entirely independent research by Cardiff university into A and E department admissions, and according to the British crime survey that the Conservatives established but that we have enhanced&#151;very significant reductions in violent crime. None of us underestimate the current problem of knife crime in certain areas.

 I understand the concern that my hon. Friend has raised. It is a concern not only to members of the Muslim community, but to members of the Jewish community. In Greater Manchester, the coroners, led by the Bolton coroner, have developed a good local protocol that means that, in cases that are regarded as forensic, relatives can choose post mortem by MRI scanner, rather than by intrusive post-mortem methods. That ensures that the post mortem is much swifter and can be quickly followed by certification and burial. I am in discussions with the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice), about how we can see that practice rolled out across the country.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday, you had occasion to reprimand the Home Secretary because she sought to make a statement at topical questions. You told her that if she wanted to make a statement, she should come to this House in the normal way. Today, the Government have published their youth crime strategy, and it is inconceivable that even this Government should publish a document to which they attach such importance without making an oral statement in the House. Have you had any indication of when we might expect such a statement? Will it be later today, tomorrow or Thursday, or is the Home Secretary so embarrassed by the fiascos of the past couple of days that she can no longer face the House?</p>

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. In view of what you have said on consecutive days, may I ask that you refer the whole question of topical questions to the Procedure Committee? The procedure is clearly not working as some would have hoped and is being abused by certain Ministers of the Crown. That is a very unsatisfactory situation.</p>

 We are almost getting to the stage where the Chair is being drawn into the argument. Yesterday, I gently reminded the Home Secretary that she could have made a statement, but I go no further than that. From time to time, I have to tell Back Benchers not to make speeches, so it cuts both ways. I will say to the right hon. and learned Gentleman and to Sir Patrick that Ministers come to make statements to the House and the Speaker does not bring them to the House to make speeches or statements, other than when there is an urgent question.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80715-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08071582000172">I should like to begin by thanking those hon. Members who kindly agreed to sponsor this Bill, and all those colleagues who have given me their support in the face of potential threats, or of the consequences of taking on and challenging the British press. I should also like to express my gratitude and thanks to Lord Soley, who in 1993 tried to bring in a similar Bill but who was unfortunately unsuccessful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80715-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08071582000173">This Bill would introduce a statutory method for protecting the general public from inaccurate and, at times, inflammatory reports in the press and media. It is not intended, either by design or omission, to restrict or in any other way curtail the freedom of the press. However, a free press must balance commercial considerations with its responsibilities to individuals and to society as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80715-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08071582000174">The press are beholden to ensure that what is reported is accurate and can be substantiated if challenged. As it stands, a high proportion of people living in the UK have some difficulty in believing even the racing results printed by some of our newspapers. Indeed, a recent survey suggested that only 7 per cent. of the general public trust tabloid journalists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80715-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08071582000175">I want to make a clear distinction between the tabloid press and those in the journalism profession, such as the late Charles Wheeler and, of course, our own Alan Johnston. At tremendous risk to themselves and their crews, they have worked bravely to report from some of the most troubled hotspots in the world and to bring events to our television screens. I contrast that with those who perch themselves in the Press Gallery here, and who indulge in cowardly character assassinations by day yet by night moonlight with the old boys&#146; network of the BBC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80715-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08071582000176">The Press Complaints Commission was established in 1991 by the newspaper industry to address increasing concerns that self-regulation of the press was failing adequately to protect the public, and indeed the industry itself. The PCC&#146;s prime function<i> </i>is to put things right when they go wrong during the editorial process, and it seeks to police a voluntary code of practice that was drawn up by members of the industry. Its board has 15 members: seven are senior editors and the other eight are lay members. The PCC operates under the slogan &#147;Fast, Free and Fair&#148;, and its voluntary code states that the press must take all due care not to publish &#147;inaccurate, misleading or distorted&#148; information in text or in picture format. It also states that a</p>

Finally, it also states that any publication must report fairly and in an accurate fashion</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80715-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08071582000178">That is the PCC&#146;s voluntary code as it stands at the moment. However, despite its adoption, the number of complaints to the PCC is increasing. As recently as 2003, the total was up by 39 per cent. at 3,649 complaints, more than half of which related to the accuracy of reports. Despite that alarming rise, and against the backdrop of an increasing lack of trust in tabloid newspaper journalism, the PCC wrote to me, in response to the Bill, to establish its view that no review of its practices was warranted. The National Union of Journalists and I disagree with the PCC&#146;s position on that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80715-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08071582000179">The NUJ has for some time suggested that the PCC should be declared a public authority, to bring it within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. That would make for a more transparent system, in which the PCC&#146;s workings were opened up to public scrutiny. At present, cases brought before the PCC are dealt with in secret, and only the final judgment is made public. The NUJ also argues that the best way to ensure adherence to the PCC&#146;s code of practice is for journalists themselves to uphold it. However, many journalists are increasingly forced to violate the code as a result of commercial pressures, or pressure from editors, some of whom are members of the PCC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80715-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08071582000180">The NUJ argues that if journalists had a contractual right to refuse to carry out assignments or tasks that required them to breach the code of practice, the result would be greater accuracy and less need for complaints. Such a &#147;conscience clause&#148; would perhaps be the biggest step towards a return to a fairer, free press. There have been suggestions from some quarters that if we made the press complaints procedure more accessible and effective, our newspapers would be full of nothing but apologies and retractions. That view is clearly absurd, as the only foreseeable reason why a paper would be full of corrections is that it had been full of inaccuracies in the first place. In addition, many countries such as Germany, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Greece, Austria, Switzerland and France have just as robust, or even more stringent, systems to ensure that their citizens are afforded protection from inaccurate press reporting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80715-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08071582000181">In the UK, the current voluntary code of practice leaves newspapers free to print what they like, irrespective of the personal consequences for those involved. In the majority of cases in which members of the general public are the victims of inaccurate reporting, they do not have the resources&#151;financial or otherwise&#151;to mount a legal challenge against those responsible. There is an increasing body of anecdotal evidence to suggest that in situations in which victims feel that they have a strong case, they are bought off with minimal out-of-court cash settlements, and with a small retraction buried in the depths of the newspaper. There are, of course, some high profile cases, such as that of the McCann family, whose lives have been made a misery, not simply because of their own actions, but because of subsequent unsubstantiated, and frankly outrageous, reports about their situation. In my view, the McCanns are due every penny of their successful claim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80715-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08071582000182">However, what about the case of Mr. Murat, at one time the prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann case, who was cleared of any involvement, but whom the British media decided to convict, and whose life now  <br>

lies in ruins? The principle of innocent until found guilty seems not to be held to by the tabloid newspapers, which choose to persecute people in the court of public opinion, although what they say has little or no basis in fact. There are many cases like Mr. Murat&#146;s, and that must give Members of the House, and the public, great cause for concern, as anyone at any time could fall prey to the vicious practices of the often unrepentant British press.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80715-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08071582000183">A recent newspaper report was a prime example of inaccuracy; it made statements to the effect that a group of Muslims had attacked a house in Windsor that they thought was being purchased by four members of the armed forces returning from a tour in Afghanistan. The report was made despite the fact that there was no evidence to suggest that the vandalism was caused by Muslims. The story even included a quote from the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies). Subsequently, evidence emerged that indicated that the local Army barracks had received three anonymous telephone calls the previous week from local residents who objected to the presence of soldiers, fearing that they would lower property prices in the area.</p>

To quote the Financial Secretary, the main purpose of the National Insurance Contributions Bill was to align the upper earnings limit of national insurance contributions with the starting point of the higher rate of income tax. Since the Bill went through the House of Commons, when we broadly debated the matters to which the Lords amendments relate, it has emerged that it is no longer the Government&#146;s stated intention to align national insurance contributions and income tax. Would it be appropriate for the Committee, in providing its reasons to the House of Lords, to give the reasons why the Government wish to proceed with the Bill, given that the stated policy intention no longer applies?</p>

Increasing integration of, and collaboration between, health and social care are among the key drivers behind the regulation framework provided for in the Bill, and constitute a recurrent theme running through Government policy. We introduced this group of amendments to address some of the key concerns that were debated at length here and in the other place. They were put forward in discussion with the current commissions as well as with the National Consumer Council, the Picker Institute, and Which?, all of which have welcomed them.</p>

 As I was saying, amendment No. 2 introduces a new main objective for the commission. We have been clear throughout that the commission&#146;s main priority should be the safety and quality of services, and I said early on that I thought that its key functions and responsibilities were already set out in what was clause 2. However, we recognise that many people thought that this was not expressed clearly enough. The amendment introduces a clear, succinct statement of purpose, which resists the temptation to stray into other territory and  <br>

create for the commission additional broad functions that it would have been unclear how it was to deliver, or to include a long list of objectives that could duplicate the functions of other statutory bodies. Instead, it emphasises that the welfare of patients and people who use social services should be at the heart of everything that the commission does.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="80715-0005.htm_para0"><a name="08071582000207">Amendment No. 3 amends the matters to which the commission must have regard and sets those out in a separate clause. We were initially cautious about creating too many general requirements in these areas that risked diluting the commission's priorities. However, we have been persuaded on two particular fronts to make changes that, through their careful construction, address key concerns about the regulator&#146;s focus on people who use services, but still preserve the right balance. Those are the reference to Local Involvement Networks&#151;or LINks&#151;which relates to amendment No. 72 in the next group, and the expansion of the responsibility to promote and protect people&#146;s rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="80715-0005.htm_para1"><a name="08071582000208">Another key issue in both Houses has been the desire to secure patient and user engagement in the commission&#146;s work. We set out from the outset to create a body with a strong user focus, just as the existing bodies have. I have put on record my expectation that the commission will not only work closely with LINks but will find ways to engage with people who use services on a broader basis. Through Lords amendments Nos. 4, 24 and 25, we have responded to requests for this expectation to be set out explicitly in the Bill. Amendments Nos. 24 and 25 make it explicit that the commission must demonstrate to Parliament, as part of its annual reporting, how it is delivering against its statement on engagement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="80715-0005.htm_para2"><a name="08071582000209">Amendment No. 66 also responds to one of the key themes of the debates&#151;the importance of ensuring that social care and the commission&#146;s responsibilities under the Mental Health Act 1983 are not neglected. We have given assurances in both Houses that that would not be the case, but various amendments were proposed to try to guarantee it by legislative means. In amendment No. 66 we have arrived at a solution that provides the reassurance that some people have been looking for without tying the commission&#146;s hands. It will include a broad requirement for the board to include members with expertise relating to all three areas covered by the existing bodies: social care, monitoring the use of powers under the 1983 Act, and health care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="80715-0005.htm_para3"><a name="08071582000210">We believe that the amendments improve on what was already in the Bill to make much clearer what is expected of the commission, without telling it how it should approach its task, and I commend them to the House.</p>

I welcome that new clause, brought forward by the Government, as it responds to Conservative amendments from the other place and this House. I pay tribute to those on the Conservative Front Bench in the other place, particularly my noble Friend Earl Howe, on winning so many concessions from the Government. Indeed, a large number of the substantive Government amendments before us today come as a direct result of amendments tabled by Conservative Front Benchers in Grand Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="80715-0005.htm_para5"><a name="08071582000213">Members of the Committee in this House will well remember that amendment No. 2 was originally tabled, in similar terms, by me, supported by my right hon. and hon.

Surely it would have saved much parliamentary time to have accepted the amendment in Committee in this place.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making an important point. Does he have any explanation for the flip-flop, or U-turn? Is this a rare occasion when a Minister has listened and realised that he was wrong?</p>

 The best I can say to my right hon. Friend is that I would like to think so. I recall saying at the outset of the Committee that as we were aiming for as much consensus as possible on health and social care&#151;not areas that are normally given to the playing of the party political game&#151;I hoped that the Minister would avoid being tribal or having pride of authorship in the Bill. It was clear to us during the course of the Committee that accepting any Opposition amendments would cause the Minister physically to wince, so he did not accept one. Now we are back, mainly to implement the Conservative amendments, conceded in another place, that we presented in Committee. In answer to my right hon. Friend, there is a genuine question about what the price of saving face, or the price of not thinking quickly enough on one&#146;s feet, is. As so much parliamentary time could have been saved had the amendments been accepted when they were first proposed, it is fair to ask precisely what has changed the Minister&#146;s mind in the interim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="80715-0005.htm_para8"><a name="08071582000218">There are indeed some questions about the new clause. A number of hon.

Paragraph 150 states:</p>

The NHS chief executive wants the health care side to be divested of performance monitoring, but presumably such monitoring will be built into the social care side.

 My right hon. Friend reaches for the overarching principle that lies behind the mindset that informs Bills of this type.

That is set out in our autonomy and accountability Bill, which has been drafted by the Opposition and is ready to go. I am grateful to my right hon.

Interestingly, I have picked out the same quote as the hon. Member for Eddisbury did from the Committee proceedings, when the Minister clearly said that he did not think including LINks was the right way to go, although he added that he would come back with clearer thinking on the issue. On Report, however, he repeated his earlier sentiment; indeed, we divided the House, and Government Back Benchers, almost to a man and woman, although not quite&#151;there were a few honourable exceptions&#151;agreed with him. I am almost tempted to find a way to divide the House now, to see whether Labour Members, as one body, have changed their minds, but that would be churlish, and we have to welcome what we have.</p>

approach. It is relatively easy to define human rights, and although it is not always easy to enshrine them in new legislation, such legislation does help us to define them. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify whether the word &#147;rights&#148; is intended to include human rights, whether it is intended to be broader, and what is meant by rights. I do not think that the term has particular legal meaning, so a broader outline of the Minister&#146;s thinking would be helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="80715-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08071582000259">I also have a question about Lords amendment No. 4. Although I am delighted to see a focus on user involvement, the proposed new clause strikes me as potentially tokenistic. Although the commission has to publish a statement describing how it proposes to involve users and carers, it is not clear when that is supposed to happen. The proposed new clause mentions periodic reviews that must be consulted on, but it does not say by when we should have the statement. Again, it would be helpful to have some clarification from the Minister when he sums up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="80715-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08071582000260">Finally, I welcome Lords amendment No. 66, which would make it clear in the Bill that a full range of knowledge must be represented on the commission, and that is clearly important. The chair of the commission has now been appointed, and in her evidence to the Select Committee she was very open about the fact that she knew little about social care. Knowledge has to be taken into account, so it would be useful to have further clarification of the depth of knowledge expected, of whether one board member will be enough, and of whether there will be attempts to create a balance. Although there has to be a full range of knowledge, the balance could still be tilted if the composition of the board changed over time and this principle were not kept at the forefront of thinking.</p>

 I share the slight disappointment of the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) at the ungracious tone adopted by the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien). We made it clear throughout Committee that we were in listening mode, and open to constructive suggestions as to how to improve the Bill further. The hon. Gentleman referred to the contribution of his noble Friend Earl Howe when the Bill passed through the other place&#151;and Earl Howe described the Government amendments as diamonds and gems. If the hon. Member for Eddisbury wants me to outline the exact differences between these amendments and those that he proposed in Committee, I shall be happy to do so, but let me say that his amendments were closer in form to stones and pebbles than to diamonds and gems. That is why we tabled our own amendments; if we had not, he would have criticised us for not listening and not improving the Bill. Thanks to the contributions of noble Lords from the Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour parties, as well as Cross Benchers in the other place, the Bill has been considerably improved, and I had hoped that the hon.

 My hon. Friend touches on an important point&#151;how we benefit from the processes. That has not been particularly well thought through, not least because of the absence of, for instance, the great bed-watch campaigns that the old community health councils could collectively inspire. Indeed, the second of the three areas that I was discussing in relation to amendment No. 8 and our concerns, which remain unaddressed but have been part of the debate that has led us to this point, was monitoring the trends. For a regulator, local or national trends revealed through complaints can be a useful bellwether&#151;precisely the point made by my hon. Friend&#151;in directing its inspection activity.

Those documents would still require the Secretary of State&#146;s approval. Again, the amendment comes in response to amendments that we tabled in the Grand Committee, again supported by another party. That is a small victory in the Conservative crusade to have the CQC set up as an independent regulator, rather than one too often at the beck of the Secretary of State. Whether it turns out to be effective in practice, we wait to see. While the Secretary of State will not be able to &#147;modify&#148;, he will presumably be able to withhold approval until he is happy with the document, amounting to the same thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80715-0007.htm_para3"><a name="08071582000303">Likewise, I welcome Lords amendments Nos. 18 and 19, which give the CQC a new power to refer matters of concern to the Secretary of State, and are the result of points made by my noble Friend Earl Howe in Grand Committee. They give the CQC a further power in its own right, separate from the Secretary of State. I only lament, once more, that the CQC is not independent enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80715-0007.htm_para4"><a name="08071582000304">I welcome Lords amendment No. 23, which again removes the power of the Secretary of State to specify by order when the commission must publish programmes setting out the reviews, investigations and studies that it proposes to conduct. It is a further concession won in another place. Not only is it welcome as a further removal of the Secretary of State&#146;s control over the commission, but it is welcome as one less piece of legislation that will use up valuable parliamentary time. The 1950 Parliament put 720 pages of Acts and 2,970 pages of statutory instruments on to the statute book. Last year, the number of pages of new Acts totalled 4,609 and there were 11,868 new pages of statutory instruments. I just could not help referring to that, as it is so shocking.</p>

It will be recalled that, although those elements to enhance the independence of the CQC are welcome, the Government have been unable to accept that it was appropriate to reconsider clause 2(4), which now seems rather out of place and which effectively enables there to be a Secretary of State override, as the commission must have regard to what the Secretary of State &#147;may direct.&#148;</p>

I also note that we were the only party with an MP representing a Welsh constituency in the Committee.

She has been exploring the funding that she is likely to require directly with the Treasury, rather than with my Department. She also made it clear in the memorandum that she tabled for the Committee, which has been shared with hon. Members, that she would be happy to provide them directly with any further information.</p>

In this case, the CQC would examine an organisation&#146;s handling of complaints and hold it accountable for how robust its arrangements were. That consideration would include whether organisations were learning from complaints, as we all want them to do.</p>

It was therefore with great pleasure that we were able to confirm on Third Reading in the other place that we would take the next available legislative opportunity to extend the remit of the local government ombudsman, so that he or she could investigate complaints by self-funders. To achieve that, we will amend the Local Government Act 1974. Of course, the local government ombudsman already has a role to play in investigating complaints by people whose care is arranged or funded by local authorities. A new responsibility for self-funder complaints will sit logically with those existing duties, and the ombudsman&#146;s staff will have the advantage of already understanding the types of issues that arise in adult social care.</p>

The hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) made an important point about the overall importance of improving commissioning and the primary care trusts&#146; capacity to commission. It should not be forgotten that alongside the role of the CQC in improving the quality of commissioning through regulation, we also recently announced in the primary and community care strategy&#151;and before that, in our proposed performance and failure regime&#151;how PCTs&#146; commissioning could be better performance-managed.

 With this it will be convenient to discuss Lords amendments Nos. 33 to 36, 52, 55 to 60, 62, 73 to 83 and 85 to 89.</p>

<p><a name="st_o137"><a name="08071582000329"><a name="80715-0007.htm_spnew8"><a name="08071582000624"><b>Mr. Bradshaw:</b>
 This group of amendments reflect areas in part 2 of the Bill where arguments put forward in the other place merited serious consideration. We have also tabled amendments to achieve a new policy, which I will turn to first.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="80715-0007.htm_para21"><a name="08071582000330">Amendments Nos. 36, 60, 75 to 78 and 85 to 89 were introduced at Grand Committee stage in the other place to meet a Government commitment to abolish the Hearing Aid Council by April 2009 and to transfer the regulation of private hearing aid dispensers to the Health Professions Council. This group of amendments is intended to achieve that by paving the way for a future Order in Council under the section 60 provisions of the Health Act 1999, in addition to ensuring that public hearing aid dispensers can be regulated in the same way in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80715-0007.htm_para22"><a name="08071582000331">I accept that it is not ideal that this House did not have the opportunity to consider this provision in its deliberations in Committee. I hope, however, that hon. Members will forgive the fact that this is a late addition to the Bill in recognition of the very real benefits that this measure will bring for patients and consumers. First, this will provide improved protection for the hearing impaired and simplify the regulatory framework for hearing aid dispensers. Although the council has done a fantastic job over the past 40 years, it is operating under legislation that is increasingly outdated with gaps in consumer protection. The Health Professions Council, established in 2001, has modern and comprehensive legislation that will provide for a much more complete service to patients and consumers. As a multi-professional statutory regulator, it can provide greater resources while charging considerably smaller fees to the profession. Secondly, and importantly, the Hearing Aid Council itself, the Health Professions Council, the Royal National Institute for Deaf People and the British Society of Hearing Aid Audiologists are all fully supportive of this move, and are working together to ensure that the transition will be as smooth as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80715-0007.htm_para23"><a name="08071582000332">I turn now to the amendments that we have brought forward as a result of debates in the other place. Amendment No. 32 addresses concerns that the Secretary of State&#146;s power of direction over the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence in the Bill, as originally drafted, could be perceived as undermining the independence of the CHRE. The reason for including it in the Bill was as a mechanism to help the CHRE to prioritise its workload in busy periods, but having discussed it with the CHRE we are now confident that it can be dispensed with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="80715-0007.htm_para24"><a name="08071582000333">On clause 116, I was persuaded by arguments put forward in the other place that the Bill could be strengthened to ensure that the careers of health care workers are not damaged by malicious or untrue allegations. Amendment No. 35 therefore requires the appropriate Minister to have regard</p>
<a name="80715-0007.htm_brev4"><a name="08071582000443"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to the importance of avoiding unfair prejudice to health care workers against whom unsubstantiated allegations are made&#148;</p>

Amendments Nos. 52 and 56 respond to concerns that the piloting of legally qualified chairs might be unfair to individual practitioners who appear in front of OHPA&#146;s fitness to practise panels. Although I am clear that that can be done fairly, we have brought forward amendments Nos. 52 and 56 to ensure that if OHPA makes rules that include piloting provisions, these rules will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. That means that Parliament will have the opportunity to debate OHPA&#146;s detailed proposals for the pilot, and will be able to reject them if it is felt that they are unfair.</p>

The DPRRC recommended that regulations conferring responsibilities on responsible officers under new section 45B of the Medical Act 1983, as inserted by clauses 114 and 115, should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure on their first exercise by each of the appropriate authorities.

 I am most grateful to my hon. Friend, who makes a powerful point. We in this House must be supremely conscious to ensure that justice can be done, and can be seen to be done. We are talking about a quasi-judicial area, and it is of course important not to discourage whistleblowing, which is one of the best sources of information. The Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw), and I have been asked the question: what does one do to guard against those who might be minded to make a malicious allegation? There are people who might be keen to do so, because of career jealousy or personal angst. What would be the threat against those who knew that they had done something wrong? The answer is not in the Bill. The Bill rightly ensures that information can be provided, and it could be malicious or non-malicious. If it is non-malicious, that is fine, and the allegation will be examined.</p>

 Perhaps I could just finish the point. There ought perhaps to be a safeguard. Somebody who makes a complaint needs to know that they can opt for an alert system. They can put the matter to an official body, which can then be on watch, or on alert, without launching a formal investigation. By that means, responsibility is offloaded from the individual. If the complaint is non-malicious, that is likely to give the person confidence that they have at least done the right thing. They will know that the official bodies are in possession of information that gives them the chance to be on watch, or to put in place an appropriate alert system. That happens in other areas, and quite properly so.</p>

and so forth. That information will then be given, and the subject of the complaint can be officially put on watch; that way, allegations are not simply a way of passing on tittle-tattle. I hope that that addresses my hon. Friend&#146;s valid and important point to some degree, and I am deeply grateful to him for raising it.</p>

That would give whistleblowers clarity and peace of mind about the fact that their concerns are being dealt with professionally. It would also give professionals the confidence that they need in the system, and I hope that the Minister listened carefully to our exchange.</p>

The amendments were tabled in response to points made by my noble Friend Earl Howe in Grand Committee, and by others, about the fairness of the scheme. The Government amendments on legally qualified chairs that were brought forward on Report in the Commons did not go as far as they might have done, but they were an important concession by the Government, and they recognised the strength of the arguments&#151;not least our own&#151;on legally qualified chairs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80715-0008.htm_para23"><a name="08071582000371">The provision of legally qualified chairs arises from recommendation 79 of the Shipman inquiry&#146;s fifth report, by Lady Justice Smith, then Dame Janet Smith. She reinforced her position during an oral evidence session in the Public Bill Committee, on 8 January, at column 37 of <i> Hansard</i>. Her grounds relate to effective chairmanship, the speed of proceedings, a higher standard of reasoned decision, and an ability to deal with the complexities of the civil standard of proof. It will be remembered that the Bill uses the civil, as opposed to the criminal, standard of proof for the processes in question. I am glad that both Houses will have the opportunity to scrutinise the final proposals when they come before us; that will be absolutely vital.</p>

Amendment No. 73 excises the phrase &#147;member State&#148; and replaces it with &#147;relevant European State&#148;. Often, these things can be absolutely fundamental, given how European legislation tends to work, but as far as I am aware, the relevant sections of the Medical Act 1983 have not been amended to read &#147;relevant European State&#148; instead of &#147;member State&#148;. Will the Minister explain the substance behind the amendment and why it is being made? Surely &#147;member States&#148; are easily definable and &#147;relevant European States&#148; less so.</p>

It just worries me that it could be a definitional read-across that it is important to recognise, given that at the moment there is the introduction under European legislation of the 48-hour week. That is having a major effect on how health services can be provided in our country, let alone in other member states. We should have uniformity of definition.</p>

We wonder whether a sleight of hand may be behind the issue. As I say, I have no reason to believe anything other than what is in the explanatory notes, but it is extraordinary that we should be asked to replace &#147;member State&#148; with &#147;relevant European State&#148; without an explanation, given that these things often carry such important cross-referencing in legislation.</p>

We raised the issue in Committee. The Minister contended that he had already achieved that through what was then Government new clause 6. He said the new clause meant that possible disputes about whether the council had the power to consider individual cases would be avoided. Why, then, were the Government unable to get the issue right in the first place? That question is left hanging in the air. The other matters in this group of amendments need not detain us any longer.</p>

The amendment clarifies that that will not apply to clause 106 and schedule 8, which contain amendments to the order-making power in section 60 of the Health Act 1999. Other provisions in schedule 8 will need to be commenced prior to the order-making power being used and commencement of certain aspects of the provisions, as subject to consultation with Scottish Ministers under clause 166(1).

 Amendments Nos. 38, 40 and 41 strengthen the safeguards available for those subject to orders by justices of the peace by placing additional maximum time limits on detention, isolation or quarantine. Amendment No. 38 provides for an automatic review every 28 days where an individual is quarantined, isolated or detained under regulations made using section 45C of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984. Amendments Nos. 40 and 41 provide for the period of any extension of a measure for detention, isolation or quarantine imposed under an order not to exceed 28 days. There were concerns in the other place that the wording of the legislation could lead to disposal of dead bodies in a less than respectful manner. Amendments Nos. 37 and 39 clarify that where disposal of an infected or contaminated dead body is required, it is by way of cremation or burial. It was also felt that clarification was needed as regards who should be notified when an application for a justice of the peace order is made regarding a dead body. Amendments Nos. 42 and 43 deal with that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80715-0009.htm_para4"><a name="080715108000011">Amendment No. 47 ensures that regulations made using the emergency procedure in new section 45R are not subject to the process for making hybrid regulations. That is because the hybrid instrument procedure is a rather lengthy process and would not be appropriate where there is an imminent public health threat. Finally, amendments Nos. 44, 45 and 46 ensure that the first draft of the regulations under sections 45N and 45L(4), which provide for the making of additional provisions in relation to a justice of the peace&#146;s order, are subject to the affirmative procedure.</p>

 I shall start with amendments Nos. 37 and 39, which ensure that dead bodies are disposed of respectfully.

In addition, the review would be automatic for such measures. I fully support that amendment. In Committee, we had considerable discussion about issues relating to detention. I am pleased to see that the Minister has recognised some of the concerns about safeguards on the power to detain, isolate and quarantine people. The measures will restrict periods of detention, isolation or quarantine under the domestic regulation-making power to a maximum period of 28 days before a review must take place. We do not want a situation where people are held in isolation or quarantine indefinitely at the mercy of a periodic review. I therefore welcome the extra safeguards that the amendment will give to the liberties of those detained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80715-0009.htm_para7"><a name="080715108000016">The automatic review is most welcome, and it will not depend on an application. As I said, considerable concern was raised in Committee about the powers, and I know that organisations such as the National AIDS Trust have particular concerns on the matter. I am pleased that the Minister heeded some of the concerns raised in Committee. There has been a lot of discussion in the House on detention recently, and it is curious in some ways that the measures in this Bill received almost no attention. The powers are quite draconian; they may be necessary in certain circumstances, but we need to ensure that the public are protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80715-0009.htm_para8"><a name="080715108000017">Amendments Nos. 40 and 41 will amend the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 to limit the period for which a part 2A order could impose detention, isolation or quarantine of a person to a maximum of 28 days. The amendments will also limit any extension of those measures to no more than 28 days, and provide a power to shorten the maximum periods further by regulation. I am pleased that the amendment will restrict the period of any extension of a justice of the peace order for detention, isolation or quarantine to no more than 28 days at a time. Once again, that will help to safeguard the human rights of those who have been detained, and it will protect the public from any miscarriages of justice. Consequently, I fully support that amendment. There is also a provision to shorten the maximum periods by regulation. If there is an opportunity to do so, and the 28 days is not found to be necessary in practice, I hope that the Minister will take up that option.</p>

Indeed, in 2002, Derek Wanless served a warning on the Prime Minister that a failure to tackle public health challenges would contribute to an extra cost of up to &#163;30 billion a year by 2022. The Prime Minister&#146;s failure to tackle them forced the Government&#146;s chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson to raise the alarm last July that the country was following the Wanless report&#146;s worst case scenario.

Indeed, since 1997, the proportion of boys aged two to 15 who are either overweight or obese has increased by 33 per cent. I recognise that the Bill contains provisions to do something to address that problem through weighing and measuring children. However, the statistics are shocking. The position has been exacerbated by the Government&#146;s abandonment in 1999 of the Conservative Government&#146;s targets of reducing obesity rates in the general population to 6 per cent. among men and 8 per cent. among women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80715-0009.htm_para13"><a name="080715108000022">Figures have recently been produced on sexually transmitted infections.

Cases of gonorrhoea have increased by 44 per cent., of chlamydia by 148 per cent., of herpes by 17 per cent., of genital warts by 17 per cent. and of HIV by 11 per cent.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. It is interesting that he makes a party political point to knock me for making a party political point. I do not think that he will find that the increase in syphilis is down to extra recording. Syphilis has been recorded for quite some time. The issue is nothing to do with recording. To have sexually transmitted diseases at those levels in this day and age is very serious, and the issue is all about public health protection. On substance misuse, since 1997 the number of alcohol-related deaths has increased by 40 per cent. and the number of young people receiving treatment in hospital as a result of alcohol misuse has risen by 33 per cent. Smoking rates have fallen far more slowly since 1997 than in earlier years. In 2005, 24 per cent. of the adult population smoked, compared with 27 per cent. in 1998.</p>

We are talking about the duties placed on public health staff to detain and isolate people, and to protect the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80715-0009.htm_para15"><a name="080715108000032">Let me finish by saying that health inequalities can be changed by public health staff. The inequality gap in the infant mortality rate has not been reduced by a sufficient amount to meet the target. The inequality gaps in male and female life expectancy at birth have both increased since the baseline. If current trends continue, the target will not be met. The inequality gap in cancer mortality has declined since the baseline, despite a slight increase in the last period. The minimum requirements for the 2010 target have already been met. However, that is irrelevant, as the meaningful outcome measure is the five-year survival rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80715-0009.htm_para16"><a name="080715108000033">Although I welcome the Lords amendments, they place yet more duties on public health staff, who are struggling to meet the already onerous burden imposed by the rising rates of substance misuse and sexually transmitted infections, and, more worryingly than anything else, particularly from this Government, by the rising inequalities in health.</p>

 Lords amendment No. 50 introduces a new clause into the Bill to amend section 164 of the National Health Service Act 2006, which allows the Secretary of State to authorise any primary care trust or other person to exercise the functions of determining authorities in relation to the making or varying of a determination on the remuneration for those providing NHS pharmaceutical services.

However, we recognised the concerns raised during the passage of the Bill in this House and the other place that that might change in future. Amendment No. 50 addresses those concerns by ensuring that if, in future, a decision were made to appoint primary care trusts or other persons as determining authorities for the remuneration of those providing pharmaceutical services under section 126 of the National Health Service Act 2006, that may be done only through regulations.

 As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I am trying to imagine what effect this measure will have on our proceedings. Representatives of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs appear regularly before the Committee, and I cannot imagine the kind of questions that I would put to the permanent secretary to find out how HMRC had aided the nutrition of pregnant women.

 I dare say that many of us would like to be a fly on the wall, if not in the Public Gallery, of the next PAC meeting when my hon. Friend will have a chance to put precisely that question. It will be interesting to hear what answer is given, in view of the expected responsibilities. It is extraordinary to find ourselves in this situation, not least when the health in pregnancy grant has been tested by having gone through such a lengthy process in both Houses. By his own admission, the Minister found much of the debate on that grant somewhat frustrating. We support it in principle, but we do so on the basis of evidence that it is indeed in the early weeks of pregnancy, and often the time before conception, that is most important for the health&#151;in the broadest possible definition&#151;and the health care of women either just pregnant or seeking to become pregnant. How that will be understood in the rather clinical world of the PAC, I do not know. Like my hon. Friend, I remain fascinated and I remain to be convinced.</p>

 I really do, which is why amendments Nos. 48 and 49 rightly raise this issue at this stage of our proceedings. The Government have sought to skate over what they know to be a patent embarrassment, and a patent inability to produce evidence, because they know that the evidence is not there to back up the Prime Minister&#146;s statement from the Dispatch Box to a full House that nutrition was most important in the &#147;last months of pregnancy&#148;.

It was being paid in the later stages of pregnancy, and rather than being spent on food and nutrition or vitamin supplements, it was used to buy wide-screen TVs.

caring people who want the best for their imminent child, and they will do their best to provide the right nutrients for themselves. Undoubtedly some people will be in debt, but for most mothers, additional money will inevitably spill over into a diet that is a bit better. The hon. Gentleman is rightly saying that there should be a much more substantial increase for expectant mothers and for mothers after the child is born. I certainly agree with the need for much higher child benefit.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for helping us to recall what happened in Committee. Some of us who were a touch sceptical about the evidence sessions before they took place found that they helped a lot of us understand where the evidence that had inspired the Government to introduce the provisions might lie. That was particularly so in the case of the health in pregnancy grant. We all approached the grant in a benign way, with good will, because we wanted to see it happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="80715-0010.htm_para4"><a name="080715108000058">The hon. Gentleman is entirely right that the grant must be appropriate. Where there are scarce resources, and in particular where extra resources are being made available, they should be targeted at those who can benefit most from that support. Pregnant women are clearly in that category. It is best that resources are well targeted to deliver the best benefit. The evidence we were seeking was where that best benefit would lie.</p>

Gentleman heard me&#151;that I thought it rather rough and unfair for the payment in Australia to be termed the &#147;plasma payment&#148;. This country should be better able to trust people to do the best for themselves if they are given the opportunity to do so with extra resources. That is precisely what I was seeking to ensure was being said in response to my hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="80715-0010.htm_para6"><a name="080715108000060">The big issue is that if there are scarce resources&#151;if it is not possible to augment the payment proposed by the Government, who have identified what resources they are prepared to devote to the grant&#151;we need to target them in the best way. The evidence does not suggest that it is best to put a nutritional opportunity at the tail end of a pregnancy, which is what the Prime Minister seemed to say when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer and that was announced, in effect, by voting the money, or the intended money. Rather, the evidence suggests that it should be provided in the early weeks, and prior to conception. That is the beef; that is the argument. We are all trying to achieve nutritional and health improvements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80715-0010.htm_para7"><a name="080715108000061">I do not think that the hon. Gentleman and I are at odds on that. It was helpful that he intervened, because I have been able to make it clear that we are not in the business of castigating people. On the contrary, we want them to derive the best benefit from a potential opportunity. However, in the light of all the discussion, and the evidence to the contrary of what the Prime Minister sought to pray in aid, we believe that what is delivered in the Bill is still based on a false premise. We would be far better off using the evidence sessions, which were designed to help the Committee, to ensure that the best benefit is delivered in the early years and prior to conception.</p>

 The point was made in Committee&#151;I think that it was borne out by the evidence session&#151;that there are fundamentals in the nutrition of the unborn child, particularly in the early months. They include when nutrients, particularly calcium, phosphorous and vitamin D, are needed to lay down the skeletal frame. By the 25th week the internal organs will be well formed, although one would hope that the foetus would gain in weight thereafter. Many of the deficiencies in underweight babies result from lack of nutrient in the early stages. That was clearly stated, yet the Government appear not to have taken any notice of it.</p>

Friend will be the first to remember, a series of amendments were tabled in Committee&#151;under both chairmanships&#151;relating to the number of weeks involved. The issue was not whether the grant should be paid when a woman was 25, 24, 23, 21, 16 or even 12 weeks pregnant; it was to do with the pre-conception stage and the very early weeks of pregnancy, the fact that nutritional information was vital, and the benefit that could be derived from it.</p>

 I have every sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman is saying, and I think we are all trying to move in the right direction. I entirely agree that the earliest stages of pregnancy, immediately after conception, are crucial. It is vital that alcohol abuse, for instance, is avoided at that stage. The difficulty for the Government, however, is that it is not really feasible to award a grant to someone on the basis that she is hoping to become pregnant. I think the best that the Government can do is ensure that expectant mothers are advised to eat properly and not to abuse their bodies, and told that they will receive a grant later which will help them out once their pregnancies are confirmed. The Government cannot seriously provide a grant just because someone is trying to become pregnant.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight the practical difficulty, although I do not think it is an impossibility. After all, the NHS funds infertility treatment. That has quite an extensive scientific base. It involves diagnosis, and the assessment of people on the grounds of their wish to start a family, at the pre-conception stage.

As the matter was not discussed in Committee, it would be helpful if the Minister could clarify the nature of the information likely to be shared, and the mechanisms that exist for the limiting and auditing of information sharing so that the &#147;health in pregnancy&#148; reason is not given when some other purpose is being served.

Work to develop the arrangements for administering the grant subsequently established that both the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for Social Development in Northern Ireland in fact already had sufficient access to information under the existing provisions to verify whether the necessary advice had been given.

 Members will recall that the previous time this Bill was before the House we undertook to address the issue of the application of the Human Rights Act 1998 following the decision in YL <i> v</i>. Birmingham city council. The effect of that decision is that residents whose care is publicly arranged do not have those rights we intended to put in place when we introduced the Human Rights Bill into Parliament. These amendments seek to address the immediate impact of the YL case for people receiving publicly arranged care in care homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80715-0010.htm_para22"><a name="080715108000087">The Minister with responsibility for human rights has committed to consulting in the near future on how to address the general issue of the definition of &#147;public authority&#148; in future, perhaps by means of legislation. The consultation process is the place and time to work out which functions should be subject to the Human Rights Act, and to work out how that can best be achieved. I am grateful to all those who have worked with the Government in preparing the amendment. I would particularly like to note the contributions of the British Institute of Human Rights and the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The amendment is a step along the road to addressing the issues around the scope of the Human Rights Act, but it is a very important step. It will provide the additional protection of the Act to some of the most vulnerable people in our society. I commend it to the House.</p>

many regard as a broken commitment by the Government&#151;lack of dignity, especially for personal care needs; too hasty discharge from hospital; fear of making complaints, a subject on which we touched during discussion of an earlier group of amendments; and age, disability and racial discrimination. Given all that has been discussed about equality matters in relation to recent legislative proposals, that is a continuing worry.</p>

The Bill went through this House in Committee and on Report and then went to the Lords. It seems that that process has moved the Government&#146;s position. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), who has been a doughty champion for that approach, and to the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins), who was often supported by the hon. Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins) in Committee It was important for the Government to listen&#151;we like to think they did&#151;to the Opposition&#146;s arguments. In this area, the Liberal Democrat spokesmen also made a significant and important contribution. Many of the amendments relating to that area were in their names. The Government seem to have come to a seriously and significantly modified view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80715-0011.htm_para2"><a name="080715108000091">According to the Government, MRSA affected about 6,000 people in 2006-07, and C. difficile about 56,000. By contrast, in 2006-07, 139,127 patients were discharged from hospital in a state of malnourishment. This is not just a malnutrition issue&#151;it is also a human rights issue. The Joint Committee on Human Rights in its recent report &#147;The Human Rights of Older People in Healthcare&#148; noted that malnutrition and dehydration in care settings breached articles 2, 3 and 8 of the European convention on human rights. Figures cited in the Department of Health&#146;s own nutrition action plan show that the cost of undernutrition is estimated at &#163;7.3 billion a year, and a recent <i> British Medical Journal</i> study reported that about 20 per cent. of patients in hospital are malnourished.</p>

 I am listening carefully to what my hon. Friend says, but as this legislation brings together health and social care, is he concerned about malnutrition among those, particularly the elderly, living at home with packages of social care, as well as those who are in residential or hospital care? Malnutrition among the elderly can cause not only general unwellness but symptoms that mimic other diseases, and often those diseases are not then identified.</p>

 Precisely. My hon. Friend makes a powerful point, again from her own experience. That was discussed at some length with the Minister in Committee. Although there was an absence of common cause on the malnutrition issue, we recognised, particularly in the health care setting, where there are some statistics one can get hold of, that it has been extraordinarily difficult to get the under-nutrition, malnutrition, or inappropriate nutrition figures out of the social care settings, whether they are local authority, public sector or indeed private sector. Almost everyone knows that some people will arrive, whether it is into a social care  <br>

setting or into a hospital setting, malnourished. It could be part of their condition. At the same time, the issue has been the rise in malnutrition among those who leave hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80715-0011.htm_para3"><a name="080715108000094">The thing about social care homes is that we do not have the same statistics&#151; naturally, given that we are often dealing with the end of life&#151;on people leaving to measure whether greater malnourishment has taken place. The weighing and measuring issues, which are addressed in the Bill, are important. Most of us remember from our childhoods that weighing and measuring were a natural first step in almost all interactions with the health or care services, not least in relation to health visitors. That is relevant to an earlier intervention on health and pregnancy. Such issues are vital to the future health of the people of our nation.</p>

 That is particularly the case for the elderly, because as the body ages it does not absorb so well key minerals and vitamins from food, and deficiencies in vitamins and minerals in the elderly can lead to serious health consequences. That applies regardless of whether the elderly are cared for at home with a social care package, in residential or nursing homes or in hospital, where during longer stays there can be serious consequences.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. Interestingly, her two most recent interventions demonstrate how this point applies at all vulnerable stages of life, both in the early and later years. Some of us rather wish it might also apply in the middle stage, as then there would be some solution to the difficult problem of controlling weight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80715-0011.htm_para4"><a name="080715108000097">This is a serious issue. It is important that staff have knowledge and training, both in the care setting and in the hospital setting, where nurses are involved. They must recognise the importance of nutrition and have knowledge of it, and they must be able to monitor it. An appropriate amount of time must be available to care for people by ensuring that they eat regularly and eat the right things. People must be monitored for vital nutritional and vitamin values, particularly as an illness&#151;or the condition of ageing&#151;often means that digesting becomes more difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80715-0011.htm_para5"><a name="080715108000098">This is a human right, and we have been anxious to understand how that would have a direct bearing on Lords amendments Nos. 51 and 61. The <i> British Medical Journal</i> figures that I recently gave reaffirm those provided by BAPEN&#146;s&#151;the British Association for Parental and Enteral Nutrition&#151;screening week, an initiative that the Government claimed to support. However, the Department of Health chose instead to describe the figures as,</p>

Furthermore, the Government&#146;s own figures, provided to me through a written parliamentary answer, showed that the number of under-nourished patients being discharged from hospital had risen by 84 per cent. since 1997. There has been a further discussion with the Minister on that point, and on what is described as an episode and how the percentages are reached. I acknowledge that there was some clarification of some of these statistics, but I believe that the Minister accepts that there is a vital issue here that must be considered.

of assistance in respect of this prime example of a matter that is seen as a health issue but is in fact best described as a human rights issue. To do so enables us to define people&#146;s entitlement, which in turn gives them rights. Rights confer power and are enforceable, whereas people have their health and care opportunities handed down to them from on high.</p>

 My hon. Friend spoke very quickly just now, so I may have misheard. It sounded to me as if he said that there had been an 84 per cent. increase in the number of patients leaving hospital suffering from malnutrition&#151;and that in the 12th year of this Labour Government, with a near trebling of expenditure on the NHS. I wish through him to ask the Minister to explain to the House how that could have happened. I agree that being fed and looked after, particularly when one is elderly and vulnerable, should be recognised as a human right, but we need to have practical steps on the ground, rather than just more high-minded rhetoric.</p>

 As I said, there has been some further discussion about the precise way the figure of 84 per cent. was reached, but through written parliamentary questions and the answers to them we realised that this was not just an anecdotal issue of the sort that we as Opposition Members are, of course, always being fed. This became a serious issue, and it was highlighted in Committee. The question is whether the Lords amendments will give us an opportunity to address the issue. I hope the Minister will explain whether the 84 per cent. figure has been reduced, and how that is worked out. What matters, however, is that the trend is very worrying. A health service and social care service should not lose sight of the simple things that are very easy to deal with if the appropriate measures and expectations are in place.</p>

 On a positive note, may I, through my hon. Friend, congratulate Hull royal infirmary? I recently visited it and raised the issue of malnutrition. It was taking it seriously. It was using a coloured plate system to identify patients at risk and was putting in place a series of measures to tackle the problem and ensure that there is not the increase in malnutrition in hospital in our local area that we have, sadly, seen across the country under this Government.</p>

 I am glad to hear that. I was recently in the Hull, Haltemprice and Howden area, but unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to visit Hull&#151;although I was, of course, pleased that other positive results came from that part of the world. My hon. Friend raises an important point. I must not get diverted too far from the topic of the amendments, but let me say that the red plate system, or the red tray system of Westminster city council, is a marvellous way of ensuring that those who need extra attention in gaining nutrition due to either lack of appetite or lack of will get that attention. It means that the caring staff have the opportunity to give that attention without the vulnerable person losing face or feeling that they have been singled out, and it works very well.</p>

publication of vital signs indicators for primary care trusts, the responses to the payment by results consultation and this Bill to demonstrate their intention to do so. None of the 83 vital signs targets relate to under-nutrition. It has been pointed out to the Department of Health that the lack of recognition for support services&#151;such as for nutrition&#151;in payment by results acts as a barrier to the commissioning of effective care pathways. Most damning was the voting down in Committee of an amendment that would have put tackling under-nutrition on the same statutory footing as tackling hospital-acquired infections. We could have avoided that situation. I was grateful for the full support that we received for that Conservative proposal from the Liberal Democrats, but, unfortunately, the Government failed to take it up, and we still do not see it. However, I think our rescue may come through the amendments in this group that give us the Human Rights Act application. Our approach should be to come from the human rights angle, rather than for the Bill to put under-nutrition and malnutrition on the same footing as hospital-acquired infections, however important they are. The latest available statistics show that MRSA and C. difficile affected about 62,000 people, whereas the number of people in a state of malnutrition when discharged from hospital only&#151;forgetting the care settings for now&#151;was more than double that at 139,127. We are not wrong to be deeply exercised about that, and to be critical of the Government because there is an opportunity to improve the health and well-being of so many people.</p>

At that time, we did not move the Government very far, but I was pleased that the Minister later agreed to meet a delegation, including a consortium of outside organisations, as well as myself and others, to discuss the issues and has moved in a positive direction. I am grateful for that, as I am sure others are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80715-0011.htm_para10"><a name="080715108000110">The problem we face is that the Human Rights Act 1998 applies to citizens in relation to the state, and that self-funders in private care homes do not have a relationship with the state in that context. It seems that we are moving towards a situation in which the others&#151;those who are funded by local authorities in private care homes&#151;will be able to exercise their human rights under that Act, as will all those in the few remaining public sector care homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80715-0011.htm_para11"><a name="080715108000111">My concern is about self-funders in private care homes. One can foresee an anomalous situation involving two residents in adjacent rooms, whereby one is funded by the state and protected by the Human Rights Act, and the other is not. That would clearly be unsatisfactory, and one would want to see some change. Such a situation arises from two changes that have taken place over the past few years, both of which I opposed. Although it was not opposed by the three major parties, I opposed the large-scale privatisation of care homes. If they were all in the public sector, there would not be a problem; and if all care home residents were funded by the state, as had been recommended by the royal commission on long-term care, there would not be a problem, but such people are in a double bind. One or other of those things does not apply to them, and thus they are in difficulty.</p>

I hope that at some future stage that will come to pass&#151;I would like to think it will happen under my own Government&#151;and I would also like the re-establishment of a strong public sector care homes sector.</p>

 I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman. Does he recall that comparative standards in residential care in the public and the private sectors were discussed in a Committee evidence session and that, unfortunately, although there are always problems in both sectors, the comparison did not show the public sector in a very good light?</p>

 The hon. Lady is right. Individual care homes perform very differently in both the public and private sectors, and since that session there have been public reports of serious failings in the private care sector too. Many people, particularly those who cannot speak for themselves, have been suffering inadequate care. I think that we do not care enough, or properly, for our elderly and vulnerable, and that comes down to resources. The public sector care homes were starved of resources for a long time. Many of them are not modern, and they have been understaffed and under pressure. The local authorities, which have been under the financial cosh for a long time, have been doing their best, but perhaps they have been squeezing funding for care homes to the point where some of those homes have not been very good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80715-0011.htm_para13"><a name="080715108000115">My own experience of a care home in my constituency, where my mother-in-law spent the last days of her life, was wonderful: the staff were directly employed and lived in the community, and the people in the care home came from the community. The care home was warm, friendly and caring, and my mother-in-law was as happy as she had ever been, given that she was nearing the end of her life.</p>

<p><a name="st_o197"><a name="080715108000116"><a name="80715-0011.htm_spnew13"><a name="080715108000298"><b>Mr. Stephen O'Brien:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman might be coming on to this, but he will have heard me say that one of our gravest difficulties in contending with this issue is part-funders. That is because their relationship comes partly through taxpayer support, but their contract is as a private individual in the private sector. Does he have some thoughts on that?</p>

<p><a name="st_o198"><a name="080715108000117"><a name="80715-0011.htm_spnew14"><a name="080715108000299"><b>Kelvin Hopkins:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman raises a further complication. Again, if everyone were fully paid for by the state, that complication would not arise, and that is the direction in which we want to move, but the Government will doubtless have to examine it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80715-0011.htm_para14"><a name="080715108000118">One Conservative Back Bencher talked about a lack of care in the health sector in general. Although this Government have increased spending on health by enormous sums, our spending levels remain considerably behind those of Germany and France. I believe that the latest figures show that France spends about 2.5 per cent. more of its gross domestic product on health than we do&#151;that is equivalent to &#163;50 million per constituency. If we had spent an extra &#163;50 million per constituency on health in every one of the past 30 years, we would be in a rather different position. Resources are still not as plentiful in the British health service as they are on the continent of Europe&#151;in Germany and France&#151;in terms of scanners, nurses, beds and so on. I want us to move further in their direction, with even more generous funding for health than we have now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80715-0011.htm_para15"><a name="080715108000119">I want us to move towards the levels of funding in France and Germany. It is noticeable that in France one does not have to wait to see a doctor or to have an operation&#151;I know from friends who live in France that that is the position. I want Britain to be like France; I do not want us constantly to pretend that the situation is much better than it is. It is not as good as it should be, even though it is a lot better than it was in 1997; we have made considerable progress since then. I urge my Front-Bench team to continue to press ahead with additional health service spending and to move towards the levels of expenditure in France and Germany. I am talking about not only the money, but the quality of provision that such funding will make possible.</p>

I have never supported the idea of self-funding or private care homes. We need proper funding and democratically accountable local care homes built into the community, where people are directly and permanently employed from the community. I am talking about people whose own relatives go to those care homes, as was the case in the care home in my constituency that I mentioned, which is now sadly closed. There was pressure from government to close a public sector care home because it did not have built-in, en suite facilities and all the other care home standards that the Government wanted. That care home has now gone, and the staff who worked in it have retired or moved on; that body of people who did such a wonderful job is no longer there. May I add that they were all solid trade unionists, belonging to my trade union, the GMB, and that some of them were even members of my party? They were wonderful people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80715-0011.htm_para17"><a name="080715108000121">That is the sort of care that I want, where people are community-based and there is accountability to the local authority. People should be publicly funded in proper, well-funded care homes that are free to all at the point of need. We are some way from having that, but when we do, the Human Rights Act will apply to all care home residents because they will all be in a relationship with the state in terms of their care. I have made these points before, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister does not mind hearing them again. I thank him for the progress on this issue and I will support the amendments.</p>

 I, too, welcome the amendments, and we should not let the other place take all the credit. It was clear from discussions in Committee that the Minister was sympathetic to the arguments that some of us were making. I was also part of the delegation mentioned by the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80715-0012.htm_para0"><a name="080715108000123">The matter of the significant proportion of care home residents who are privately funded is still outstanding. We often give the example of two people sitting side by side in a private care home, one funded by the state and the other not, and the differential between them. That is clearly unfair and needs to be tackled, but the amendment&#151;which will affect those who are publicly funded&#151;will make staff in care homes think about all aspects of human rights, including those raised by the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O&#146;Brien), and they are unlikely to distinguish between residents on the basis of how they are funded. The amendment will therefore drive up standards overall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="80715-0012.htm_para1"><a name="080715108000124">We must not be complacent. Some homes do not have any publicly funded residents, but they may have residents who qualify for a contribution to their nursing costs. Presumably&#151;the Minister could perhaps clarify the point&#151;because those people are receiving that contribution, the Human Rights Act could be used to redress any problems that they might have. In that case, we may be worrying unnecessarily in some cases.</p>

 I too welcome the amendments and the remarks made by the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O&#146;Brien) and his colleagues, who have welcomed this approach to the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European convention. That is a breath of fresh air as we do not always get that attitude from the Opposition on the benefits of that legislation. The hon. Gentleman cited with approbation my Committee&#146;s report on older people in health care&#151;both in hospitals and in care homes&#151;although I do not propose to go through all the examples we described in that report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80715-0012.htm_para3"><a name="080715108000127">The hon. Gentleman was asked about enforceability and he batted the question over to me. The answer is twofold. First, and most importantly, if the Act does apply in these circumstances, it strengthens the hand of the staff involved in arguing for more resources and better instructions and in standing up for residents against management if asked to do things that are not human rights compliant, perhaps relating to dignity and respect, because of lack of time or ability to deal with a particular patient. Secondly, it enables a general raising of standards, which is the only way we will be able to ensure that the human rights of the elderly are respected, whether in care homes or hospitals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80715-0012.htm_para4"><a name="080715108000128">The rights will also be enforceable through judicial review. Indeed, the issue arose because of a judicial review in the YL case, in which Mrs. YL was about to be evicted from her care home in Birmingham after a dispute, and the House of Lords found that she did not have any enforceable rights in that case. Luckily, that case was resolved amicably after the damage had been done in the House of Lords, so Mrs. YL did not lose out. The law was however put in limbo by that decision.</p>

 I agree, and our report focuses on recognising the fact that using the law through the court process will not bring about the substantive institutional and attitudinal change that addressing the issue through the Human Rights Act should achieve. It can be used as a tool to lever up standards more generally. Advocacy&#151;for example, through the patient advocacy and liaison services in hospitals&#151;is part of that. Indeed, in NHS hospitals we should not have a problem, because they are carrying out a public function, so the patients are already protected by the Act. Examples, such as cases of malnutrition, were given, and good practice has spread rapidly and widely as a result.</p>

YL issue. I have also introduced a private Member&#146;s Bill on the issue two years running, and I shall bring it back in the next Session, if it does not become law this Session, to keep up the pressure for wider reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="80715-0012.htm_para7"><a name="080715108000133">The amendments are very narrow. They would merely restore the position&#151;of care homes only&#151;before the YL case, and would affect only publicly funded residents. I think that that would include part-funders because of the way the amendment is phrased, but perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister can confirm that. As my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) suggested, that creates an anomaly whereby two residents in neighbouring rooms could be in different positions vis- -vis their legal rights. I suspect that that will not, however, make much difference in practice to the service that they receive from the care home, because it would be very difficult for staff to treat one patient better because he or she was covered by the Human Rights Act, so standards will be generally levered up in any event.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="80715-0012.htm_para8"><a name="080715108000134">The issue of the YL case remains unresolved. I tabled an amendment on Report, and my hon. Friend said that the Government would consider it. I am pleased that they did so and tabled this amendment in the Lords. He has been as good as his word in addressing this issue, but the basic problem remains. What is happening is that it is being addressed issue by issue. For example, the other place is considering amendments to the Housing and Regeneration Bill in relation to the applicability to housing associations. In a recent court case&#151;it may be going to appeal so I shall not give details&#151;the High Court found that housing associations were covered by the Human Rights Act, but whether that will be sustained on appeal remains to be seen. It is another open question. Every area of public service in which some elements are contracted out or privatised has this problem, but it is only being addressed piecemeal. We need a comprehensive solution.</p>

I hope that when my hon.

For example, on housing, the Minister in the other place suggested that it was never intended that housing associations would be included within the meaning of &#147;public authority&#148;.

 I am not sure that I would approach it from that direction. I would approach it from the other direction, which involves considering the service that is being delivered, its nature and where it comes from&#151;and how it is paid for plays a large part, too. If my hon. Friend looks at my private Member&#146;s Bill, which is still live&#151;although I suspect it will not make much progress in October&#151;he will see that in it I have set out a checklist of factors to consider. The more factors that apply, the more likely the institution is to be a public authority, whereas the fewer factors that apply, the less likely it is to be a public authority. The best way of approaching the overall picture probably is to consider the functions&#151;who pays for them, who delivers them and the nature of the tasks being performed.</p>

Although my hon. Friend the Minister&#146;s amendment is extremely welcome, in that it deals with the urgent problem of funded care home residents, it does not deal with the much wider issue. We await some urgent announcements from the Government on how they will take the issue further forward. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to focus on that when he replies.

 With the leave of the House, Madam Deputy Speaker. I was hoping to respond to my hon.

I originally said that we would consult on the subject in the near future. My hon. Friend will probably know this better than I do, as he follows these things much more closely, but the note says that we are already consulting.

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="80715-0012.htm_para20"><a name="080715108000150">Proscription is a tough but necessary power and its effect is that the proscribed organisation is outlawed and is unable to operate in the UK. The consequence of proscription is that specific criminal offences apply to a proscribed organisation. They include: membership of the organisation; the provision of various forms of support, including organising or addressing a meeting; and wearing or displaying an article that indicates membership of the organisation. Further criminal offences exist in relation to fundraising and various uses of money and property for the purposes of terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80715-0012.htm_para21"><a name="080715108000151">Given the wide-ranging impact of proscription, the Home Secretary exercises her power to proscribe an organisation only after thoroughly reviewing all the available relevant information on the organisation, which includes open source material as well as intelligence  <br>

I am sure hon. Members will appreciate that I am limited in what I can say about the evidence in support of that belief, as much of it is intelligence material and of a sensitive nature.</p>

We welcome the advent of the new Government, and at the start of these proceedings, I was very careful to read out the criteria under which we proscribe organisations. The right hon. and learned Gentleman will know that Hezbollah has definitive political, social and humanitarian wings that perform entirely legitimate functions in Lebanon. That is why they are not part of this order. However, given all the information that we have to hand, as well as the advice that we have received and the discussions that we have had, it is right and proper in the context of the criteria set out in the Terrorism Act 2000 that we proscribe the entire military wing and not just the External Security Organisation.

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman takes a great interest in these matters and will know that there are distinct parts of Hezbollah. That is the information that we have. We proscribed the External Security Organisation in 2001, but we now want to proscribe the broader military wing. People involved in aspects of Hezbollah activities that, according to the criteria of the Terrorism Act 2000, are found to support or act as a supplicant to the entire military wing will be dealt with under the offences that I have outlined.</p>

from them. The evidence that we have is also clear and, in that context, it is right and proper that I bring this order before the House. However, I can say unequivocally that Hezbollah&#146;s military wing is providing active support to Shi&#146;a militant groups in Iraq, including Jaysh al-Mahdi, which has been responsible for attacks on both Iraqi civilians and coalition forces. That includes providing training in the use of the deadly explosively formed projectiles used in roadside bombs. Although, as I have said before and for obvious reasons, I am unable to go into the full detail of the evidence, I can inform hon. Members that Hezbollah&#146;s support for insurgent groups in Iraq was confirmed when coalition forces captured a senior operative, Ali Musa Daqduq, in Iraq on 20 March 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="80715-0012.htm_para24"><a name="080715108000158">Daqduq is a Lebanese national who served for 24 years in Hezbollah. In 2005, he was directed by senior Lebanese Hezbollah military commanders to train Shi&#146;a groups in Iraq. Hezbollah&#146;s military wing is also providing support to Palestinian rejectionist groups in the occupied Palestinian territories, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The proscription of Hezbollah&#146;s military wing will contribute to making the UK a hostile environment for terrorists and their supporters. It will signal our condemnation of the support that Hezbollah provides to those who attack British and other coalition forces in Iraq, as well as Iraqi civilians. It will support our international partners in disrupting terrorist activity in the occupied Palestinian territories. It will also send a strong message that the UK is not willing to tolerate terrorism, either here or anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="80715-0012.htm_para25"><a name="080715108000159">I return to the point made by the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram). The House will be aware that, alongside its military operations, Hezbollah performs legitimate political, social and humanitarian roles in Lebanon. Proscription is not targeted at, and will not affect, those legitimate activities, but it sends a clear message that we condemn Hezbollah&#146;s violence and support for terrorism. We continue to call on Hezbollah to end terrorist activity, abandon its status as an armed group and participate in the democratic process on the same terms as all other Lebanese political parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="80715-0012.htm_para26"><a name="080715108000160">I have said already that the Government recognise that proscription is a tough power that can have a wide-ranging impact. Because of that, there is an appeal mechanism in the legislation. Any organisation that is proscribed, or anyone affected by the proscription of an organisation, can apply to the Home Secretary for the organisation to be de-proscribed. If that request is refused the applicant can appeal to the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission, a special tribunal that reviews whether the Home Secretary has properly exercised her powers to refuse to de-proscribe an organisation. The POAC can consider the sensitive material that often underpins proscription decisions and a special advocate can be appointed to represent the interests of the applicant in closed sessions of the commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80715-0013.htm_para0"><a name="080715108000165">Given the evidence of the military wing of Hezbollah&#146;s direct support for terrorism in Iraq and the occupied Palestinian territories, I believe that it is right that we continue to proscribe the External Security Organisation and that we extend the existing proscription to cover Hezbollah&#146;s entire military wing.</p>

 Under part 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000, the Secretary of State has the power to proscribe any organisation that commits or participates in acts of terrorism, prepares for terrorism, promotes or encourages terrorism or is otherwise concerned in terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80715-0013.htm_para2"><a name="080715108000168">Proscription is a very tough power. Any organisation that is on the list of proscribed organisations is outlawed in the UK. It is a criminal offence for a person to belong to, or encourage support for, a proscribed organisation. It is a criminal offence to arrange a meeting in support of a proscribed organisation, or to wear clothing or to carry articles in public that arouse reasonable suspicion that a person is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation. Proscription also means that the financial assets of the organisation become terrorist property and can be subject to freezing and seizure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="80715-0013.htm_para3"><a name="080715108000169">For those reasons, Parliament obviously must take very seriously its role in scrutinising those organisations to be put on a proscribed list. The failure to proscribe an organisation concerned with terrorism could allow it to gain a foothold in the UK, in particular to recruit and raise funds. That would undermine our national security, and I join the Minister in reiterating the Opposition&#146;s strong belief that we need tough anti-terrorist laws. That view is only confirmed when we think of the anniversary of 7/7 and the havoc wrought in this country&#146;s capital city on that day. Nor must we forget the fear felt by many people in this country when they read news reports of the attempted atrocity in the Haymarket some months ago. Terrorism is a perpetual threat in this country, and Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition are strong in their belief that tough laws will be required to protect the public. I know that that is the view of Her Majesty&#146;s Government.</p>

issue or ventilate my thoughts on it in this debate, but it is certainly an interesting question, and I am sure that the Minister will want to respond to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80715-0013.htm_para4"><a name="080715108000172">As I was about to say, failure to proscribe an organisation that turns out to be violent and to have terrorist intent could threaten British citizens on our soil, but equally, proscribing an organisation mistakenly or inappropriately could tie up significant resources. The resources available to our security services are, of course, finite, and must be targeted properly. It is important to make that point. This is an important order, and Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition will not oppose it tonight. However, we need to understand the Minister&#146;s precise rationale for bringing it forward. I put my questions to him in a spirit of honest intellectual inquiry, but I repeat that Conservative Members do not oppose the order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80715-0013.htm_para5"><a name="080715108000173">It might be useful to recap some of Hezbollah&#146;s history, and to say how it comes about that we are debating the proscription of the whole of its military wing in this country. Hezbollah is a political and military organisation. The group was first formed in response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. The group&#146;s military wing, The Islamic Resistance, is believed to have between 500 and 600 full-time fighters&#151;some estimates put the number considerably higher&#151;and to be able to call on many more thousands of reserves. During the 2006 conflict in Lebanon, Hezbollah showed that it is armed with rockets that can reach into northern Israel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80715-0013.htm_para6"><a name="080715108000174">Hezbollah is known or suspected to have been involved in anti-western and anti-Israeli terrorist attacks, including the suicide truck bombings of the US embassy and the marines&#146; barracks in Beirut in 1983, the bombing of the US embassy annexe in Beirut in September 1984, and the attacks on the Israeli embassy in Argentina in 1992 and on an Israeli cultural centre in that same country in 1994. In 2000, Hezbollah operatives captured three Israeli soldiers and kidnapped an Israeli non-combatant. Jane&#146;s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre recently suggested that Hezbollah has a new, additional presence in Iraq, and on 16 April 2008, UN Security Council resolution 1701 was passed, calling for armed militia groups, including the likes of Hezbollah, to disarm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80715-0013.htm_para7"><a name="080715108000175">I turn briefly to this Government&#146;s history of proscribing parts of Hezbollah&#146;s military wing. In March 2001, the Hezbollah External Security Organisation, part of the broader military wing of Hezbollah, was added to the list of proscribed organisations under the Terrorism Act 2000. The order before us, which was laid before Parliament on 2 July, proscribes the military wing of Hezbollah in its entirety; that is the change to which we are invited to accede today. The military wing of Hezbollah includes the Jihad Council and all units reporting to it, including the Hezbollah External Security Organisation.</p>

 The reason why I am asking questions is that although we might debate the issues in the House in isolation from what is happening in the middle east, Israel and Hezbollah are currently negotiating a very complicated prisoner exchange. Both sides are having to deal with people who find it very uncomfortable to deal with each other. Does my hon. Friend believe that the order will make that negotiation easier or more difficult?</p>

It might interest him to know that I was in Damascus during the Whitsun recess with Members from both sides of the House, and heard about the delicate, vital negotiations to which he refers, and which we hope will lead to peace. I venture no view on whether the order will make peace more or less likely, but I hope that he will give us his views on the subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="80715-0013.htm_para8"><a name="080715108000178">With your permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I should like to ask the Minister some questions that might assist my right hon. and learned Friend to understand what lies behind the order, and exactly why the Government seek an extension to ban the entire military wing at this particular time, and in this particular way. So that the Minister does not misinterpret what I say&#151;not that he ever does that, although some people think that he misinterprets what I say on a range of security and policing issues&#151;I repeat that we do not oppose the order, so he must not take my questions as an indication of scepticism about the intent of Her Majesty&#146;s Government.

In those two cases, Her Majesty&#146;s Government decided to proscribe the whole organisation&#151;that is, both the political and the military parts. On what basis did the Government decide to proscribe, in this order, just the military wing of Hezbollah?

 I am happy to intervene. The hon. Gentleman has raised a number of points that I hope to raise if I catch Madam Deputy Speaker&#146;s eye. The fact is that, previously, proscription has affected not just a part of an organisation, but the whole organisation, and also any groups that may be from the same area. For example, the British Tamils Forum, which is not a supporter of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and does not campaign for it, is affected by the decision that the Government have taken on proscription, so the hon. Gentleman is right to raise those points, and I agree with him.</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. I do not wish to engage in too much high-flown metaphysical analysis, because we are not here to do that. However, I hope that the Minister will address his point, which was also mine&#151;that is, how, in the context of the order, do the Government define the political and social wing of the organisation and how do they define its military wing? That is an important practical, rather than metaphysical, distinction that the order draws for us, whether we like it or not. The order is about separating out Hezbollah&#146;s military wing in its entirety from its political and social wing. As an honest seeker after truth, I am not clear about how the Government have come to make that distinction. I am sure that the Minister has a good answer; he is well briefed and an intelligent man. If he could enlighten us, we Conservatives would be grateful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="80715-0013.htm_para15"><a name="080715108000189">My next point follows on from that issue. Will the Minister share with us the evidence in his possession about Hezbollah&#146;s fundraising activities in the United Kingdom? Are the Government and their agencies taking any steps to identify any such activity? As the order falls short of proscribing the whole organisation&#151;political, social and military&#151;has the Minister considered whether there is a risk of the fundraising for political purposes, which will be legal even if the order goes through, being diverted to Hezbollah&#146;s military activities? I am thinking about the political wing of Hezbollah, a non-proscribed organisation, raising funds quite legitimately after the order has gone through but passing money to the military wing, which will be proscribed by the order. It seems an obvious point, so what thoughts does the Minister have on it? What consideration has been given to the possibility of people getting around the proscription order?</p>

 When we debated this issue in 2001, I recall advocating that the then ban on Hezbollah&#151;on the external security organisation, as it then was&#151;did not go far enough, and that, as has just been suggested, we had to proscribe Hezbollah entirely, in all its shapes and forms.</p>

Friend the Minister is proposing today, as it would include the entire military wing of Hezbollah. However, its political and social wings will not be proscribed and that does not reflect the true operational structure of the organisation. As has been said in interventions, other organisations such as the LTTE and the PKK have been banned in their entirety because of the difficulty of separating out their respective forms of activity. That applies in the same way, if not more so, in relation to Hezbollah. The Hezbollah founding manifesto of 1985 makes it clear that the organisation operates under one common command structure and shares the same goals:</p>

But I can say that no differentiation is to be made between the military wing and the political wing of Hezbollah.&#148;</p>

To try to draw a distinction between its social, political and military activities is, in my view, to draw a false distinction&#151;a point that I made back in 2001.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80715-0013.htm_para26"><a name="080715108000201">Obviously, I am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Minister has introduced the order to extend the proscription to all aspects of Hezbollah&#146;s military wing. He has made a good case in showing the mounting evidence that the military wing has been providing active support to terrorists in Iraq, including in training in the use of improvised explosive devices. He has also shown evidence that the organisation has been supporting Palestinian terrorist groups in the west bank and Gaza, and organisations such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The case in relation to the military wing is absolutely clear, but we must not try to draw a false distinction. The Shura council, the organisation&#146;s executive board, is in command of Hezbollah&#146;s military and terrorist operations and its social and political activities. Hezbollah operates social programmes in Lebanon, for example, but those are used to rally support among the sections of the population who depend on Hezbollah handouts because of inadequate state provision in those parts of the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80715-0013.htm_para27"><a name="080715108000202">As was hinted at by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), funds raised by Hezbollah for such social programmes are often diverted into other parts of the organisation, including its military branches, to help to fund terrorist attacks. That should not come as a surprise to any of us, because that is the nature of terrorist organisations, whether in relation to the PKK, the LTTE or the Irish terrorism that we saw in the 1970s. People went around rattling the tins for the prisoners or whoever it happened to be, but we all knew where it was going to end up. As we have proscribed Hamas in its entirety, we should follow suit in the case of Hezbollah, despite the fact that it also provides these social functions and fields candidates for political office, as in the 2006 Palestinian elections. We would not be isolated in that. The United States, Canada and the Netherlands have proscribed Hezbollah in its entirety, as has Israel, but that has not prevented the sensitive negotiations between Israel and Hezbollah on prisoner exchange.</p>

the disarmament of the group in the wake of the Lebanon war of a couple of years ago. The new political agreement that has been brokered in Lebanon allows Hezbollah to retain arms as long as they are not used to resolve internal political conflicts in Lebanon. Well, we will believe that if we see it. Although the Lebanese Government may no longer be a target, Hezbollah can continue to build its weapons arsenal for use against Israel in future. The Israeli security cabinet heard that Hezbollah now has an arsenal of some 40,000 rockets ready to be fired at Israel, which is three times more than two years ago at the start of the second Lebanon war.</p>

 On the same day that this order to proscribe the military wing of Hezbollah was published, the Prime Minister told the House that it was solely on the grounds of new evidence of its involvement in terrorism in Iraq and the occupied Palestinian territories. Of course, we all utterly condemn the violent and terrorist activities that are conducted by Hezbollah. I say to the Minister at the outset that Liberal Democrat Members are in broad agreement with the Government&#146;s decision to introduce the order. However, I would like to pose a few questions to probe their motivation in doing this and get a little more information so that the House can come to a clear decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80715-0014.htm_para2"><a name="080715108000206">It would be helpful to have more of an outline of why this change in legislation has come about now. What specific activities undertaken by Hezbollah have prompted it? I appreciate the sensitive nature of the issue, but it would be advisable for the House to have the maximum information possible. I think that the Minister said&#151;I hope that he will confirm and clarify this&#151;that some of the intelligence had been confirmed following the apprehension of a senior individual on 20 March 2007. If so, why has it taken more than a year for the Government to get to the stage of bringing this order before the House? Is it just because the information was gleaned from the individual only recently, or have there been delays for some other reason? On the same day that the order was announced, <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> reported that some Iraqi MPs had accused Hezbollah of planning and supervising the kidnapping of five British citizens from the Iraqi Finance Ministry in Baghdad in May 2007. Does the Minister have any reflections on the coincidence of those two events and whether they were related?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80715-0014.htm_para3"><a name="080715108000207">While the activities of terrorist organisations must of course be condemned, the Government cannot entirely escape criticism for their role in creating conditions in which terrorism can thrive.

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80715-0014.htm_para4"><a name="080715108000208">Several right hon. and hon. Members raised the issue of definitions. I, for one, welcome the Minister&#146;s assurance that the political, social and humanitarian activities will be unaffected, but defining those will prove very difficult, and I would welcome clarification from him as to how that would work in practice. Hezbollah is a highly opaque organisation. It cannot even have bank accounts in its own name, so its finances run through sister organisations funnelling money to a central structure, where it then reaches the military, political and other arms. Finding any conclusive proof that financial support given to Hezbollah from a UK donor has paid for arms rather than social projects will be an incredibly difficult exercise. Last week, a lawsuit was filed in the US district court in Manhattan by Israeli victims of rocket attacks who are seeking $100 million-worth of damages from five Lebanese banks that they accuse of helping to fund Hezbollah during the 2006 war. At that time, horrified by the pictures of the humanitarian problems on our screens, many people gave donations to the relief effort for legitimate charitable purposes and out of a genuine desire to help the people of Lebanon. That case raises problems about how any individuals or institutions that provided financial backing to Hezbollah would be dealt with under similar circumstances in future. Contributors to genuine charitable causes should not be at risk of prosecution for supporting a terrorist organisation. I hope that the Minister can expand a bit further on how the question of definition will be resolved.</p>

 The hon. Lady is right to address the consequences of proscription. No matter how bad this organisation is, others who support general, charitable causes will be caught within the overall net of what is proposed. Does she agree that there is a general lack of clarity on the issue of proscription and on what other organisations, perhaps not associated with this one, are involved with in supporting the general cause of peace in the middle east?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman has a great deal of experience in these matters through his chairmanship of the Home Affairs Committee. My point is that greater clarity is required about Hezbollah and its different arms, partly so that innocent people are not caught out unfairly by the legislation. I am sure that that is not the Government&#146;s intention, but I would welcome some clarification as to how they propose to get round these difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80715-0014.htm_para5"><a name="080715108000211">Under the existing terrorism legislation, there have been no prosecutions of Hezbollah-connected militants in this country.

Have there been any Hezbollah supporters in this country who should have been prosecuted but have escaped as a result of the different definition?</p>

 The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson), like the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), raised important points concerning the whole question of proscription and its implications. It is right that Parliament should scrutinise such important decisions. Even though this order will quite rightly go through the House unchallenged tonight, it is the scrutiny that Parliament gives to such orders and legislation that is so vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80715-0014.htm_para7"><a name="080715108000214">Following the aftermath of what happened in New York and what happened in London just a few years ago, there is tendency to rush to make decisions and for Parliament to reflect on the consequences afterwards. I do not think that the Government have done that in this case, and I fully support what the Minister said about the organisation in question. In many cases, those of us who are not experts in this field&#151;although I chair the Select Committee on Home Affairs, I do not regard myself as an expert on this matter&#151;do not possess the kind of information and security intelligence that the Minister has. I accept what he says, therefore, and I take it on faith. It is a quiet Tuesday evening, there are not huge numbers of Members in the House, and the order will go through unchallenged by a vote, but the danger is that we will make a decision and look at the implications afterwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80715-0014.htm_para8"><a name="080715108000215">The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds was right to talk about the draconian effects of proscription. As we can tell from the word itself, proscription cannot be anything other than the most serious judgment on the activities of a particular group. My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), who follows these matters more closely than I do because of his great constituency interests, is able to reel off information about Hezbollah, which I certainly did not know, concerning who sits on its councils and what they do. The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire picked up the information that the organisation does not even have bank accounts, but transfers its money between various sister organisations. All of that adds to the weight of knowledge that we, as parliamentarians, have.</p>

The Minister knows about the issue of proscription, because I have raised it with him, and its effect on law-abiding citizens of this country who do not support the terrorist activities of organisations abroad, but believe in the wider cause. The example of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam was raised, quite rightly, by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds. I have about 10,000 members of the Tamil community, and many Muslims, in my constituency, who would be very interested in what Hezbollah is doing in the middle east. I have many constituents who are concerned about the peace process.

Of course they were not; we do not support terrorism. But they are events that concern members of the British Tamil community, who will be affected by the general nature of proscription. That is why clarity is so vital when we are affecting the rights of British citizens. I am surprised to some extent by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, who is the chairman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. He is always very eager to talk about human rights, but should remember from his former profession as a lawyer that it is important to preserve the rights of individuals who are not supporters of such organisations, but somehow get caught in the wider net thrown around them because they attend or give at a charitable event, as the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="80715-0014.htm_para11"><a name="080715108000218">On Saturday, the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), who leads for the Liberal Democrats on foreign affairs, the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling), who was a Conservative MP but is now independent, my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh), who is a member of the Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Ms Butler) and the former Prime Minister of Kosovo were all at a meeting in Mitcham, attended by 40,000 members of the Tamil community, to talk about the situation in Sri Lanka. The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott), was not present, but had a letter read out at the event. The LTTE is a proscribed organisation, but the Tamil organisation is not. Police officers were there filming what was going on. I went up to a number of them, just to reassure them that nothing was out of order. The problem with orders of this kind is that they have implications far beyond what the Government intend&#151;implications that affect law-abiding British citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="80715-0014.htm_para12"><a name="080715108000219">The last time I attended such an event, I was told by the Metropolitan police that those in every organisation had to sign a piece of paper, invented just before the meeting, confirming that they would not carry out various activities there. I said, &#147;How can you just produce this piece of paper? These are law-abiding British citizens. In my 21 years in Parliament, I have never heard of British citizens attending a meeting being made to sign pieces of paper about what will happen there in advance of it happening.&#148; My office was told by the police officer that this was now standard practice in view of the proscription that had been decided by Parliament.

people of Arab origin living in the United Kingdom&#151;individuals and extended families. Some have indefinite leave to remain, and some are British citizens. Many take part in different organisational activities to do with the middle east, and are concerned about what happens there. Where is the demarcation line for those people?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80715-0014.htm_para14"><a name="080715108000221">My second point was just made to me, outside the Chamber, by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. I told him that I would be mentioning him in my speech, and he reminded me that the Government&#146;s original order to proscribe 25 organisations was unamendable. No Member could amend that list, so we could not raise concerns about the implications of the order for law-abiding constituents who did not support terrorism. They want to support the Government in all that they do, as in the excellent work they have done in the past 11 years in trying to suppress terrorism. We could not amend that order, however, and there has never been an opportunity for us to do so. Of course, in future, the Committee of my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon or the Home Affairs Committee might look at the matter of proscription. However, as things stand, unless an order of this kind is brought before the House, there is no way in which we can scrutinise what the Government are doing in this area or offer fresh information about the implications that such actions have for law-abiding citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80715-0014.htm_para15"><a name="080715108000222">My next point is about challenging proscription. I raised it with the Opposition spokesperson and he rightly said that he wished to concentrate on other matters in his speech, but I hope that the House will consider the subject in future. When an organisation wishes to challenge proscription&#151;the Government have recently lost a case in the courts; an order was passed a few weeks ago when the Government had to come to the House and implement the court&#146;s decision&#151;there is no hard and fast, robust way in which to do that. I know that because a meeting was held with the former Home Secretary during which members of the Tamil community asked what they could do so that a distinction could be made between those who wished to pursue terrorist ends and those, like those members of the community, who did not, but wanted to speak about the genuine carnage and violence that is happening in parts of Sri Lanka and to return to the negotiating table, which was so vital to the progress of peace in that troubled and beautiful island. The then Home Secretary said that there were no procedures, rules or guidelines. All that an organisation had to do was write to the Home Secretary and that would trigger a look at proscription.

I hope that the Minister will address that when he responds to the debate. What other way is there, other than writing to the Home Secretary and, when she says that the proscription cannot be lifted&#151;I would be amazed if she wrote back and said yes to any of the organisations that she or her predecessors have proscribed&#151;going to court?

I welcome the Tamil community&#146;s actions in the past few years in politicising themselves and lobbying Members of Parliament.

However, I part company with him on the notion that there is anything but clarity in the 2000 Act about de-proscribing. Let me briefly describe our experience with the People&#146;s Mujahedeen Organisation of Iran. A collective&#151;if I may use that phrase&#151;of Members of this House and the House of Lords took the case for de-proscription to the Home Secretary. I understand that anyone is free to do that, but in the case that I am considering, it was a significant group of Members of this House and the other place. The Home Secretary, in her wisdom, said&#151;I still believe rightly&#151;that we would not de-proscribe. The principals involved then rightly took the matter to the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission, not straight to a court of law. The commission, in its wisdom, said that the People&#146;s Mujahedeen Organisation of Iran should be de-proscribed.  <br>

My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary then took the case to the courts and lost. In the narrowest terms, the process is clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="80715-0014.htm_para20"><a name="0807163000015">There are problems with organisations that are loosely associated, or not at all associated, with the principal proscribed organisations, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East mentioned. The law deals with some, but others are in a greyer area. My right hon. Friend knows that the second form of proscription undergoes a different parliamentary process and involves laying an order, which is subject to the negative resolution procedure. That happens when the organisation that we wish to proscribe is an adjunct to the original proscribed organisation, which might be described as the precursor. For example, the PKK was proscribed and Kongra-Gel was seen as simply another element of the same terrorist organisation. The latter was proscribed through negative rather than affirmative order, because we could establish evidential connections.</p>

 I am not clear about my right hon. Friend&#146;s comments about the case of the People&#146;s Mujahedeen Organisation of Iran. Obviously, de-proscription is almost as important as proscription when people feel that they are subject to an unfair restriction. Is my right hon. Friend saying that, to get an organisation de-proscribed, Members of this House and the House of Lords must approach the Home Secretary? I did not envisage that when I read the vague rules that currently exist on de-proscription.</p>

<p><a name="st_o231"><a name="0807163000017"><a name="80715-0014.htm_spnew6"><a name="0807163000171"><b>Mr. McNulty:</b>
 Absolutely not. In the first instance, anyone who objects to proscription can write to the Home Secretary asking for an organisation to be de-proscribed. I made the point about the PMOI because it is the most recent, if not the only, case of de-proscription that was not done by Government but because a group of Members of this House and peers took up the cudgels for it. However, there is no parliamentary process whereby Members of Parliament and peers have to do that. An organisation or anyone who feels that they have been affected by an organisation&#146;s proscription may apply in writing to the Secretary of State for the organisation to be de-proscribed. That happened in the case of the PMOI.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="80715-0014.htm_para21"><a name="0807163000018">As I said, if the Secretary of State refuses the application, the applicant may appeal to POAC. When hearing an appeal, the commission consists of a panel of three members, at least one of whom holds or has held high judicial office. POAC sits in public, save when considering material whose disclosure is contrary to the public interest. The closed session with special advocates enables POAC to consider material that would be the subject of public interest immunity in ordinary High Court proceedings. The special advocate sees the sensitive material and can make submissions upon it. It is perfectly right and proper that the de-proscription process should be as clear as the proscription process, which is the subject of today&#146;s order.</p>

 My right hon. Friend will know from his constituency of Harrow, East, which has a large and diverse community, how important it is to get the message across. We are talking about a core responsibility of Government, so what engagement is or has been proposed with those community groups that may be loosely associated with any of the organisations that I have mentioned&#151;for example, Hezbollah, those who support the middle east peace process, or those in the Tamil community who support peace in Sri Lanka&#151;to get that message across, rather than leaving it to community members to work out that they cannot be involved in such activities? I described how difficult it was when such organisations tried to arrange meetings, because they are not au fait with the various minutiae of the law.</p>

 I take my right hon. Friend&#146;s point, but I repeat: there is at least a degree of responsibility on those organisations to ensure that they are au fait with the law and that they are not intent on supporting organisations that have a terrorist bent, whether proscribed or otherwise.</p>

That happens regularly. On the specific threat that we face from violent extremism, my right hon. Friend will know, too, that there are a range of issues&#151;principally involving DCLG, but also involving the police, under our broad prevent agenda&#151;on which we are doing precisely that kind of work, albeit in a more sustained and focused way, particularly in respect of the Islamist or jihadist threat that we face.</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes an important point about organisations being able to show that they are distinct from proscribed organisations. My right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) used the example of the Tamil community. The reports that I heard of the event that he attended were very worrying indeed. It may sound very innocent that children had their faces painted as tigers, but more importantly, I heard reports of banners and posters being put up that supported the LTTE operation. My right hon. Friend ought to be aware that there are significant differences in the Tamil community over the LTTE.

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="80715-0015.htm_para2"><a name="0807163000025">My hon. Friend is factually inaccurate about the United Kingdom. We have not banned Hamas in its entirety; we have banned, as we are doing this evening, only the military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassem Brigades, not the whole thing, for the same reason. However, my hon. Friend is quite right that in some contexts at least&#151;certainly at the EU level&#151;the entire organisation is effectively banned, through asset freezing and other dimensions. It is important, too, that, on the broader issue of finance, which hon. Members have raised, we deal with organisations at either UN or EU level, or via the proscribed list, through asset freezing, where possible and if identified, and by notifying all financial and banking institutions, not least in respect of their dealings with charities, that they are under an obligation to refer to us any suspicious activities involving the movement of funds that may or may not be destined for organisations on the proscribed list.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="80715-0015.htm_para3"><a name="0807163000026">The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) is entirely right to say that that is not easy. There are often myriad accounts, addresses and organisations, but in the normal course of things, it is our job&#151;the job of the authorities&#151;to try to chase the money, to see whether it gets to any proscribed organisations and then to deal with it in the appropriate fashion. However, the task is not straightforward. A proscription order is not a magic wand that makes things any easier. The Charity Commission is clear what its responsibilities are in that regard, as are the financial and other regulatory authorities, but the hon. Lady made an entirely fair point.</p>

 The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire raised an important point, which goes back to something that my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) said. I will not go into detail about the meeting at the weekend, but there were also some young children with lions painted on their faces, too&#151;I saw one. But anyway, let us put that to one side. If someone gives some money in good faith to a charitable cause associated with peace in the middle east and, to take the example that the hon. Lady gave, it ends up, through myriad transactions, somewhere that was not intended by the person who originally gave it, surely that person should in no way be held responsible.</p>

 That is right, and that is reflected in the law, but the key phrase is &#147;in good faith&#148;. Where the organisation&#151;the charity or whatever else&#151;is clearly directly associated with a proscribed organisation or where it is well established that the organisation is a front, or even where it is proscribed itself, the responsibility is on individuals to establish, effectively, the bona fides of that organisation. However, if someone gives a contribution in good faith, it is not for the authorities, some 24 iterations or otherwise down the line, if we follow the money, to ensure that the original donor is pursued. That is not the purpose of the law at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80715-0015.htm_para6"><a name="0807163000031">The right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram), who is no longer in his place, was quite right to ask in terms, as did other hon. Members, not only why we should ban just the military wing and not the whole organisation&#151;that is a perfectly fair point, which I hope I am addressing&#151;but why, given what is happening in the middle east, not least in Lebanon, we are proscribing it at all. Those are both fair points, and I hope that I have addressed them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80715-0015.htm_para7"><a name="0807163000032">We recognise that the political wing of Hezbollah and the political organisation provide a social and humanitarian function in Lebanon. To an established extent, they make positive contributions to Lebanon and other places. In keeping with a whole range of United Nations Security Council resolutions, they provide a positive function in Lebanon and other parts of the middle east. It is to be hoped that the strength of those social and political wings would obviate the need for the military wing to do anything in the first place. We cannot reach a position in which the United Kingdom and others call on Hezbollah to disarm and participate in Lebanese politics as a democratic and peaceful political party&#151;in line with UN Security Council resolutions 1559, 1680 and 1701&#151;and then somehow put obstructions in its way to prevent it from doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80715-0015.htm_para8"><a name="0807163000033">I believe that there is a fine balance between the military and other elements of Hezbollah but, in this instance at least, my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon is misguided in seeking to ban the whole organisation. I do not think that it is sufficient to say that anything to do with Hezbollah is terrorist, period. We recognise that there is sharp distinction between the two parts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80715-0015.htm_para9"><a name="0807163000034">Colleagues have asked me to go into much more depth about the evidence. I am a fair person&#151;I think&#151;and I have tried to outline as much evidence as I could in my opening speech. Were there substantially more evidence for me to share with the House, I would have done so. The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire asked why we were introducing the measure now, when the key piece of information that I was able to relay concerned March 2007. I would simply say that we do not take these decisions lightly, and we have to take careful consideration of all the available evidence. I can assure her, however, that the decision is not related to recent events in Lebanon, and certainly not to the coincidence that happened on 2 July in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80715-0015.htm_para10"><a name="0807163000035">There is a wide range of international positions on Hezbollah. As I have said, some countries, including the USA, Canada, and the Netherlands, proscribe the entire organisation. Australia proscribes the External Security Organisation only, while others, such as France, do not proscribe any part of the organisation at all. As I said earlier, I cannot go into any more detail on the evidence. The ability of organisation so proscribed to be de-proscribed involves a clear and fair process, although I will take on board the points made by my right hon.

 I want to start by welcoming the draft Heritage Protection Bill. The Bill aims to set out the legislative framework for a more unified and simpler heritage protection system that will be more open, accountable and transparent. I am pleased that the Bill has been designed to provide more opportunities for public involvement and community engagement in understanding, preserving and managing our heritage. These are laudable aims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80715-0015.htm_para20"><a name="0807163000049">The benefits of the reforms, as set out in the Bill, are that they will enable us to preserve the historic environment and to manage its transition to the future. My main concern tonight is to ensure that, when it comes to protecting buildings, there is a balance between the past and the future. We must not let our desire to cherish and protect the past jeopardise building for future generations. I believe that more consideration should be given to wider economic and regeneration issues in the listing or designating of buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80715-0015.htm_para21"><a name="0807163000050">At the moment, the criteria to which English Heritage has regard in determining whether to recommend that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport should list a building are the architectural and historic value of the building. The majority of listings are carried out in response to applications for individual buildings, which can be made by any individual or organisation. In addition to the listing work that is undertaken in response to applications, English Heritage also undertakes some thematic reviews of particular types of building. For example, in the 1990s, the textile mills of Greater Manchester were looked at in this way, and about five years ago cinemas across the whole of England were examined as a whole.</p>

 In my constituency, we have the world&#146;s only listed pigeon cree&#151;or loft, as they are commonly known. Does my hon.

 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend, who I know has campaigned on this issue for a long time. I am sure that the Minister will have heard his fervent plea.</p>

However, the decision to designate will still be made on the basis of special architectural, historic or archaeological interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para0"><a name="0807163000054">During consideration of this draft legislation, I would like other subsidiary criteria such as economic regeneration plans debated and taken into consideration before a recommendation is made to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport for a building to be designated or listed. Recent frustrating experiences in my own constituency of Stockport have led me to that view. May I make it clear that I am not making any criticisms of the individuals  <br>

involved? I would like to thank Henry Owen-Jones from English Heritage for his help. The criticisms that follow are of the system itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para1"><a name="0807163000055">Those experiences have made me believe that the designating of buildings should be more specific and spell out exactly what should be retained in any future developments. For example, clear descriptions of the materials to be used would enable future developers to tie down and contain costs and know from the beginning exactly what was required of them and how much it would cost. That would prevent expensive proposals from emerging at a later stage, often during informal pre-application discussions with English Heritage, which can severely hold up building projects or indeed jeopardise them altogether.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para2"><a name="0807163000056">As I have explained, my interest in this whole issue arose out of tensions between heritage and regeneration in a multi-million pound development of Stockport college&#146;s town centre campus in respect of one particular building. The new campus is to be on the site of the old St. Thomas&#146;s hospital, the buildings of which have fallen into disrepair since the hospital was closed. The building in question, called merely &#147;building 25&#148;, was not a listed building, but because it fell within the curtilage of the principal listed structure, it was regarded as listed. It was attached to a listed building.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para3"><a name="0807163000057">The problem was that English Heritage wanted to keep building 25, but Stockport college did not want to keep it. The college did not think it had any value for its vision of a 21st century educational facility and believed that its retention would compromise the design of the front aspect of its new college campus. As the building was riddled with asbestos, restoration would add further expense to the project. The college had already spent &#163;11.217 million on the refurbishment of listed buildings as a result of pre-planning meetings with English Heritage. As the cost of refurbishment of listed buildings is 16 per cent. higher than the cost of new build, the excess costs were &#163;1.53 million. The college did not want building 25, and the proposed alternatives of boarding it up or selling it were not ones that the college considered to be viable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para4"><a name="0807163000058">The college recognised the historical significance of the two listed buildings, but felt that building 25 detracted from the overall scheme. The frustration for the college was that it was always trying to discuss matters against a background of historical significance, irrespective of cost to its budget or the need to cater for 21st century learners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para5"><a name="0807163000059">From a heritage point of view, the college was keeping the best of the site, spending a lot of money on buildings that had hitherto been left to decay with little or no interest from anyone. It was also bringing a &#163;55 million regeneration scheme to Stockport and simply could not go on investing in buildings for which it had no use and that it felt would serve no educational purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para6"><a name="0807163000060">English Heritage first advised Stockport council that it wanted to keep building 25 during pre-application advice meetings, and argument went on for months. The college spent &#163;145,032 preparing a case for  demolition, employing specialists in this field and commissioning architectural surveys to respond to English Heritage&#146;s aspirations for the site as a whole. The college  <br>

purchased the site in March and the estimated delay, due to the involvement of English Heritage, is likely to be 12 months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para7"><a name="0807163000061">The whole affair has added other costs to the project, including &#163;37,500 in staff time and &#163;117,000 in interest costs. It also had a major consequence for the college&#146;s cash flow as it delayed Learning and Skills Council approval and the subsequent grants by almost a year. Ironically, English Heritage did not in the end formally object to the planning application submitted by the college, which involved the demolition of building 25.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para8"><a name="0807163000062">From my involvement, which included several meetings with English Heritage, the Government office for the north-west and council officers, it became clear to me that if a building is listed but alongside that listing there is no description of the work that has to be done to preserve its heritage aspects, the developers cannot possibly know the costs that they might incur and, even worse, those costs will become clear only from advice by either local conservation officers from the council or the local representative from English Heritage. That organisation, of course, will be concerned to improve the heritage aspects, but doing so does not come out of its budget; every helpful piece of advice usually costs somebody else money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para9"><a name="0807163000063">The other difficulty, of course, is that it is not often clear to the recipient of the advice from English Heritage what the status of the advice is. It was clear from my involvement that the college was certainly under the impression that English Heritage was able to exercise some kind of veto on the planning application if its advice were not accepted. That, of course, is not the case. I think there is a need for a much more transparent process for striking a balance between heritage and the need to make buildings fit for the purpose for which they are developed. If, when buildings were listed, the listing were accompanied by descriptions of features that had to be retained, together with acceptable materials for restoration, developers would have a clearer idea of the costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para10"><a name="0807163000064">In arriving at such descriptions, some regard needs to be paid to the future use of the building. For example, it is important that we provide affordable housing, but if old buildings are to be converted to flats, every extra cost imposed to meet heritage standards will affect the affordability of the housing. I understand the value of heritage, but it is also important to make buildings fit for purpose in the coming century, so we need an approach to heritage and the listing of buildings that takes that into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para11"><a name="0807163000065">I was also concerned that money intended for further education and other public services was being disproportionately spent on buildings that had no national significance, although they had local listings, and, indeed, on buildings that were not themselves listed, but were attached to listed buildings. I do not think it right that money intended for educating young people should be spent on heritage, and there is a case to be made for having separate heritage budgets that can support such restoration work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para12"><a name="0807163000066">I am also convinced of the need for such a separate budget by another example in my constituency that involves the derelict St George&#146;s Church of England vicarage and St. George&#146;s Church of England primary school, which are both grade II listed buildings. The Victorian vicarage is set in a large garden and has been  <br>

disused since 2001; it is boarded up because it has major disrepair and structural problems&#151;for example, there is no staircase. Groups of children are trespassing and lighting fires inside, endangering both themselves and the surrounding area&#151;a cause of continual complaints to the local police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para13"><a name="0807163000067">The school and the church diocese want to demolish the vicarage to make space for a much-needed green playing field. At the moment, the pupils have just a concrete playground. However, the conservation officer at Stockport council has told the church vicar that the vicarage windows or doors cannot be broken up or demolished because they are part of a conservation area and English Heritage would object, so we are stuck with a derelict, rotting building that nobody wants, can use or indeed, can properly conserve. That is another example of advice being given at an informal level. The consequences of such advice can be far-reaching. Of course, the Church could put in a planning application that involves demolishing the vicarage, but it is not clear that people understand that this is an option. There is a sense, however unreal, that English Heritage has an automatic veto.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para14"><a name="0807163000068">Meanwhile, the school building itself is in need of some repairs. For example, the roof tiles have recently needed to be replaced. The school governors were told that they had to use a specific quality and colour of slate, and it turned out that the right tiles could be obtained at great expense only from Vermont in the United States. Again, on what basis was that advice given? Where is it said that only those particular tiles could be used? Why should this school use money that was intended for education to buy expensive tiles for something that nobody can see, simply because the building is listed? Surely, when listed buildings are being used, there need to be clear agreements about how the building is to be maintained. The advice should be more transparent, and it should take into account affordability for the user. These sorts of extra hidden costs can come as a shock and can jeopardise the finances and, in some cases, the continuation of projects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para15"><a name="0807163000069">Three lessons have been learned from the examples of Stockport college and St. George&#146;s. First, the criteria for listing buildings should be widened, and more consideration should be given to wider economic and regeneration issues in the listing or designating of buildings. That is particularly important in inner-city and town-centre developments. Secondly, if buildings are listed, the listing should specify exactly what features any future developers would be expected to retain, together with descriptions of the acceptable materials to be used. Thirdly, there should be a separate heritage budget to support such restoration work so that money intended for educating young people, for example, is not diverted away. English Heritage has a statutory obligation to give advice, but with ever more complex applications involving millions of pounds of investment, we need to look again at the process of listing and the balance between heritage, the extent to which developments are fit for purpose and how those decisions are made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para16"><a name="0807163000070">The right balance has to be struck between the future and the past. Many hon. Members will have examples of derelict boarded-up buildings in their constituencies which have stood vacant for years and which no one can afford to renovate. They are not being conserved at all but just being allowed to decay. Is it not ironic that the  <br>

listing itself may be a deterrent to development and may lead to decay and eventual demolition of a building that is so significant that it was listed for preservation? However, unless some account is taken of the possible use of a building in the application for listing, I cannot see how the Bill in its current form is actually going to achieve its objectives of preserving our heritage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para17"><a name="0807163000071">Buildings stand not in the past but in the present. They carry the heritage of the past, but they will not survive unless they can meet the aspirations of the future. Not all can become perfectly preserved museums. They have to be schools, houses or new offices. The process of listing buildings should take account of that, both in the application and when listed.</p>

 I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey) has secured this debate. I am even more delighted that we finished the main business a bit early. I am not going to go on at great length, because I do not need to, but I want to take the opportunity to say a few things about the listing process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para18"><a name="0807163000073">The word &#147;listing&#148; is seared on my brain. Anyone who knows anything about Stroud will know that we take a special joy in the process of listing buildings. The obverse of that is that I have also talked to people who are close to suicide as a result of some of the implications of what happens when the listing process develops a life of its own. It can have all sorts of repercussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para19"><a name="0807163000074">My right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport knows that I take a particular joy in the current proposal for C block of Standish hospital, and I hope that she will do the decent thing and not list it. The idea to list it is, to use a parliamentary term, nuts. It is the wrong sort of building for that. It would stop a perfectly good development on that site, which hopefully will be led by the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para20"><a name="0807163000075">To show that I am not a philistine, I also ask my right hon. Friend to look at the proposal to list the Purton hulks on the River Severn. Those include some wonderful old barges, which were driven into the side of the river to stop its banks eroding. The hulks are of particular interest. I know that we cannot get protection for them at the moment, but hopefully the Bill, which I also welcome, will give us an opportunity to consider something that is of universal importance in the marine world and which we should be doing something about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para21"><a name="0807163000076">At one level, the process of listing is incredibly democratic. Anyone can put a building forward for listing. That is laudable. It is important that we look at the process in its totality, because it is of great importance, as I said. My hon. Friend said that the process was one of apparent transparency. I am a great fan of English Heritage, because it has saved buildings that were in a dire state of repair and in need of proactive intervention. For example, it has paid an awful lot of money to repair the roof of Stanley Mill in my constituency. It is to be congratulated on that. My only criticism of English Heritage is that it sometimes takes rather a long time to respond to applications, which can lead to difficulties because a building is, of course, deteriorating over that time. Uncertainty can be the worst outcome of all. I ask my right hon. Friend to say something about how, in the new legislative world that we are coming into, we can  <br>

speed up the process of listing a building. There are occasions when a silly proposal is made&#151;perhaps even a vexatious one to delay the inevitable development of a site&#151;and we need to deal with that more expeditiously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para22"><a name="0807163000077">In terms of my special interest, the system is fraught with problems if a building has been listed but, over the course of history, some of the reasons for that are not clear and people are left with the problem of how to respond when there is a quite heavy-handed approach. I do not want to cast aspersions on my local authority, but again, anyone who knows anything about Stroud will know that listing is something that we do as a particular joy of life. We take a long time over it and look at applications in considerable detail. However, where those processes take that course, it can be difficult for people who are trying to take forward permitted development. The listing process makes things incredibly complicated and expensive. I hope that the Bill has something to say about that, particularly in view of the joyous phrase &#147;development in the curtilage&#148; of a listed building. Again, that is seared on my brain because it just means, &#147;Look out, chaps. You are going to take an awful long time to get through this, and everybody is going to have an opinion on it, and it is going to take a long time, therefore, to reach some conclusion.&#148; That is not fair to someone who is desperately keen to do something with a particular property.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para23"><a name="0807163000078">Much as I see the process as democratic, and one that should be transparent, I hope that we can sometimes speed things along. It is not much good if we find that the process has resulted in the eventual destruction of a building either because it was too expensive to go through the process or, dare I say, because the building was in such a poor state of repair at the end of the process that all we have done is use the process in an adverse way and failed to foresee how we could have dealt with it differently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para24"><a name="0807163000079">I hope that my right hon. Friend will say some interesting things about what the Bill might do to expedite the process of listing, how we might get the process to be even more transparent&#151;it is, as I said, democratic&#151;and, in particular, how we can list what we should be listing and not list what we should not be listing.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey) on securing the debate. She has made some extremely important points. I do not want to detain the House for long. I was not planning to speak, but as we have a bit of time, I thought I would mention one or two things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para25"><a name="0807163000081">It seems that when the listing notice comes through the letterbox, common sense goes out of the window. We need to get some common sense into the process, which is what my hon. Friend advocated. I suspect that we do not have to look any further than this building to see some of the problems that arise. Our staff struggle to maintain it in accordance with the requirements of English Heritage, which often fly in the face of common sense and what we need to do to make what is, in effect,  <br>

a museum building suitable for a modern Parliament. That is frightening. No one is talking about messing around with the Chamber, but a bit of common sense needs to be applied to how some of the offices and rooms upstairs are maintained and improved, which is prevented by English Heritage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para26"><a name="0807163000082">I want to mention two buildings in my constituency, one of which is not listed and one of which is. The one that is not listed perhaps ought to be, but everyone is frightened of the consequences of going down that route because of what it would mean for its development. The building in question is the officers&#146; mess in Inglis barracks. The barracks have been the home of the Middlesex Regiment for some time. When the regiment moved out, it was replaced by British Forces Post Office. Indeed, Inglis barracks are named after Colonel Inglis, who was a hero of the Peninsula war and gave the Middlesex Regiment his nickname, &#147;The Diehards&#148;, from the battle of Albuera&#151;but I digress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para27"><a name="0807163000083">The officers&#146; mess is a wonderful old building. I am not sure whether it merits listing, but it certainly merits preservation. To its credit, the local authority has been fairly co-operative, but the Army has moved out and the whole site is to be redeveloped to provide at least 2,000, or perhaps 2,500, homes, The question is what is to happen to the wonderful old building at the top of the site. What will happen to the Middlesex war memorial and others nearby? As my hon. Friend implied, if it is listed no developer will be able to make anything of it. It will go to rack and ruin: either it will eventually fall down of its own accord, or it will simply be neglected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para28"><a name="0807163000084">We are left with a wing and a prayer. We hope that when the site is developed, whoever buys that part of it will find a use for it&#151;perhaps as a conference centre&#151;and will be able to preserve it without its having to be listed. We also hope that the local authority and the local community will work together to ensure that it is preserved for functional purposes, but that adjustments may be possible that might not otherwise be possible, for reasons cited by my hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para29"><a name="0807163000085">My second example is of a building that has been listed. My constituency contains the site of the former Hendon aerodrome. I believe that it was the first aerodrome in the country; certainly it is the site of the first aircraft factory, operated by a chap called Claude Grahame-White. It is now the site of the RAF museum and a housing estate. There is also a new development on the last unoccupied part of the estate&#151;formerly known as RAF East Camp, now known as Beaufort Park&#151;and the developer is putting up a couple of thousand houses there as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para30"><a name="0807163000086">The original planning permission for part of the development meant that the then derelict Claude Grahame-White aircraft factory, dating from before the first world war, had to be relocated, lock, stock and barrel, to the RAF museum site. It cost a fortune, and it looks wonderful. The relocation was a magnificent operation. The first world war aircraft collection is housed there&#151;but so is the former RAF watchtower, also a listed building of the highest category. The original plan was for it to remain in the middle of the development and be used as, for instance, a health centre. That idea has fallen through, and the current plan is to move the watchtower to the RAF museum site, which will involve a rather complicated land swap and a very complicated financial arrangement. The developer is putting in the cash.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para31"><a name="0807163000087">The watchtower is almost falling down. It will have to be taken down virtually brick by brick and rebuilt on the site, where it will be used as an education centre. That is a brilliant idea, but English Heritage, perhaps being less co-operative than it might be, is insisting that this derelict building&#151;which will be erected in the middle of a new housing estate, surrounded by big buildings&#151;must be marketed, and marketed in a particular way. The project will take months to complete, with the net result that a very complicated deal could well fall through, although I hope it will not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para32"><a name="0807163000088">There is plenty of good will on the part of the museum, the developers and the local authority to ensure that the deal does not fall through, but it could fall through because of English Heritage&#146;s ridiculous requirement. No one in their right mind would buy a derelict watchtower in the middle of a new housing estate with which nothing can be done. There is a wonderful function planned for it where it belongs, in the middle of our RAF heritage only a couple of hundred yards away, and it would be restored as part of the process rather than being allowed to fall down. Yet we run the risk of the whole scheme falling to pieces&#151;literally&#151;because of the approach that has been adopted. Where has common sense gone? A wonderful historic building in my constituency may not be restored and used for a sensible purpose. Moreover, a site that could be used for significant housing development may not be used for that purpose either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para33"><a name="0807163000089">I think that this is what my hon. Friend was getting at. The current process means that buildings that should be preserved may not be preserved as well as they could be because of developers&#146; fears of what may happen, a point referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew). When a building is listed, all the attendant hassle can be counter-productive in preventing us from preserving our wonderful heritage, which is what we are trying to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80715-0016.htm_para34"><a name="0807163000090">I think that both those constituency examples illustrate the need for a common-sense approach that, unfortunately, seems sometimes to be lacking in the existing process. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will be able to assure us that the new system will allow for such an approach.</p>

Washington &#147;F&#148; Pit museum; Washington old hall, the ancestral home of George Washington; and Penshaw monument, which was built to commemorate Lord Lambton, or Radical Jack as he was known because of his support for the 1832 Reform Act. There are many examples in the constituency where listing has helped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="80715-0017.htm_para2"><a name="0807163000094">It would be remiss of me not to mention the brave campaign of the Ryhope allotment holders, who a decade ago won listed status for their pigeon cree&#151;the world&#146;s only listed pigeon cree. We use the term &#147;cree&#148; in the north-east, but many will know it as a loft. The honourable Tony Banks, a former Member of the House who is no longer with us, supported and secured that listing. I dread to think what would have happened to that early example of a pigeon cree without it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80715-0017.htm_para3"><a name="0807163000095">There has been tremendous support for the cree. The men were particularly heartened on Christmas eve when they held a vigil in support of the pigeon cree, and the Prime Minister congratulated them on the 10th anniversary of its having received listed status. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport visited earlier this year and met the men involved. Last week, I received a letter with American stamps on. When I opened it, I found it was from a Hollywood superstar and his wife, who had appeared in panto in Sunderland and had read about the Christmas eve vigil that we held with local children to support the cree. That letter was from Mickey and Jan Rooney, who are still going strong and who are of a ripe old age. They wrote to me, and via me to the men, to say how much they supported the campaign and that they would be more than keen to do anything that they could to help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="80715-0017.htm_para4"><a name="0807163000096">I have given those examples for a reason. In what is a fast-moving world, particularly for young people, listing and our industrial heritage provide a compass point. There are fewer and fewer things that unite us, because it is a disparate world that we live in. Heritage is incredibly important, not just for the physical representation but for what that physical representation means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="80715-0017.htm_para5"><a name="0807163000097">People see the winding gear at Washington &#147;F&#148; as a symbol. The pit heaps and other traces of our industrial past may have gone, but what lives on through communities is the sense of comradeship and belonging, and the values that were strong in years gone by. That is why I support the Bill that is coming before the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="80715-0017.htm_para6"><a name="0807163000098">There has been an explosion of interest in heritage. It has been great to see locally that miners&#146; banner groups have been formed in Washington and Herrington Burn and are putting on displays. Local people are getting involved. A local school is celebrating its centenary: last week, I visited the John F. Kennedy primary school, where local children have worked with pupils who attended the school in the 1930s and they have all come together to support their heritage. Heritage is important as it can give us that sense of community. In many ways, changes in society mean that we do not always have as strong a sense of community as we had in the past.</p>

acknowledge in the House the excellent work that she does on behalf of her constituency, both in the constituency itself and in representing her constituents&#146; interests in Parliament. I have discussed with her informally on a number of occasions the issues that she has raised formally during the debate. I am pleased that she has been able to put her concerns on the record. We have a draft Heritage Protection Bill, which the Culture, Media and Sport Committee is currently considering, and I hope that it will take into account the comments of the Members who have spoken&#151;none of whom serves on the Committee&#151;when making its representations to Ministers as we take the Bill forward.</p>

Like him, I firmly believe that, at its best, conserving our heritage, including our industrial heritage, is crucial to building strong communities. Sometimes the best of community spirit comes out of celebrating and understanding our past, and of using that to reflect the values of the present and to inform how we think about the future. Heritage, at its best, has a very important role to play in building identity, cohesion, a sense of community and strong communities.</p>

The way in which we designate them is intended to allow the planning system&#151;we will come on to whether or not it works&#151;to protect the buildings and to enable the management of our heritage to be carried out in such a way as to ensure that we leave a legacy for future generations that reflects the strength of our past.</p>

Friends the Members for Stockport, for Stroud (Mr. Drew) and for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), but with particular reference to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport. She talked a lot about the transparency of the system. She then talked about our having a clearer understanding of, on the one hand, the roles and powers of English Heritage, with its responsibilities for listing and the listing system, and on the other, local authority planning departments and officers and what they have to do within the planning framework. She also talked about the importance of English Heritage giving a clearer indication, when it lists, of the implications of listing&#151;the features that would need to be listed and retained, and matters on which it would have a view and on which listed building consent to alter the building would be required. She talked about the importance of subsidiary criteria to which English Heritage should have regard in listing decisions&#151;not just the statutory criteria, which are those of special architectural and historical interest, but also the wider economic and regeneration implications of listing. Finally, she talked about whether we should have a separate heritage budget so that the costs of protecting our heritage are much clearer. I would like to deal with each of those points.</p>

will say to him that I have asked that the relevant health authorities also have the opportunity to put in their representations so that I can balance them against the representations of English Heritage. He raised a number of issues that I shall address. One is the importance of marine heritage assets.

I believe that 12 miles of sea is in the ownership of the Crown, so we have to employ a complicated mechanism to ensure not only that the Crown takes its proper responsibilities, but that it is properly compensated for any work that it has to do in protecting marine heritage assets. I would like to reassure my hon.

 Two different principles are at play here. One hates to see an order made about other people&#146;s property without their knowing about it in the first place, but there is always a risk, given the length of time that the process takes, that if a building owner is told that an application to list a particular property is being made, they might knock the building down before the decision is taken. I believe that that happened in a case relating to Kensington town hall a little while ago. One of the real problems that we face is that there is no stop notice arrangement, whereby once an application has been made, it protects the building from demolition while the process is under way. Perhaps my right hon. Friend might think about providing in her Bill that once an application is made, no action can be taken to knock a building down until the process is completed.</p>

 My hon. Friend takes the words out of my mouth. The way in which we propose to handle that point in the draft Bill is to ensure that the owner is given the right to know that an application to list has been made. We will couple that with a new provision that once an application has been lodged, no action can be taken to demolish or alter the building until consideration of the application has been concluded. Those two new provisions will ensure a much fairer and more democratic&#151;to use the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud&#151;approach.</p>

 If certain owners of buildings that may be listed were given warning, the danger would be that some of our heritage would be lost. Some people just lease out buildings. The people who love buildings, look after them and want them listed are not necessarily those who might want to develop a site. The stop notice would need to be coupled with tough and effective penalties and enforcement measures. A &#163;5,000 fine will mean nothing if a developer stands to make millions of pounds from developing a site.</p>

 That is a very pertinent observation. My officials and I are currently considering how we should modernise the penalty regime to make it relevant to the 21st century through draft clauses for the Bill. I shall take away that thought. Consideration of the draft Heritage Protection Bill will be the first time in a generation that both Houses of Parliament will have the opportunity to consider this hugely important aspect of our environment. We are constantly reflecting on how to achieve a balance among the rights of the individual owners, protecting our heritage and facilitating modern development to encourage buildings that are fit for purpose today.</p>

 My right hon. Friend mentioned how buildings will be designated in the future, and I wish to give her another example. A town such as Stockport will have five or so school buildings from the turn of the last century that are all very similar. An application will be made to list one of those buildings, and it will rightly be listed because of its architectural value. Six months later, another application may be made to list one of the other very similar schools. When applications to list  <br>

buildings are considered, some information should be provided about whether similar buildings in the area have already been listed. The local authority should perhaps be required to consider all similar buildings and make an application for one of them to be listed. Otherwise, five years later all five will have been listed, but they are all the same.</p>

 Some interesting issues emerge as we think about the new regime that we want to bring in to protect our heritage. I have felt in the year for which I have had responsibility for this area of policy that all too often those who are immersed in the world of heritage protection have a distinct view that does not relate to the view of many people with other interests in society.</p>

 I know from personal experience about the elite in heritage protection. As I mentioned earlier, because Tony Banks came and visited the site in my constituency he was able to go back, engage in discussion and ensure that it was listed. If he had not been prepared to make a 600-mile round trip as a serving Minister, to see the site and to talk to the people, I am not sure that things would necessarily have happened that way. Does the Minister agree that the Bill needs to include some sort of process? I hesitate to use the word &#147;re-education&#148;, as it sounds a little Soviet, but there needs to be a wider understanding among the heritage elite that listing is not just about certain types of buildings. It should be about something that represents millions of people, their pastimes and their employment in Britain, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="80715-0017.htm_para13"><a name="0807163000118">There is a real difficulty, which we are debating tonight, with buildings of relatively recent construction. On the whole, buildings are not listed according to a thematic review. One would like to get to a position where English Heritage, as the responsible authority, would decide to look at all the schools in Stockport, all the churches in Hendon or all the pigeon crees in Houghton, and would take a view, looking at the matter thematically, about what we should conserve for future generations. At present, that does not happen. We tend to have a spot-listing system whereby a planning application is submitted to demolish or alter a building and somebody with a heritage interest, usually somebody connected to one of the national organisations that are particularly concerned with heritage matters, will submit an application to list.</p>

 My right hon. Friend made an important point, which she then started to move away from, about the question of very modern buildings, which might be only a few years old. We have some wonderful architects in our country designing some wonderful buildings. One has only to look at the Gherkin, for example, which is one of my favourites. That ought to be a listed building, and perhaps we ought to list it now rather than in a few decades&#146; time. How do we ensure that our wonderful modern architecture is preserved and that we do not simply end up preserving Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian town halls, for example? How do we ensure that we reflect throughout our listing process the full range of our country&#146;s thousands of years of architecture?</p>

 During my preparations for tonight&#146;s debate, I came across Westminster bridge after having visited Stonehenge today, and thought, &#147;I wonder whether anybody has put in an application to list Portcullis House.&#148; I do not know what advice English Heritage would give about that building; I am not allowed to prejudge these matters, as I make the final decision. There are some splendid modern architectural buildings, but the judgment that we have to make, which is much more difficult in relation to relatively recently constructed buildings, is about which buildings will be hugely important and which buildings future generations will want to see so that they can understand what life was like in the 20th and 21st centuries. Those are incredibly difficult judgments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80715-0017.htm_para14"><a name="0807163000121">On the whole, applications for listing, particularly of recently constructed buildings, tend to be for public sector buildings, such as schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80715-0017.htm_para15"><a name="0807163000122">My hon. Friend the Member for Stockport asked an important question about the costs that arise when a building is listed and its conservation thus ensured. No consideration is given to the cost or resource implications of listing; indeed, it would be completely unlawful to take them into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80715-0017.htm_para16"><a name="0807163000123">People in the heritage world say that buildings should be listed only on the basis of their architectural or historic value or special interest. Listed building consent comes through the planning system, and the decision about whether that should be given is the appropriate context for thinking about the economic implications of a decision to maintain, alter or demolish a building.</p>

<p><a name="st_o262"><a name="0807163000124"><a name="80715-0017.htm_spnew15"><a name="0807163000202"><b>Ann Coffey:</b>
 The difficulty is that consequences follow immediately from the decision to list a building. It is strange that when a decision about listing is challenged, it is said to be somebody else&#146;s problem. Surely the intention when listing a building must be to protect it, because it is seen as special. It appears that the very act of listing a building sets off a train of events that means that that building will fall down seven years later because the resource costs of development are too great. The process almost determines that the building will be demolished, not preserved.</p>

<p><a name="st_o263"><a name="0807163000125"><a name="80715-0017.htm_spnew16"><a name="0807163000203"><b>Margaret Hodge:</b>
 My hon. Friend made that point at the start of the debate, and she is right to have done so. The existing legislation contains provisions&#151;we are proposing similar provisions in the draft Heritage Protection Bill&#151;so that in the circumstances that she describes, two things can happen. First of all, grants are available from the Heritage Lottery Fund or English Heritage that can be used to support the maintenance and conservation of buildings. Secondly, the draft Bill provides that either English Heritage or a local authority can take responsibility for carrying out essential repairs to conserve the building. The body involved could either meet those costs or pass them on to the building&#146;s owner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80715-0017.htm_para17"><a name="0807163000126">However, our concern is similar to the one that my hon. Friend expressed earlier, and it is that local authorities may be reluctant to take action to list for fear that the cost of repairing or enhancing the building might have to be borne by local council tax payers.</p>

(Ann Coffey). We have all seen the television programme in which one wonderful building is chosen from each region and then the whole nation votes&#151;that shows how popular this subject is&#151;on which should be preserved. As a result, the other 10 or 11 buildings, or however many of them there are, are left at risk of falling down. The programme shows the state of all the buildings, and how urgent it is to find the money to restore them. However, despite all the publicity and national effort, only one of the wonderful buildings shown in each series can be preserved. How many buildings are simply falling down for lack of money? Might not some other approach&#151;perhaps a lessening of the restrictions&#151;be appropriate? That might allow us to succeed in preserving something of a building, even if not the whole thing.</p>

<p><a name="st_o265"><a name="0807163000128"><a name="80715-0018.htm_spnew1"><a name="0807163000205"><b>Margaret Hodge:</b>
 That is an extremely interesting line of argument. I hope that the Select Committee will have regard to the proceedings of the House this evening when they consider what advice to give me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="80715-0018.htm_para0"><a name="0807163000129">I have been reflecting on a whole range of issues, especially in connection with recently constructed buildings and in particular because so many of them have to be funded through the public purse. Let me take an example that will be familiar to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon. The old London county council fire stations were all constructed at about the same time, and many of them are splendid parts of our English heritage that we would want to conserve. However, there is a little problem: a modern fire engine cannot get into an old LCC fire station. What can we do about that? Clearly, we want future generations to be able to see some of those fire stations, and to see what wonderful, aesthetically pleasing, architecturally well-constructed buildings they are, and what their historic value is&#151;what they add to the community. Clearly some of them can be used for other purposes. They could be, and have been, used to create housing units or flats. However, the chair of the authority with responsibility for the fire service came to see me&#151;I am trying to think what the authority is called.</p>

<p><a name="st_o266"><a name="0807163000130"><a name="80715-0018.htm_spnew2"><a name="0807163000206"><b>Mr. Dismore:</b>
 LFEPA.</p>

<p><a name="st_o267"><a name="0807163000131"><a name="80715-0018.htm_spnew3"><a name="0807163000207"><b>Margaret Hodge:</b>
 It was the previous chair; this was some three or four months ago. She said, rightly, that there were parts of London where the fire authority had looked for an alternative site for a fire station, to ensure the safety of the local population, but were unable to identify such a site. The result of listing old fire stations would therefore be to put at risk the health and safety of residents in London. In those circumstances, the question that we ask ourselves is whether a thematic review could be undertaken of all the fire stations built by the LCC, and whether we could decide on a few that we wanted to list and conserve for future generations, without feeling that we had to conserve the lot.</p>

<p><a name="st_o268"><a name="0807163000132"><a name="80715-0018.htm_spnew4"><a name="0807163000208"><b>Mr. Dismore:</b>
 Again, that is the halfway house argument. What I was saying from a sedentary position is that the name of the organisation is LFEPA, the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority. Surely there are two aspects to this issue. First, there are fire stations that should be preserved pretty much as fire stations, perhaps even as museums. Secondly, there are buildings that are worth preserving, but with a different function. For example, in Hammersmith there is a brand-new fire  <br>

station, and the old fire station has been turned into a bar. The faade and the building are still there, but the building has a different function. It is not preserved in the listed sense, because it has been completely knocked about, but there is still something left of it, although the whole lot has not been preserved.</p>

<p><a name="st_o269"><a name="0807163000133"><a name="80715-0018.htm_spnew5"><a name="0807163000209"><b>Margaret Hodge:</b>
 I agree entirely. I cannot find the words in my notes, but at present one cannot have regard to the fact that there are a number of old fire stations, and that preserving and listing a few would be sufficient for ensuring that future generations could enjoy our current structures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="80715-0018.htm_para1"><a name="0807163000134">My hon. Friend talked about the way in which common sense appears to go out of the window in the listing system, and he gave the example of two buildings in his constituency. I have had to deal with watchtowers in a number of constituencies across England in the past few months. I wonder whether, when derelict buildings become heritage assets, there is a point at which we perhaps take the wrong view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80715-0018.htm_para2"><a name="0807163000135">Let me help with a few facts. There are 2,000 applications every year to list, and 30,000 applications each year for listed building consent. There are only 100 cases a year in which alterations to listed buildings are agreed and buildings are demolished. The system is very slow. English Heritage tries to make a decision within six months, but the process can take longer. As all hon. Members have said, seeking listed building consent is also extremely slow&#151;but there are reasons for the delay. The planning guidance states:</p>
<a name="80715-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="0807163000160"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;once lost, listed buildings cannot be replaced; and they can be robbed of their special interest as surely by unsuitable alteration as by outright demolition.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80715-0018.htm_para3"><a name="0807163000136">I hope that the new system will speed up consideration. We are cutting out the duplication, so English Heritage will make the decision. I hope that the process will be much more transparent, that the owners will be notified and that there will be a much better description, in much more accessible language, of what is being listed and why. That would help. In response to my hon.  <br>

Friend the Member for Stockport, I undertake to look further at how we can improve transparency. I will write to her about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80715-0018.htm_para4"><a name="0807163000137">My hon. Friend talked about the separate roles of those with responsibility for listing&#151;that is, English Heritage representatives&#151;and those who give planning permission for listed building consent. We need to improve the professional and public understanding of those separate roles. I undertake to consider that and see what further work I can do, and I shall come back to my hon. Friend. English Heritage has the information, and I agree with my hon. Friend that in the interests of transparency it should be able to provide it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80715-0018.htm_para5"><a name="0807163000138">We are in much more difficult territory in respect of the criteria for listing. At present, there is a hierarchy of criteria. The statutory criteria relate to historical and architectural interest, and, as we have said, there is no discretion on selectivity. Beneath that lies the planning policy guidance note, which we are reviewing; we will see whether we can have regard to some of the issues raised tonight. Beneath that, English Heritage has introduced selection guides, which provide the technical information demonstrating the features that need to be considered. Again, we can look at that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80715-0018.htm_para6"><a name="0807163000139">However, if hon. Members wish, as they have suggested, to try to alter the statutory criteria, they will need to do so through the process of considering the Heritage Protection Bill. I have to say that that idea would be highly contentious for many other stakeholders in the heritage world. However, this conversation between parliamentarians and that world is important and needs to take place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80715-0018.htm_para7"><a name="0807163000140">My hon. Friend raised the issue of separate accounting. That is pretty difficult, but I have great sympathy with the motivation for it. Why should money set aside for education facilities be used to protect heritage assets? My hon. Friend&#146;s request is fraught with practical difficulties, but I shall have a look at it and come back to her. This debate has been really interesting. I thank hon. Members for their contributions, and I draw my comments to a close.</p>
