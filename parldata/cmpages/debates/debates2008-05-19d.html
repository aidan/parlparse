In 2007, the NAO concluded that GCSE performance in academies had improved compared with that of predecessor schools and that, taking pupils&#146; personal circumstances and prior attainment into account, academies&#146; GCSE performance is substantially better on average than that of other schools.

 Proposals to establish academies are subject to non-statutory local consultation, which would normally include all interested parties, including the parents of children at feeder schools and existing secondary schools.

We will support the council in its decision, but only as long as there is genuine improvement in all three schools in the coming year, particularly in Thomas Lord Audley and Alderman Blaxill.

Is it not the case that, as last week&#146;s legislative programme makes clear, the Government have run out of ideas on school reform, have no clear sense of direction and, as the chief inspector of schools said today, school standards have &#147;stalled&#148;?</p>

We are using academies as an important way to drive up standards and meet the national challenge of getting all schools above the 30 per cent. target.

 The number of places for children in early years provision continues to grow. However, we will clearly watch carefully and talk to child minders about any further decrease in their numbers. Having spoken to many child minders, I am convinced that the decline has nothing to do the EYFS, which is simply what good child minders are already familiar doing: having a flexible, play-based approach to children&#146;s development while they are in their care.

More than that, they are wrong-headed, because this is not about having either health visitors or outreach workers; we need multi-agency teams that include both, as with the excellent co-located services in Ipswich, where health visitors hold clinics and carry out home visits with family support outreach workers. That system is about working together.</p>

 I meet regularly with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health to develop the Government&#146;s programme for improving child health and well-being, which includes a transformation in the provision of short breaks for families with disabled children.</p>

<p><a name="st_o31"><a name="08051912000071"><a name="80519-0002.htm_spnew0"><a name="08051912000430"><b>Mr. Harper:</b>
 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that answer. I am pleased with what his Department has done on this issue and with the money that it has given to local authorities. My county, Gloucestershire, is one of the pathfinders. One of my reasons for asking him to talk to the Department of Health is that the Government committed, in the comprehensive spending review, to the NHS matching the funding that his Department makes available. On investigation, I have found that that just is not the case. In Gloucestershire, the primary care trust got exactly the same rise as every other PCT. Gloucestershire is a pathfinder, but has no extra money to provide the necessary services. Will the Secretary of State talk to his colleague the Health Secretary about putting that right?</p>

<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="08051912000072"><a name="80519-0002.htm_spnew1"><a name="08051912000431"><b>Ed Balls:</b>
 As the hon. Gentleman has said, we are seeing a transformation. There will be a &#163;280 million increase in spending on short breaks in the next three years from my Department, and a further &#163;90 million in capital spending. Local authority by local authority, that will lead to a doubling, on average, of spending on short breaks, and a fivefold increase in some cases. That will be greatly welcomed by families with disabled children for whom short breaks are often a lifeline in the difficult job that they do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="80519-0002.htm_para0"><a name="08051912000073">I fully understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the importance of money being matched through PCTs and the health service, and I have talked to the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), and the Health Secretary about that in detail. The Health Department rightly takes the view that PCTs have a responsibility, area by area, to find money from their overall budgets to match our spending. Such decisions should be for PCTs, but we are clear, nationally, in our Department and in the Health Department, that PCTs must find the money to fund short breaks. They will be held to account by parents, families and, I hope, by hon. Members on both sides of the House if they do not find the money to do that. Our joint health strategy will ensure that that happens.</p>

 At a recent conference in Blackpool, I spoke to parents whose children suffer from various forms of cancer. Children who are disabled because of a life-limiting illness often need respite care&#151;sometimes from health services and sometimes from properly trained social care workers provided by local authorities. Will the Secretary of State ensure, in his discussions with his colleagues in the Health Department, that those families have appropriate, integrated packages to support them through what are often difficult times?</p>

importance of ensuring that we provide guidance and support for parents so that they can navigate what is often, for them, a complex system, in order to deal with their child&#146;s multiple and complex needs. It is important that we do that for all aspects of a child&#146;s care, including short breaks. In the past, respite breaks have often been seen as providing respite for the parents and siblings. In the transformation of short breaks that we are pursuing, we are also trying to achieve a transformation in the experience for the children themselves, and to make the short breaks genuinely fun and enjoyable. For that to happen, the children must get the care that they need, including the health care. That is why my hon. Friend&#146;s point is so valid. I shall be discussing this matter with the Health Secretary as we take forward our joint child health strategy this summer.</p>

 Does the Secretary of State recognise the very special needs of families with children with an autistic spectrum disorder, who are desperately in need of the occasional break? The environment for those children is very specific and must be appropriate to their needs. They thrive on familiarity and often do not respond well to change or to different circumstances, but those breaks are essential, as the Secretary of State has acknowledged, for the parents and siblings as well.</p>

 The hon. Lady is quite right. For all children with a learning disability or a physical disability, a short break can work and be trusted by the parents only if they can be confident that it will provide the care and support that that individual child needs, and that the child will be secure. That is true for children with physical disabilities, but it is also true for children with a learning difficulty such as autism. I have visited the TreeHouse school in north London and seen the intense way in which professionals provide care throughout the day. I have also seen how the parents provide that care all on their own in the mornings and evenings, and during the school holidays. For those parents, a short break is vital, but it must be tailored to the needs of the child.</p>

 All that we can do is to encourage the local authorities concerned, and I am sure that my hon. Friend will be doing everything in her power&#151;including asking this question today&#151;to encourage her local authority to apply for the funding. It is extremely important that when these facilities are put in place the young people themselves are consulted, along with the local community.

 Notwithstanding the admirable efforts by the hon.

Chlamydia rates have risen by 50 per cent. in the north-west over the past five years. Those figures are, sadly, replicated across the rest of the country. Are not the Government failing our young people in that, rather than promoting youth facilities with urgent education programmes to encourage responsible attitudes to sex, drinking and youth crime, they seem more intent on demonising young people yet again by staging desperate stunts with fake hoodies in Crewe?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is wandering rather off piste. Nevertheless, let me deal with the issue of Warrington. I think that the whole House would want to join me in expressing sympathy to the Newlove family in respect of what we all recognise as an appalling case that took place there recently. The key is to work in partnership, nationally and locally, to try to solve these problems. That means that there are local responsibilities as well. We are playing our part nationally with record investment in youth facilities and we will soon publish our new youth alcohol action plan. The Government are doing their bit; it is also necessary for it to happen locally.</p>

 Well, in among that long list of things that we are doing, my hon.

We have 100,000 more than in 1997 achieving the required standard in English and maths, but we need to go further.

 We always say that we need to do better, but I do not agree that progress has stalled. Key stage 2 results are up 17 percentage points from 63 to 80 per cent. in English since 1997, and up 15 percentage points in maths at that stage. At key stage 3, there are similar improvements. We see that across the board. Indeed, reading is a subject that the Conservative party rightly talks about a great deal, and the hon.

One thing that we are doing further to develop the early years of teaching is developing a masters qualification in teaching and learning, so that teaching can become a masters-level profession.

Gentleman&#146;s grammar, but I can tell him that 80 per cent. of pupils are currently leaving primary school having met the national standard in English, while 77 per cent. are leaving having met it in maths.

 Is the Secretary of State&#151;himself no mean cricketer&#151;aware that tomorrow is national schools cricket day? He recently claimed that 90 per cent. of all state schools were offering cricket, which sounds an excellent figure. But is he also aware that the Cricket Foundation, the Government&#146;s designated organisation for delivering grass-roots cricket, discovered in a survey that only 10 per cent. of children actually play cricket in state schools? Are those figures correct? If they are, what will he do to try to get more young children on to the pitch?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is well known for his cricketing skills and interest, and for his work on the all-party group. It was a matter of pleasure for me to see him bowled out in the first over of our game last year, even though those from my side of the House went on to suffer defeat. According to my information, nine out of 10 schools do offer cricket to their pupils, and more than half of all schools have strong links with cricket clubs. We support enthusiastically the work of the Chance to Shine initiative and the national cricket day tomorrow, and I am happy to meet him to discuss the matter further. For the benefit of Members on both sides of the House, the current score is that New Zealand are 187 for four.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I ask your advice about the High Court&#146;s determination on Friday that Members&#146; private home addresses should be published under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 when requests are made. As I have tried to indicate previously in the House, I believe that such a policy would be extremely dangerous in the present security environment, and my belief is shared by Members from all parties in the House. Until now, as the matter has been sub judice, we have understandably been prevented from discussing it in the House. We have not been able to discuss it in the press, because the press is in the driving seat of applications for addresses to be disclosed. What can we do properly to air publicly, in the Chamber or outside, our justified concerns about the security implications of this foolish decision?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80519-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08051912000174">It is said by those who resist the amendment that we can rely on regulation, but we do not believe that regulation is enough. We believe that the move is a step too far and should therefore be banned. Indeed, the Government support the contention that some things are so ethically dangerous that they should be banned. For instance, the Bill will not allow the use of embryos for sex selection or to allow deaf people to have deaf children. Occasionally, the House makes a firm decision that something is ethically wrong. The House long ago decided, for example, that it did not want better to regulate capital punishment; it simply stopped capital punishment. The amendment is a call for these experiments to be banned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80519-0004.htm_para15"><a name="08051912000175">It is said, too, that the embryos will be allowed to live for only 14 days. We do not believe that that answers the point that we are now crossing an entirely new ethical boundary. Many claims have been made for this research. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State cited Lord Winston as a supporter of the Bill. Indeed, Lord Winston is a supporter of the Bill, but he is also a lukewarm supporter of such research. He said:</p>

But if we don&#146;t have that resource, it won&#146;t fundamentally alter the science of stem cell biology.&#148;</p>
</ul>

How wonderful it would be if we had some realistic way of curing them, but there is no overwhelming or large-scale body of scientific evidence that suggests that such research, which crosses the ultimate boundary between animals and humans, will cure anything. That is our point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80519-0004.htm_para19"><a name="08051912000179">My point of view is backed up by a letter written by scientists from &#147;across the world&#148;, to quote the Secretary of State. It was written by Professor Scolding of Bristol, Professor Chopp of Detroit, Professor Franz of Munich, Professor Mackay-Sim of Queensland and Professor Martin of Melbourne and was published in <i> The Times</i> only this Friday. What did it say? It said:</p>
<a name="80519-0004.htm_brev3"><a name="08051912000354"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In particular, given the current state of more conventional embryonic stem-cell research, of adult stem-cell research and induced pluripotent stem-cell research, there is no demonstrable scientific or medical case for insisting on creating, without any clear scientific precedent, a wide spectrum of human-non-human hybrid entities or &#145;human admixed embryos&#146;...As scientists and clinicians actively involved in stem-cell research and regenerative medicine, we do not hold a single common view about the relative merits, ethics and potential of adult v (conventional) embryonic stem cells. But we all believe that extravagant claims regarding the purported merits of human-non-human interspecies embryos are mistaken and misleading, and that such research would damage public confidence and support, to the detriment both of the cause of stem-cell science and, ultimately, of patients.&#148;</p>

That is truly pushing the boundaries, and I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds) has tabled an amendment on that point. It is true that all those creatures have to be destroyed within 14 days and they cannot be implanted in a woman or an animal, but to listen to the press one would think that only cybrids were involved. In fact, the Bill legalises true hybrids, which are genuinely and absolutely 50 per cent. animal and 50 per cent. human.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80519-0004.htm_para23"><a name="08051912000185">It is not entirely true, as we so often read, that cybrids are only 0.1 per cent. animal. Roger Highfield, who is the science editor of <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> and does not normally support my views on many things, says that at the early stages of embryo development animal DNA is as much as 50 per cent. of the mitochondrial DNA. Of the mitochondrial DNA created in cybrids, as much as 50 per cent. might be animal, so it is not quite true that such early creatures are 99 per cent. human. Of course, if that is true, they are not just things; although they are anormal, they are potentially like human embryos&#151;they have all or most of the genetic make-up of a human being.</p>

 I am keen to defend <i> The Daily Telegraph</i>: Roger Highfield said that 50 per cent. of a cybrid&#146;s mitochondrial DNA might come from a human and 50 per cent. from an animal, but that is not inconsistent with a very small percentage overall coming from the animal. Over 95 per cent. of the DNA in such a cybrid is nuclear DNA. He is talking only about the split of less than 5 per cent.&#151;probably less than 1 per cent.&#151;of the mitochondrial DNA.</p>

It is essentially a vessel to compensate for the shortage of eggs that are needed to produce embryonic stem cells. As I have said, two licences for that practice have already been granted. I am sure that the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)&#151;a distinguished scientist&#151;will confirm that mitochondria, which are in the area  <br>

around the cell nucleus, are neither animal nor human, but are autonomous. We need to clarify this aspect of the law, because the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 did not foresee cybrids coming along. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has therefore granted two licences for such work to be carried out, jumping ahead of legislation. If we agree with the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend, we will go back to the days before the 1990 legislation, which would not be a positive change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="80519-0006.htm_para1"><a name="08051912000251">The second category of embryo is the human transgenic embryo, for which animal DNA is put into one or more cells of a human embryo. Both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA are inserted such that there will be a DNA sequence that controls the expression of the DNA already in the human sample. The hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="80519-0006.htm_para2"><a name="08051912000252">The third category of embryo is the chimera, which involves adding animal cells to a human embryo; it has two or more cells from different organisms. A chimera could contain two different mouse cells, such as a mouse stem cell in a mouse embryo. Chimera are useful research tools for the observation of disease and treatments. With these, the human cells significantly outnumber those from animals.</p>

It combines human gametes&#151;for those who are uninitiated with the terminology, a gamete is either an egg or a sperm&#151;with animal gametes, which are also either egg or sperm. As was pointed out earlier, the 1990 Act allows such embryos under what is called the hamster test, but they are allowed to go only to the two-cell stage and must then be destroyed. If we allow true hybrids to continue, that limit would be extended to 14 days.</p>

New technologies&#151;specifically intracytoplasmic sperm injections&#151;have significantly reduced the need for that type of assessment in clinics. Indeed, a distinguished stem-cell biologist, Dr. Robin Lovell-Badge, whom I shall mention again, told me in a letter only last week that the intracytoplasmic sperm injection had made the hamster test largely irrelevant.</p>

<p>Originally, the Government were not going to allow true hybrids up to a 50:50 genetic material mix of animals and humans.

 If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, I will come to that specific point in a moment. He is right to make that point, however, although there has been some dissent in the scientific community since Second Reading as to whether that is or is not the case. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="80519-0006.htm_para6"><a name="08051912000258">So there has been a shift in the Government position, which seems to undermine the ethical situation. There was an extensive debate in the other place on the issue, but no reason seemed to be given, except that the Committee and those in another place could see no reason why true hybrids should not be included.</p>

It is a research requirement that the research could not be achieved by any other means than by embryonic research. As I have said, adult stem cells are different from embryonic stem cells. When visiting Newcastle university, I saw an embryonic stem cell, created from a human embryo, under a microscope, beating like a heart muscle. That has not been done using adult stem cells. When visiting Kyoto, it was clear that embryonic stem cells were essential for benchmarking for pluripotent adult stem cells, exciting though that prospect is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="80519-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08051912000260">There are therefore significant differences between the different types of admixed embryos. I personally have no issue with the first three. I take issue only with true hybrids, which is what amendments Nos. 10 and 11 are about. The first reason is that, in the context of this debate, the Government have changed their position without clearly making their case. They are obviously uncertain about this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80519-0006.htm_para9"><a name="08051912000261">Furthermore, the scientific community has expressed serious reservations about true hybrids, and these were quoted by other hon. Members on Second Reading. Indeed, since last Monday&#146;s debate, the distinguished stem-cell scientist Dr. Robin Lovell-Badge has felt it necessary to clarify his position. Those who were here for the Second Reading debate will remember that he was cited as the leading scientist who felt that there was no need for human hybrid embryos to be approved under the legislation. He seems to have changed his mind, however&#151;whether under pressure or otherwise remains unknown. During the oral evidence session of the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee, he said:</p>
<a name="80519-0006.htm_brev1"><a name="08051912000368"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I cannot think of a good experiment to do now&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="80519-0006.htm_para10"><a name="08051912000262">However, in a letter that Dr. Lovell-Badge wrote to me after the Second Reading debate last week, he confirmed that there were primarily three areas in which true hybrids could be useful. I shall outline each one quickly if I may. The first involves the hamster test, which was permitted under the 1990 Act. That would be allowed to continue if these amendments were passed today. The second area involves artificial gametes, making sperm from pluripotent cells. The Minister confirmed on Second Reading that she would not allow such a provision to be in the Bill at all. The third area involves the use of what is called somatic cell nuclear transfer to understand the mechanisms by which human somatic cells can be reprogrammed from one cell type to another. It is the rationale for the construction and study of cytoplasmic human hybrid admixed embryos, which will be allowed under the Bill even if my amendment is passed.</p>

but many other scientists have also expressed significant concerns about true hybrids. Lord Winston is another example, and my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough was absolutely right to quote Sir Liam Donaldson&#146;s evidence to the Committee that there was no clear scientific argument for this measure, and that it represented a step too far.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He is arguing that we need to keep all avenues of research open, but that is not the way that we deal with licences for animal research. An application to do research on a chimpanzee would be unlikely to be granted until people had demonstrated that they were unable to do that research on something less ethically difficult&#151;for example, a rat or a hamster.

 I thank the hon. Lady for that intervention, but as a hard-nosed scientist, no. People work on the best organism to give them the answer that they want to see. They might not get the answer and they might even have to work on a worm to get the answer that they want. In other cases, people want to move up to the clinical situation. There, they have to go through rhesus monkeys and so on.</p>

They have to get permission to use certain animals and they have to deliberate on how they are going to use them. They have to prove how things will be done so that there is no cruelty appertaining to that situation. Mice, rats, guinea pigs and other animals have all featured over the history of this period, but&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="80519-0006.htm_para26"><a name="08051912000289">On Second Reading, I said that I remembered a time in the &#146;70s when genetic recombination was the bugbear. We were putting genes from another organism inside a bacterium or whatever. That caused trouble right across the USA. It was the scientists themselves, at a huge meeting and seminar, who disciplined themselves and ran a campaign on how to assess the dangers pertaining to such work&#151;not just the dangers to themselves and the technicians in the lab, but the dangers to the public outside. The whole of Boston was up in arms about that kind of work being done at Harvard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="80519-0006.htm_para27"><a name="08051912000290">When we look back now and ask whether those scientists were right, the answer must be yes. People may not like genetically modified plants, but gosh, if they have diabetes they will all be using insulin made from GM organisms. That was the big issue in the debate about genetic modification in this place. When it led to medical improvements in our conditions it was OK, but when it involved plants it was a bit different. We know that there are many other issues involved relating to big companies and so on, but I can tell the Committee that people really do support attempts to improve their lives, and insulin is a good example. If we had banned GM completely, we would not have the human insulin that has saved so many lives.</p>

 Will my hon. Friend clarify his exchange with the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)? As a scientist, can he give some examples in which adult stem cells would be of no use in advancing experimentation? I understand from some of our debates that pancreatic stem cells do not exist in adults, whereas we have heard about motor neurone stem cell lines being developed in a dish from embryonic stem cells that could be used for compounds.</p>

 It is extremely difficult to obtain adult stem cells from the human body, although there are instances in which some stem cells are in better condition than others. The longer a stem cell stays in the body, the more likely it is that an ageing effect will lead to mutations, while an embryonic cell at the start of a process does not show any of the changes in DNA that we call mutations.</p>

I have not yet confessed today that I am a member of the Stem Cell Foundation, which includes some of the most distinguished scientists in the world who are interested in stem cells. Their sole motivation is not to be uncritical about stem cells, but to ensure that when the stem cell flood happens&#151;if it does happen in the next few years&#151;we in this country develop the technology.</p>

As for the provisions in the Bill on human admixed embryos, will the hon. Gentleman&#151;as a scientist&#151;tell me what evidence there is in favour of authorisation? Since 2003, there has been only one peer-reviewed published article. Is it not unprecedented to proceed on the basis of such scant evidence?</p>

 If I am honest&#151;and I am, I think&#151;if there had not been such tight regulations and such difficulties in obtaining licences, for all sorts of reasons, we might be further down the line. As a scientist, and as one who knows science backwards, I feel that we are constrained by all sorts of regulations involving health and safety and how we operate with cells in laboratories. However, the reason scientists carry out research is that they have a hunch, an idea, perhaps on the basis of earlier work, which makes them say &#147;I wonder what would happen if...&#148; That is how science advances. Scientists are fallible&#151;they are not always on the right lines&#151;but gosh, if the world did not have science we would not have the medical cures that we have, or, indeed, any understanding of climate change, about which many Members spout without knowing much about the science.</p>

Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is wrong if he is implying that it is a walkover and that every proposal goes through. That is not true. Lord Winston in the other place says it is much too tight and regulatory and that it stops too much happening; he is against the HFEA precisely on the grounds that it does things of the kind that the hon.

We do not want to have to have a debate every year for two or three days with Committees and so on; we need to make sure that we can take science on, and that when new science comes through that is useful, the legislation allows for that.</p>

Because we cannot get human eggs at this stage. The scientific community would not want to use animal cells in elements of its research if it could get human eggs. So we could look at what these MND genes do up until the 14-day stage, when such admixed embryos would have to be destroyed. We could see if the genes start working and what they do to the cells at this early stage. This is how research is done: we might not see what happens, but we can ask questions&#151;and I suggest to the House that these questions are very much worth asking.</p>

 It is difficult to follow the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), because he presents his case in such a reasonable fashion and he is enormously knowledgeable. I was thinking about the fact that when our debates took place on these issues in 1984 the atmosphere in the House was dramatic; one might say that it was electric. Some hon.

Member broke the Speaker&#146;s Chair&#151;or rather the shelf on which the Speaker puts his papers&#151;such were the emotions at that time. Some of that resulted from the fact that a petition signed by 2 million people had been presented. I had proposed the idea of such a petition to the Life conference in August of the year in which I got elected. Perhaps I was a little presumptuous in doing so, but, on the other hand, I feel as strongly now as I did then about the question of boundaries, to which my hon.

This is not just a matter of religious belief, which I certainly hold; it is also a question of practicalities. On Second Reading, I put a question to the House and to those in favour of the research, and I have been thinking about it a great deal since: even if this research could be accepted&#151;I could not accept it, because I object to it in principle&#151;and it were to go ahead, for whom would it be made available? Who would benefit from it? The hon. Member for Norwich, North nods, and that is certainly an important question that we have to address.

That legislation was very good and the Government of the time should be congratulated, as they were on Second Reading. In the 1990 Act, we see that the hamster test made provision that true hybrid entities should be created, albeit only up to the two-cell stage. No one, however, can argue that there is a huge ethical distinction between the two-cell, eight-cell and 16-cell stages. I am going to explore whether ethical distinctions can be made between different types of admixed embryos, but surely one cannot argue that it is okay for a two-cell entity to be created, but it is not okay for a four-cell entity to be created if the other requirements are met&#151;that it is necessary or desirable for medical research and there is no other way of doing it.</p>

 I do not think that that is right, and I wanted to return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) in an intervention. The way in which science works is that before someone gets to the HFEA stage, they have to get funding. They must get ethical approval and have a research proposal. That is a huge job. People&#146;s jobs depend on being able to get permission, and scientists apply to the HFEA only at an extremely late stage. It would be a scandal if they had public or charity funding and subsequently failed to get that permission. In many cases, there is an iterative process between the authority and scientists, and they do not get approval until the end of a long process. That is what Lord Winston and others, including those at Newcastle, complain about at length. They complain that the process is too burdensome; other hon. Members are now complaining that it is not burdensome enough. If no one is happy, that suggests that the authority has it about right. A walkover it is not.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that when considering keeping all avenues open, there was a proper framework in the 1990 Act that had respect for the human embryo?

 Absolutely. As I said, there has to be a scientific justification. We could not justify creating a true hybrid embryo simply because someone else has done that to test sperm, but if there is another reason to do it, no new ethical question has been opened up since the Conservative Government and the House passed the 1990 Act and allowed the hamster test. That matter was heavily debated in both Houses&#151;it was not snuck through. There were debates and Divisions on that matter in 1990, and we should not be going backwards.</p>

Indeed, countries such as the United States have no regulation in the private sector. The fact that we have tight regulation and, yes, burdensome regulation, means that many scientists recognise that this country has deliberated over the issue and that there is a framework. The flipside, I suppose, of the fact that most scientists are successful is that there have been no prosecutions for research on embryos without a licence, and there are plenty of people looking for opportunities to make accusations. To the extent that no prosecutions indicates success, one can say that the process has been successful.</p>

Whether it was envisaged in 1990 is a separate matter, but the Government are putting the legal advice and the HFEA policy that is based on it into statute. People who are worried about such matters should be grateful to the Government for placing them on to a statutory footing so that there is clarity and we do not rely on the random&#151;or perhaps not so random&#151;views of a judge or judges in the High Court or the Court of Appeal, and do not get bogged down in judicial review.</p>

However, there is a belief among sufferers and organisations such as the Motor Neurone Disease Association that the research may be the necessary path to finding a cure and that, once we have achieved that for one disease, there will probably be knock-on learning effects for other diseases, enabling us to unlock a great deal of medical knowledge by allowing the pursuit of research.

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80519-0009.htm_para17"><a name="08051928000063">The second point was that if there were progress in research into in vitro derived gametes&#151;they have been called artificial gametes&#151;that would need to be tested. It is true that the Government are not yet looking favourably at the prospect of allowing stem cell derived gametes to be used in the treatment of the thousands of people who have survived cancer and cannot create their own gametes, but that does not mean that they have any intention of banning research into those things. That is permitted, and part of that research is to test whether research is working. It is unfortunate that that has not been recognised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80519-0009.htm_para18"><a name="08051928000064">Finally, Dr. Lovell-Badge made it clear that the cloning technique might require a comparison between cybrids and full eggs&#151;eggs that have not been enucleated&#151;to see whether there is anything nuclear in the egg that helps blastocyst formation. He did not say in his letter that the third issue was simply cybrids; he said that it was comparison with cybrids.</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman has said, the prohibition on implantation is explicit and the Bill is unmistakeably clear on that point. Will he take this opportunity to make it clear beyond doubt that it is not the case that the bulk of scientists who support the Bill are glumly resigning themselves to the reality that there will be a regulatory framework? Indeed, far from it; those scientists have been at the forefront of those arguing for a regulatory framework because they want to do the work ethically and on the basis that they can carry the country with them in the process.</p>

 A great deal of this subject has already been covered in the debate, but I want to respond briefly to a number of the points that have been raised and to refer to the Government amendments. First, it is important to put it on record that a lack of human eggs is creating a significant barrier to the continuation of embryonic stem-cell research. Researchers have looked for a pragmatic solution to the shortage, and they believe that they have found one in the form of animal eggs and in the creation of human admixed embryos.</p>

The Government amendments reaffirm the purpose of the scientific definition in the Bill. Any licence application to create human admixed embryos for research will need to prove to the HFEA that the proposed use of the embryo is necessary&#151;not simply that the scientists want to try it&#151;and that no other route of research would enable the development of the science to understand the development of the treatment.</p>

 The statutory purposes are clearly laid out in the Bill, building on the provisions in the 1990 Act. I do not remember whether the hon. Gentleman was in the House in 1990. I was, and I remember that the matter was fully debated at that time, and that many of these purposes were considered. </p>

This research is about giving scientists the ability, within clear boundaries&#151;which have been discussed in the House before, particularly in 1990&#151;within which to advance technologies that could help in the development of treatments for devastating degenerative conditions, in continuing research into male infertility and in learning more about what makes embryonic stem cells so different from any other cell.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman) made a very eloquent speech earlier. I make no apology to the Committee for saying that we cannot promise that this research will definitely lead to those treatments; it is an aspiration that it could do so, if it is permitted, along with the rest of the research that is being carried out.</p>

A major barrier to continuing embryonic stem-cell research is the lack of human eggs for use in research, as they can be obtained only through the stimulation of a woman&#146;s ovaries. That procedure is not without risk, and the best eggs are quite rightly used in treatment. Researchers have been looking for a solution to the shortage, and they believe that they have found one in the form of animal eggs, which are widely available and believed to be as useful in the creation of embryos as human eggs. If successful, they could advance embryonic stem-cell research by many years.</p>

In fairness to him, however, let me say that that was also reflected in the way the Government proceeded in their consideration of the matter. The hon. Gentleman asked for an explanation.</p>

In recent correspondence to the Department, Professor Lynn Fraser made a clear argument for the continuation of this work, citing the use of hamster eggs as the best option for testing treatments designed to increase the ability of human sperm to fertilise an egg. Such research is valuable in trying to find ways to overcome male infertility. Prohibiting its use and the use of this technique seems completely unjustified, especially as this prohibition would be a step backwards from the position enshrined in the 1990 Act.</p>

Member for Boston and Skegness says&#151;99 per cent. genetically human through to those that are 50 per cent. genetically human. The amendments are a response to the debate in the other place, where clarification of the definitions was sought. The Government amendments add a catch-all category to the definition of human admixed embryos in the Bill, providing further clarity of the scope of the term. In addition to the four precise scientific definitions already in the Bill, that will ensure that all new forms of embryos that may be developed that contain both human and animal DNA will, where the animal DNA does not predominate, fall within the regulation.</p>

 I begin by making a point that I would have liked to raise by intervening on the Minister earlier. It concerns Government amendment No. 34. The problem of definition has been an issue for this House and the other place. Some have sought to define what is human, what is animal and then what is a human admixed embryo. In other provisions, the Government have sought to do that by way of illustrative examples.

The question, though, for the Minister, which perhaps highlights the problems that we have over definition is, where Government amendment No. 34 would capture that embryo which is created by what is called tetraploid complementation. Those embryos are normally created by adding embryonic stem cells to an animal embryo that has been altered to have double the number of chromosomes&#151;that is, it is a tetraploid.

Once embryo stem-cell lines are differentiated, the concern is that what is involved will stop being a stem cell and lose its &#147;stemness&#148;. It has difficulty turning into a tissue type.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80519-0010.htm_para22"><a name="08051928000104">The concern, though, is that we do not simply deal with the problems of embryo stem-cell research; the issue is human hybrid embryos and whether there are alternatives. In the development of embryo stem-cell research, one has to focus on cloned human embryos. Those are particularly difficult to create. They are very inefficient and defective. There is difficulty that leads to abnormality. When one looks at the research, one sees that there are problems. The problems develop when dealing with the structure of cloned human animal embryos.</p>

The development of cloned human animal embryos represents taking another leap. That is the focus of the Bill, which will establish that we must move into the area of cytoplasmic hybrids. Taking the scientist&#146;s view, one struggles to see how one could get to the point of curing diseases, which is what we all want.</p>

The human genome would have been reprogrammed with reprogramming factors from the animal egg, and there would be a degree of mismatch between relevant human and animal material. There would also be the risk of the creation of new diseases. As I mentioned earlier, there may be the risk of immune rejection, as mitochondria have proteins that can cause an immune reaction. Some animal mitochondrial proteins would be present in the cells, and they might cause an even stronger immune reaction than human mitochondria.</p>

That led to the withholding of the US Food and Drug Administration licence for clinical trials of embryonic stem cells to go ahead. But it is far too dangerous medically to attempt to use embryo stem-cell lines for therapies. Looking to take that a stage further in terms of human animal cloned embryos, it would be even less safe to use them for therapies.</p>

On Second Reading we heard mention of Professor Wilmut, creator of Dolly the sheep. He had planned to create disease-specific cell lines using so-called cybrids to investigate motor neurone disease, but abandoned that approach very publicly a few months ago, stating that reprogrammed adult cells&#151;induced pluripotent stem cells&#151;showed much more potential.

Members on both sides of the House have expressed real anxiety about the fact that the clauses dealing with human admixed embryos transcend people&#146;s concerns about proper respect for the dignity of human life. It is not a case of all avenues being equal. If we take the scientist&#146;s view of where the therapeutic value is and where research is advancing by leaps and bounds, we find ourselves considering induced pluripotent cells.

In recent years progress has been made by leaps and bounds, not least&#151;as I said earlier&#151;in induced pluripotent stem-cell research. Considerable progress has been made even since the publication of the Bill. We should be very cautious about adopting a route that is ethically problematic. Sir Liam Donaldson himself, the chief scientific adviser, made it clear to the Joint Committee that there was a deficit in medical ethics. We ourselves are charged with the duty of ensuring that there is a proper ethical framework, and we should be extremely cautious about taking this route unless its therapeutic value is clear.

An increasing number of tissue types are producing therapeutic value for those suffering from the degenerative diseases that we all want to cure.

I also come to the debate without holding an absolutist view on the position of the embryo&#151;I freely declare that as a Christian and a member of the Church of England&#151;and in that I suspect I reflect to an extent the views held within the Church of England; the hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) spoke about this on Second Reading, and the Archbishops Council advice given to us reflects it. As Members know, I am a historian, and although this debate is not an occasion for great historical references, it is worth remembering that for a great chunk of the middle ages many Catholic theologians took a very different view of the role of the embryo from that which they do today.</p>

I find it difficult to accept that one should be as absolutist as they were about the difference between 99 per cent. and 50 per cent. Coming from the perspective of not having an absolute moral view on embryology but of having some deep-seated concerns, I believe that the further we go along the spectrum, the further such concerns will be raised, and the further the precautionary principle should be applied.</p>

The points made about the progress there has been with adult stem cells need to be given much greater prominence. An important point was also made about how treatments in this entire area have been revolutionised in the past 10 years. That makes it all the more important that we send out a message to the HFEA.

diseases. In the case of motor neurone disease, the disease leads to certain death. As far as I can tell from looking at the King&#146;s college work, there is no real option of creating neurons from adult stem cells, so we must grasp this chance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80519-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08051938000039">In 1975, people said no to recombinant DNA technology because, &#147;It is playing God. You are mixing up different genes. That is not the proper thing to do.&#148; The scientific community said that it would say yes, and in the 33 years since, treatments for haemophilia and diabetes, as well as many biopharmaceutical drugs, have been developed. That has taken 33 years, but it has made a real difference on these chronic illnesses. We have an opportunity tonight to make a real difference, perhaps not in the short term, but in the future, on chronic diseases, particularly on these devastating neurological diseases. It would be a great pity if the House did not grasp that opportunity.</p>

 It is a pleasure briefly to sum up an excellent and serious debate, in which, for once, we have been able to lay aside party politics. I thank everybody who has taken part, although not everybody has supported my point of view. I particularly thank the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), who talked at the beginning of this debate about the heart of this issue: the ethics. He was followed briefly by the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden). We all share great sympathy for the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart), but hundreds of clinical trials have taken place and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) mentioned, they were all on adult stem cells; not one was on embryo stem cells. The proposal is a step too far. We believe that it crosses an ethical line in mixing animal and human embryos. We believe the evidence. As Lord Winston has said, there is no evidence to suggest that a magic cure is available round the corner, which is why we shall press this amendment to a vote.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Hood. I am concerned as to whether amendment No. 31 is within the remit of the Bill, given Lord Darzi&#146;s letter of 31 January in response to a similar amendment in the other place. He made it clear that regulatory oversight by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority finishes once a stem-cell line is derived and deposited in the UK stem-cell bank. Any stem-cell lines intended for human use will need to comply with the requirements of the Human Tissue Authority and are, therefore, subject to its regulations and to the Human Tissue Act 2004. As that is not the subject of the Bill and as other amendments, not least mine dealing with the collection of umbilical cord blood, were within the remit of the Human Tissue Act and the Human Tissue Authority, I ask the judgment of the Chair as to whether the amendment is in any way relevant, given that it is not within the remit of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80519-0013.htm_para21"><a name="08051947000535">Embryo selection can be negative or positive. Negative embryo selection, which has been lawful under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, means that if a family suffers from an inheritable disease, they are able&#151;even if otherwise fertile&#151;to have in vitro fertilisation. If it is successful, embryos can be gathered and tested at an early stage, while outside the woman, by the removal of one cell. That has not been found to damage the embryo and the testing of the cell enables clinicians to identify whether each embryo is affected by the condition. If an embryo is affected, the couple undergoing treatment can avoid selecting that embryo for implantation and use one of the unaffected embryos.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80519-0013.htm_para22"><a name="08051947000536">Since 1990, the HFEA has licensed such negative selection on a number of occasions and families have benefited by avoiding inheritable disease, particularly when they already have a child significantly affected by the disease. That is a reasonable thing to do and I absolutely reject the suggestion that helping a family to avoid having a child with a serious disease is in any way discriminatory against the disabled. There is a complete difference between seeking to alleviate or avoid suffering by such techniques and discriminating against disabled or sick human beings after they are born. Indeed, many of the doctors who work so hard to provide pre-implantation genetic diagnosis also work hard both to provide in utero surgery to avoid or ameliorate congenital defects and to look after children born with serious diseases. Although I realise that views on the issue run strongly, I hope that the allegation of discrimination is not levelled against clinicians, parents and those of us who think that PGD is legitimate to help people to avoid having a child with a forecast serious genetic disorder. Such an allegation borders on the offensive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80519-0013.htm_para23"><a name="08051947000537">My second point is that when taking a cell to check whether a child is affected by a disease it is also possible to carry out other tests on the cell&#151;for example, tissue typing. I shall briefly describe two cases. The first involves the Hashmi family whose child was very sick with thallassemia and needed a transplant, but none was available from the bone marrow or cord banks, as is often the case for families with certain genotypes&#151;particularly, but not exclusively, those from ethnic minorities. The Hashmis needed to check whether their next child would have the same disease, and whether they could select an embryo who did not have it. They also wanted to see whether they could get a tissue match. The HFEA said, after serious consideration, that that was a legitimate thing to do, and the courts upheld that decision as lawful under the 1990 Act. I understand that the Hashmis were unfortunately not successful in conceiving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80519-0013.htm_para24"><a name="08051947000538">The next case that came along was that of the Whitakers, a family from Oxfordshire. They had a child who was seriously ill with Diamond Blackfan anaemia, who was kept alive by weekly transfusions and nightly treatments of an infusion of a drug. It was not an inherited disease but a sporadic mutation, so when they had another child&#151;they wanted to have another child anyway&#151;they did not need to test the embryo for the genetic disease, but they did wish to use a tissue-typing technique. They were fertile but they wanted to have IVF so that they could select an embryo that was a  <br>

tissue match, in order that a wanted, loved child could provide a cord blood transplant for the afflicted older sibling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80519-0013.htm_para25"><a name="08051947000539">The family were denied that opportunity by the HFEA, which disagreed with its own ethics committee. It later changed its mind, but in the interim the Whitakers went to Chicago for the treatment. It was successful, and they had another child, who was healthy. That child&#146;s cord blood was used in a transplant for the older sibling. The procedure was successful, and the sibling was cured. As a result of the intervention, instead of neither of the two children being alive and healthy, they were both alive and healthy. That makes the case more eloquently than any speech or policy document could.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80519-0013.htm_para26"><a name="08051947000540">What are the problems? Well, I do not think that there are any. I do not accept the allegation that there will be a burden on the saviour sibling. There is no evidence of that. There is evidence that if the intervention does not take place the sibling will suffer bereavement, because the young child will be born into a family who have a seriously diseased child who may die. It would be a benefit if that could be avoided. As I said on Second Reading, even if we could forecast circumstances in which there would be a burden, those potential circumstances have to be balanced against the certainty of harm if the family is not allowed to have a second child in the way that I have described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80519-0013.htm_para27"><a name="08051947000541">We do not know whether the removal of a cell creates long-term harm to the embryo; it is fair to say that the technology is relatively new. However we do know that so far&#151;thousands of children have been born following pre-implantation genetic diagnosis&#151;there does not appear to be any harm, although it is important to keep observing. We do know that the birth of many sick children has been avoided, and healthy ones have been born instead, and that a handful of saviour siblings have been permitted. The HFEA has made it clear that it will not allow the procedure if there is an alternative that does not involve the destruction of embryos, so if there is a bone marrow match or a cord blood match, it is likely that that will be pursued first, because such a transplant is clearly less onerous for the parents than IVF, which is burdensome, and pregnancy.</p>

<p><a name="st_o241"><a name="08051947000542"><a name="80519-0013.htm_spnew3"><a name="08051947001072"><b>Dr. Gibson:</b>
 Is it true, though, that many ailments and afflictions are multi-factorial, and that in those cases one could not easily find a single-gene disorder by carrying out PGD? In many cases, 50 or 60 genes are involved. What is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view about those situations and the children with those afflictions?</p>

 It is most likely that the procedure will be possible only in a handful of cases, so we are not talking about widespread tissue typing of a lot of embryos. Of course, many parents will choose not to have IVF and will instead take their chances, which are one in four.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80519-0013.htm_para28"><a name="08051947000544">Clear evidence has been presented to me that a tissue-matched transplant from a relative is more likely to be successful&#151;at least in the case of Diamond Blackfan anaemia, from which the Whitaker child suffered&#151;than a tissue-matched transplant from someone who is unrelated. We all support the idea of a bone marrow bank and umbilical cord blood banks, but they will never be a complete replacement. However, if those banks expand,  <br>

there will be less need for procedures of the kind that we are discussing. I do not think that we need to have the discussion that I fear we will have about the merits of umbilical cord blood banking and bone marrow banking, such as that provided by the estimable Anthony Nolan Trust. The measure is self-limiting; if cord blood and bone marrow transplants work, the procedure will not be done. The measure relates to the few circumstances in which the procedure will still be required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80519-0013.htm_para29"><a name="08051947000545">As far as my party is concerned, there is to be a free vote on the issue. I know that some of my hon. Friends do not share my view, but I think that the procedure should take place. We are not talking about eugenics. Eugenics is a state-sponsored scheme of building in genetic advantages, or excluding certain genetic conditions. The procedure is not state-sponsored at all. It is for doctors and patients to agree to the procedure together, under informed consent, and then apply to the regulator for permission. It is not eugenics, and it is offensive to suggest that it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80519-0013.htm_para30"><a name="08051947000546">I should like to move on to the other significant amendments in the group. First, I want to talk about the amendments in my name concerning the use of the term &#147;abnormality&#148; in the Bill. That wording causes a problem. It allows genetic testing for a genetic abnormality. There are some characteristics that, together, might cause serious diseases or life-threatening disease&#151;or whatever the threshold happens to be&#151;but that cannot properly be called abnormalities. I have had a briefing from leading geneticists, including Marcus Pembury, that says that if the Government do not make this minor amendment, they may find themselves fighting a High Court case in which opponents of PGD will say, &#147;This particular combination of normal genes, which causes a serious disease in this individual, is not an abnormality, so how can you say that you&#146;re testing for an abnormality, according to the terms of the Bill, when the problem is caused simply by a combination of normal components?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80519-0013.htm_para31"><a name="08051947000547">The best comparison is with rhesus disease. Carrying certain rhesus factors&#151;positive or negative&#151;can cause serious disease in a second child, but the rhesus factor is not an abnormality; it just so happens that in that case, it is bad news for a child. I therefore urge the Government to consider the alternative form of words that I have suggested, which includes reference to a &#147;harmful gene&#148; or &#147;combination of genes&#148;, because that is what we are talking about. In the other House, it was suggested that the phrase &#147;genetic characteristic&#148; be used&#151;that is, a genetic characteristic that caused serious disease, not a genetic characteristic that was being screened for; we have to be clear about that. Either of those wordings would solve the problem, and I should be interested to know whether the Minister of State, Department of Health, the right hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo), can be certain that her form of words will not be challenged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80519-0014.htm_para0"><a name="08051947000548">Finally, I turn to amendment No. 31. It is linked with amendment No. 32, which would amend schedule 2. Amendment No. 32 is the key one; it is very important, but I do not have time to give it its due. It would insert a new provision that would enable the HFEA to give a licence for therapy as well as for research. The problem with the current Bill is that if, one day, the research works, and it is possible to derive from embryos stem cells that could be used to treat, say, diabetics by  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="19 May 2008">

providing new, insulin-producing cells, or Parkinson&#146;s disease, it is not clear whether it would be possible to create embryos and use or store them for the purpose of therapy. Clearly, clinical trials are covered by the term &#147;research&#148;, so it will be possible to create, store and use an embryo to provide stem cells for use in clinical trials. One cannot keep doing clinical trials once a treatment is known to work; it is unethical to randomise someone to placebo and someone else to a treatment that is known to be effective. At that point, one has to stop trialling, and instead deliver treatment. At that point, it is not clear whether the original embryo, from which the new stem cells are derived, will be covered, under the HFEA, by a licence, because one can get a licence only for treating infertility or for research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80519-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08051947000549">The Government are right to say that the stem-cell therapies will be controlled by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and, before that, by the Human Tissue Authority. That is not in doubt, and I am sure that the joint statement from those bodies and the HFEA will lead to a seamless transfer. The problem is that if, once research trials work, a company called, say, Stem Cells R Us comes along and says, &#147;We can produce embryonic stem cells for treatment and sell them to the NHS as therapy&#148;, it will not get a licence under the Bill, because it cannot show what the research ends are. It is not good enough for the Government to say that there will always be quality assurance testing on any stem cells derived and that that counts as research. Quality assurance is not research. Research must pass muster on clinical research ethics, and a clear programme of research with inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria is therefore required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80519-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08051947000550">The Government gave two different answers when the issue was raised in the Lords&#151;I can send the Minister the exact quotes. That makes their position difficult&#151;if their position is that there is no problem&#151;because if there were a challenge in court, it would be found that Ministers in the Lords said diametrically opposed things in Committee and on Report. In Committee, the Minister said that such a provision would be a step too far, because it would raise a series of issues about, for example, how many embryos per stem cell line are needed for therapy. On Report, the Government changed their mind, when the Minister said that such a provision would be unnecessary, because the practice is already permitted under the 1990 Act. The Government stuck to that line in the letter that was referred to in the point of order raised by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) and on Third Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80519-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08051947000551">That will not do. It is necessary to clarify the situation, which would not be a step too far. Indeed, Baroness Warnock expressed concern in Committee that despite everything we went through on cloning regulations, which related to conducting stem-cell research and providing therapies, the Government say that they would permit research but would not permit the fruits of that research&#151;the therapies themselves&#151;to be used.</p>

 I am very worried now, because that is not the question. The question relates not to research but to after research has finished. Let us say that in five to 10 years&#146; time the research has worked and that the researchers want to create embryos to derive the therapies without the research stage. How would they do that, when only a research licence is available for that purpose? That is the problem. The Minister might say, &#147;Well, we will have another Bill in five to 10 years&#146; time.&#148; However, I do not think that she will want to go through this again.

Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) from this, but there are other speeches still to come&#151;might be forgiven for falling under the misapprehension that the moral argument lies entirely in one direction and that the legislation has been drafted by a latter-day Mary Shelley who wants to allow scientists to create monsters.

We should make decisions based on the best available evidence and put highly charged language to one side.

I will discuss those arguments and touch on some of the moral arguments that support our moving in that direction. The first argument that is often put is that saviour siblings would be treated as commodities. In other words, parents who choose to have a further child in the knowledge that that might save the life of its sibling are somehow driven by unacceptable motives. At the heart of that argument lies the alarming notion that the state has the right to question the motives of prospective parents. It does not take a great deal of thought to realise the odd directions in which that could take us. I strongly believe that it is up to parents to decide their own justifications for having children.

it is unclear how it would be possible accurately to judge intentions in every specific case. I do not want to stray too far from the point, Mr. Hood, but it does not take a great deal of imagination to envisage a number of different cases where any of us would disapprove of the circumstances in which a child was conceived. However, would we have the right to condemn their birth? That example has a direct parallel with the argument that I have mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="80519-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08051949000005">The second argument expressed by opponents of saviour siblings suggests that saviour siblings would be the first step on a slippery slope to designer babies. Frankly, that argument could be put only in a completely different context, because the rules in the Bill explicitly prevent such a development. If we went through life rejecting Bills on the basis of what subsequent legislation might propose, we would probably never pass any laws whatever.</p>

It is flawed for several reasons. First, the Bill includes an amendment that limits other tissue, so it does not include whole organs and will have the effect of preventing an embryo from being tested if the intention is to remove an organ from a child. Although it is true that, according to all reports, making a bone marrow donation is not a pleasant experience, there is little, if any, evidence that donors suffer any lasting adverse effects. In fact, the contrary is true: as the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon suggested, many people who can offer the gift of life report an overwhelming psychological benefit.</p>

Some people might have made a value judgment, but all I can say is that I know a lot of people who were born to unmarried parents and do not seem to have suffered any psychological disadvantage at all.

There is no easy answer to any of these problems and I do not pretend to have all the answers.

 I agree with everything that my right hon. Friend has said. The answer to my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) is that when Siamese, conjoined twins have to be separated clinically and the chances are that one will die, I do not recall that the twin least likely to survive is consulted. The situation is difficult and parents have to make the decision. The situation is no different from that involving savour siblings.</p>

<p><a name="st_o266"><a name="08051949000024"><a name="80519-0014.htm_spnew23"><a name="08051949000742"><b>Mr. Howarth:</b>
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Perhaps I should just take interventions; the more I take, the stronger my argument becomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80519-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08051949000025">It is important to remember that, as the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon pointed out, the only real difference between conventional IVF treatment and the process of creating a saviour sibling is in the reduction of chance at the point when eggs are selected for implantation. In my view, claiming that that is a manipulation of DNA cells or a creation of designer babies is a misrepresentation of the facts. The reality is that it simply enables an informed selection of embryos so that there is a greater likelihood of a healthy baby who also has the potential to save their sibling&#146;s life. If, as I do, we accept that the principle of IVF is a good thing and if we have the technology to make this important decision in a more informedway, we should use that technology, as long as all therapeutic alternatives have been exhausted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="80519-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08051949000026">It is a question of using the best available knowledge to maximise the chances of saving lives and reducing suffering. As was noted in the previous debate, there are other sources of therapeutic cells&#151;bone marrow transplants and cord blood from non-related donors provide such possibilities. However, only 20 to 35 per cent. of patients have a matching sibling by chance and the odds of obtaining matching stem cells from an unrelated donor vary according to the ethnic origin of the patient. As matching is significantly improved when the donor and recipient have the same ethnic and racial background, this Bill will have even greater benefits for people from minority ethnic groups struggling to find a suitable donor. Indeed, one of the cases that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon referred to made that point equally well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="80519-0014.htm_para18"><a name="08051949000027">When we think about the principles involved, it is all too easy to forget that we are dealing with uncertainties. The best available scientific evidence can only predict the most likely future therapies. Indeed, the history of medicine shows, repeatedly, that life-transforming treatments in one area often arise from work with a very different original rationale. The obvious example is that of Alexander Fleming&#146;s discovery of penicillin&#151;a chance discovery from an already discarded contaminated Petri dish. The drug sildenafil was originally used to treat angina before a notable side effect was deemed to have a significant therapeutic use in its own right. For those in the Committee who are not immediately familiar with this drug, its more popular brand name is Viagra.</p>

One has to raise the question of what a harmful gene or chromosome is. How is &#147;harmful&#148; defined? To whom is it harmful&#151;a society that cannot tolerate disease? My concern about the amendments, and the Bill itself, is the value we put on life, and whether we seek to focus on the quality of life and make the judgment that some lives are more valued than others.

 I am grateful for that intervention because it is the issue of definition that concerns me. Amendment No. 25 sets out an extension to harmful genotypes. I have looked up the meaning of genotype, and it includes a range of definitions of the genetic make-up of an individual. Genotype can also be defined as the physical or psychological genetic potential of a person when born&#151;for example, someone born with a genetic predisposition to depression. However, whether that person develops depression depends on their upbringing and environment. I looked further at  <br>

Someone may be born with the physical genotype to play football for his or her country.

After they have been through all avenues to seek a match&#151;from bone marrow or any available cord blood&#151;and are told of an opportunity to create a sibling to provide a match, one can understand why they would want to consider that option.

 My reaction to that moral imperative, which has existed for several years, is to challenge the Government about the extent to which they are properly focused on and investing in umbilical cord blood to ensure that the necessary resources are available. We can then join Peter Braude of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who chaired the committee on cord blood. When asked about saviour siblings, he said that the need for donor siblings would be temporary and that, in future, he hoped that stem-cell supply, especially the use of cord blood from national cord blood banking, would virtually remove the need for donor siblings.</p>

One must acknowledge the difficulty of the process. I understand that it can take four cycles of IVF treatment to find the necessary match. As hon. Members know, in any one cycle of IVF treatment, around 12 eggs will be extracted. Of those, 10 will become embryos, eight will be biopsiable and it is possible to diagnose only seven. Two would be normal, with only one potentially described as good quality. Once that embryo has been implanted in the womb, the chance of it being carried to term is estimated at 15 or 20 per cent. That may not be of paramount concern for all hon. Members, but it is for some. Cycles of IVF treatment lead to many discarded embryos, both diseased and healthy. That causes some hon.

That raises concerns about the woman undergoing the procedure.</p>

 Surely it is up to the woman. There is informed consent in those procedures. She may say that she wants a chance to save the affected sibling&#146;s life and wants a child who can give that chance.

We all need to be aware that once the embryo is tissue typed, it has implanted an immune matched sibling for life and is known to have organs compatible with the older sibling, whether the initial reason related to tissue typing or not.

Many of the arguments that he is rehearsing were made then, too, albeit in a different light, but most people in our society&#151;and, I suspect, most people in the House&#151;have had great confidence in that authority over the past 17 or 18 years, and are confident that in future it will do nothing more or less than what society would allow it to do.</p>

 It is perhaps regrettable that we in this House cannot consider the Human Tissue Act 2004 in the context of saviour siblings, and debate it more fully so that the House can be clear about its intentions. The Human Tissue Authority&#151;or, indeed, lawyers&#151;might be seeking to make the case that Parliament would effectively be sanctioning the creation of a sibling for the specific purpose of tissue matching. If the alleviation or cure does not come through the use of cord blood or bone marrow, the next considerations will be about other tissues and whether there should be other donations.</p>

The pressure would continue. What would be the psychological impact on a saviour sibling of knowing that they were created for a purpose that they cannot achieve? There is no evidence on that, but the burden is on the Government to establish whether there has been any assessment or study of the psychological impacts.</p>

 What is the difference between a saviour sibling being unable to fulfil such hopes, despite tissue typing, and a sibling who was not tissue matched also being disappointed because they cannot provide tissue?

 My response to that is similar to my response to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s previous intervention: those cases are entirely different. We are dealing with a sibling who has been created specifically because of their tissue match and genetic footprint to find a cure for their sibling. The case of another sibling would be wholly different.</p>

The best interests test includes not only medical considerations, but a person&#146;s social, psychological and emotional best interests. That is why the psychological impact is relevant. Those interests would have to be examined if there were an application for donation. That could leave a child in a vulnerable situation and under unique internal and family pressures, having been created specifically to be a donor for the elder sibling. They could be put in a situation in which their older sibling might die if they do not provide the required organ. Those are considerations that could well arise in a chain of events, and it is therefore important that we do not simply rely on the safeguards in the Bill or even those suggested in amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="80519-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08051949000081">We must consider carefully, rely upon and uphold the important principle that we should not deliberately create a child for the benefit of another. The way to respond to this issue is not simply through prohibition but by promoting an area of resource&#151;umbilical cord blood stem cell research. What is happening is a crying shame; there is a moral imperative on the Government to have more than four hospitals collecting cord blood. It imperative that we do not lag at 13th position in a league table of 17 countries for our collection of cord blood units per inhabitant. We are way behind other countries. It is imperative that we inform parents of the value of cord blood and of the opportunities to collect it, and that we encourage collection so that we have that ready resource that can provide the match and cure for parents who desperately want a cure for their children. On those points of principle, I invite hon. Members to support my amendment. We should not countenance a break in the principle, effectively, that a means justifies the end.</p>

 I have a brief speech to make on a narrow point of concern. What we are sanctioning in this debate is the use of an invasive procedure on a child without their consent and without their gaining any direct benefit from that intervention. There has been speculation that such a child might benefit from feelings of good will towards the sibling that they might or might not have helped, but there is no certainty of that. I shall dwell on those elements, starting with consent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="80519-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08051949000083">There are many procedures for which children are not required to give consent. My son has had to undertake certain procedures on the basis that I have  <br>

consented to them, and that is an entirely familiar principle in law. However, such procedures are usually associated with the principle that that child&#151;the focus of this speech is that the child is an autonomous being in this matter&#151;should derive some benefit from the procedure that they are undergoing. If the parents&#146; consent is not directly associated with that child enjoying a benefit, but is so that another child will enjoy a benefit, we should reflect on that with some care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80519-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08051949000084">The Bill sanctions invasive procedures. In the preceding speech, the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) made the point that that can occur in a variety of different ways that are sanctioned in the Bill. The commonest method will be concerned with bone marrow extraction, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) described as an unpleasant procedure. Like any invasive procedure, it is not without risk. It carries a low risk, but it could go wrong. If the Bill excluded such steps and instead relied entirely on non-invasive procedures, I would probably accept the wording, but it sanctions a procedure that could, as has been said, involve the extraction of a part of a child&#146;s body, and could certainly involve the extraction of bone marrow.</p>

 Does not bone marrow biopsy already take place? The point has been made that that is not with the informed consent of the child, but it could not be, because a child is not of legal majority. None the less, such procedures already take place to try to help a sibling, so what is the difference in principle? If a child were created partly for that purpose&#151;it would also be because they were wanted&#151;that bone marrow could not be removed for at least a year after they were born, so what is the difference from existing procedure?</p>

 I must say that I have some anxiety about existing practice sanctioning a potential injury to a child from which they will not derive any direct benefit, but in this instance I rely on the argument that was made in the preceding speech: the child will have been engineered specifically for that purpose rather than being created naturally. I do not regard the circumstances as being precisely comparable, but I take the point that there is a part answer to the ethical issue that I have raised.</p>

I think that all our remarks on this point are speculative. As has been made clear from the start, the sample involved is likely to be tiny and is tiny now. There is no basis on which anyone can do anything other than guess what the impact on a child might be. The positive constructions that have been suggested are perfectly possible, and a child might well feel greatly loved and that it had contributed greatly in love to its sibling. However, it is also possible that much more negative feelings might arise. I personally feel that I cannot second-guess that in law, but that is what we are implicitly doing in the Bill, as it is currently worded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="80519-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08051949000096">As we have heard in the debate, there are serious concerns about the use of saviour siblings, and the HFEA and the HTA must consider closely each application to ensure that it is justified and necessary, and that there is absolutely no alternative. We have also heard discussions about the worth of the saviour child. I do not agree that the provisions would undermine that child&#146;s worth, particularly if the child were born into a loving, caring family, as it inevitably would be. In fact, the opposite impact would be achieved if a child knew that it had saved one of its siblings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="80519-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08051949000097">The amendments tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) include amendment No. 15. Its effect would be to tighten the circumstances in which embryo testing can be carried out, so that it could take place only when an illness was life-threatening or severely impaired a person&#146;s quality of life. These provisions would replace the word &#147;serious&#148; that is in the Bill at the moment. Amendments Nos. 17 and 16 would do similar things in different parts of the schedule.</p>

 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. The legal advice that I have received on this is contradictory; I must be honest about that. However, everyone says that the use of the word &#147;serious&#148; does not create a very tight provision, and that any effort to tighten the clause would therefore be welcome. I shall say more about that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="80519-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08051949000100">Amendment No. 18 would insert the word &#147;regenerative&#148;. This goes back to the point made by my hon.

I have no wish to duplicate the debate that took place in another place, in which it was made clear that this was not intended to include the removal of whole organs. I understand, however, that it could mean not only bone marrow and biopsies but partial organ removal, and that those organs&#151;for example, a significant chunk of a liver&#151;might not grow back. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us whether that is being considered in this regard.</p>

 Actually, I would like to use the liver as an example of something that might be caught by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, because it does regenerate, particularly in young people.

 I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but that is not my understanding of the situation. I am told that it depends on how much of the liver is taken. A significant percentage can be taken, even from a young person, and the person will still survive with the remnants of their liver. Not all of their liver will grow back, however. The Minister needs to tell the House whether that would be the impact of the amendment that I have tabled. A kidney is perhaps another example. People have two kidneys, and if one were taken, a person would survive. I understand, however, that that would not be allowed under these provisions because it would involve a whole organ being removed. </p>

 Does the key distinction relate not to the difference between regenerative and other tissue, but to the invasive techniques that are required? These were referred to by the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd). Many of us would be content for stem cells from cord blood to be used, because that does not involve invasive techniques, but we have concerns about the necessity literally to invade the body of a child in order to provide some of the other kinds of tissue.</p>

 I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s point, but I would raise with him in response the issue of what would happen if a saviour sibling were born and the umbilical cord were wrapped around the baby&#146;s neck and had to be discarded. Is my hon. Friend suggesting that the parents would have to take a decision to have another saviour sibling that would generate the particular cord blood or other tissue required to save the elder child? I do not think that that would be acceptable, which is why I believe that invasive procedures such as removal of bone marrow should, as a last resort, be allowed for saviour sibling purposes.</p>

Would it include circumstances in which seriousness is diluted even further than I believe it is at the moment?

If there are any serious differences, the Committee should know what they are. I understand from lawyers&#151;I say this in response to an earlier intervention&#151;that neither &#147;serious&#148; nor &#147;quality of life&#148; provides the utopian phraseology that would be needed to ensure that this provision is drafted as tightly as it should be.</p>

 I am trying to be helpful, so I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for taking my intervention. He said that &#147;serious&#148; was not tight enough, as it was open to interpretation and was essentially subjective. However, the fact that it is open to interpretation is important in clinical practice, because doctors and patients together take decisions that are specific to their circumstances. That is what medical care is. Secondly, if &#147;serious&#148; is subjective&#151;not a bad thing when dealing with patients&#151;so is seriously impairing the &#147;quality of life&#148;. They are both subjective; one is no better than the other in that respect.</p>

 That is where we disagree. I think that my amendments are better because they are, in my view, tighter. I accept that there has to be some flexibility&#151;there was a debate in the other place about this issue&#151;in that we cannot have a list of specific diseases or illnesses that will be treated. I understand the decision taken not to accept that: it would be very difficult to agree the list in the first place; and as new techniques came along, the list might have to be amended, which would be complex.</p>

As I have said before, whole organs are prohibited, but I am still concerned about allowing the removal of parts of organs that might not grow back&#151;hence the issue of regeneration. As the hon. Member for South Derbyshire said, the issue of consent is also relevant. Indeed, consent is rightly viewed as the cornerstone of this legislation. Given that the child cannot possibly give consent, it would be interesting to know whether the consent of the parents overrides any particular ownership of tissue that the child may have. Adults can, of course, consent to kidney donation, but children and certainly saviour siblings cannot.</p>

It is similar to amendments Nos. 31 and 32, which were tabled by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. The general thrust of the Bill must be that it should last as long as the 1990 Act. It is a testament to the robustness of debate on that Act that it has lasted for so long. I am sure that the Minister and all other Members of the House who are interested in these issues do not want to have to return regularly to this legislative structure, although I fear that this is one of those areas that may need looking at as technologies and sciences develop.</p>

The HFEA licenses for treatment non-medical fertility services, storage and research, including&#151;correctly&#151;clinical trials.

 Let me try to explain the Government&#146;s thinking on clause 11 and schedule 2, and on the issues that have been raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80519-0017.htm_para9"><a name="08051949000126">The Bill sets out five purposes for which embryos can be tested, and a regulation-making power to amend them. One of the purposes is the creation of so-called saviour siblings. As we have observed this evening, that is an issue that provokes very strong feelings in people on both sides of the discussion. Some feel that the creation of a tissue-matched sibling is entirely appropriate to treat an affected child when it is the only treatment option, and that not to allow it would essentially impose a life sentence on the child. Others feel that, despite that, saviour siblings should not be permitted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80519-0017.htm_para10"><a name="08051949000127">Some parents with an affected child whose only treatment option&#151;perhaps because the child has an unusual tissue type&#151;relies on the creation of a tissue-matched sibling would feel very strongly that the Bill&#146;s proposals offer a practical solution. Having a child to satisfy a particular need, in this case the treatment of a sick sibling, is not uncommon. As the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) pointed out so eloquently on Second Reading, no one has a child solely for the child&#146;s own purposes. It is often done to satisfy the needs of parents to be parents, or the need for a brother or sister for an existing child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="80519-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08051949000128">Let us consider a family who are in that position. The parents love the existing child so much, and are so motivated to do whatever they can to protect that child, that they are willing to undertake embryo testing. Embryo testing is an invasive and expensive procedure, and such motivated parents are highly unlikely to be anything other than loving and supportive to any child born into their family.</p>

That would be a backward step, and it would prevent people from accessing treatment to which they currently have access. In practice, tissue-typing is only very occasionally carried out. As has been said, the HFEA has licensed tissue-typing only in a handful of cases, and always for life-threatening conditions. It considers applications for the process on a case-by-case basis, and we would expect it to continue to proceed on that basis. Where it has agreed to proceed&#151;for rare blood disorders&#151;tissue typing already takes place, but that is not specifically set out in the 1990 Act, and this Bill rectifies that. Tissue typing is a treatment of last resort, and while I acknowledge the concerns of many Members, in my opinion and that of the Government there is not sufficient justification to remove the last-chance treatment option for the sick children who would be affected by such a ban.</p>

 I touched on that point. I absolutely acknowledge that in these extremely difficult cases very hard choices have to be made by loving, caring parents about their families, but those same choices are made by parents who already have younger or older children and who, for example, give their consent now for a bone marrow transplant where an existing child might save another child in the family. So these hard choices sometimes have to be made whether or not such a child has been created through the process under discussion. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there are difficult issues that need to be considered, but they are not unique to the provisions in this Bill.</p>

 The hon. and learned Gentleman picks unfortunate phrases in articulating his point this evening. The proposition is that somehow parents would approach this matter lightly and that, in the occasions that we can examine, they have had other children in the hope that there would be a tissue match. It is incredibly unfortunate that they could possibly be accused of being disrespectful or of entering into breeding a child&#151;as he puts it&#151;in a cavalier or unreasonable way. I would also say to him that before the HFEA issues the licence, it has to satisfy itself, within the terms and conditions of the legislation, that such a licence should be provided. Consideration would be given to all the details, to the motivations and to the appropriateness of such a licence being given in order to deal with these difficult choices.

Embryo testing allows families with inherited genetic conditions to avoid passing on the particular condition that affects them. The HFEA has licensed more than 80 conditions for pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, including Huntington&#146;s disease, muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis. Three of the purposes for which an embryo can be tested relate specifically to medical conditions, and the Bill specifies that embryo testing for those three purposes can be done only when the condition is serious.</p>

Under the amendments, the embryo-testing provisions would be extended to allow the testing of combinations of genes, as well as genes that are not necessarily harmful on their own but could be in combination with another factor.

The Bill reflects current HFEA policy, and we are not aware of anyone having used the technology for the wider uses envisaged by the amendments to date. For some people, that type of testing would be considered a step too far. However, we recognise the desire for future-proofing of the legislation. Accordingly, we have allowed for that via a secondary power enabling the provisions relating to embryo testing to be amended in the future. Such regulations would be subject to the affirmative procedure. The amendments are not appropriate as they would allow testing for conditions that to date the HFEA has not licensed.

The Bill does not change that. The amendments tabled by the hon. Members for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) and for Oxford, West and Abingdon would add the further specific category of the licensing of the creation and use of embryos for therapy&#151;that is, the creation of embryos to generate embryonic stem cells for use in the treatment of disease that is not infertility related.</p>

However, the problem that the Minister seemed quite unwilling to address this evening was that once the pass has been sold, and the House and the Government have taken over the task of making those ethical judgments, they cannot be ducked. The right hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East said that the provision was not about designer children&#151;an argument echoed by the Minister. I have to say that their argument has an intellectual incoherence that is truly breathtaking. It cannot be argued that the provision is not about designer children, because the intention behind it is to design children who will fulfil the particular purpose of being able to help their siblings.

 My hon. and learned Friend is making a characteristically erudite and clever speech, but he disappoints me, because he seems to be trying to argue that someone is literally designing a child. That is not the case. We are talking about discovering something that already exists, and simply choosing one kind of cellular structure rather than another, one of which will deliver genetic abnormality or disability, and one of which will not. That is not designing a child. That is taking what is on offer in nature, and it is helping to design only in the sense of choosing what is best.</p>

 I have to say that I disagree with my hon. Friend. It is a selection of a design for a purpose. Moreover, I do not know whether he was present at the time, but the Minister made it quite clear that we are using the expression &#147;saviour sibling&#148; because the design intention is to help the sibling. Indeed, that is the purpose of the Bill. The aim is not to remove the possibility of a child having genetic problems of their own, but specifically to help another child.

For that reason, I shall certainly support the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes).

He needs a bone marrow transplant before the age of 10 to avoid a slow and lingering death within the following 20 years, when he will die from bone marrow failure or from leukaemia. There is no existing tissue match for David. All 12 million people worldwide who are members of bone marrow databases have been checked, but a match has not been found. If David were to have a bone marrow transplant from a mismatched donor, there would be a 30 per cent. chance that he would survive in the short term.

Should we not move heaven and earth, to cite the Minister&#146;s words, to ensure that we do not just throw away 98 per cent. of cord blood and so that we can use it as a resource to provide cures for fanconi anaemia without going down the ethically perilous route of saviour siblings?</p>

 This excellent debate has gone far and wide, well beyond the issue of saviour siblings. In fact, I am surprised that the debate has ended somewhat earlier than planned. Nevertheless, I should like to offer the following comments to the Minister and the Committee about my amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80519-0019.htm_para3"><a name="08051949000204">Amendments Nos. 24 to 30 question whether &#147;abnormality&#148; is the right term to use for the genetic characteristic to be tested in pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. I accept that, as the Minister said, my amendments go further than the provisions of the Bill. But I am concerned that the Bill may not go far enough to capture all the conditions that are not single-gene mutations, and therefore abnormalities, that one might legitimately want to test for with the same threshold of seriousness. The Minister says that we would need to provide examples in order to persuade her that the existing wording was not sufficient, and that is the challenge. If, for example, one could identify two normal variants&#151;causing a life-threatening disease&#151;that could not be called abnormalities, perhaps the Government would look at the matter again. I shall ask the clinical advisers whom I have been hearing from&#151;including Professor Martin Bobrow, who chaired the Academy of Medical Sciences working group into another aspect of the Bill&#151;whether they can provide some specific examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80519-0019.htm_para4"><a name="08051949000205">The second area is that of licences for therapy, which is dealt with by amendment No. 30 and associated amendments. I listened carefully to the Minister, who  <br>

made it clear that the Bill allows embryos to be created and used for research, which in itself should be sufficient to cover any therapeutic use. She gave a second reason, which I accept, that the therapeutic use of cells will be covered by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the Human Tissue Authority and not the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80519-0019.htm_para5"><a name="08051949000206">Moreover, any embryos from which stem cells are derived will inevitably have research associated with them, and therefore could be covered by a research licence. But I question whether that is the case in every situation. Briefly, I want to mention four scenarios and see whether the Minister recognises that there might be a problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80519-0019.htm_para6"><a name="08051949000207">There might be an organisation that is a specialist in the derivation of embryonic stem-cell lines in other jurisdictions, which applies to the HFEA for a licence to use embryos to create stem-cell lines that it intends to pass on to another organisation to use for research or therapy. How would such an applicant be able to specify what research was done if it is not doing the research? The current Bill requires the people producing the embryos to be the people associated with the research licences, which may stifle innovation, investment and the production of stem cells.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80519-0019.htm_para7"><a name="08051949000208">Secondly, cell-based therapy might be so well established in the future that only quality assurance need be carried out, without a research protocol, prior to therapy. In such a scenario, the embryo would be created and then used for therapy without a research step. The same distinction between quality assurance and audit on the one hand, and research on the other, is already made in the Human Tissue Act 2004 for the use of tissue. The Minister&#146;s argument depends on there being no possible therapeutic use that did not require a form of clinical or pre-clinical research on those cells, and I am not convinced that that is certain. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80519-0019.htm_para8"><a name="08051949000209">The assumption that the therapeutic use of ES cells will always follow formal research during the lifetime of the legislation is dangerous because if phase 1 and phase 2 trials are successful, there will be clinical pressure to use ES cells as experimental treatment, albeit licensed by the MHRA, outside of the phase 3 research protocol. Alternatively, phase 3 trials might be successful, and it would be questionable whether one could identify a proper research application, beyond quality assurance, within the subsequent use of the newly derived ES cell lines created under research licence. The Minister may say that that is dealt with, and if she agrees to put a summary of the legal advice in the Library, I shall look at it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="80519-0019.htm_para9"><a name="08051949000210">Finally, if therapeutic cloning works, it might be possible to provide autologous stem-cell therapy for a patient using their own somatic cells. That would be experimental therapy, not research, if it were used, and such a situation might apply in the lifetime of the Bill. I am concerned that the Government are not adequately future-proofing the Bill by accepting the relevant amendment, and we shall have to examine that question in the weeks to come. It is not my intention, however, to press it to a Division now.</p>

 I question whether the definition is tighter, but I do not believe that it should be because the decision should be left to doctors and patients, under the regulator&#146;s guidance. It is difficult for us to decide at the outset that something is not serious when the regulator, the doctor and the patient might consider it serious. When pre-natal diagnosis is done through amniocentesis, with an indication for termination of pregnancy, not at an embryonic but a foetal stage, weeks into the pregnancy, there are no criteria for seriousness. It is illogical to have a high threshold for embryonic steps to avoid illness when amniocentesis and pre-natal diagnosis in an established pregnancy require no such threshold. Doctors have written to me saying that they do not understand that distinction: why one can terminate a pregnancy without a seriousness threshold&#151;the doctors and patients decide&#151;when we set such a threshold for embryo testing, before a pregnancy is established.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80519-0019.htm_para11"><a name="08051949000214">Let me consider the important speech of the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) about the extent to which it is appropriate to conduct invasive procedures on a child to derive tissue for transplant to a sibling. I am a member of the BMA Medical Ethics Committee. The BMA wrote that it is not worried about that ethical problem because there is already provision for taking the child&#146;s best interests into account. In the case of disagreement by doctors and parents or between parents, a court must be involved. Paragraph 44 of the Human Tissue Authority code of practice states clearly, if briefly:</p>
<a name="80519-0019.htm_brev3"><a name="08051949000717"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Courts have identified certain important decisions which require court approval where one person with parental responsibility consents against the wishes of another. If there is any dispute between persons with parental responsibility or any doubt as to the child&#146;s best interest, the matter should be referred to court for approval.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80519-0019.htm_para12"><a name="08051949000215">Invasive procedure could be sanctioned only when there is no doubt that it is in the child&#146;s best interests. Of course, that is relevant to every sibling, not only the small minority of saviour siblings, who may be a match for an affected child. It is wrong to suggest, in the few cases that the Bill covers, that there is a problem with common law, medical ethics and the guidance to doctors about the best interests of a child for invasive procedures if we do not extend those provisions to the many more children in that position. The Bill strikes the right balance on saviour siblings and I urge hon. Members to bear that in mind.</p>

The family contest the allegations, and believe that neither of these allegations is sufficient to warrant children being forcibly adopted into another family.

 I have given the Minister prior notice of exactly what I intend to say to enable him better to respond directly to the points that I shall raise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para4"><a name="0805201001045">I need to put my concerns about the future of GP dispensing into the context of two broader points. The first is that my constituents are becoming increasingly angry and frustrated about what they see as a persistent attack by this Government on local services. Locally, we have seen post office closures, and we have been spared the closure of our local, consultant-led maternity unit and 24/7 children&#146;s wards at the Horton hospital thanks only to the intervention of the independent reconfiguration panel. Not surprisingly, my constituents are constantly asking what next public or community service will be taken away from them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para5"><a name="0805201001046">One of my constituents wrote to ask me to oppose the pharmacy White Paper, asking</p>

This village has lost its Post Office, and consequently its shop, is shortly to lose our next nearest Post Office, now our dispensary service is under threat. What will they destroy next?&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para6"><a name="0805201001047">Secondly, this debate has to be seen in the context of the Government&#146;s professed commitment to give NHS patients greater choice. After all, the Government have spent considerable amounts of money on ensuring that GPs have choose and book systems, the better to allow patients choice as to where they are treated. Indeed, last week, the Prime Minister in his statement on the draft legislative programme said:</p>
<a name="80519-0021.htm_brev7"><a name="0805201001103"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is right to make it&#148;&#151;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para8"><a name="0805201001049">If the Government genuinely want to give patients real power and control over services they receive, the least the Government could do is to allow people the freedom to decide where they would like their prescriptions dispensed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para9"><a name="0805201001050">At the moment, there are some 5,872 dispensing doctors in the UK in 1,365 practices. Overall, they look after more than 8 million patients, of whom 3.5 million are dispensing patients. For reasons that I shall explain, these GPs mainly have rural practices. They provide the enormous benefit that patients can visit their GP and, at one and the same place, have their drugs both prescribed and dispensed. That service is being threatened by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="st_o364"><a name="0805201001053"><a name="80519-0021.htm_spnew4"><a name="0805201002135"><b>Tony Baldry:</b>
 There are dispensing practices throughout England that are very concerned because it would seem that the Government wish to give pharmacies a monopoly on dispensing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para11"><a name="0805201001054">There is, I suspect, some history that needs to be understood. When the NHS was set up, its establishment was a huge undertaking and no doubt required a number of political compromises with a range of groups involved in health care including GPs and pharmacists. I suspect that the big retail chemist chains such as Boots said that they would co-operate with its establishment only if they were given a monopoly of prescribing drugs in urban areas. Almost from the NHS&#146;s inception, therefore, pharmacies had a monopoly on dispensing drugs in urban areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para12"><a name="0805201001055">Since then, almost every other similar professional monopoly has long been discarded. One only has to think of the revolution in eye care and opticians that occurred when opticians&#146; monopoly to sell spectacles was taken away. However, the Government not only intend to retain the pharmacies&#146; monopoly on dispensing, but are clearly intent on strengthening that monopoly, as evidenced in the White Paper &#147;Pharmacy in England&#148;, which the Department chose to publish during the Easter recess, so it did not get the publicity that it perhaps deserved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para13"><a name="0805201001056">The existing dispensing rules already lead to some fairly ludicrous results. Here, I declare some interests. I live in the village of Bloxham, in my constituency. It is some 4 miles from Banbury, dominated by the spire of its parish church. It is a self-contained village, surrounded by fields for some considerable distance. It is perhaps one of the few villages in England that is so much a village that the Warriner school in Bloxham even has its own school farm. The village has a very good GP practice and surgery, which also has a dispensary, so that patients who attend Bloxham surgery can also have their drugs dispensed there. I am a registered patient at that surgery, although I have to say that I am a very infrequent visitor, as whenever Dr. Martin Harris, my GP, sees me, he rightly tells me that I need to lose a couple of stone in weight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para14"><a name="0805201001057">A pharmacy chain has applied to open a chemist shop in Bloxham. I am sure that residents of Bloxham and the surrounding villages will be genuinely delighted if a chemist shop is opened in Bloxham. The village is fortunate in having a diverse range of local shops and a chemist shop would be genuinely welcome. However, under the existing rules, the application by a pharmacy to open in Bloxham was a trigger for the primary care trust to review whether Bloxham continues to be a rural area. If an organisation called the NHS Litigation Authority decrees it to be an urban area, any incoming pharmacist who sets up will be given a complete monopoly on dispensing and the GP practice will no longer be allowed to dispense drugs for Bloxham residents. That might also lead to the GP practice being forced to cease dispensing before the proposed new pharmacy has been established.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para15"><a name="0805201001058">The definition of what is rural is left to the individual primary care trust, but it is usually considered to be an area surrounded by open land with a limited number of shops or other facilities and poor transport infrastructure.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="19 May 2008">

<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>19 May 2008 : Column 135</b><br>
The decision is subject to appeal, and an oral hearing has been scheduled by the NHS Litigation Authority in July. Once determined, there is no further appeal short of judicial review, and the decision stands for five years unless there is a major change in circumstances. Bizarrely, should it be determined that Bloxham is no longer rural, the GP practice will be allowed to continue to dispense drugs to patients in other villages such as Barford St. Michael or Milcombe, but not Bloxham&#151;until the provisions of the Government&#146;s White Paper in due course kick in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para16"><a name="0805201001059">Put shortly, under the existing rules GPs may not dispense to patients who live within 1.6 km of a pharmacy or who are deemed to live in a non-rural area. Almost everyone living in Bloxham considers that being told by the Government that they no longer live in a village is pretty crazy. But what really causes offence is the thought that they will no longer have any choice as to where their drugs are dispensed, and that they will be compelled, whether they like it or not, to go to a new chemist to get their drugs dispensed. Bloxham residents are concerned that they will no longer be able to get their drugs dispensed by their own GP, as in the past, notwithstanding that that is far more convenient and that they only need to park once&#151;parking at the GP&#146;s surgery is considerably easier than having to park near the shops in Bloxham. Why not give patients choice?</p>

<p><a name="st_o365"><a name="0805201001060"><a name="80519-0021.htm_spnew5"><a name="0805201002136"><b>Mr. Edward Vaizey (Wantage) (Con):</b>
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. I represent the south of Oxfordshire in Wantage and I have been inundated with letters on the matter. Does my hon. Friend agree that choice is the key issue? My constituents focus on the point that although it might be right to relax the rules regarding pharmacies so that they can dispense more drugs and give some medical advice, it is wrong as a quid pro quo to close down GPs&#146; dispensaries. My constituents simply want choice, and surely that is what they should be given so that they can continue to use the dispensary if they so choose.</p>

<p><a name="st_o366"><a name="0805201001061"><a name="80519-0021.htm_spnew6"><a name="0805201002137"><b>Tony Baldry:</b>
 I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. The Government say that they are keen to give NHS patients as much choice as possible, so why not give them choice about where they have their drugs dispensed? Why take away patients&#146; ability to have their drugs dispensed at their GP surgery if they so wish? It seems that the Government will allow choice in the NHS when it suits them, and will not when it does not. Is it simply that the Government wish to give the impression of choice, freedom and new regulation, when in reality they are being increasingly dirigiste?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para17"><a name="0805201001062">One rationale given in the White Paper for the proposals was that present regulations do not take into account the distance that a patient must travel between the GP surgery and the chemist. The new proposals fail to address that, as the new regulations would still be unable to account for the distance a patient has to travel between their surgery, their home and the pharmacy. The solution proposed in the White Paper would simply result in fewer patients receiving the service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para18"><a name="0805201001063">I thought that the proposal to prevent the Bloxham GPs from dispensing drugs to local people was one of  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para23"><a name="0805201001070">The Government&#146;s White Paper, &#147;Pharmacy in England&#148;, was published during the Easter recess, as I mentioned earlier. Proposals in the White Paper, if implemented, would mean that any GP surgery with more than about 3,000 registered patients would not be able to dispense drugs. No GP surgery with a chemist within a mile of the surgery would be allowed to dispense drugs. The opportunity for dispensing doctors to continue dispensing would be completely dependent on whether a pharmacist decided to open a shop within a mile of their surgery. For example, the Montgomery House surgery in Bicester has a considerable number of patients who live in the surrounding villages. At present, if they need drugs prescribed and dispensed after a visit to their GP, it can all be done conveniently at the surgery. In future, if the Government have their way, my constituents will no longer have that opportunity or choice; they will be obliged to go elsewhere to have their drugs dispensed. Why?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para24"><a name="0805201001071">If doctors are prevented from dispensing, the resulting loss of income for the practice will in many instances also mean a reduction in patient services. At present, the income from dispensing subsidises other services&#151;for example, branch surgeries. Dispensing practices have examined the plans and foresee that they will have to close branch surgeries or make salaried GPs redundant. Where doctors are near retirement and sole practitioners, the prospect of surgery closure looms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para25"><a name="0805201001072">Is it all a ruse whereby the Government hope to help fund polyclinics? Will polyclinics be allowed to dispense drugs? Why does the chief executive of the OFT say in his analysis of the Government&#146;s failure to take on board the OFT&#146;s recommendations that the Government have</p>
<a name="80519-0021.htm_brev18"><a name="0805201001114"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;developed far-reaching plans for reshaping the NHS and as you know polyclinics are part of these plans&#148;?</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para26"><a name="0805201001073">During a recent debate on family doctor services, I intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), the shadow Secretary of State for Health, who was pointing out that the introduction of polyclinics could threaten existing GP surgeries. I observed that communities were also losing their dispensaries, and asked:</p>
<a name="80519-0021.htm_brev19"><a name="0805201001115"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Is my hon. Friend aware that 8.5 million patients are in GP practices that dispense drugs? Under the Government&#146;s White Paper on the future of pharmacy services it will be almost impossible for GPs to dispense drugs in the future. Why on earth remove patient choice in this way? This is yet another service that will be lost in villages in my constituency and colleagues&#146; constituencies.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80519-0021.htm_para27"><a name="0805201001074">My hon. Friend responded:</p>
<a name="80519-0021.htm_brev20"><a name="0805201001116"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Yes, I am interested in what my hon. Friend says because in one particular respect the effect of the pharmacy White Paper, which was published during the recess, may well be to undermine dispensing by dispensing doctors, and it may all be part of a common process by the Government. The polyclinics are expensive beasts; they cost about &#163;800,000 each, so money has to be raised for them. I suspect that in many cases the Government intend to ensure that they have a large pharmacy, which will take the pharmacy profits, and the dispensing doctors in local surgeries will lose out and shut down as a consequence.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 23 April 2008; Vol. 474, c. 1317.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="80519-0022.htm_para0"><a name="0805201001075">Given that a large number of polyclinics will be in urban areas, there can be no possible justification for the Government&#146;s allowing them to dispense drugs when they are not allowing GPs to dispense drugs. Do the Government intend to rewrite the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2005 to favour polyclinics?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="80519-0022.htm_para1"><a name="0805201001076">There seems to be no end to the Government&#146;s meddling in the NHS. There have been nine major reorganisations of the NHS since Labour came to power, at a cost of &#163;3 billion. The NHS is an institution that binds our nation together. In cities, towns and villages up and down the country, family doctor surgeries are part of the fabric of our community. The Government seem intent on imposing a polyclinic on every primary care trust area, which will inevitably put a substantial number of smaller local family doctor surgeries at risk. Again, if the Prime Minister is serious about the Government wanting to give patients &#147;real power and control&#148; over the service that they receive, why will the Government not let my constituents vote on whether they want a polyclinic imposed on Banbury?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80519-0022.htm_para2"><a name="0805201001077">Well over 1,000 GP practices in England will be destabilised as a consequence of the proposals in the Government White Paper on pharmacy. More than 8 million patients are registered with dispensing practices and thus potentially affected, and huge numbers of them will in future be denied choice about where, and by whom, their prescriptions are dispensed. It is estimated that between 5,000 and 7,000 staff employed in the dispensary and ancillary service areas of dispensing practices will be made redundant. That is a crazy situation. Will the Minister provide assurances that the Department will re-examine the proposals for dispensing doctors, and will he ensure that those appalling plans are not put into practice? Patient choice is allegedly a constant driver in all other aspects of Government health policy. Why not in dispensing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80519-0022.htm_para3"><a name="0805201001078">Dr. Laurence Buckman, the chairman of the general practitioner committee of the British Medical Association, tells me that the implications of the Government&#146;s pharmacy White Paper</p>
<a name="80519-0022.htm_brev0"><a name="0805201001117"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;could be very severe indeed. The result might well be to terminate the rights to dispense of a substantial number of practices who rely on their dispensing income to subsidise the rest of the practice&#146;s work. We believe that this could well mean that a lot of practices would cease to be financially viable and thus affect the provision of NHS services to their patients. This would be a perverse result of proposals that are intended to provide greater choice and access to patients.</p>
</ul><a name="80519-0022.htm_brev1"><a name="0805201001118"><ul><p class="tabletext">Paragraph 8.7.2 refers to &#145;transitional rules&#146; being required in the event that the loss of dispensing income financially destabilises a practice. &#145;Transitional&#146; implies that such resources would eventually be withdrawn and so practices are and will continue to be under the threat of closure as it is unlikely that existing NHS income could be increased to cover the loss of dispensing...dispensing practices are popular with patients and provide an excellent service. Given that there is no public demand for any changes to the current arrangements, we do question why the Government seem so determined to generate so much uncertainly and to potentially destabilise the provision of local services.&#148;</p>

<a name="80519-0022.htm_brev2"><a name="0805201001119"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in just about every patient survey that has been undertaken, dispensing practices are shown to be highly popular with patients.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) on securing this Adjournment debate, and point out that he has not given me much time to respond to the various points that he made. If I am not able to respond to them all directly, I will follow them up in writing. I thank him for giving me a copy of his speech in advance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80519-0022.htm_para6"><a name="0805201001082">I should like to begin by responding to the challenge, &#147;What next?&#148; Record levels of sustained investment in the NHS&#151;that is what is coming next for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents. Continued record levels of investment in his local schools&#151;that is what is coming next. Measures that brought an end to mass unemployment will continue under this Government; that is what is coming next for his constituents. I assume that his constituents will benefit from free off-peak travel for pensioners, and from the winter fuel allowance, which was introduced by this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80519-0022.htm_para7"><a name="0805201001083">Of course, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents, and those of the hon.

There will be evening and weekend opening; I am sure that the constituents of the hon. Member for Banbury will welcome that, too. It is interesting that he did not refer to the fact that there is a clear dividing line between the Government and Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition on the issues. The Leader of Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition has clearly stated that future decisions about primary care should be in the hands of the British Medical Association. The Government&#146;s policy is that future decisions about primary care should be in the hands of patients. That is the nature of the health service that we seek&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="80519-0022.htm_para8"><a name="0805201001086">That is the nature of the health service that we seek to create. The idea that the Government have an agenda to impose polyclinics on a one-size-fits-all basis in every community in every part of the country is utter nonsense. That is disingenuous, because it is not the Government&#146;s position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="80519-0022.htm_para9"><a name="0805201001087">On behalf of his constituents, the hon. Member for Banbury has raised a number of valid and legitimate points, which I shall deal with. On Bloxham, the current regulations covering NHS pharmaceutical services have been in place since April 2005. They replaced previous systems, which existed in one form or another since 1948&#151;indeed, I understand that the regulations on rural areas can be traced back to 1936.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="19 May 2008">

<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>19 May 2008 : Column 140</b><br>
The latest regulations implement a series of measures that were agreed between pharmacy and medical representative bodies back in 2001. It is important for the House to bear in mind the fact that the regulations that gave rise to the local PCT&#146;s decision about which the hon. Gentleman is concerned are based on that accord between representatives of doctors and pharmacists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="80519-0022.htm_para10"><a name="0805201001088">It is a long-standing general precept, which all Governments have endorsed since the NHS came into being, that doctors prescribe medicines and pharmacists dispense them. In that way, patients receive the benefits of both professions&#146; expert advice, intervention and care. I have used the term &#147;general precept&#148; very carefully. We all agree that both medical and pharmaceutical services have developed significantly since 1948. Our White Paper set out ways in which pharmaceutical services should and will grow in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="80519-0022.htm_para11"><a name="0805201001089">It is also possible that a community pharmacy is simply not a viable proposition in every part of the country, especially in rural areas. Patients need to receive their NHS-prescribed medicines promptly and efficiently, which is where dispensing doctors can play a vital role by allowing patients to collect their medicines from a surgery&#146;s dispensary without undertaking a lengthy journey to the nearest pharmacy. In the vast majority of cases, if the patient wishes to receive the services of a dispensing doctor, they need to live in a designated controlled locality&#151;the hon. Gentleman has raised that point. The local PCT determines whether a particular area is rural or not. When it does so, it invites views from interested parties locally. Whatever the PCT decides, the decision can be appealed to an independent body, the NHS Litigation Authority, which is genuinely independent. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the question is whether Bloxham is rural in character. An appeal against the PCT decision has been lodged with the NHS Litigation Authority, and every opportunity will be given for people, including the hon. Gentleman, to make appropriate representations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="80519-0022.htm_para12"><a name="0805201001090">The hon. Gentleman has referred to the OFT. He has accused the Government of ignoring the OFT&#146;s recommendations on community pharmacy services, which we did not do. We responded in July 2003 and did not accept the case for full deregulation. We decided to move cautiously in the recommended direction, and we announced a balanced package of reforms to the regulatory system. We introduced those reforms in 2005 and reviewed their operation in 2006. Overall, we have found that they opened up the market as intended without destabilising it, but the impact was genuinely uneven. The tendency for pharmacies that are open for at least 100 hours a week to cluster near each other in some places is considered in the White Paper, which is why we have introduced proposals for further reform and why we did not fully deregulate as the OFT wanted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="80519-0022.htm_para13"><a name="0805201001091">On the reference by the OFT&#146;s chief executive to GP-led health centres, I cannot say what was intended by the reply that the hon. Gentleman received, and I am sure that the chief executive&#146;s office will be pleased to help him further. GP-led health centres are designed to extend choice and offer convenient services.
