 Obesity, especially among children, is a threat to their health, to the NHS and to the economy. The World Health Organisation, the World Cancer Research Fund and the Government&#146;s expert scientists have warned that obesity is a problem of potentially epidemic proportions and that drastic action is needed if millions of young lives are not to be blighted and billions of pounds drained from the NHS and the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o3"><a name="80425-0001.htm_para3"><a name="08042574000072">The impact of obesity on Britain has been likened to climate change: a disaster for the lives of individuals, our health service and the economy. Today, in Britain, one in three children are classified as overweight or obese. More than nine out of 10 children consume too much saturated fat; more than eight out of 10 too much sugar; and more than seven out of 10 too much salt. The Government&#146;s foresight report has predicted that between half and two thirds of all our children will be overweight or obese if current trends continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="80425-0001.htm_para4"><a name="08042574000073">The estimated cost of the rise of obesity in cash terms is put at &#163;45 billion a year if no action is taken. Diabetes UK tells us that, unless action is taken, the incidence of type 2 diabetes will rise by 70 per cent., and of strokes by 30 per cent. and coronary heart disease by 20 per cent. Massive funding to advertise and promote junk foods&#151;&#163;800 million a year&#151;is undermining the efforts of parents to control the food and sugary drinks that children take. As a former Minister with some responsibility for the advertising industry, I am pleased to introduce a Bill that will reinforce parents&#146; efforts and make it easier to encourage healthier eating to benefit children and the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="80425-0001.htm_para5"><a name="08042574000074">There is no single solution to childhood obesity, but everyone except the food and advertising industries agrees that tougher regulations and restrictions on how unhealthy foods are marketed to children are essential. Even the advertising industry concedes that such regulations would make an impact, otherwise it would not oppose the Bill so vigorously.</p>

<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="08042574000075"><a name="80425-0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="08042574000712"><b>Philip Davies (Shipley) (Con):</b>
 The hon. Gentleman says that everyone accepts that the Bill is needed to tackle childhood obesity, yet a recent opinion poll showed that 76 per cent. of the public thought that the restrictions would make no difference whatever to childhood obesity levels. I am not entirely sure how he has worked out that everybody agrees with him. On what basis does he take that view?</p>

<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="08042574000076"><a name="80425-0001.htm_spnew3"><a name="08042574000713"><b>Nigel Griffiths:</b>
 It is the case because having listened to people, I have introduced a Bill that is a compromise. I am sure that if those people were polled on even tougher regulations, they would say that they would have an effect. As we are trying to reach a compromise, we have introduced a Bill that is practical and proportionate. I am sorry if members of the public feel that even tougher action is needed, and I certainly would not hesitate to introduce a Bill that would achieve it.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that this is a very difficult subject to get right? There are a number of changes and improvements that one can make to help to deal with the problem, but does he recognise that more parental responsibility is important? What does he think could be done to educate parents and ensure that more of them take a responsible line in feeding their children and seek to minimise the problems of obesity?</p>

 I certainly agree with the hon. Member, and I shall tell him what I think can be done. We can diminish the pester power that children exert on their parents, which is fostered by an advertising and food marketing industry that has already been caught using websites that were so unacceptable to the public that even some of the largest companies in Britain had to pull them. I hope that there is support for backing parental responsibility, which is one of the primary aims of my Bill.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing that out, and for his continuous support for the Bill. It is a direct response to what I believe parents want, but more importantly, it is also a response to the scientific review that our Government carried out, which reported towards the end of last year. The foresight report of last October chillingly warned that a substantial degree of intervention was required to have an impact on the rising trend of obesity.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for being generous in allowing interventions. I wanted to stop him when he talked about little children&#146;s pester-power about food. On the basis of seeing my own child and those of parents whom I know, it is clear to me that pester power definitely applies to toys, but does it apply to food? I have never heard the phrase, &#147;I&#146;ve got to have that packet of crisps.&#148; Children may want a packet of crisps, but it will not necessarily be a packet of Walkers crisps. I do not agree that children are so motivated by food advertising. In the end, it is the mum who does the shopping, or maybe the dad, but definitely not the child.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that pestering is not just for specific products, but for such things as McDonald&#146;s burgers or Kentucky Fried Chicken? Many of us have had to say to our children, &#147;I am not taking you there,&#148; but they see such places on the television.

 I thank my hon. Friend for being so generous in giving way. Before I came to the House I did work in the community, part of which was about parents and food. The message that I received from parents was that children would eat only the foods that they recognised and that, unfortunately, recognition came largely from television. The other problem that parents had was the accessibility of different foods. Many of them without cars found themselves having to shop at corner shops, which rely on highly advertised foods rather than fresh and affordable foods.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on his success in the ballot and on introducing the Bill. In response to the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride), I point out that when the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) and I served on the Select Committee on Health some half a dozen years ago or so, we conducted an inquiry on obesity. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman remembers it well, as he played a very constructive role. He will recall that we came across a company&#151;I have a pretty clear impression that it was Kellogg&#146;s, and if it was not I apologise unreservedly&#151;that had on its website a marketing strategy that actually encouraged the use of pester power. It quoted it as a strategy for selling its products. That pester power clearly applied to children, not adults.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That report was critical in ensuring that the Government&#146;s views on obesity were taken seriously and that, more importantly, society and Parliament took obesity seriously. More recently, Which? produced two reports. One was &#147;Food Fables&#148;, on the myths that the industry had put out about how responsible its marketing was. My hon. Friend has given one example, and I shall give another later. The other report was &#147;Cartoon Heroes and Villains&#148;, on the use of cartoons by such companies to lure children into having more of their products than is healthy. The views of my hon.

 The term used in the Bill, &#147;less healthy food&#148;, is fairly subjective, but I assume that it would encapsulate products such as those of McDonald&#146;s. The Bill refers not just to broadcast advertising but to point-of-sale material. Youngsters walking down Victoria street past McDonald&#146;s would come to one of those plastic Ronald McDonald characters, which I suspect would be made illegal under the Bill. Does the hon. Gentleman really want to go down in history as the man who killed Ronald McDonald?</p>

 I do not want to go down in history&#151;I am sure that this is true of the hon. Gentleman, too&#151;as the person who put the health of our advertising industry and of McDonald&#146;s before the health of our children. He is mistaken, because there is nothing subjective about the provision. Clause 2(1) clearly refers to the Food Standards Agency definition of foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar.</p>

Members who signed the early-day motion cannot be with us today, because they are campaigning in the London mayoral elections or in their local council elections. I have received apologies from strong supporters of the Bill on both sides of the House. I am especially grateful to Which?, Cancer Research UK, Diabetes UK, Sustain, the Children&#146;s Food Campaign, the British Heart Foundation, the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing, the National Union of Teachers, Unison and many others for their support for the Bill, which aims to control the advertising, marketing and promotion of less healthy food and drink products to children.</p>

What a generation ago was a treat&#151;a bar of candy, a box of chocolates or a fizzy drink&#151;is now taken for granted. Economic prosperity has made such treats commonplace. Of course, that is not enough for some companies, which have commissioned labs to come up with artificial smells outside food shops to act as a magnet to pressurise shoppers&#151;at such outlets what smells fresh is totally artificial. It is difficult for children, who must learn that items that were treats to my generation are, when taken in quantity, damaging to their health.</p>

 My hon. Friend has focused on the impact on obesity in children of consuming junk food and the influence of advertising. Does he accept that the consumption of junk food can have a significant impact on children&#146;s behaviour in terms of attention deficit disorder, which can occur if they consume food containing lots of additives, and hyperglycaemia?

Clause 2 refers to &#147;less healthy&#148; products, as defined by proposed section 7(c) to the Food Standards Act 1999&#151;such foodstuffs are high in fat, sugar or salt. It specifies that such foods should not be advertised, marketed or promoted between the hours of 5.30 am and 9 pm. The 9 pm watershed has been selected for two reasons. First, evidence cited in the Ofcom report indicates that, among all the options that it examined two years ago, a 9 pm watershed would screen out up to 95 per cent. of junk food advertisements from popular TV programmes watched by children. Secondly, the 9 pm watershed is already accepted for TV adverts for gambling. I commend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions for his work in his former post as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, when he achieved that watershed by threatening legislation. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport will not hesitate to do the same to protect our children&#146;s health.</p>

 The hon. Member is right. With the exception of one or two hon. Members, the whole House knows that there has been a long-term decline in the commissioning of children&#146;s programmes by UK companies. That is part of the argument that has been deployed against the Bill, but the bad news for the people who have deployed that argument is that the Bill is not law and that that has been the trend for the past decade, which has nothing to do with advertising restrictions.</p>

 Since the advertising restrictions were introduced, children&#146;s television commissioning has fallen off a cliff. The BBC effectively has a monopoly, which nobody wants, while other channels only carry American imports. Is the hon. Gentleman going to put the health of American television ahead of the health of British television?</p>

 The hon. Member is advocating putting the health of American television before the health of British children. His hyperbole, as a journalist, does him no credit, because the truth is that prior to the restrictions&#151;they were rather small, and came in only in summer last year&#151;all the evidence showed that tens of millions of pounds&#146; worth of children&#146;s programming was no longer being commissioned in Britain, and that was the case before a single bit of legislation had been put in place. Small and welcome steps have been taken so far and they are being evaluated in full by Ofcom. However, Ofcom&#146;s evidence indicates that less than half of the programmes watched by young children are affected by the restrictions, which is why they are not very effective.</p>

 It is fairly obvious that not everyone agrees with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Bill&#151;there is a fair amount of disagreement. Given that there is already a ban on advertising during children&#146;s programmes, would it not be more appropriate to determine whether that ban is effective? If that were determined to be the case, he might be better able to persuade those of us who are extremely sceptical and think that this is just a &#147;something must be done&#148; Bill, rather than a Bill that will have any effect; indeed, this Bill might even have perverse consequences. We could then move forward in the knowledge that some science backs up the Bill.</p>

 My hon. Friend could not be more right, and could not speak on a subject more dear to my heart. Early on in my time in the House, I sought to bring in a Bill introducing a traffic-light system. I commend Sainsbury&#146;s for introducing a system of that sort, but I am critical of Tesco&#146;s failure to use a simple colour-coding device. He is right that there is opposition to the traffic-light system, and when those who are opposed to it think that they have been overwhelmed by public opinion, they then seek to confuse us, as Tesco is seeking to do.</p>

The Conservative Front Bencher the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey) asserted that the Bill somehow backs American TV over British TV, but that is a ludicrous assertion. The opposite is true. The non-commercial BBC channels, CBBC and CBeebies, provide plenty of space for domestically produced television programmes, whereas the commercial channels&#151;CiTV and the others&#151;are dominated by American material, so the reverse of what the hon.

There is a very good example of good corporate responsibility in my constituency, in the national headquarters of Kraft Foods. It has run a responsible promotion aimed at children, called Health 4 Schools. It is about promoting healthy cooking and eating in schools. It has resisted making any association with the many confectionery products produced by Kraft. If I have one concern about the Bill, it is with clause 2, which refers to associations.

It was carried out by Sustain, the food campaign group, and the Mental Health Foundation. They concluded that the changing nature of people&#146;s diets had a significant impact on mental health and could be linked to the rise in mental illness in the past 50 years.</p>

It cited the introduction of pesticides in foods and also the intensive farming of, for example, chickens, which now reach their slaughter weight twice as fast as they did 30 years ago. That means that the fat content is 22 per cent. rather than 2 per cent. The balance of vital fatty acids, such as Omega 3 and Omega 6, in chickens has also been altered. That is not specifically the point of the Bill, but we need to take account of not only the food that we can readily identify as unhealthy, but other food, which is becoming increasingly less nutritious and healthy.</p>

A controlled experiment was conducted in the United States in a jail for chronic offenders aged between 13 and 17. Many of the boys there were found to be deficient in specific nutrients. For example, they consumed on average only 63 per cent. of the iron, 42 per cent. of the magnesium, 39 per cent. of the zinc and 39 per cent. of the vitamin B12 in the US Government&#146;s recommended daily allowance. The researchers conducted a trial in which half the inmates were treated with placebos and half were given capsules that contained the missing nutrients. They also gave the prisoners advice on how to improve their diets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80425-0002.htm_para19"><a name="08042574000156">As a result of the trial, the number of violent incidents caused by inmates in the control group, which took the placebos, fell by 56 per cent., and those caused by prisoners in the experimental group, which took the capsules, fell by 80 per cent. However, there was no reduction among the inmates who took the placebos but refused to improve their diets. It is therefore clear that those who took the capsules benefited most, those who voluntarily changed their diets showed the second most notable change in behaviour, but those who did not change their diets showed no change.</p>

 I am following the hon. Lady&#146;s argument with interest. The problem with the Bill is that Brian Young of Exeter university did a study of the effects of food advertising on children&#146;s food choices, and found that their food acceptance patterns and eating preferences developed in infancy, before they came under any influence of advertising. Whether her point is right or wrong, advertising food products makes no difference to the tastes that the children have developed.</p>

Specific types of food are unhealthy if one eats too much of them. Eating a McDonald&#146;s will not shorten one&#146;s life, whereas, as the film, &#147;Super Size Me&#148; demonstrated, a diet of nothing but McDonald&#146;s probably will. That is a question of education and, to some extent, common sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="80425-0003.htm_para6"><a name="08042574000168">Attention has been paid to efforts to inform consumers about what is healthy, and considerable progress has been made. The hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Jim Dowd) mentioned guideline daily amounts&#151;GDAs. I do not share his concern about whether they are an effective means of educating consumers or cause confusion; I believe that they are useful. They indicate clearly percentages that are regarded as healthy. It does not take much common sense to work out whether a product contains too high an amount of a substance. However, there are two competing systems and doubtless, in time, consumers will make it clear which one they find easier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="80425-0003.htm_para7"><a name="08042574000169">The food industry has also worked hard. It is easy to demonise food manufacturers as wanting to pump out quantities of unhealthy food and force feed our children with it. It is worth paying tribute to food manufacturers for what has been achieved in the past few years. In 2005, the Food and Drink Federation surveyed its leading members and found that 36 per cent. of products, worth approximately &#163;7.4 billion, contained lower amounts of salt than they did in 2004. To give just two companies as examples, between 2005 and 2007, Nestl&#233; reduced the volume of salt in its food manufacture by 13.6 per cent., the volume of sugar by 12.3 per cent. and the volume of fat by 15.6 per cent. Mars, which has achieved a great deal, reviewed its snack portfolio in 2002 and set out to reduce trans fatty acids in products that had a content of above 1 per cent. That has resulted in an average reduction in trans fatty acids of 72 per cent. Now more than 99 per cent. of Mars&#146;s snack food sales contain less than 0.5 per cent. That represents a reduction in the use of trans fatty acids of more than 3,500 tonnes across its snack food portfolio.</p>

 We should make it plain that the Food and Drink Federation is not an impartial academic centre, but the mouthpiece of the very companies that the hon. Gentleman mentions, such as Mars, Nestl&#233; and Kellogg&#146;s. He says that people will come to a conclusion on whether GDAs or traffic lights are easier to understand, but how does he respond to the work of the Consumers Association and the Food Standards Agency? They have done tests on both systems and found that the recognition level for traffic lights is more than 90 per cent., whereas the recognition level for the information garnered from GDAs is below 10 per cent. </p>

If they decided that they still wanted to purchase the product, it would not damage them, as long as they recognised that they probably should not eat another packet within the next 24 hours. One has to give some credit to the intelligence of consumers and their ability to reach judgments when they are given the information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="80425-0003.htm_para8"><a name="08042574000172">The other point that I would make to the hon. Gentleman is this. It is very easy to say that any trade body representing an industry is completely unreliable and that one should not believe anything that it says in defence of its members. However, I take it that he is not disagreeing that the food manufacturers have made huge progress in reducing in their products the content of the more damaging substances, such as salt, sugar and trans fatty acids in particular. Just because the FDF has pointed out that that has been achieved does not mean that we should not commend the food manufacturers for doing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="80425-0003.htm_para9"><a name="08042574000173">As well as giving consumers the information that allows them to make a judgment, we could also give the public more opportunities to work off the calories that they have taken in, through sporting activities. There is a danger that people will tend to focus on criticising the advertisers and food manufacturers because they do not want to face up to what would be a much more effective strategy, namely putting more money into sport and encouraging children to go out and take physical activity. The Government are vulnerable on that issue, because the amount of money available for sport across the country will be reduced, owing to the black hole of the Olympic games, which is sucking lottery money in. That has resulted in less money being available for Sport England to spend on sporting facilities outside London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="80425-0003.htm_para10"><a name="08042574000174">One should pay especial tribute to the private sector on the money that it puts into sport. Without that money, sporting clubs up and down the country would be considerably poorer. I should like to pick out two companies in particular. The first is McDonald&#146;s, whose record of supporting amateur football up and down the country is second to none. Every year, McDonald&#146;s sponsors junior football coaches who do a tremendous amount in voluntary sports and football clubs, training young people and encouraging them to take up the game. Presumably the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South would wish to prevent that under the terms of his Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="80425-0003.htm_para11"><a name="08042574000175">The other food manufacturer to which I should like to pay tribute is Kellogg&#146;s, which for 10 years has sponsored the Amateur Swimming Association, putting millions of pounds into swimming, to encourage young people to take part, get in pools, learn to swim, enjoy swimming and make it part of their exercise regime. The danger is that the measures that the hon. Gentleman is proposing would prevent companies that invest in sport from continuing to do so. That would be damaging, which is precisely the opposite effect to that which he seeks to achieve.</p>

Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) has already referred to one or two perverse outcomes of nutrient profiling.

 My hon. Friend is entirely right. My children grew up eating cereals&#151;I imagine that most parents in this country had the same experience&#151;and I agree that that restriction is a perverse result.

That exercise was conducted over two years and produced voluminous reports. As a result, Ofcom concluded that food advertising had</p>

Ofcom went as far as children aged 15, which I was concerned about, since that would affect, for instance, music channels such as MTV, as well as programming specifically for children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="80425-0003.htm_para16"><a name="08042574000184">That was the decision that Ofcom reached, although it recognised that it would come with a cost attached. The cost was removal of some &#163;20 million in revenue from the commercial broadcasters that they would otherwise have received in advertising around UK children&#146;s programming. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South was right to say that the problems facing UK children&#146;s programming predate the advertising ban. Investment in UK children&#146;s programming has been in decline for some six or seven years. Indeed, between 2001 and 2006  <br>

it fell by 56 per cent., from &#163;62 million to &#163;27 million. However, we can see from those figures that if another &#163;20 million is removed by the ban already in place, a huge hole is left. The consequence is that investment in UK children&#146;s programming in the commercial sector is now essentially dead. The hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) is right to say that excellent children&#146;s programming is available on the BBC. CBeebies, CBBC and the main terrestrial channels offer children&#146;s programming of a very high quality.</p>

It is not desirable that all other programming on the commercial channels directed at children should be American or Japanese imports. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey) is right, and it is why the Select Committee concluded that there was a case for intervention, using public money, to support the provision of children&#146;s programming in the commercial sector.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman demonstrates his usual foresight by anticipating the exact point that I was about to make. Ofcom decided that the specific restrictions that are now in place, and the money that would be lost as a result, were a price worth paying. The restrictions were therefore put in place last year. At the same time, as the hon. Gentleman rightly points out, Ofcom considered the proposal in the Bill for a complete pre-9 o&#146;clock watershed ban. It said that it had</p>
<a name="80425-0003.htm_brev3"><a name="08042574000610"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;considered the option of excluding all HFSS advertising before the 9pm watershed.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="80425-0003.htm_para18"><a name="08042574000189">It recognised that that would remove 82 per cent. of recorded HFSS advertising impacts on all children, which would achieve one of the key regulatory objectives, that of significantly reducing the impact of HFSS advertising on younger children. Based on data provided by the FSA, Ofcom recognised that that would have social health benefits of perhaps &#163;50 million to &#163;200 million a year. However, Ofcom also concluded that</p>
<a name="80425-0003.htm_brev4"><a name="08042574000611"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;this option would also undermine two other regulatory objectives. Most importantly, it would impose a disproportionate impact upon broadcasters, given that television advertising only has a modest impact upon food preferences. We estimate that the exclusion of HFSS advertising up to 9pm would cost broadcasters somewhere between &#163;130 million-&#163;240 million in lost advertising...Secondly, rather than being a targeted measure on younger children, its effect would be to restrict the viewing of audiences other than younger children.&#148;</p>

obesity-related diseases at some &#163;49 billion a year? In being concerned about advertisers, we are not perhaps getting our priorities right.</p>

 If I thought that bringing in a pre-9 pm ban would remove the problem of obesity and save the nation &#163;49 billion, I would be first in the queue to support the Bill, but I simply do not believe that it would have that effect. It is easy to say that the opposition to the Bill comes from multinational food producers such as McDonald&#146;s and Nestl&#233;. I draw the House&#146;s attention to a letter sent to Members on behalf of ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, Sky and Virgin Media Television. It states:</p>
<a name="80425-0003.htm_brev6"><a name="08042574000613"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Such a ban would have a major and dramatic impact on our companies&#146; ability to fund programming and invest in original UK production&#151;without achieving significant health benefits. There is no...evidence that advertising restrictions can have a major impact on obesity, and academic research has concluded that advertising has modest direct effects of maybe 2 per cent.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="80425-0003.htm_para20"><a name="08042574000193">We cannot go ahead with a measure that will have such a dramatic effect on the commercial television sector, when there is very little evidence that it will achieve its objectives.</p>

 What is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s opinion on the advertising of alcohol and cigarette products? It is generally accepted that such advertising should be restricted, presumably because otherwise young people would be encouraged to smoke and drink more alcohol. What is the difference between those products and food products?</p>

<p><a name="st_o74"><a name="08042574000195"><a name="80425-0003.htm_spnew14"><a name="08042574000784"><b>Mr. Whittingdale:</b>
 There are differences, but the hon. Lady raises an interesting point. It is worth considering whether it is right in a free society to say that certain products are legal and people have the right to choose to consume them if they wish to do so, but to ban completely any advertising of them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o75"><a name="08042574000196"><a name="80425-0003.htm_spnew15"><a name="08042574000785"><b>Mr. Vaizey:</b>
 Is my hon. Friend aware that there is no evidence that a total ban on advertising alcohol has any effect on alcohol consumption? It is slightly odd for Labour Members to be pious about alcohol advertising when they introduced 24-hour drinking and a binge-drinking culture in this country.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a strong point. As I had the honour of representing the Opposition during the passage of the relevant Bill, I can remember expressing some concern at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="80425-0003.htm_para21"><a name="08042574000198">Whether one chooses to smoke is a matter of freedom of choice, and I certainly do not favour banning cigarettes. Indeed, I opposed the smoking ban, but I accept that the evidence is overwhelming that smoking even one cigarette is bad for people and they risk damaging health consequences. That is not the case for eating a McDonald&#146;s. If people eat one McDonald&#146;s, it will not shorten their life. It is a question of proportion and the extent to which people overeat McDonald&#146;s or live on nothing but McDonald&#146;s. Therefore, there is a big difference between so-called unhealthy foods and products such as cigarettes, where even one is probably bad for one&#146;s health.</p>

 What is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s opinion on a 9 pm watershed for gambling advertising?</p>

<p><a name="st_o78"><a name="08042574000200"><a name="80425-0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="08042574000788"><b>Mr. Whittingdale:</b>
 Again, gambling is a different issue, but I wish to address the issue of the 9 pm watershed. The Bill picks out the 9 pm watershed as the appropriate time to draw the line&#151;everything banned before 9 pm and complete freedom afterwards. However, the 9 pm watershed is becoming meaningless. It was created in the days when viewers had a choice of two or three channels and, yes, most children probably were in bed by 9 pm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="80425-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08042574000201">Several things have changed since then. I wish that my children were in bed by 9 pm, but time and again they are not. I have a 14-year-old son&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I have previously revealed some of his tastes in films and music, probably not endearing myself to him in the process, but I can say that one of his favourite programmes&#151;and this is a confession&#151;is &#147;Skins&#148;. It is an extremely good programme that resonates with teenagers. It is made for them&#151;perhaps for teenagers slightly older than my son&#151;and appeals greatly to 13 and 14-year-olds, yet it is broadcast at 11 o&#146;clock at night. I can tell the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South that I am not quite such a negligent parent as to allow my son to watch television at midnight, but, like a growing number of households in this country, mine has a personal video recorder, so my son watches the programme on the PVR. He sets it and can then watch it any time. The ability to do that is increasingly destroying the meaning of the 9 o&#146;clock watershed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="80425-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08042574000202">We are now in the age of PVRs, which make time shifting so simple that we no longer have to pore over the <i> Radio Times </i>and punch in numbers; we can time shift with one button. We are now getting video on demand, which means that we can call down programmes at a time of our own choosing. Focusing on the 9 o&#146;clock watershed as somehow protecting children from exposure to late-night programmes is increasingly becoming irrelevant and ineffectual. For that reason, I believe that the Bill will not achieve the objectives that its promoter seeks.</p>

 My hon. Friend, wearing his Select Committee hat, knows a lot about the advertising industry and the gambling industry. Does he have any evidence that the incidence of childhood gambling has reduced as a result of the 9 o&#146;clock watershed?</p>

 The question is a little premature. Gambling advertising has only just been permitted on television, so there is not much evidence as yet. Children are not allowed in gambling establishments anyway and they are prevented from online gambling because they have no access to credit cards&#151;and those are much more effective measures. I entirely accept that it is important to protect children from gambling, but we can already take effective measures to achieve that without preventing advertising, which is intended to inform adults and allow them to take rational decisions based on the information they receive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="80425-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08042574000205">It is important to stress that advertising is not brainwashing.

depends completely on advertising, because only through advertising are consumers given the knowledge they need to reach judgments about which products they want to buy. Advertising has a very important part to play in a market, which is why we need to be extremely careful before adopting measures to restrict it.</p>

 I am not sure that I would agree that it is necessarily very damaging. I would have to confess my almost complete ignorance&#151;obviously unlike my hon. Friend!&#151;of the different types of cannabis; but strong advocate of advertising as I am, I am not sure that we should be making that information widely available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="80425-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08042574000208">Let me conclude by returning to the main theme. The Select Committee conducted an inquiry at the end of last year into the future of public service broadcasting&#151;a very serious issue. I believe that it is extremely important for the healthy functioning of democracy that there should be plurality, so public service programming should not be monopoly of the BBC. Public service programmes&#151;the news, current affairs, documentaries, children&#146;s programming, regional programming&#151;should also be available on the commercial channels, but we have to recognise that those channels are under pressure to an extent that they have never been before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="80425-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08042574000209">A revolution is taking place in this country&#146;s broadcasting, which I welcome, as it will result in a huge increase in viewer choice. The Government are the catalyst as a result of their courageous decision to proceed with the switch-off of analogue broadcasting, but digital switchover will result in the fragmentation of audiences and an inevitable decline in the market share of every single broadcaster. That will have huge financial consequences for those broadcasters, some of which we are already seeing, with Channel 4 telling the Government that it might not be able to sustain its business model without future financial help. ITV has asked the Government about withdrawing from some of its regional programming commitment and ceasing to commission UK-produced children&#146;s programming. The Select Committee thus believed that there was a case for Government intervention to sustain public service programming.</p>

 Is it not striking that, although we know the consequences on commercial broadcasters of such a ban on advertising, no supporter of the Bill has been able to give any indication of how much childhood obesity will be reduced as a result of it? Perhaps that is because, as they may concede themselves, the Bill may make no difference to childhood obesity levels, even though we know that its impact on commercial broadcasters will be devastating.</p>

led to a sudden reduction in obesity. In fact, the levels have normally tended to increase. Such evidence and research as there is actually goes to show that advertising restrictions have extremely little, if any, impact on obesity.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that what probably has a much greater impact on obesity is how much television children watch? Would it not have been better to bring in controls over the amount of TV that children can watch rather than control advertising?</p>

 My hon. Friend is showing alarming interventionist tendencies for a Tory! I have to say that that is unlike him; he is usually a great believer in freedom and libertarianism. I agree with him, however, that one of the key solutions in this area is the exercise of parental responsibility; it is parents who should be determining what their children eat and, equally, how much television they watch. I do not believe that that role is appropriate for the Government, but if my hon. Friend is suggesting that parents should restrict the amount of TV that their children can watch, I certainly agree with him.</p>

 I gave that example to produce a reductio ad absurdum in respect of the Bill&#146;s arguments. As my hon. Friend knows, I greatly believe in parental and individual responsibility. Does he also accept that we should point out to parents the connection between sitting on the sofa and obesity?</p>

 Yes, we should do that. As I suggested earlier, we should also make available more facilities in the community so that children, rather than sitting on the sofa, participate in sporting activities. As I pointed out, many food manufacturers are contributing to that effort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="80425-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08042574000216">Let me finish on the point I was making before we got slightly side-tracked. This is a very difficult, as well as exciting, time for television in this country, and it will result in huge pressures on the commercial sector. As Ofcom has determined, the measures in the Bill are likely to cost commercial television broadcasters &#163;224 million. That would be a catastrophic loss of revenue at any time; at this particular time, it would be hugely damaging. As I said to the hon. Member for Cheltenham, if I thought that the Bill would result in a dramatic improvement in the health of our children or in a huge reduction in the level of obesity, I might accept that there was a case for it, but nothing in the speech of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South persuaded me that there is any evidence to suggest that the Bill will achieve that.</p>

There are all sorts of reasons for that, such as lack of sport, or just too much eating, or too much eating of the wrong foods. We would have to be blind not to see that there are too many overweight youngsters, and we must address that. However, the Bill will not kill off obesity, but it will kill off a lot of advertising, and as advertising leads to programmes appearing on our televisions, that would have an enormous impact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="80425-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08042574000219">The hon. Gentleman talked about colour coding on products. That goes some way towards giving the information that parents need about whether products are healthy, but it is simplistic. I far prefer the information that is contained on some packaging, particularly on some Tesco products, which states how many calories, sugars, fats, saturates and salts products contain. Sometimes we might think a product is healthy, but when we read that information we are amazed to discover how many calories it actually contains. When people are given that information, they can be far more intelligent about not only about what they eat, but how much of it they eat, and how often they eat it.</p>

I am vegan so I have to scrutinise everything right down to the last detail to see whether it contains, for example, lactic acid. Would it not make it a lot easier if people could see a very clear red, amber or green traffic light, rather than have to analyse all that GDA&#151;guideline daily amount&#151;information?</p>

I do my own shopping, but now may be the appropriate time to declare that I have an interest as I own a retail convenience store in Swansea.

money that they had spent on television advertising on other forms of promotion, such as buy one, get one free? Therefore, rather than reducing the amount of unhealthy products being consumed, such a restriction could easily lead to much more unhealthy products being consumed because the marketing spend would change in that way.</p>

 My hon. Friend, with his expertise in the supermarket field, knows exactly what might happen. That is another unintended consequence of this proposed legislation; it is intended to promote health, but it would have the opposite effect. Of course manufacturers will look at different ways to promote their products. The Bill does not even address whether these so-called unhealthy foods should not be allowed to be promoted in any way, even by price discounting or buy one, get one free offers.

 I shall not name and shame anybody. When the doctor discussed with the patient&#146;s eating habits with her, he found out she was eating tomato soup for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Nobody would say that tomato soup is dangerous or unhealthy, but it clearly has such an effect if that is the only thing someone eats. That is not a balanced diet. We ought to be promoting a balanced diet, not picking on so-called unhealthy foods and clobbering them with an advertising ban.</p>

The Bill covers a lot of issues, as the hon. Gentleman has tried to cover every base on the promotion of products, including the internet, but he will know about social networking sites such as Facebook and Bebo, where a lot of youngsters put up their own sites supporting products they like. For instance, there may be a &#147;We love Smarties&#148; site. I suspect that under the Bill the promotion of Smarties on the internet before the watershed would not be allowed. However, if youngsters put up a fan page for a product that they like, would that be covered by the Bill? I am unsure whether it would be, but that raises the prospect of the food police knocking on a youngster&#146;s door and telling the youngster that they were promoting an illegal produce. That would be perverse, and I am sure that it would be an unintended consequence.</p>

a certain distance, as there is with, for instance, point of sale material in the school tuck shop? Cigarette packets would have to be under the counter so that people could not see them until they went into the shop and asked for them. The extension of that logic would be that sweets or unhealthy products should not be on show, in case that entices people to put them in their trolleys. That raises the image of shoppers going up to the shopkeeper and whispering to them, because they should not be asking in a loud voice in case someone else hears them, &#147;Could I have a packet of Frosties, please?&#148; and the shopkeeper wrapping the pack in brown paper so that nobody can see the product when the customer puts it in their bag. That is ludicrous. Such products, particularly breakfast cereals, tend to be fairly colourful. A lot of the packets contain gifts&#151;I understand that there is a voluntary code on that&#151;and even items such as CDs and DVDs, which may be educational or promote sports, are given away with these products. Even they could be said to be enticing youngsters to buy such products, so all that might become illegal, as well.</p>

<p><a name="st_o99"><a name="08042574000234"><a name="80425-0004.htm_spnew22"><a name="08042574000809"><b>Mr. Evans:</b>
 Yes, and I therefore wonder whether products such as Coca-Cola and McDonald&#146;s would even be allowed to use the Olympic rings, because in a way, that would be reverse advertising: trying to associate themselves with something healthy. However, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale), the Chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said, a lot of these firms actually do support sport, and they do so because they want their consumers to be healthy and to live longer, in order to carry on buying the products that they rather like. So the situation I described would be an unintended consequence, as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="80425-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08042574000235">I spoke earlier about another unintended consequence: the programming that would disappear. We have heard estimates of the cost to the commercial television industry of this ban coming in. Friday mornings here have almost become a case of, &#147;What are we going to ban this week?&#148;, and this is the latest in that sequence. A lot of current family programming&#151;including after the watershed&#151;would also disappear. As my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford intimated, the watershed is becoming increasingly ridiculous. Sky Plus and other such products enable people to record television programmes, and there is also the internet. I understand that most of Channel 4&#146;s programming is now available to watch on demand, at any time people like. Would there therefore be restrictions on such advertising of these products? There are doubtless a lot of youngsters who watch not just &#147;Skins&#148; but &#147;Shameless&#148;&#151;another programme that one might deem unsuitable for those under the age of 16, but one that I suspect has a fair following among such people, who will watch it on the internet or via Sky Plus.</p>

Could its brand be advertised, in the sense that it associates itself with healthy products, or would it be banned from advertising that brand because it is also associated with unhealthy products? I am not entirely sure where we stand on that.</p>

 I suspect that Coca-Cola would fall into that category, because it produces not only the drink Coca-Cola but a number of other soft drinks. Some of them might be deemed healthy under this simplistic guide, and some would be deemed unhealthy, so that would be an issue. Following the cigarette ban&#151;this was not even an unintended consequence&#151;the Marlboro clothing range was effectively banned from sale, simply because it contained the word &#147;Marlboro&#148;. Nobody has ever argued that clothes are going to kill people, but the fact is that there was legislation intended to deal with just that issue. All this would prove rich pickings for lawyers&#151;they must be rubbing their hands together. I suspect that they are on their knees praying that this Bill is passed, so that they can enrich themselves even further.</p>

 I am listening to my hon. Friend&#146;s speech with great interest. Does he also accept that in recent years tremendous strides have been made by food and drinks companies? Britvic, which I have the honour of having in my constituency, has done a tremendous amount of work in reducing and removing the sugar content of its drinks, and in producing ranges of healthy drinks to meet a changing and developing market.</p>

<p><a name="st_o103"><a name="08042574000240"><a name="80425-0005.htm_spnew2"><a name="08042574000813"><b>Mr. Evans:</b>
 I fully accept that, and that is the direction in which we need to go. We need to work with the industry to find out how it can alter the content of some of its products in order to make them healthier. I understand that the amount of salt and sugar has been reduced in a number of products, but that cannot be done overnight, apparently. Our taste buds are so sensitive that, if all the salt and sugar were removed from such products, sales would plummet. The industry simply does not have the flexibility to do that overnight, but I am sure that it could be done over a period of years in order to change people&#146;s tastes, until we finally reach a stage where the product in question is deemed as healthy as it possibly can be. So my hon. Friend is right&#151;such work should be done, and should be recognised.</p>

 Does this not get to the nub of the issue? In the past 20 years or so, at the same time as the amount of salt and sugar in such products has been reduced, there has actually been a reduction in the amount of advertising of those products. There are now far fewer advertisements for such food products on TV than there were 25 years ago, but it is during that period that the increase in obesity has occurred. Does my hon. Friend not conclude, therefore, that the advertising of such products makes absolutely no difference to obesity levels? If it did, we would have seen a reduction in obesity in that time.</p>

 I fully accept that. People are becoming obese for reasons other than sitting watching television adverts; indeed, I suspect that sitting watching television per se is part of the problem, not the advertisements themselves. We have to target where the problem is, and it is not addressed by the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="80425-0005.htm_para1"><a name="08042574000243">There is another issue about which we must also be very careful. The problem is not just the disappearance of children&#146;s television from the commercial sector that we have increasingly seen since the ban came in&#151;there is now a virtual state monopoly of children&#146;s television on the part of the BBC, which is unhealthy&#151;but the fact that if the Bill is enacted, there will be wider ramifications, such as loss of advertising on other programming that has been deemed family entertainment. Ant and Dec were mentioned earlier, and several other such shows could be jeopardised by the loss of advertising. We can already see the impact that the economic downturn is having on the commercial sector; such legislation would add insult to the injury that already exists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="80425-0005.htm_para2"><a name="08042574000244">There would also be a problem with product placement, which is seen as a more sophisticated form of advertising. It is not blunt, in-your-face advertising; however, product placement&#151;be it watches, cars or soft drinks&#151;is vital to a lot of films that we see in the cinema. As a form of advertising, it would be covered by the Bill, and I suspect that that would destroy in one fell swoop the film industry in this country. In fact, the provision would be almost impossible to enforce and would constitute bad legislation. Product placement is an issue that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South did not cover.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a very powerful point. As an esteemed member of the Select Committee, he will know that much of such legislation is now emanating from European Union directives.

 We had to wait two hours before the mention of the dreaded EU on a Friday morning; we apologise for being so lax in that regard. My hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="80425-0005.htm_para3"><a name="08042574000247">I mentioned earlier how difficult it would be to enforce the legislation relating to the point of sale. We have also mentioned some of the characters that are involved in selling certain products, including Ronald McDonald, a clown who has been closely associated with the McDonald&#146;s product. Such characters can appear within a store or outside it, but they would all be banned immediately under the legislation. Other characters such as Tony the Tiger and the Honey Monster would all be assassinated in one fell swoop by the Bill. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South would be guilty of killing off a long list of characters. The only person left would be Father Christmas, and I suspect that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s next private Member&#146;s Bill would ban him as well.</p>

We all ought to be doing a lot more to help youngsters to be more healthy and to get them involved in sports, but employing the nanny state to deny parents and youngsters access to the information contained in the advertising is wholly wrong.

great deal of personal and professional experience in these matters, and he made it clear how crucial it is to find ways to address this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80425-0005.htm_para8"><a name="08042574000257">We know that 25 per cent. of the adult population in this country is already obese, and it is estimated that, in a couple of years&#146; time, one in five children will be overweight or obese. Currently, three in 10 women and four in 10 men take part in less than the recommended 30 minutes of physical activity, five days a week. My hon. Friend has already mentioned the prediction that, if we carry on as we are, the cost to the nation in 40 years&#146; time will be more than &#163;45 billion as a result of the problems that will arise from obesity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="80425-0005.htm_para9"><a name="08042574000258">The point has been made that addressing obesity requires a multi-faceted approach. There is no silver bullet solution. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley made a crucial point when he said that we should be concentrating on the fact that far fewer people are taking part in physical activity. Statistics show that, on average, we consume the same number of calories today as we consumed 50 years ago. The reason that we have a problem of rising obesity is that we are far less active. It is crucial that we try to get more people to be active, not that that would provide a silver bullet solution in itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="80425-0005.htm_para10"><a name="08042574000259">It is deeply worrying that about 50 per cent. of young people drop out of all sports activity once they leave school. Despite some welcome measures by the Government, it is worrying that we are still selling off playing fields and that, even where funds have been allocated to improve sports provision, the money often remains unspent. The sum of &#163;750 million was announced some time ago for sports action zones, but only &#163;6.2 million has been spent. So, despite well-intentioned announcements, even where funding is being made available, it is not being used. Indeed, the vast bulk of the &#163;200 million that was promised years ago for improving children&#146;s play areas has still not been spent. Addressing the issue of activity is crucial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="80425-0005.htm_para11"><a name="08042574000260">The Bill concentrates on advertising, but we must be confident if we are going to introduce regulations. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South has spoken passionately about the overburdening amount of regulation that exists, so it is somewhat surprising that he is now proposing to introduce more. He needs to convince the House that there is overwhelming scientific research evidence to show that those regulations would have the effect that he and the rest of us want. Like the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale), I would happily support the Bill if I could see that there was clear research evidence that the result would be a significant impact on rising obesity levels in this country, but as hon. Members have said, the research is not that clear. Indeed, in countries such as Sweden and Quebec&#151;part of a country, admittedly&#151;that have introduced all-out bans on junk food advertising, levels of obesity have not fallen but have continued to rise. Other research provided by Ofcom indicates that such measures have only a 2 per cent. impact on children&#146;s food choices.</p>

2 per cent. impact, or whether it involves more than that. Like climate change, this is an incremental issue&#151;one where a number of significant steps, although they may be small in themselves, must be taken to staunch the tide of obesity in childhood and subsequently in adults. If we were to seek overwhelming scientific evidence on this subject&#151;to use the hon. Gentleman&#146;s words&#151;we would wait for decades, and the consequence for our children&#146;s health, our nation&#146;s economy and our national health services would be catastrophic.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman rightly speaks with great passion, as this is an important issue. My concern is simply that I am not convinced that there is even relatively significant evidence, let alone overwhelming evidence, for this proposal. If we go ahead with it, there will be damaging consequences and we will be making a big mistake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="80425-0005.htm_para12"><a name="08042574000263">The hon. Gentleman may say that we cannot afford to wait, but it is interesting that a number of Departments are conducting research into these and related issues. It is only very recently that the Department for Children, Schools and Families has rightly introduced research, to be carried out by Professor David Buckingham, on &#147;Assessing the Impact of the Commercial World on Children&#146;s Wellbeing&#148;.

 Of course I do. That is I why I used that particular example&#151;although the point would apply equally to the provision in Sweden&#151;and why I have huge reservations on the matter. I know that other research has contradictory views to the ones that the hon. Gentleman and I are expressing. My point is that we simply do not have a good enough understanding of this issue to carry on with the imposition of severe regulation. I do not believe, for reasons that I will demonstrate, that it would have the effect that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South suggests.</p>

advertise &#147;less healthy&#148; products between 5.30 am and 9 pm. The Bill would also change the definition of junk food to include not only HFSS products, but all products &#147;associated with&#148; the brands that make such products.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="80425-0005.htm_para16"><a name="08042574000269">We have heard much debate about the impact that that association provision will have, so I do not propose to discuss that, although the fact that it is of great concern to many of us is crucial. For instance, why should the firm that makes Frosties not be able to advertise Bran Flakes? Such a situation would be extraordinary and inexplicable. I pay tribute to hon. Members who have debated these issues before. For example, Debra Shipley, the former Member for Stourbridge, introduced a private Member&#146;s Bill on the issue, and only last year Baroness Thornton introduced such a Bill in the other place. Much has happened in the relatively short period since those most recent attempts to go down this line. The House should be aware that this country already has some of the tightest and strictest restrictions on junk food advertising on television in Europe, and more is still to come in what has already been proposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="80425-0005.htm_para17"><a name="08042574000270">Since reference has not yet been made to this, let us remind ourselves what has happened in that short period: promotional offers targeted at the under-fives are now banned; celebrities and well-known cartoon characters are banned in advertisements aimed at children; HFSS ads are not shown in or around programmes aimed at children or programmes likely to appeal to children aged four to 15; and regardless of the time of broadcast, these advertisements cannot be shown during programmes for which more than 17.6 per cent. of the viewers are children. There is more to come, because from December dedicated children&#146;s channels will have to phase out all HFSS advertising. That is what is currently taking place.</p>

If the Bill goes to Committee, I hope that the Committee will examine ways of addressing that issue, because it is important. I would like any Committee to address the possibility of a ban that specifies an actual number of children watching the programme, rather than just a percentage. Provision should be made for a percentage and an absolute number, because that would address that issue. </p>

 The hon.

For that reason, Ofcom&#146;s review of the future of public service broadcasting and how we may have to fund it in future is critical. This is a very difficult time for broadcasters, particularly as so much advertising is moving away from broadcasting and into the new media.

my speech. I genuinely believe that the hon. Gentleman has raised an important issue about obesity and children&#146;s health. The debate between him and me concerns whether the Bill is being introduced at the right time in the absence of the necessary research and investigations, and whether there is any clear evidence that it will have the effect that he wants. I shall advance further arguments that may persuade him that problems exist other than the lack of research evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="80425-0006.htm_para2"><a name="08042574000281">What we do know is that the new measures are already having an impact. Core category advertising during terrestrial children&#146;s programmes has fallen to negligible levels. The decline of such advertising on dedicated children&#146;s channels has been greater than the reduction that was required in Ofcom&#146;s phased rules. The greatest decline has featured in programmes watched by children aged between four and nine, which I consider the most important age range. Interestingly, Ofcom has said:</p>
<a name="80425-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="08042574000617"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;While it&#146;s still too early to come to any firm conclusions about the success or otherwise of the new rules, there are clear signs that the new rules are having the intended effect on reducing the amount of food and drink advertising that children are exposed to on television.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="80425-0006.htm_para3"><a name="08042574000282">As others have said, other measures are also having an impact. I do not want to go overboard in praising the food industry, but it has responded well to the new regulations. The Advertising Standards Authority has said that</p>
<a name="80425-0006.htm_brev1"><a name="08042574000618"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the food and soft drink advertising industry had successfully understood and acted upon new rules&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="80425-0006.htm_para4"><a name="08042574000283">As we have heard, there have been further industry-led initiatives. We have heard about GDA labelling, for instance. Like others, I am not sure whether &#147;traffic light&#148; or GDA labelling is the answer, and hope that a way can be found of merging the two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="80425-0006.htm_para5"><a name="08042574000284">We also know that in recent years more than &#163;15 billion-worth of branded products have been reformulated to contain lower levels of fat, salt and sugar, and that a further &#163;11.5 billion-worth of products have been launched as lower LFSS variants. There is little evidence of a correlation between junk-food advertising and obesity. A new set of rules was introduced relatively recently and there are more to come. There are early indications that those rules are having an effect, and research will take place on all that, so I believe that we should wait. I also believe that, in any event, the Bill would prove to be a blunt instrument if it were implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80425-0006.htm_para6"><a name="08042574000285">As my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) pointed out, the pre-9 pm watershed would not target programmes watched by a high proportion of children after 9 pm, &#147;Ugly Betty&#148; being a good example. It would, however, affect all the programmes shown before 9 pm that do not target children, including news and current affairs programmes and documentaries. That is not proportionate, effective or fair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="80425-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08042574000286">As others have observed, there would be a serious impact on broadcasters&#146; revenues, representing up to &#163;250 million. That was dealt with effectively by the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, and I do not want to repeat all that he said. However, if we think of that &#163;250 million as the equivalent of all the money spent on all UK-initiated children&#146;s programming and all news programming across all broadcast outlets, we realise how serious the impact would be.</p>

They cannot support measures that will significantly reduce the amount of money provided for broadcasting, and then ask broadcasters to spend more money on children&#146;s television and regional news programming.</p>

It is absolutely appropriate that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South has raised the issue of non-broadcast media, with which there are all sorts of problems. However, there are problems with the Bill&#146;s provisions relating to the 9 o&#146;clock watershed, because fewer and fewer people watch actual television; they watch what are sometimes called the new media. There is also the problem of time shifting and the introduction of personal video recorders in more and more households, meaning that people can watch programmes at any time of the day or night regardless of when the watershed is imposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="80425-0006.htm_para10"><a name="08042574000291">As well as all those problems, there is also the question of what we should do about increased advertising in the new media. We have heard stories about children receiving food advertising on their mobile phones, and although the practice is now wholly contrary to the rules that the industry has set itself, more and more advertising of such products is going on to the internet. That is why I welcome the fact that the industry has acknowledged the need to do something. Without the need for regulation, the industry has set up working parties to look at the issue and set up a code of practice. The New Media Group has been established to review the regulations. As a result, the industry has already introduced many of the things that the hon. Gentleman seeks to impose on it by regulation. I welcome the fact that the industry has done that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="80425-0006.htm_para11"><a name="08042574000292">The point of the industry taking such action rather than its being done by regulation is that regulations imposed in the UK apply only to UK organisations, but  <br>

much of the advertising comes from outside the country. Self-regulation would have the effect of dealing with that problem. Indeed, the European Advertising Standards Alliance is already working vigorously in that area. If self-regulation is working, as it appears to be, I believe that it is better than imposed regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="80425-0006.htm_para15"><a name="08042574000297">One thing that unites everybody in the Chamber is the recognition that obesity is a serious problem in the UK. I make that statement in the full knowledge that I am an obese man who needs to lose at least 40 lb and who was obese long before the advertising and food industries got their teeth into me.

If he were to make such a claim, it would be quite rightly shot down. However, he contends that the Bill will have some effect on obesity in this country. I will not get into an argument about the extent of the effect that it could have or whether it would have any effect at all, but even if it had a small effect on obesity&#151;I do not concede that point&#151;one must consider whether this is not a  <br>

case of a sledgehammer being used to crack a nut, or rather a huge legislative sledgehammer that will have a very small effect on the problem that he seeks to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="80425-0006.htm_para18"><a name="08042574000300">We already have some of the tightest restrictions on such advertising in the world. Indeed, a great many companies and advertising agencies have already engaged in a voluntary downgrading of such advertising. Since Ofcom introduced its ban, the exposure of unhealthy food to children aged four to nine has been reduced by a quarter, to children under 16 it has been reduced by more than half. Food advertising is now at its lowest level since 1982, on an absolute measure of food advertising. As a proportion of the total advertising take, it is less than half the level in 1982. Indeed, the advertising industry has been found to be 100 per cent. compliant with the Ofcom ban. So we find ourselves in a conundrum, where the advertising of unhealthy food has been dropping not simply since the Ofcom ban, but for several years, yet obesity continues to rise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="80425-0006.htm_para19"><a name="08042574000301">As has been pointed out by some hon. Members, including me in an intervention, bans on the advertising of unhealthy food exist in other countries, and as yet no evidence can be seen to show that they have any effect on childhood obesity or, indeed, adult obesity. As has been said, in Quebec, a ban has been in place since 1980&#151;almost 30 years&#151;and if it had had a noticeable effect, such as even a 10 or 20 per cent. reduction, and we could stand here and say that the Quebecois were 10 or 20 per cent. thinner than the British or that a graph showed a downward trend in obesity in Quebec, the Bill&#146;s proponents would have an enormously powerful argument to deploy. But they cannot deploy that argument, because the ban on the advertising of unhealthy food in Quebec has had no noticeable effect on obesity there.</p>

ban on food advertising does not dramatically affect levels of childhood obesity. It is important to make that point, because while the proponents of the Bill think that a ban will have a good effect, which is the point that they want to push, a ban on food advertising will have some very bad effects.

There is no doubt that the Ofcom ban has had a serious effect on children&#146;s television. It has been pointed out that children&#146;s television has been in decline for a number of years, but the advertisers and the broadcasters implemented a voluntary code of conduct and a voluntary reduction in the advertising of unhealthy foods during children&#146;s television programmes before the Ofcom ban came into effect. I will take any hon. Member who wants to challenge me on that point to a meeting with the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television to meet dedicated, professional television producers who have spent their careers making children&#146;s television programmes.

 No one, not least the Liberal Democrat Front-Bench spokesman, the hon. Member for Bath, has ever been able to follow a point made by the hon. Gentleman. I join the hon. Member for Bath in being a member of an ever-growing group of people unable to comprehend one of his points. If he wants a British broadcasting monopoly, he can by all means advocate it. He can say, effectively, &#147;Let&#146;s ban all advertising, close down our commercial broadcasters and just have the BBC.&#148; To be sure, the BBC has a large budget&#151;&#163;3.5 billion or &#163;4 billion&#151;</p>

 As I have said, by banning advertising, the Bill would take &#163;250 million away from the commercial broadcasters. That is money that could be used to produce British programmes. I, for one, believe that British programmes should be produced and shown on a range of channels, not just the BBC.</p>

Member for Falkirk, who wants to parody me as seeing the advertising industry as a vested interest. We have a very successful advertising industry in this country. The Minister has just published her creative industries strategy paper, which flagged up the contribution that advertising and other creative industries make to this country, and the hon. Gentleman should know that there is a thriving advertising industry in Edinburgh. I therefore make no apologies if the message goes out from this House that the Conservative party supports the advertising industry and believes that it is doing a good job, including in self-regulation. I shall come to that in a moment.</p>

Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) in his excellent article in <i> The Grocer</i>, which I recommend to all hon. Members, that the Bill compromises Ofcom&#146;s independence. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I have a photocopy with me, if the hon. Member for Falkirk would like me to circulate it. I hasten to add that my hon. Friend did not send it to me, in case hon. Members think that he is vain and self-promoting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="80425-0007.htm_para2"><a name="08042574000320">Ofcom is a very expensive piece of machinery that this Government created to regulate broadcasting. By and large, it does a pretty effective job. I know that it has its serious critics, but it is an important organisation, not least because the nature of broadcasting and communications is changing so rapidly, as it will in relation to advertising to children. There are now many different ways to get children&#146;s attention. Ofcom has engaged in extensive consultation, and as a matter of principle, regardless of the merits of the Bill, it would be wrong for Parliament to legislate on such a specific, narrow broadcasting issue. Ofcom has clearly acted on it, continues to review the situation and may act again in future. It consults the Department of Health and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and will consult Ministers and perhaps even Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen on the merits or otherwise of a ban. However, as Ofcom is engaged in the exercise, it would be odd for Parliament to legislate. Indeed, in the next two or three years we might get another communications Bill that would give Parliament the opportunity to debate the matter and decide whether to set parameters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80425-0007.htm_para3"><a name="08042574000321">I am worried that the Bill is one of those fashionable measures on an issue about which people get greatly exercised and that they pursue single-mindedly and doggedly without any thought of the consequences. Where would this end? If one watched a series of television adverts over an hour or so, it would be pretty much possible to come up with a case for banning every single one, and a start would certainly be banning all car adverts. We know that cars reduce people&#146;s need to exercise and pollute the environment. The start would be banning adverts for 4x4s immediately, but a case could be made down to the Mini.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="80425-0007.htm_para4"><a name="08042574000322">Adverts for clothing could be a problem because we know that a lot of clothes are made in pretty unpleasant conditions in third-world and developing countries. Obviously, adverts for shops selling both food and clothing, such as Sainsbury&#146;s and Marks and Spencer, could be banned in case an M and S advert featuring Twiggy enticed a mother to that shop and she then bought a high-fat product for her child. Adverts for almost all products, such as detergents and perfumes, could be banned because almost all products that we use and consume have a downside.</p>

 That is correct, Madam Deputy Speaker. I have to say that M and S was the culprit in my downfall as a child, with the M and S teacake the prime example. I do not think that it is a stretch to say that an advert for M and S, regardless of the product, could be construed under the Bill as involving a brand associated with unhealthy food for children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="80425-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08042574000327">The Bill&#146;s scope is wide, so hon. Members who cited the Olympics were absolutely spot on. It would be unavoidable that the BBC television broadcast of the 2012 Olympics 100 m final, with a large McDonald&#146;s hoarding in the background because it was the chief sponsor, would fall foul of the Bill by promoting a brand associated with unhealthy food. Nothing in the Bill would grant an exception. Technology might allow the McDonald&#146;s sign to be pixillated out, but if McDonald&#146;s, or any other commercial advertiser, thought that the large amount it had spent on sponsoring the Olympics was being undermined by the Bill, it would have pretty strong words to say to the International Olympic Committee and the Olympic Delivery Authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="80425-0007.htm_para7"><a name="08042574000328">The Bill is a sledgehammer to crack a nut, there is no evidence that such a ban would tackle a problem that we all recognise, and the Bill is drafted in such a way as to have enormous ramifications across a huge area of marketing. Additionally, however, the Bill is an excuse not to talk about the positive things that we could do to reduce childhood obesity. As the hon. Member for Bath pointed out, running through the Bill there is a hostility to the private sector, a belief that everybody working in advertising is childless, and a belief that no one who works for a food company has children or worries about them. That is ludicrous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="80425-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08042574000329">McDonald&#146;s, the company that people love to hate and pillory, has done an enormous amount in terms of corporate social responsibility. My hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) mentioned football, but it has also been involved in training, including vocational training. Because of my involvement in work experience, I have visited McDonald&#146;s and have seen what it does. An enormous amount of responsibility is taken. As everybody knows, the McDonald&#146;s product range has changed, mainly because of public pressure, and there is a much greater focus on healthy eating. It is important that we recognise that the debate is not completely one-sided, with people from the evil industry desperately trying to force high-fat products on our children behind our backs, and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South standing like Horatio at the bridge to prevent them from crossing. As has been mentioned, billions of pounds-worth of food products are now much lower in fat, sugar and salt.</p>

high-fat foods. They would reduce the cut to the number of training places for physical education teachers. They would tell us how they will get the 1 million children who currently do not do two hours a week of sport into sport and exercise. That is the type of positive thing that the Government could be doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="80425-0007.htm_para10"><a name="08042574000331">The Government could be encouraging our children to eat better food. We know that when Jamie Oliver had his school dinners campaign, we heard a lot of rhetoric from the Government, but it turned out that the additional funding provided was something like 50p per meal, per school. I recognise that we can change children&#146;s eating habits, both at home and at school. I have seen that in numerous primary schools in my constituency, which now have a huge focus on healthy food. We can change children&#146;s habits by providing them with the opportunity to exercise and play competitive sports. Measures of that type, and not a misplaced, mistimed and grossly disproportionate attempt to ban the advertising of high-fat food to children, will help us to reduce childhood obesity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="80425-0008.htm_para1"><a name="08042574000356">In the US, similar evidence has been adduced. According to the Federal Trade Commission, advertising during children&#146;s television programming has declined by 34 per cent. in recent years and food advertising on television has declined by 13 per cent. since 1993. However, there is no evidence that childhood obesity levels in the US have declined as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="80425-0008.htm_para2"><a name="08042574000357">The authors then say that if the level of advertising has not increased, perhaps the level of television viewing has increased. In fact, to the surprise of many&#151;including me&#151;television viewing has not increased over the period of the obesity epidemic. Some observers suggest that it has not changed for children and adolescents for the past 40 years. There is some evidence that the time children spend watching television has actually declined in recent years. The idea that people are getting fatter because they are couch potatoes may be wrong according to that evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="80425-0008.htm_para3"><a name="08042574000358">The authors then draw attention to the fact that when children sit down and watch television, they view a balanced presentation of foods. A British study looked at the food messages and references in regular programming, as opposed to those contained in food advertising, because there are as many references to food in regular programming as during the adverts. Children&#146;s regular programming contained references far more centred on so-called healthy foods. For example, fruit and vegetables were the most frequently portrayed foods in regular programming, and that might be regarded as positive advertising for healthy eating. If one of the unintended consequences of the Bill would be less good children&#146;s programming, there would be less opportunity for those positive messages to be put across.</p>

 One of the supporters of the Bill said earlier that if advertising made no difference, companies would not advertise. Does my hon.

The chief purpose of their adverts is to build their market share in a sector, rather than to grow the sector as a whole.</p>

 Everybody knows that people should eat five pieces of fruit a day, and there is a lot of advertising promoting that, whether on television, in magazines or elsewhere. Children who come into my shop rarely ask for fruit. Instead, they want crisps, cans of fizzy drink and other sweets. That reinforces the point that advertising on its own does not have the impact that people suggest.</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend. Indeed, there is substantial econometric literature that disproves the alleged connection between advertising, diets and weight. Peter Kyle of the University of Lancaster examined the impact of food advertising on food consumption, and he found no evidence to support the popular myth that advertising increased market size.

conclusions are hardly exceptional. Other studies into the effect of advertising of such items as breakfast cereals and biscuits, both frequently cited as bogeymen in the childhood obesity epidemic, have concluded that advertising did not affect market size in any general way or to any material extent.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is putting on a characteristically fascinating exhibition, but if he really supports these academic theses, how does he explain the explosion in the consumption of breakfast cereals, for example, in emerging economies where they had never been promoted before?</p>

 First, I am not sure of the facts about the amount of breakfast cereals consumed in emerging economies, but one of my concerns&#151;I referred to it earlier&#151;is the increase in drug taking, particularly cannabis, among young people, which is totally dissociated from advertising. I suspect that drug taking is increasing in this country for exactly the same reason as cereals are being consumed more widely in the third world countries that the hon. Gentleman mentioned&#151;mainly as a result of availability and the fact that word on the street says that they are good things to get one&#146;s hands on.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right about that. It also depends on the maturity of the market, and the particular market that the Bill focuses on is a very mature market, so the point raised by the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) does not apply. Would not the only consequence of the Bill be to protect the market share of the current biggest food producers because no one else would be able to advertise to get a slice of the market? If someone produced a slightly healthier version of a particular product but it was not healthy enough to meet the demands of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, they would not be able to advertise it, so people would have to stick with the current more unhealthy product.</p>

 I think that my hon. Friend is absolutely right. We are not talking only about advertising on television. If we are talking about advertising in the wider sense of promotion, many new products are promoted because they are offered at a reduced price in supermarkets or smaller shops. People, including me, are always looking for a bargain, so they can choose a new brand of a well known product with new ingredients to discover whether they like it. They can do so by buying it at a price significantly below that of the standard product. That is another way in which producers can get new products on to the market, but if the foods were regarded as being unhealthy for children, they would be outlawed under the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80425-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08042574000367">My final example on the same theme is the report by Bob Eagle and Tim Ambler, who looked into the impact of advertising on chocolate consumption in five European countries in order to test the claim that a reduction in advertising would reduce consumption. They reported no significant association between the amount of advertising and the size of the chocolate market. When we went to supermarket check-outs in the past, they used to try to tempt consumers by offering two bars for the price of one; nowadays, they have two bars or one very large bar on offer and try to tempt us by saying, &#147;More to share&#148;.  <br>

I am not sure that people buying those bars are not going to eat them all themselves, but this provides an example of the promoters attempting to be politically correct, in the sure knowledge that most of the &#147;more to share&#148; bars are going to be consumed by one particular individual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="80425-0008.htm_para5"><a name="08042574000368">As I suggested earlier, as well as there being no evidence in support of the Bill and of the thesis advanced by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, there is evidence against it. The Bill completely breaches the principle that regulation should be based on proper scientific evidence.</p>

 My hon. Friend mentions chocolate marketing. Does he agree that when Cadbury&#146;s sponsored &#147;Coronation Street&#148;, which would presumably be outlawed by the Bill, the company did not expect everyone immediately to leap off the sofa, switch off the TV and go out to the nearest newsagent to buy an extra bar of Cadbury&#146;s Dairy Milk, but rather advertised in the hope that the next time someone went to the newsagents to buy a bar of chocolate, they would buy a bar made by Cadbury rather than Nestl&#233;?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Another example that springs to mind in the light of today&#146;s opinion polls is that despite spending ever-increasing amounts of taxpayers&#146; money on Government advertising, the Government have not become any more popular!</p>

 As my hon. Friend will remember, the leader of our great party once attacked one well-known shopping brand for promoting Terry&#146;s Chocolate Oranges and not having real oranges in its shops. If the Bill were enacted, people would look into different ways of promoting products. In some stores, we see signs saying, &#147;Five chocolate bars for a pound&#148;. I suspect that it is those offers, rather than watching advertising on television, that entice people into buying five bars&#151;and then, perhaps, eating one or two more than they should.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="80425-0008.htm_para6"><a name="08042574000373">There is the related issue of school lunchbox inspections. At the behest of television chef Jamie Oliver, and promoted by the Department for Education and Skills and the Food Standards Agency, there was a plan to promote healthy food in school lunchboxes by encouraging teachers to confiscate unhealthy products. As a consequence of that, head teachers were a lot busier than hitherto, as they had to deal with angry parents. Those parents might previously have made only an occasional visit to the school, but their interest in what was happening at school was provoked by the fact that their children were unable to eat for lunch what they had decided would be good for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="80425-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08042574000374">Let me turn to another fundamental flaw in the Bill. Who will decide what is unhealthy? The Bill&#146;s promoter suggests that the FSA&#146;s remit should be extended so that it has a role not only in informing the public about food facts but in making a judgment on behalf of the public that could, in a regulatory context, result in the promoters of certain foods becoming criminalised.</p>

 Buoyed up by the Jaffa Cakes I have eaten, I have thought of another instance of people or organisations involved at the point of sale possibly falling foul of the law if the Bill is enacted.

It is good that Members are scrutinising it today, because the fact that so many of our colleagues have signed early-day motions in support of it shows that a lot of them have not fully thought through its implications.

My own view is that it is so far short of perfect that it is incapable of being improved and made into a proper and acceptable Bill in Committee.

selling some foodstuffs to children. Obviously, there are rules and regulations relating to the sale of alcohol and tobacco to children, but it seemed that, if we were to follow the logic of some of the promoter&#146;s supporters, it would not be long before we were banning certain items from being sold to children in the shops because they were regarded as less than healthy.

 My hon. Friend is touching on an important point. When the initial restrictions were placed on advertising, it became perfectly clear that they would not make any difference to childhood obesity, but the health zealots have come back and said that those restrictions did not work because they did not go far enough. Then, when further restrictions are shown not to work, they will no doubt come back again and say that they want even more restrictions.

That is a grossly simplistic and unfair division to impose. Television programmes that are broadcast between 9 pm and 5.30 am can be recorded and watched at other times. In the context of the Bill, we must note that such programmes could contain a mass of advertisements targeted at children and urging them to buy particular products. If such programmes were being recorded and watched at other times, they would be in a different position from internet programmes. If such a programme were broadcast on the internet, such advertising would be outlawed completely, but if it were originally broadcast between 9 pm and 5.30 am and then recorded, such advertising would not be outlawed.

 We are again returning to the ridiculous nature of this Bill. A ban on the advertising, and therefore the promotion, of these products would extend to scout fundraising jamborees, because if the scouts had made and were advertising or promoting their own lemonade or brownie cakes, that would fall foul of this legislation. One can imagine the food police marching into fêtes and arresting youngsters simply because they were promoting their home-made lemonade.</p>

 My hon. Friend tempts me to mention home-made ginger beer, on which many of us were brought up. Those who make their own ginger beer know exactly how much sugar needs to go into it, just as those who make elderflower cordial know that, as well as elderflowers and water, a heck of a lot of sugar is needed. Some may think it a good idea to drink gallons of elderflower cordial diluted with fizzy water or lemonade, but if it is drunk in excess, their sugar intake will be massive. People who prepare their own food and drink have a better understanding of the ingredients.</p>

The Government have a good record on sport. In the past five years or so, we have increased participation in school sport so that 86 per cent. of our children now enjoy two hours of school sport a week, with an aspiration to take that to five hours. It is a fantastic achievement. Opposition Members are feeling rather negative about the Olympics but I think the opposite, and the Olympics will have a further impact by encouraging more people to engage in sport.</p>

 The Minister cannot be allowed to get away with skimming over things that easily.

 The hon. Gentleman wants Rome built in a day. Let us consider the statistics. Five years ago, I think either 40 or 60 per cent. of children were doing two hours of sport a week; we have raised that figure to 86 per cent. It is one of the areas where we have actually exceeded our target. Of course, there is more to do to reach 100 per cent. He is correct about that, but we have made fantastic progress. If I compare what children do in school nowadays with what my children did, when they would go for weeks with no engagement in sport whatever, I can see that there has been a terrific improvement since the Labour Government have been in office.</p>

He said something that it is important for the House to remember: we have some of the toughest regulations in the world on the advertising of food to children, and we ought to wait to see how the new regulations bed down and whether we need to introduce further regulations or whether a ban would be a blunt instrument.</p>

I am not sure whether advertising is the one issue that would change the way in which more American television programmes are being imported into the UK. We need action on all sorts of fronts, some of which are included in the creative economy strategy programme. No doubt the hon.

 We must wait to see what Ofcom recommends, as it is the body to which we have given responsibility for investigating the matter, and it is considering the whole of public sector broadcasting and children&#146;s programming, so let us wait to see its recommendations. In the meantime, the effort that we are putting into growing the talent and providing the appropriate competences, so that we have talented programme makers in the UK, is probably about the best contribution that the Government can make to ensuring a thriving children&#146;s programme sector.

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="80425-0009.htm_para17"><a name="08042574000425">The important point is that, as the public health White Paper has clearly stated, if the measures that have been taken so far fail to produce a change in the nature and balance of food promotion to children, we will take action to implement a clearly defined framework for the regulation and promotion of food for children. For broadcast advertising, we can do that within existing legislation, so we do not need a new Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="80425-0009.htm_para18"><a name="08042574000426">The Communications Act 2003 provides the legislative framework to respond to concerns about food promotion to children and, if necessary, allow further action to be taken. The 2003 Act details Ofcom&#146;s statutory responsibility for setting broadcast standards for advertising and for the sponsorship of programmes. It is in accordance with those duties that Ofcom examined the case for greater restrictions and subsequently strengthened the regulation of broadcast food promotion. Based on the available evidence at that time, Ofcom concluded that the new rules that it introduced were a proportionate and appropriate response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80425-0009.htm_para19"><a name="08042574000427">Taken with the wider, cross-Government range of measures aimed at tackling childhood obesity and poor diet, to which I shall return, we have a tough agenda for action, which will stimulate the necessary culture change in our society. The Secretary of State has the power under the 2003 Act to issue directions in relation to prohibiting categories of advertising. If he were persuaded by the evidence that the rules were not strong enough, the 2003 Act includes powers to direct Ofcom. On non-broadcast advertising, we will continue to work with the Advertising Standards Authority and the industry.</p>

The findings of those reviews into the effectiveness of the advertising codes will be taken into account in formulating and enforcing revised codes, if they are needed. Both broadcast and non-broadcast advertising regulations must be based on best evidence, and they must be robust and subject to appropriate assessments. If new evidence were to emerge that clearly highlighted major problems in relation to children&#146;s exposure to the advertising of food with high fat, sugar or salt, the regulator would have a duty to consider the matter and take appropriate action.</p>

establish a correlation between childhood obesity and television advertising of foods with a high content of sugar, salt and fat, we cannot establish causality, which has been a contested issue in today&#146;s debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="80425-0009.htm_para21"><a name="08042574000431">On obesity in general, I agree with my hon. Friends that obesity is a huge challenge. One has only to consider the figures. In 1997, one in five women was obese; in 2005, one in four women was obese. In 1997, one in six men was obese; in 2005, the ratio was more than one in five. That is a 25 per cent. increase in a mere eight years. The foresight report was important, because it drew attention to a major issue. The report estimated that by 2050, 60 per cent. of men and 50 per cent. of women might be considered obese. We know that obesity is responsible for premature deaths, reduces life expectancy and imposes a massive cost on the NHS as well as a cost on the economy as a whole. However, we must understand the causes of obesity to ensure that we take the appropriate public interventions. It is a multi-faceted and complex issue, and therefore requires a multi-faceted and rather more complex response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="80425-0009.htm_para22"><a name="08042574000432">All of us tend to reach for what looks like a simple solution, because it makes us feel that we are taking action and doing something. We must ask ourselves whether it is effective action and whether there will be unintended consequences such as those mentioned by a number of hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope), whom I have not yet mentioned&#151;my apologies for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80425-0009.htm_para23"><a name="08042574000433">Many hon. Members have mentioned parenting, and of course parental influence on children&#146;s behaviour is hugely important. It is an interesting statistic that only 17 per cent. of parents with an obese child were correctly able to gauge their child&#146;s weight status. That demonstrates the challenge for other Departments and the type of work that they need to do to provide support for parents and help them to understand the impact of what happens to their children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="80425-0009.htm_para24"><a name="08042574000434">I assumed that Members would mention the fact that we have stopped walking our children to school, but nobody has. There has been a 10 per cent. drop in the number of children walking to school over the past couple of decades, partly because time has become more precious and partly because of fear.</p>

<p><a name="st_o192"><a name="08042574000435"><a name="80425-0009.htm_spnew12"><a name="08042574000902"><b>Mr. Chope:</b>
 Speaking of unintended consequences, there is a campaign in the House for free bus travel to school for children. Does the Minister share my concern that one of its unintended consequences would be even fewer children walking to school?</p>

 That is a difficult one. That is precisely the type of issue that one should consider so that we can ensure proper understanding of motivations and consequences. If travelling by bus were to cut the number of parents going to school by car, that would be good for the environment and probably have zero impact on obesity&#151;although people would have to walk to the bus stop, so I suppose that they would do a little more walking than they otherwise would. I am sure that the motivation for that suggested measure comes from environmental concerns, not obesity concerns, but I would like to examine the evidence before expressing a view on it.</p>

I well remember that when my children were small, we did a month&#146;s house swap with a family in Sacramento. They had two cars and a wonderful swimming pool, but interestingly, they came to our inner-city house and had not realised that we walked to Sainsbury&#146;s, the shops, the park or the tube station. They were used to getting into the car. We could see their completely different culture and the different way in which individuals used the built environment. We in the UK are moving further towards that American-style environment. We tend to get into our cars much more for simple journeys, which we would not have done in the past.</p>

 The Minister has just stated that we eat out more often, which is absolutely right. When we are preparing food for ourselves, we can go around the shops and look at the little tables on the cans, whether they use the traffic-light system or something more detailed. We can assess how many calories are in a food and what sort of portions we should have. When we eat out in restaurants, we are not given that same information. A lot of people are absolutely ignorant about how many calories are in what they buy. Would it not be useful to give people more information, particularly about children&#146;s food, and therefore more power over how many calories they consume each day?</p>

The industry can help us to promote healthy diets and proper exercise. The Government&#146;s role is to give people information and opportunities that will help them to make good choices for themselves and their children, to ensure that people get clear and transparent information about food and exercise, and to put in place the right incentives and facilities to support people in making healthier choices.</p>

The Hastings Strathclyde review produced probably the most serious piece of evidence that we have. Its main finding was that a direct link between the prevalence of obesity and food advertising could not be proved, but it established that there was evidence that advertising had a 2 per cent. impact on children&#146;s food  <br>

When it asked about the role of parents through a NOP survey, the overwhelming majority of people&#151;79 per cent.&#151;said that parents had &#147;a great deal&#148; of responsibility for ensuring that their children had a proper diet. The survey showed that people thought that others&#151;schools, food manufacturers, the media, the Government, supermarkets and broadcasters&#151;had responsibility. However, when people were asked which group could do the most to ensure that children ate healthily, 55 per cent. of people named parents, while only a small minority&#151;16 per cent.&#151;named food manufacturers. Schools were named by only 14 per cent. of people, and very few named the media and the Government. Supermarkets were named by 3 per cent. and broadcasters by 1 per cent. The public&#146;s view is that parents are key to this. Even with regard to the 2 per cent. figure that I cited, one cannot even determine whether that effect is due to television viewing itself, the snacking that tends to take place when watching television, or the impact of the advertising.</p>

We must think about that seriously, which is why we would need much better research-based evidence if we were to take further steps.</p>

 I have followed the debate with great interest, and I was particularly interested to hear what the Minister had to say. I am delighted that she made it clear to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths), as politely and tactfully as possible, that the Government do not support the Bill. I imagine that even people who would like to support the Bill would consider it premature, given that Ofcom, which has been left in charge of the issue, has not had time to consider the restrictions that have already been put in place. No matter where one stands on the issue&#151;whether one supports the thrust of the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman quite rightly repeats a point that a number of us made about the need to have research done by Ofcom.

 The hon. Gentleman is entirely right. The Bill opens up a huge array of issues, not just to do with the effect on broadcasters and on obesity, but to do with definitions. The scale of the impact that the Bill would have on the advertising industry needs to be considered, too. I praise him for his speech, which was particularly well-argued and proportionate, and which made some very sensible points about why the Bill is not the right way forward.</p>

I wonder where all this banning of things will end. The Bill is just another in a long line of attempts by Labour Members to ban something that they happen not to like.

 My hon. Friend is right. I hope that we are conscious that the public have a low regard for politicians. One reason is that, when politicians are confronted with a specific problem about which people are concerned&#151;there is no doubt that many people in this country are rightly worried about childhood obesity&#151;their instinctive solution appears always to be to incorporate two ingredients.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that opinion about whether a food or drink is healthy or unhealthy is highly subjective? Some foods go in and out of fashion. One wonders about the qualifications of those who make the decisions in, for example, the Food Standards Agency, and who would create policy if the Bill reached the statute book.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. Foods that were once deemed unhealthy are later considered good for you before being thought bad again and so on. Research findings about what is good and bad for people change all the time. Introducing the Bill, which would write off specific foodstuffs, even though they may be perfectly good for people if eaten in moderation, is not only disproportionate but slightly crazy.</p>

In it, he referred to politicians always offering &#147;painless panaceas&#148;. He was right. Time and again, we discuss proposed legislation, which provides what could be described as a painless panacea&#151;something that will sort out all the country&#146;s ills with, lo and behold, no pain for anybody. Such solutions do not exist. Whenever we legislate, we should be clear about the proposed benefits&#151;I doubt whether there are any in the Bill&#151;and the costs. We must ask who will lose out.

 My hon.

 The hon. Gentleman should not apologise for coming in late. His contribution is more than welcome at any stage. The problem is that we have a fundamental disagreement on principle. He clearly believes that the only way to engineer any change is through regulation and Government legislation. However, in recent years we have seen a huge reduction in the amount of salt and sugar in food products. That has not happened because of Government legislation and regulation: it has happened because customer demand has changed. Customers now want healthier products as they are more health-conscious than before, so we do not need all this legislation to bring about those changes. They are taking place already. Anybody who works in industry knows that the most successful companies in the world are those that look after their customers and deliver what they want. If the hon.

 My hon. Friend raises a very interesting point. If I did not know better, I might have thought that he watched our evidence-taking session with Ofcom earlier this week, when I placed in question its independence of the Government. Because the restrictions introduced last year do not appear to me to be based on any evidence, but rather appear to be a sop to the Government who wanted those restrictions, I rather think that my hon. Friend has a point. Given that the Government have given Ofcom this responsibility and that Ofcom said in our evidence session earlier this week, as it has reiterated on a number of occasions, how independent it was of the Government in being an independent regulator, I think it rather mischievous of Government Departments, whether the Department of Health or others, to try to pre-empt Ofcom&#146;s deliberations into these matters by trying to push it down a particular line. If the Government have set up Ofcom as a truly independent regulator, they should leave that independent body to  <br>

get on with it, without trying to nudge it in a particular direction when it suits them. If the Government want to interfere in all these matters, they should not have set up an independent regulator in the first place; they cannot have it both ways and they should not expect an independent regulator to do their dirty work for them, if that is the direction in which they want to go.</p>

Member for Edinburgh, South in support of his Bill was that it would deal with pester-power. That was the hon. Gentleman&#146;s main focus at the start and it may also explain why the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) said that he had seen a poll showing that 80 per cent. of the public think that this sort of restriction would be a good thing. I am not sure that if people understood the full ramifications of the Bill, we would see that kind of endorsement, but I can see why some people would instinctively and at a superficial level be attracted by a restriction on advertising. It has the two ingredients that I mentioned at the start of my speech: it does not really offend anybody and a parent might think that it will avoid a bit of pester-power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80425-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08042574000491">The poll was much more significant, however, because it went on to ask people whether they thought the restrictions would make any difference to childhood obesity, and 76 per cent. of parents said that they did not think they would. Therefore, they might be in favour of this on a superficial level if it stops a bit of pestering, but they do not believe that it would make any difference to childhood obesity. However, that is what the Bill is trying to do. We are trying to deal with childhood obesity, not the convenience of parents who are being pestered by their children.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. A lot of the pestering comes from children themselves. I can well recall collecting my children from primary school and being pestered to allow them to go into the sweet shop next door but one, by them claiming that they were the only ones not allowed to do so&#151;quite erroneously, of course. It is up to parents to resist such pressure, because their children&#146;s teeth, weight and general health is far more important than giving in to their temporary whim of wanting to go into a sweet shop every day.</p>

 My hon. Friend is entirely right. Like her, I believe passionately that parents have responsibility for bringing up their children. There are certain things in life that are very important and about which people should think very carefully. Raising children falls into that category; people must understand that bringing up their children is one of the most crucial things that they do. They cannot farm that out to the state; they have to do it themselves.

 My hon. Friend is right, and it does not take a great leap of faith to see the direction in which Bills of this nature might take us. Indeed, this Bill&#146;s measures are drawn so widely that it is not entirely clear whether it would itself exclude some of these activities. Ice cream sellers who set up in parks at weekends hoping to do some business may well soon find that they are banned from doing so, and therefore people will not be able to enjoy an ice cream when they are feeling hot in the middle of a summer weekend. It is not entirely clear whether the Bill&#146;s promoter, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South, seeks to stop such activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80425-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08042574000497">Parents should be held responsible for bringing up their children and decide what their children eat. I feel sorry for parents who are pestered. I am the parent of two very young children; one of them is four years old and the other is two. They pester me no end about certain things. I am not sure whether they have ever been influenced by any advertising; that just seems to be what children do. By nature, children pester their parents for certain things, and parents have the responsibility to stand up to that, and to say, if they do not think their children should have something, &#147;No, you can&#146;t have it.&#148; I do not want us to have legislation that takes that responsibility away from parents, as that would be counter-productive.</p>

Is that attitude not very convenient? His article captures the thrust of this Bill perfectly. How convenient it would be for all of us who are overweight&#151;like my hon.

 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend; she is absolutely right. It is far better to educate people&#151;for people to see for themselves the consequences of their actions and to conclude what is right for them. Those of us who know that eating too many chips and too many curries will make us overweight have made that decision in the full knowledge of the facts. I am well aware of the problems that my diet might cause me, but I have decided to take that on board and I am going to eat that food anyway. If that makes me overweight, so be it; if that makes me die early, so be it&#151;that is the choice I have made. I agree with my hon. Friend that it is far better to let children come to these conclusions themselves, rather than having the state nannying them and telling them what they can and cannot do, potentially leading to their wanting to rebel against what the state is telling them.

 I agree with my hon. Friend. It strikes me as utterly bizarre that an organisation that supposedly supports the rights of the consumer would want to restrict consumer information through advertising. How on earth it has come to that conclusion I am not entirely sure, but I urge it to revisit what it is about as an organisation. Rather than promoting something that is its own personal bugbear, it should perhaps think about what is in the interests of consumers as a whole. State interference is never really in the interests of consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="80425-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08042574000503">Before I entered Parliament, I worked in marketing for a large food retailer, so I have at least some knowledge of the marketing and food retailing industries, although perhaps not as much as some other people in this House. There are some misconceptions about marketing and how it works. People who know me know that I used to work for Asda, which does lots of TV advertising. I was not personally responsible for the TV adverts involving the &#147;pocket tap&#148; theme that Asda developed, and I certainly would not try to claim credit for it; somebody far more talented than I am came up with that. In fact, the &#147;pocket tap&#148; first appeared in a TV advert back in 1975, so people might wonder what on earth Asda&#146;s marketing department did for the next 30 years, given that we kept to exactly the same &#147;pocket tap&#148; theme&#151;and, indeed, exactly the same music&#151;in our adverts for that entire time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80425-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08042574000504">My point about our advertising strategy is this. We never expected somebody who was sat on a sofa watching a TV advert instantly to leap off their feet, switch off the TV and make a wholly unnecessary extra trip to the supermarket, and the same applies to adverts that Asda puts out today. The purpose of advertising and marketing is not to try to get an extra visit to the supermarket.</p>

 To be honest, I am not sure whether it has or not, but the point that I would make to the hon. Gentleman is that the supermarket industry is now a mature market, as is the food manufacturing industry. When a market is in its infancy, advertising might well help to grow that market as a whole, but once it has matured, advertising does not increase it; it simply affects the market share of the organisation within that market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80425-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08042574000507">The factors that have driven the growth of supermarkets over recent years have nothing to do with the advertising of each individual company; they include the fact that supermarkets sell products that customers want to buy at prices that customers want to pay. Supermarkets are very good at giving customers what they want, such as a place to park or the convenience of buying many different things under one roof. Those are all much bigger factors in the reason people shop at supermarkets than any advertising strategy, and I say that as someone who worked in the marketing department at Asda. Neither my colleagues in that department nor I could claim credit for the success of Asda as an organisation. That was due, more than anything else, to the people working in-store looking after the customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80425-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08042574000508">The reason that Asda spent millions of pounds every year on TV advertising was not because we expected anyone to make an extra unnecessary visit to the supermarket but because we wanted them to shop at Asda, rather than at Tesco, when they next went to a supermarket. Advertising builds a company&#146;s market share. That is the whole purpose of the advertising.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80425-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08042574000509">Introducing a Bill that restricts the advertising of particular products would be similar to stopping a game of pass the parcel at a particular time to benefit a particular player. If the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South gets his way, when the music stops and all the marketing ceases, it will be a huge triumph for whoever happens to have the largest market share at the time. No competitor would ever have the opportunity to stick their oar in and get involved in that market again. </p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that a great deal of psychology goes into the creation of the ambience of a supermarket? That is how they try to increase their market share. The colours used in the store, the width of the aisles, the way in which goods are displayed and the convenience of getting into the store will attract customers to one supermarket rather than another. Those factors have a much greater influence than advertising.</p>

<p><a name="st_o234"><a name="08042574000511"><a name="80425-0011.htm_spnew17"><a name="08042574000944"><b>Philip Davies:</b>
 My hon. Friend raises an interesting point about what motivates people. To be perfectly honest, I think that the vast majority are motivated by convenience. I imagine that the vast majority of people shop at their nearest supermarket, simply as a matter of convenience. People who take into account other factors probably consider lots of factors, including some of the ones that my hon. Friend has mentioned. However, people&#146;s choice will also be governed largely by price. They will often go to the cheapest supermarket, particularly if they are on a fixed income. People with a disability might well shop at the place that offers the best facilities for them. There is a range of factors involved, including the best service or the shortest queuing time. Advertising plays a very small part.</p>

By definition, any supermarket that retails the products whose advertising would be banned is a brand name &#147;associated with&#148; unhealthy products.

I do think that the consequences of the Bill&#146;s extent, which is far beyond what most people would believe in, are fully understood. Supermarkets would also be prevented from promoting some things that benefit schools and some activities that take place in schools.</p>

 The other unintended consequence would be to deny youngsters and their parents information on the products deemed unhealthy by the food police. I shall give two examples. First, an advertisement for Walkers French Fries states:</p>

 My hon. Friend is entirely right, and he picks up on the point made by the hon. Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley) about this issue.

No one present would seriously argue that occasionally having some Marmite on toast could possibly do anyone any harm or be in any way unhealthy. Eating lots of it every day without eating anything else may well be unhealthy, but everything comes back to the fact that we should be promoting a balanced diet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="80425-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08042574000523">While I am on the theme, I should say that certain cereals would be considered so unhealthy as to fall foul of these restrictions. We all know that one of this country&#146;s big problems, as teachers will confirm, is children going to school without having eaten any breakfast. It is rather perverse to try to entrench a situation where people would not be allowed to promote cereals, despite the fact that we all know about that problem that I just described.</p>

 My hon. Friend has made an important point. As he says, clause 2(6) gives the Secretary of State power to make the decisions.

 I realise that it is only six days before the London mayoral election so I shall try to make my speech as general and non-partisan as I can, but I want to set out an important proposition. It is this: the public need to know who is providing funding for candidates for directly elected office, especially if that office comes with significant planning powers, such as those of most directly mayors and, most definitely, the elected Mayor of London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80425-0012.htm_para28"><a name="08042574000555">Contrary to what was said in the <i> Evening Standard</i> earlier today, I am not calling for a change in the law. I am calling for proper enforcement of the existing law&#151;the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000&#151;by the Electoral Commission. It is my belief that the proposition that I outlined above was actually the intention of the Act. Ironically, the Minister in charge of electoral administration is the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)&#151;the Secretary of State for Justice. Ironically, because it was he who in a previous guise, as Home Secretary, introduced the PPERA in 2000. At the time, he said:</p>
<a name="80425-0012.htm_brev4"><a name="08042574000643"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;At the heart of the Bill&#146;s provisions is the need to ensure that the funding of political parties is open and transparent. Greater transparency will not only strengthen the accountability of political parties but help to buttress their financial standing. The secrecy that has hitherto been permitted to political parties in their funding, and the scandals to which such secrecy has given rise in recent years, have undoubtedly left a sour taste. In contrast, all political parties&#151;and the reputation of our political system as a whole&#151;will benefit from the Bill.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 10 January 2000; Vol. 342, c. 35.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80425-0012.htm_para29"><a name="08042574000556">I believe that the &#147;sour taste&#148; described by the right hon. Gentleman is very much with us today, with the London Mayor election. One candidate, the incumbent, Mr. Livingstone, has not declared a single donation since the PPERA began just after his election in 2000, even though many donations were made specifically for him and for the benefit of his campaign. According to schedule 7 of the PPERA, the Mayor of London is a regulated donee. He is specifically named as such:</p>
<a name="80425-0012.htm_brev5"><a name="08042574000644"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Mayor of London or elected mayor within the meaning of Part II of the Local Government Act 2000.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80425-0012.htm_para30"><a name="08042574000557">In addition, the Mayor of London is normally a regulated donee as well, simply for being a member of a registered political party. For the 2004 election, the current Mayor was indeed a member of a registered political party, as he is also for this election. I am absolutely satisfied that, for the purposes of the Act, candidates for Mayor of London are regulated donees. It is not just I who am convinced: I have seen significant legal advice that maintains the same.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80425-0012.htm_para31"><a name="08042574000558">As I have said, Mr. Livingstone has never reported a single donation to the commission as a regulated donee. By comparison, the Norris for London campaign reported &#163;490,000 given to Steve Norris as a regulated donee in 2004. My hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) has declared 58 donations, totalling just under &#163;440,000, this time to him as a regulated donee as a member of a political party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80425-0012.htm_para32"><a name="08042574000559">Any London voter can quickly learn, from the names and amounts given, the nature of the funding behind the campaign of my hon. Friend the Member for Henley, as they could for Steve Norris in 2004. I believe that that is why we have political funding rules: they allow voters, stakeholders and journalists the opportunity to scrutinise for themselves who is funding the main candidates and incumbents and to make their judgment accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80425-0012.htm_para33"><a name="08042574000560">The Livingstone team declares that the rules do not apply to him, as it says that all fundraising is carried out in the name of the Labour party. Even if that were true&#151;I will show significant evidence to the contrary shortly&#151;he would still need to make the declarations as a regulated donee. It is irrelevant whether the donations are physically received by the candidate if they are made to him&#151;the phrase in the PPERA is a &#147;controlled donation&#148;&#151;for his use or benefit as the holder of such an office in connection with any of his political activities. Failure to submit the appropriate donation report is an offence under the PPERA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80425-0012.htm_para34"><a name="08042574000561">So what difference does it make whether a mayoral candidate or a candidate for any other directly elected office is treated as a regulated donee under schedule 7? First, the reporting requirements for a regulated donee are significantly more stringent than for a political party. Instead of quarterly, declarations need to be made monthly. That requirement is particularly significant during the run-up to an election, where monthly or quarterly declarations make a big difference to whether the electors can see the donation before or after polling day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80425-0012.htm_para35"><a name="08042574000562">The other main difference is the threshold amount. For regulated donees, it is &#163;1,000. For political parties, it is &#163;5,000. Again, that is a very significant difference. For reasons that I will discuss shortly&#151;the London Mayor&#146;s very significant planning powers&#151;I believe that it is vital for the reporting frequency to be as often as reasonably possible for the London Mayor and for the threshold to be as low as reasonably possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80425-0012.htm_para36"><a name="08042574000563">Returning to the current incumbent, his team has been arguing that he should not be treated as a regulated donee, as all funds are given via the Labour party, and therefore the rules that affect political parties should apply. However, until it was recently modified, the website that solicits donations to the Ken Livingstone campaign&#151;kenlivingstone.com&#151;made it explicit that donations are for the Ken Livingstone campaign, not even for general Labour party fundraising, or indeed regional, London-wide Labour party fundraising. The website was specifically inviting donations for Ken Livingstone. Indeed, the cheques were due to be made payable to a separate account in the name of Ken Livingstone. Similarly, the website claimed that the threshold above which any donation needs to be declared was &#163;5,000, which is correct for political parties, but clearly wrong for regulated donees. Also, donations to a political party must be reported only seven weeks after the end of a quarter. For regulated donees, such reports must be made within 30 days of receipt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80425-0012.htm_para37"><a name="08042574000564">To summarise, we have four very significant problems with the arrangements. First, it is impossible to see who is funding the Livingstone campaign separately from any general Labour party funding, even though donations were and still are being solicited specifically to help the candidate, not necessarily the political party. In fact,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="25 Apr 2008">

<notus-date day="25" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>25 Apr 2008 : Column 1656</b><br>
with the current way that the PPERA is being operated, we might never know who gave to Ken Livingstone and who gave to the Labour party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80425-0012.htm_para38"><a name="08042574000565">Secondly, because he does not believe that he is a regulated donee, the frequency of declarations is only quarterly, not monthly. That might not normally make much difference, but in the run-up to an election of the magnitude of next week&#146;s, that makes a huge difference. The fact is that, with the last quarter of the campaign&#146;s fundraising&#151;probably the biggest quarter of all for donations&#151;the names will not be known until 27 May, which is 26 days after polling day. There is therefore no chance for Londoners to see who is funding the Mayor&#146;s re-election campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80425-0012.htm_para39"><a name="08042574000566">Thirdly, the threshold is &#163;5,000, rather than the &#163;1,000 limit that applies to regulated donees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80425-0012.htm_para40"><a name="08042574000567">Fourthly, the time lag is unacceptable, even if donations to individuals are disaggregated from those given to parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80425-0012.htm_para41"><a name="08042574000568">The Minister doubtless knows that I took up those issues with the Electoral Commission in March, but its investigation was wholly unsatisfactory. Despite the clear evidence that the spirit and letter of the PPERA were being circumvented, the Electoral Commission pronounced itself satisfied, because it said that there was no evidence that any donation had actually been made. In other words, despite a separate bank account for Livingstone donations, millions of leaflets pouring off the presses, widespread media reports of lucrative fundraising auctions and evidence from the 2000 campaign that Ken Livingstone has the ability to raise significant sums of money in his own name, the Electoral Commission saw no evidence that a single donation had actually been made to the Livingstone campaign and therefore could see no grounds for investigation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80425-0012.htm_para42"><a name="08042574000569">The Electoral Commission wanted to see specific evidence that donations had not been properly reported. Its letter to me stated:</p>

<a name="80425-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="08042574000645"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I would point out that there is no evidence that any reportable donation has not been declared.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80425-0013.htm_para0"><a name="08042574000570">That is a farce. Because of the subterfuge and the refusal to report any donations, it is impossible to discover a donation that has not been declared, which is the point of the complaint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80425-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08042574000571">I even pointed the Electoral Commission to past donations to suggest a pattern of behaviour that should be examined. I pointed to a donation to Mr. Livingstone&#146;s 2004 campaign from a property developer, Gerald Ronson, that had gone unreported. Again, the Electoral Commission refused to investigate or even to consider that that past transgression might suggest similar behaviour in this campaign. It said that the 2004 donation was of no interest:</p>
<a name="80425-0013.htm_brev1"><a name="08042574000646"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Any proceedings in relation to such a matter would have to be brought within three years of that date. This deadline has now expired.&#148;</p>

This is the second largest direct election in Europe, after that for the President of France, and 5 million electors deserve to know who is paying for all the glossy leaflets that come through their doors from the main candidates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="80425-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08042574000573">In 2004, Ken Livingstone also made no declarations, yet Londoners might well have decided differently, if they had been aware of the full facts on who was funding the candidates. My research at the office of the trades union certification officer has revealed that the largest donation to Mayor Livingstone in 2004 probably came from one of the hated tube unions, ASLEF, which made a specific donation in late 2003 to Ken Livingstone&#151;there was no mention of the Labour party&#151;for his campaign for re-election. The Labour party did not declare that donation, either. Londoners would have taken a dim view that Mr. Livingstone&#146;s re-election was being financed by the same tube unions who were on strike on a number of occasions&#151;strikes which the Mayor often pretended to condemn. I note from today&#146;s <i> Evening Standard</i> that the same is reportedly happening now. Nobody knows who is funding Mr. Livingstone this time around, either, because of the poor application of the 2000 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80425-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08042574000574">On donations from property developers, I have already mentioned Gerald Ronson, who made a payment to the Labour Mayor&#146;s re-election campaign two years after he received planning permission for the Heron Tower development in the City. The 202 m skyscraper was opposed by English Heritage and the dean of St. Paul&#146;s cathedral, because they said that it would damage the capital&#146;s historic skyline. However, Mr. Livingstone said that it would &#147;support London&#146;s economic future&#148;. The Ronson donation was made after planning permission was granted and shortly before Mr. Livingstone won the June 2004 London mayoral election. A spokeswoman for the developer told <i> The Times</i> last month:</p>
<a name="80425-0013.htm_brev2"><a name="08042574000647"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I can confirm it was a personal cheque from Gerald Ronson. The exact amount was &#163;4,990.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80425-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08042574000575">Mr. Livingstone also took donations from another property developer, Irving Sellar. At the Mayor&#146;s press conference two years after that election, on 21 March 2006, he said about his two donors:</p>
<a name="80425-0013.htm_brev3"><a name="08042574000648"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I deal with many property developers, Irving Sellar, Gerald Ronson&#151;they&#146;re there to make a profit, they also have a commitment to the city, they have a pride in creating great buildings, they&#146;re proud they are creating jobs, they actually, they share the sense of being Londoners... I mean most of the major property developers who&#146;ve had an interest in this city come along to my office, get involved, make sure their plans are acceptable to my planning officers, make a reasonable contribution.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="80425-0013.htm_para6"><a name="08042574000576">There you have it&#151;we not only have a Mayor who does not declare any donations, but one who welcomes what he calls &#147;reasonable contributions&#148; from property developers in meetings at his own office, where planning applications are being discussed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80425-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08042574000577">The various donations from ASLEF, Gerald Ronson and Irving Sellar went unreported in the 2004 campaign and thereafter. Disgracefully, they have become known in the past two months, and still neither has been reported in any way to the Electoral Commission. I wonder whether that was what the Government had in mind when they trumpeted new transparency in political funding when introducing the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="80425-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08042574000578">Why does it matter that people know who is funding the London Mayor? Perhaps that is not obvious. I have given the example of Gerald Ronson and the suspicious  <br>

circumstances of the granting of planning permission, which was followed up by a donation to Mayor Livingstone&#146;s re-election campaign. The Mayor has had significant planning powers since 2000, but they have been greatly strengthened by the Greater London Authority Act 2007, which, by a strange coincidence, was brought into force just this month. It gives the Mayor the power not only to refuse an application of strategic importance but to approve one. One can therefore begin to understand why property developers might become even more interested in donating. The Mayor can now countermand a London borough&#146;s refusal to grant planning permission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="80425-0013.htm_para9"><a name="08042574000579">I was a member of the Public Bill Committee on that Act, and the extension of the Mayor&#146;s planning powers was considerable. The Act and guidance outline a huge range of strategic planning decisions to be taken by the Mayor, including those on developments of more than 500 homes; developments in which more than 200 existing homes are to be demolished, even if replaced by more than 200 new homes; developments with more than 20,000 sq m of floor space; buildings more than 30 m high, or 25 m adjacent to the Thames; any development including an aircraft runway; a tube or rail station; a bus or coach station; a passenger pier on the Thames, and so on. Those are clearly very considerable planning powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80425-0013.htm_para10"><a name="08042574000580">What is more, true to the Mayor&#146;s directly elected office, those decisions will be made by the one-man planning authority in private, unlike the decisions of a planning committee of a local authority. Unlike any other planning authority, the one-man authority has a separate duty to promote regeneration in London. It seems inevitable that, in his regeneration capacity, the London Mayor will have frequent interaction with property developers. The current incumbent already does, for example by visiting major developers&#146; conferences in exotic locations such as Cannes, in the south of France. Huge strategic decisions are being made in private, behind closed doors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80425-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08042574000581">Thanks to the Electoral Commission&#146;s interpretation of the 2000 Act, we will not know if any of those developers have made contributions to the Mayor&#146;s campaign during an election or to his office in non-election years. We will have no idea whether there is any financial motivation behind the decisions made in private by the Mayor&#151;not necessarily the current incumbent&#151;as a one-person planning authority. That is an invitation to corruption and conflicts of interest on a massive scale in meetings taking place in secrecy. The Mayor is responsible for strategic planning decisions. Unlike, say, loft extensions, such decisions are likely to involve large developers. It is precisely such large developers who are likely to be making political donations to candidates for directly elected office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="80425-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08042574000582">There is even more need for directly elected persons to disclose their donations than for political parties to do so. That is especially true for directly elected persons who are also one-man planning authorities. We have seen how the current Mayor links planning permissions to undefined &#147;contributions&#148;. That sort of practice needs to be stamped out or, at the very least, we in the London electorate need to see what those contributions are.</p>

I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response and her proposals for change and the proper enforcement of the PPERA so that we can have proper transparency in the funding of directly elected office holders.</p>

 When the hon.

He seems to have come to the House on the pretence of being concerned about propriety, ethics and regulations governing election expenses, yet he has spent the best part&#151;two thirds&#151;of the time for the debate making scurrilous attacks on the London Mayor, Ken Livingstone, who is the Labour party candidate in next Thursday&#146;s election, and on the Labour party in London and as a whole.

As far as I can see, neither the Labour party candidate, the Liberal Democrat candidate nor any other candidate has reported individual donations. I assume that that is because they, like the Labour party candidate, have had donations made to their party, rather than to themselves as a regulated donee.</p>

 The Minister is quite right in her facts, but does she not agree that what she says rather bears out the fact that donations should be visible and transparent? She is able to make her correct assertion about the funding that I received for the last general election because the donations are visible on the Electoral Commission&#146;s website. The fact is that there are no donations visible for the Mayor of London since his first election in 2000, eight years ago.</p>

 I have already answered the point about the Mayor of London; donations to his campaign are made to the Labour party, and are used by the Labour party to fund the campaign. Many of us are concerned about the fact that an individual can throw cash at marginal seats around the country, and be subject to no serious accountability at all. I hope that that is one of the issues that we will address when we deal with party funding shortly. I have to say that we would have addressed the issue far more quickly if the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party had decided to work with us, and with the other parties in the House, on coming to a consensus on the issue.
