 The figures used to monitor progress towards the UK&#039;s climate change targets are published annually in the UK&#039;s greenhouse gas inventory. The inventory is subject to annual independent scientific peer review by a team of specialists organised by the secretariat of the UN framework convention on climate change. The inventory also contains internal quality assurance and quality control procedures, in line with international guidance prepared by the intergovernmental panel on climate change.

 (Lab/Co-op): Does my right hon.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60309-01_spnew3"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend, on his Bill and on his sales pitch.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60309-01_spnew4"><b> Chris Huhne  (Eastleigh)</b> 
 (LD): The data show very clearly that carbon dioxide emissions have increased by 2.9 per cent. since the Government came to power. Moreover, the Secretary of State will know that environmental taxes peaked at 3.6 per cent. of gross domestic product in 1999, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics, but that the latest figures show that they have slipped to 3 per cent. Does she think that there may be some connection between falling environmental taxes, which are now lower as a share of GDP even than when the Government came into office, and the record of failure on emissions?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60309-01_spnew5"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 First, I welcome the hon. Gentleman to his new responsibilities. I am sure that he will find the subject fascinating and enjoyable, as we all do. I do not agree with the basic premise of his question&#151;that CO <sub>2</sub> levels have risen because of changes in the impact of taxation. In fact, the rise has much more to do with the impact of fuel prices on the choices of fuel made by power generators. We very much regret that impact and, although the most recent figures suggest that it might not have been as severe between 2003 and 2004 as we had anticipated, we completely accept that we have to get the rise under control. However, I remind the hon. Gentleman of one further fact that undermines the point that he made: all five EU countries whose emissions are lower than they were in 1990 recorded an increase in CO <sub>2</sub> emissions in the period to which he referred.

 (Lab): In respect of emission reductions, is there any reason to doubt the validity of the 2003 Energy White Paper? It argued that energy efficiency was the safest and cleanest way to manage carbon reductions.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60309-01_spnew7"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 No, I do not think that there is any reason to doubt that judgment. Energy efficiency can be a very powerful tool. For historical reasons of under-investment over many decades in this country, it is available to us to a greater degree than is the case with the many other European countries that up to now have been able to deliver higher levels of energy efficiency. However, my hon. Friend will know that the investment put in by this Government, not least through the warm front programme, means that we are beginning to make inroads in that respect.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60309-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Peter Ainsworth  (East Surrey)</b> 
 (Con): Some Opposition Members wish that the Secretary of State would have rather more rows with the DTI. Her Department says that, on current trends, we will cut carbon emissions by 13 per cent. by 2010, but the DTI says that the cut will amount to only 10 per cent. Are DEFRA and the DTI working on different sets of data and predictive models, and which figure is right?
</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>working on different models. Figures and assessments are being revised all the time, as information comes in. I understand why the hon. Gentleman wishes that I would have more rows with my colleagues, but I find that that does not help me to get my own way, which is what I like to do.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60309-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Ainsworth: </b> 
 We are very supportive of the right hon. Lady getting her own way, and hope that she is successful. We know that relations with the DTI are difficult, but how is she getting on with monitoring the accuracy of the data used by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chancellor? Is she aware of research that shows that the ODPM&#039;s efforts to predict greenhouse gas emissions from new housing are completely flawed because they are based on data that are 25 years out of date? What discussions did she have with the Treasury about the accuracy of published figures on greenhouse gas emissions before the Chancellor aborted the operating and financial review? That decision has wasted millions of pounds, angered responsible business leaders and underlined yet again that, although she may be serious about climate change, the Government as a whole cannot be trusted on the issue.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60309-01_spnew11"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 With respect, that question muddles together several issues. It is true that the operating and financial review is not going ahead, but there remain requirements on companies to report on environmental standards under other legislation, which is partly why it was decided that there was no need to have two different sets of reasons for reporting. As for the validity of data from other Departments, I understand that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party is now saying that it wants us all to be on the same page and move in the same direction on such issues. That is good, and I welcome that. However, the issue is not the data&#151;whether they are as good as they should be or could be improved&#151;but what we actually do about them. That is something on which I would like to see greater agreement.

<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60309-01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Jim Knight): </b> 
 The warm front scheme has assisted more than 1 million households since June 2000 and now provides central heating to all eligible households. It was announced in the 2005 pre-Budget report that an additional &#163;250 million would be made available to the scheme.
</p>

 In view of the steep increases in domestic energy bills, does my hon. Friend agree that a further improvement to the scheme, which would help those most likely to be in fuel poverty, would be to replace the warm front scheme&#039;s current maximum grant arrangements with a system based on an average grant? Such a system is already in place in Scotland and it ensures that low income households are not required to make any contribution to the cost of the work in their homes.

 I am grateful for the interest that my hon. Friend shows in the scheme and I note that the warm front scheme has assisted more than 2,785 of her constituents in its present form. The extra money that was announced by the Chancellor in the pre-Budget report will obviously go some way towards alleviating some of the effect of increases in fuel prices, and we continue to review the scheme to ensure that it is working well to achieve our aim of ending fuel poverty.

<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60309-01_spnew14"><b> Jeremy Wright  (Rugby and Kenilworth)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Minister accept that there are two problems with the warm front scheme, which prevent it from helping more people in more ways? The first is that the warm front grant is often used to pay for insulation, which should be provided free of charge by energy suppliers under the energy efficiency commitment scheme. The second is that warm front contractors often charge substantially more than other local contractors would&#151;in some cases, more than &#163;1,000 more. Will he look into those two problems and resolve them?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60309-01_spnew15"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 I can certainly look into those problems, but I would like to pay tribute to the Eaga Partnership, a successful social enterprise that carries out that work for us. I certainly welcome the hon. Gentleman&#039;s interest in the scheme, especially as his party, when in government, denied that fuel poverty even existed.

<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60309-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Barry Sheerman  (Huddersfield)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): Does my hon. Friend agree that an extension of the warm front campaign that could link energy from waste with district heating could transform our energy supplies? Is it not time that the Liberal Democrats, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth realised that the scientific arguments for energy from waste are compelling and stopped their knee-jerk reactions to those important questions? Let us have an energy from waste programme that really works.

<p>3. Tony Lloyd (Manchester, Central) (Lab): If she will make a statement on the findings of the intergovernmental panel on climate change.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 931</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>




<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60309-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Margaret Beckett): </b> 
 My Department has accepted the assessments of the intergovernmental panel on climate change as providing the most authoritative picture of climate change. The third assessment report of the IPCC was published in 2001 and has made a most valuable contribution to our understanding of the importance of the issue. The IPCC is undertaking its fourth assessment. The draft reports are currently undergoing peer review and will not be published until 2007.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="60309-02_spnew0"><b> Tony Lloyd: </b> 
 May I endorse my right hon. Friend&#039;s remark that the IPCC produces the most authoritative reports? However, its reports have not been uniformly accepted throughout the world, even though the science that they contain is as good as it can get. We surmise from the leaks of the draft of the report that my right hon. Friend will have in April that it will be even more dire in its predictions than previous reports, because it will say that there is no upper limit to temperature increases owing to carbon dioxide increases. Does the Minister believe that it will galvanise the whole of the international community, including the United States and countries that opted out of Kyoto, to do something serious about climate change?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="60309-02_spnew1"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to say that the number of those who question the science has diminished dramatically. That can only be a good thing. The new draft report is still undergoing peer review, so this is a delicate time to comment, but over the past year, not least as a result of the efforts of this Government through our G8 and European Union presidencies, even those who may retain some lingering traces of scepticism have accepted that the risks are such that it is wise for them to address those risks. That is why we are seeing more emphasis on adaptation, and not just on reducing emissions, although the two have to go together. As my hon. Friend will know, following the Gleneagles summit and the establishment of the Gleneagles dialogue, there is now a much greater degree of international dialogue, exchange, communication and so on, drawing in all the major economies of the world. We hope that that will provide us with a way forward.

<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="60309-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Michael Jack  (Fylde)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Secretary of State agree that an important contribution to addressing the findings of the IPCC would be to reduced greenhouse gas emissions from our power stations by the use of biomass? In that context, could the Secretary of State explain to the House why the value of the renewables obligation certificates now makes it less attractive to use biomass as a co-firing fuel medium in power stations at the very time when research shows that as a biofuel it gives the best return per hectare in carbon dioxide reductions?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="60309-02_spnew3"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman is right to say that there is growing awareness of the value and potential of biomass and of biofuels. The value of the renewables obligation certificates and the issues that go with that are part of what the Government are looking at in the energy review. I am sure that, in his capacity as Chairman of the Select Committee on Environment, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="60309-02_spnew5"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I am not sure what direct contacts we have with the industry, but our scientists draw on a wide range of disciplines and information. They are very much in touch with other scientists and have done a huge amount of observational work with them. Not unusually in this field, we have some of the best scientific expertise anywhere in the world. My hon. Friend may know that our climate change scientists are making the fruits of their work more freely available&#151;for example, in the developing world, to aid in adaptation.

 (DUP): Although I acknowledge the serious nature of the problems of climate change that face us all, the Secretary of State will remember that the five Opposition parties wrote to her offering to work with her Department and the Government to find a united way to face that challenge. Has she accepted that offer?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o30"><a name="60309-02_spnew7"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 Yes, I did receive such a letter and I welcomed it, as I have indicated before, because it suggested that all the parties represented in the House accept the science and the targets that the Government have set, which is very much an important step forward. There are two other things, however. I shall not start ringing bells until I can see that we are in greater agreement about what we should actually do, because there has been a pattern whereby all the concrete actions that the Government have proposed have been one by one opposed by other parties in the House. We have not yet had an opportunity to test whether that has changed. It is a slightly different matter for a Government to engage in dialogue about future policy development than it is for other parties, although I very much hope that their policy decisions are fruitful, and greatly welcome the moves that have been made so far.

<p><a name="st_o33"><a name="60309-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I am sorry if some of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s poultry keepers and breeders feel confused. Without more detail, I do not know who is giving them conflicting advice, but the advice from the Government&#151;from the chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, downwards&#151;has been absolutely clear, and that is, as I said in my initial reply, that the vaccines currently available are not considered the most efficacious way of dealing with a disease outbreak.

 (Lab/Co-op): Will my hon. Friend clarify the situation in the EU, as there seems to have been a breakdown in the pan-EU approach to avian influenza? Are countries that are vaccinating at present intending to cull later, or do they believe that the vaccinated poultry will be protected?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o35"><a name="60309-02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The European Commission has granted limited consent to the Netherlands and France to vaccinate on a pilot basis, in extremely limited circumstances. In the case of France, for example, vaccination is happening in only two of the three regions that applied for it, owing to resistance from the industry and the public. In answer to the second part of my hon. Friend&#039;s question, I expect that both the Netherlands and France hope that a vaccination programme might avoid the need to cull in the event of an outbreak, but our advice is that that scenario is extremely unlikely.

 Local authority emergency planning departments are intricately involved in all the discussions and preparations across Government, involving not just our Department but the Department of Health, and local authorities will be involved in the forthcoming contingency exercise.

Trade controls on avian flu are on a regional basis, from which we could benefit, as we did last year when there was a case of Newcastle disease in this country.

 The simple answer is that the lessons are mixed. The hon.

Scientific opinion is mixed on whether that is a sensible thing to do. Three other countries in Asia which have not received so much publicity&#151;Malaysia, Japan and South Korea&#151;have all had outbreaks of AI in the past few years. They are all in a region where AI is endemic in wild birds. They have dealt with the problem through containment and eradication. They have not vaccinated. The answer to the hon.

 We have worked extremely closely with all of the devolved Administrations. My hon.

Only last week the Prime Minister said that vaccination is not effective in stopping the spread of the disease, but experience in Hong Kong&#151;a properly validated scientific exercise&#151;has shown that vaccinated birds do not transmit the disease. It appears that we have a Government policy of no vaccination, yet the Government have an imminent delivery of Nobilis vaccine for use in zoos. At the same time there is increasing doubt about whether other outdoor birds

 There is considerable variation in the performance of local authorities in using their powers to improve the local environment. We intend expanding the local environment quality survey to all local authorities in England, and we will publish the results.

<p><a name="st_o47"><a name="60309-03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Simon: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for that answer. Birmingham city council is proving very good at levying fines under the new Act, and proving very bad at chasing up the collection of the fines. Given the obvious limited deterrent effect of fines that do not have to be paid, and notwithstanding the notable incompetence and dithering of the Tory-led and Liberal-assisted leadership of Birmingham city council, can my hon. Friend suggest any ways in which councils such as Birmingham might put a bit of substance behind their sound and fury and collect fines rather more effectively than purely vigorously?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o48"><a name="60309-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I hope that they will be partly persuaded by my hon. Friend&#039;s intervention. He is quite right to point out that there are huge variations in local authority performance. Some local authorities do not levy any fixed penalty notices at all, whereas others issue hundreds. It is important that local authorities such as his own in Birmingham use the extra powers that the Labour Government have given them to tackle environmental crime&#151;powers, I might add, that were opposed by the Conservative party.

 Not in our Priuses, indeed. I agree with the hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan). As someone who uses the bicycle as his usual form of transport I, too, am annoyed by motorists who leave their vehicles idling for no reason. Obviously, they may have a reason to do so if they are waiting in cold temperatures for a long time for a Minister who is delayed at a meeting, but I join the hon.

</p>


<p><a name="st_o54"><a name="60309-03_spmin2"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Mr. Ben Bradshaw): </b> 
 Since November, Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs has doubled the number of staff who check passengers, freight and post from H5N1-affected countries. We are also launching publicity campaigns on avian influenza on top of existing campaigns on illegal imports.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o55"><a name="60309-03_spnew6"><b> Ann Winterton: </b> 
 Avian flu receives a great deal of publicity, but will the Minister reflect on the increasing danger of illegally imported meat and meat products into this country? On average, up to 12 tonnes are imported a year, a percentage of which is infected with foot and mouth, so will he improve considerably defences against those illegal imports? Ten sniffer dogs for 110 points of entry and increased baggage X-ray facilities are simply not good enough. Will he give higher priority to this important issue, which may adversely affect both human and animal health?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o56"><a name="60309-03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is right to say that we should not slacken our guard against other threats because of the high level of vigilance against avian flu. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 937</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>However, we are not slackening our guard&#151;we have provided &#163;25 million of new money over three years to tackle the problem of illegal imports, and we have vastly increased resources for Customs and Excise, which has improved its checking, as there have been more seizures and prosecutions. There is no such thing as 100 per cent. security, but I am satisfied that we are doing as much as we can with the very generous resources that the Chancellor has made available.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o57"><a name="60309-03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Roger Williams  (Brecon and Radnorshire)</b> 
 (LD): Recent estimates suggest that 15 million of the 30 million pheasants reared in this country for shooting are imported from France either as eggs or as young poults. Given the outbreak of H5N1 in France, has the Department undertaken any risk assessment of that trade, which will start in earnest in the next couple of months?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o58"><a name="60309-03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Yes indeed, we have done so. The assessment is that there is no risk as long as the pheasants do not come from an area where there has been H5N1 infection. Our vets have written to their French counterparts asking for extra reassurance. If we had to curtail those imports, there would be serious repercussions for our shooting industry, which makes a huge contribution to the economy of rural areas.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o59"><a name="60309-03_spnew10"><b> Bill Wiggin  (Leominster)</b> 
 (Con): The European Food Safety Authority&#039;s recent report on foot and mouth disease found that between 1 per cent. and 5 per cent. of travellers bring into the EU about 5 kg of animal products from foot and mouth disease-infected areas. The promised meat disposal bins and extra staff do not seem to have materialised. There have been only eight prosecutions, of which one was custodial, since the disease was in Britain. As 97 per cent. of the foot and mouth disease risk is in passenger baggage, why have we only 10 meat detector sniffer dogs to cover the whole UK? Between 2,800 and 17,500 tonnes of illegal meat is imported annually into the EU. How hard is it to train more dogs to sniff out that much meat?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o60"><a name="60309-03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 There have been nine prosecutions, in fact. We have 10 sniffer dogs&#151;10 more than we had under the Conservative Government. We will soon have 14, which will be 14 more than any other EU country.

 My hon. Friend is right to highlight both our progress and the fact that we are still a long way behind most other EU countries. I invite him and other Members to study the draft consultation document on the review of our waste strategy, which contains new targets for recycling that are considerably more ambitious than our 2000 targets&#151;up to 50 per cent. by 2020.

That has not been particularly difficult, however. If we can get the rest to the level of the best, we can meet the target in a straightforward way. Any hon.

 I am sure hon. Members can hardly wait. The hon. Gentleman is right, though, and I congratulate his local authority on its performance. He is also right to highlight the huge variation in the performance of local authorities, with some up as high as 50 per cent. plus, as his is, and some down in single figures. That shows that it can be done, and we want the poor performers to learn from the good.

Is the suggestion in the waste review that energy from municipal waste might rise from 9 per cent. at present to 27 per cent. by 2020 an aspiration or a target? Has he made an estimate of the energy production capacity that that increase might represent? Does he agree that it would represent the capacity of three or four nuclear power stations, and if he does, will he communicate that idea&#151;

 We do think that energy from waste has a role to play, and think, as do all the green non-governmental organisations, that it is preferable to landfill. The figure in our review document is not a target, but an assessment of where we think we are likely to be, which is considerably higher than we thought in our 2000 review&#151;we thought we would be at 33 per cent. by 2020&#151;because we have done so much better on recycling and expect to do better still.

 The effort that the hon. Gentleman has described is principally the responsibility of Ofwat. Significant progress has been made in reducing leakage since the peak in 1994.

<p><a name="st_o98"><a name="60309-05_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Margaret Beckett): </b> 
 The Government expect to exceed by about 7 percentage points our Kyoto protocol commitment to reduce the UK&#039;s greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008&#150;12. We have today published the UK&#039;s demonstrable progress report, which has recently been sent to the secretariat of the United Nation&#039;s framework convention on climate change, confirming our progress towards our target. A copy is available on my Department&#039;s website.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o99"><a name="60309-05_spnew6"><b> James Duddridge: </b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for that reply, but given that Sir David King, the chief scientific adviser, has stated that the 2010, not 2012, target will be &quot;a very tough target&quot; and that longer-term targets are perhaps more critical, what assessment has the Secretary of State made of a 60 per cent. reduction by 2050? Is that now more of an aspirational than an achievable target?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o100"><a name="60309-05_spnew7"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I am talking about the Kyoto targets, which are for greenhouse gases as a whole, whereas I think that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s reference to Sir David King may have been about our CO <sub>2</sub>  targets for 2010 and 2050. They are very tough targets. That is why they were set: there is a great deal to do. In the not-too-distant future, we will publish the climate change review, to which we committed ourselves in 2000, to show how we can get closer to those targets; but of course, no one has yet drawn out the path to 2050. Work is continuing on that, and I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we will keep the House informed of that work.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o101"><a name="60309-05_spnew8"><b> Mr. Cunningham: </b> 
 Can my right hon. Friend say what the British Government are doing to assist other countries in achieving their climatic targets&#151;for example, with projects, technology and so forth?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o102"><a name="60309-05_spnew9"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is quite right to suggest that not just the Government but the private sector in the UK can do a great deal to help others. Developing countries do not have such targets, but they can certainly make a substantial contribution towards solving or exacerbating the problem, as the case may be, and now that we have the Kyoto protocol enforced, since the earlier part of this year, there is increasing scope for projects to be developed under the clean development mechanism, whereby sometimes Governments but sometimes private companies can invest in technologies in developing countries to help them towards a low-carbon economy. Indeed, I rather take the view that that may be a big spur towards the transfer of technology, which has been sought as a development goal for so long.

 (LD): The Secretary of State will be aware that the Kyoto targets do not include emissions from international aviation, which is obviously good news for any Minister who wishes to jet off to international conferences on carbon emissions. However, how will the Secretary of State resolve the discrepancies between her Department and the Department of Trade and Industry over aviation? Unless we repeal the second law of thermodynamics, we cannot have the massive increase in aviation specified in the aviation White Paper and reduce carbon emissions? How will she resolve that discrepancy?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o104"><a name="60309-05_spnew11"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 Of course I am aware that aviation is not included. At the time, it was thought to be much too difficult and the belief was that, if people tried to include aviation, the project would never get off the ground&#151;sorry for that. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that, during our EU presidency, we got agreement from the European Commission to consider including aviation in the EU emissions trading scheme. There is what one could call a slightly theoretical commitment from the global aviation organisations that emissions trading is the way to tackle the impact of aviation but no concrete steps have been taken towards that. If we can get the matter agreed in the EU, that would be a hugely powerful step towards global action. As for Ministers travelling to discuss climate change, the hon. Gentleman reminds me of a question that I was asked at a meeting for the Gleneagles dialogue in London. One journalist asked why no Minister had arrived by bike. I explained that it was a little difficult to get here by bike from Latin America.

 Most waste collection authorities are doing their best to educate people about the virtues of waste reduction.

 No, it is not necessarily. We must be careful during our review of waste policy that we do not introduce incentives into the system that increase incineration at the cost of recycling. We do not intend to do that. However, there will always be residual waste after recycling, reused to the point of minimisation. For

 We are capable of disclosing information geographically but have yet to decide whether to do that on a constituency or a postcode basis.

 The number of new incinerators built will depend on the technologies and the scale of facilities chosen by local authorities. The Government estimate that waste to energy of all types will account for about 25 per cent. of our municipal waste by 2020, up from 9 per cent. today but considerably less than was envisaged under our 2000 waste strategy because we have done so well on recycling.

They should be encouraged to use those accounts, preserving the Post Office and its business. I see no reason to be quite so alarmist about the future of the Post Office.

<a name="60309-10_time0"><h5>12.13 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_58"><a name="60309-10_spmin2"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Mr. Adam Ingram): </b> 
 Mr. Deputy Speaker, I want today to announce the settlement package for the Royal Irish (Home Service) personnel being discharged as a result of the Northern Ireland normalisation process. I want also to mention that we have completed work on a related issue&#151;the reduction in the number of Royal Armoured Corps and infantry bands within the Army, as part of the overall work on the future Army structure. As a further part of that work, the band of the Royal Irish Regiment will be disbanded by 31 March 2008, and the Territorial Army band in Northern Ireland will be renamed the Royal Irish Regiment Band (TA). Full details have been provided to the House in a written ministerial statement today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_47">The House will recall that on 1 August 2005, the start of the security normalisation process in Northern Ireland was declared. We said then that, should the security situation remain satisfactory, Operation Banner, under which the military provide support to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, will end on 1 August 2007, and that after that there will be no requirement for the three Royal Irish (Home Service) battalions. However, they will be required to support the police in the 2006 marching season.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_48">I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to these dedicated and brave men and women, who have contributed so much in bringing us to where we are today. We will never forget that more than 200 Royal Irish (Home Service) and Ulster Defence Regiment personnel made the ultimate sacrifice while serving in Northern Ireland. I know that the day of disbandment will be a sad one for the battalions and for each and every member of the Home Service, but we should take the opportunity to look at how far we have come. They should all be rightly proud of the crucial role that they have played in creating the environment for normalisation to begin, and I offer my thanks for their sacrifice and fortitude.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_49">My Department has been working hard to draw up a settlement package for the military personnel in question, and I am now in a position to provide details of it. In addition to the normal armed forces occupational redundancy and resettlement package, full-time personnel will receive a tax-free, flat-rate ex gratia payment of &#163;28,000. Part-time military personnel will receive a tax-free, flat-rate ex gratia payment of &#163;14,000. These payments are in recognition of the impact that disbandment will have on those serving in the Home Service, and are an acknowledgement of the pressures that they will face on re-integrating into the community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_50">All full-time soldiers will be offered normal redundancy terms, which include a lump sum, tax-free compensation payment and, for many, early payment of pension. They will also have access to a full resettlement service, including training and a job-finding service. Part-time Home Service personnel will benefit from a job-finding resettlement service. There will be a bespoke Royal Irish after-care service to provide continuing 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 962</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>support; it will be accessible by all former members of the Ulster Defence Regiment and of the Royal Irish (Home Service), as well as their dependants. Exact details of the after-care service are, however, still being worked on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_51">I cannot over-emphasise how eager we are for as many Home Service personnel as possible to take the opportunity to continue their career in the armed forces, where they can carry on making a valuable contribution to defence. Consequently, we are offering an alternative taxable engagement bounty of &#163;10,000 to eligible Royal Irish (Home Service) personnel who wish to transfer into, and are accepted into, the general service Army.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_52">The settlement package will be offered to all Royal Irish (Home Service) officers and soldiers still in service on 31 August 2006. The package has been designed to take into account three factors collectively: first, the pressures and restrictions that members of the Royal Irish (Home Service) faced while serving in their local community, and which are likely to continue to affect them in the immediate aftermath of the regiment&#039;s disbandment; secondly, the importance of assisting more than 3,000 of our people as they return to civilian life; and finally, the socio-economic difficulties that they may experience as a result of the regiment&#039;s disbandment and their former membership of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_53">Resettlement will commence from 1 January 2007. Full-time soldiers will finish their service in tranches spread over a longer period. The majority will leave between 1 January and 31 July 2007, although a very small number of personnel will be required until 31 March 2008, by which time the process will be complete.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_54">The package, which goes well beyond statutory entitlements, is well deserved and we hope that it will be well received by Home Service personnel. To put it in context, I give three typical examples. A 22-year-old full-time Home Service private with four years&#039; service would receive a tax-free lump sum payment of about &#163;38,000. A 34-year-old full-time Home Service corporal with 16 years&#039; service would receive a tax-free lump sum payment of about &#163;85,500 and an immediate pension for life. A 43-year-old full-time major with 22 years&#039; service would receive &#163;152,000 and an immediate pension. Overall, the cost of this package to the Ministry of Defence is in the region of &#163;250 million. Everyone will regard this as a very generous package for a unique set of individuals who have made a substantial contribution to the achievement of normalisation in Northern Ireland. Regimental traditions will be preserved by the 1st Battalion the Royal Irish Regiment and by the Territorial Army element, the Royal Irish Rangers, which will remain an integral part of our defence capability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_55">The normalisation process will also impact on civilian personnel, and a process of consultation will take place with the trade unions on the civilian redundancies, in accordance with our duties under section 188 of the Trades Unions and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. Affected civilian staff will be kept informed of progress, but we will not be in a position to make an announcement until later this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_56">Consideration is also being given to the formal recognition that should be given to mark the unique circumstances faced by the Royal Irish (Home Service)

<br>&nbsp;<br>and its antecedents in providing continuous support to the police in Northern Ireland throughout the counter-terrorism campaign. The regiment has been consulted on that, and its views will be given due weight. I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on the matter later in the year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-10_para10">
<a name="stpa_57">I hope that the House will welcome the resettlement package outlined in this statement, and agree with me that it treats the men and women of the Royal Irish (Home Service) fairly and with the dignity and respect that they deserve.

<p><a name="st_59"><a name="60309-11_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mark Harper  (Forest of Dean) (Con):</b> 
 I join the Minister in praising the contribution of the Royal Irish regiment down the years, and especially those components that form the Ulster Defence Regiment. The Opposition recognise the immense sacrifices that they made during their lengthy period of active operations when Northern Ireland was a focus of terrorist violence. Indeed, they have been on operational duty as long as I have been alive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_58">I am sure that I speak for everyone on both sides of the House when I say how pleased we are with the progress being made towards a just and lasting settlement in Northern Ireland. We hope that the talks succeed, but the ninth report of the Independent Monitoring Commission makes it clear that it is very difficult to predict the nature of the threat to public order. Events in the summer and autumn of 2005 confirm that, and show that the police can be placed in a position where they need reinforcements. They also show the potential for extreme violence, including sectarian violence, to erupt suddenly in the course of rioting, and for that violence to include potentially lethal attacks on the security forces. Therefore, what specific measures does the Minister intend to put in place to ensure that the Army will retain the capacity to react adequately, should the security situation deteriorate? We may hope for the best, but we must plan for the worst.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_59">Given that the Minister has effectively acknowledged that the Army is overstretched, will he reassure the House that the proposed financial arrangements will not act as a disincentive to those wishing to transfer to another regiment? As for the details of the package, we welcome the generous compensation that will be available for our soldiers. They deserve no less.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_60">Finally, I have a question about Army bands. Given the reduction in the number of bands outlined in written statements, is the Minister able to give a commitment on the future of the Corps of Army Music&#039;s headquarters at Kneller hall in Twickenham?
</p>





<p><a name="st_60"><a name="60309-11_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 On the final question, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman and place my reply in the Library of the House. I thank him for his comments on the role of the Royal Irish (Home Service), and am sure that they are shared across the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_61">The hon. Gentleman asked about the potential for ongoing disturbances in Northern Ireland. He will know that overall responsibility for security matters rests with the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland, obviously with the support of other agencies, including the British armed forces. There is no question but that the Chief Constable is entirely happy with the proposals, but his 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 964</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>expert judgment also plays a role. If the conditions and flavour of the times were different, we would not have begun the progressive normalisation process that is welcomed by everyone. Army resources will of course be available, if required, and that is also part of the understanding with the Chief Constable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_62">The hon. Gentleman asked about the disincentive to transfer to other regiments. We have put up the &#163;10,000 bounty to encourage those who wish to transfer to do so, as we are eager for that to happen. Those who do transfer will forgo the other part of the settlement, but I do not believe that to be a disincentive. We are keen for people to transfer, and the bounty on offer is substantial. I met members of the Home Service on deployment in Iraq, and some of them were already beginning to think about their future career in the Army. That is to be welcomed, and I thank the hon. Gentleman for his support for the overall package presented today.
</p>





<p><a name="st_61"><a name="60309-11_spnew2"><b> Nick Harvey  (North Devon) (LD):</b> 
 I thank the Minister for his statement, and for the notice of it that I was given. I echo the words of tribute that have been paid to the very dedicated and decent people who have done such a demanding job in very difficult circumstances. It is right that they should have a generous package, and I welcome the measures that the Minister has announced today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_63">I took over the role as my party&#039;s spokesman on defence only a relatively small number of hours ago, since when just about every piece of briefing that I have read has referred to staff shortages, recruitment and retention difficulties, and overstretch, especially in the light of forthcoming engagements in Afghanistan. I am therefore sure that the Minister will understand my surprise at waking up on my first morning in my new post to find that we were due to discuss redundancy packages for armed forces personnel.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_64">I especially welcome the &#163;10,000 bounty that the Minister has announced to encourage people to stay in the armed services. I am sure that that is the best option. I would welcome an explanation of the practical measures being taken to encourage a positive response, but I applaud that aspect of the package.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_65">Finally, will the Minister remind the House of the military support that will remain in place for the police in Northern Ireland? As has been noted, there were eruptions of violence last summer and autumn. We hope that they will become things of the past, but it would be complacent to assume that they will.
</p>





<p><a name="st_62"><a name="60309-11_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I welcome the hon. Gentleman to his new role as the Liberal Democrat defence spokesperson, and no doubt we will cross swords over some of the issues to which he referred tangentially in his remarks.

<a name="stpa_66">I appreciate that this is the first day in the job for the hon. Gentleman and I assure him that my statement was not deliberately timed to coincide with that. However, given what he said about the way that we use the Army elsewhere, I think that he may have misunderstood the role of the Home Service. It is able to perform its duties only in Northern Ireland. It was established for that purpose, which has of course come to an end as we make progress towards normalisation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-11_para9">
<a name="stpa_67">Many of the people in the Home Service have grown up in a military environment, and have a good understanding of what is required. They are well

</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-11_para10">
<a name="stpa_68">We recognise that those in full-time service face a particular problem, and a sizeable number of them may want to take this career opportunity. However, we will define more closely the eventual long-term Army strength in Northern Ireland, and at present expect it to be in the region of 5,000 personnel. That would mean that those who transfer to the regular Army could still have their homes close to the regimental base, even though they would also serve on deployment like any other soldiers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-11_para11">
<a name="stpa_69">The package is based on the normalisation process. The hon. Gentleman may wish to make an early visit to Northern Ireland and avail himself of the briefings about what is going on over there. I am sure that he would benefit greatly from doing so, and we will facilitate that as best we can.

 I apologise to my right hon. Friend the Minister for not hearing the beginning of his statement, but I welcome what he has announced. I visited the Royal Irish with the armed forces parliamentary scheme only seven weeks ago, when we were all immensely impressed by the regiment&#039;s long history and tradition and by the perceptions of the future that some of the men revealed in conversation with us. They were aware that the decision that has been taken was necessary, and were proud of the fact that they had a role to play in the change that is taking place in Northern Ireland.

<a name="stpa_70">Will my right hon. Friend comment on the fact that, although the Army still flies police officers into Crossmaglen, some Army officers think that that may no longer be necessary? When does he hope that it might be possible for a further normalisation of police activities to mean that the intervention of the armed forces is no longer required?
</p>





<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60309-11_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for his welcome for the announcement, and he makes some very valid points. He asked about the transportation of key personnel into what could be deemed to be some of the more sensitive areas of Northern Ireland. It rests with the Chief Constable to come to a conclusion about when that might be changed, but at all times we must make careful judgments. That is how we have handled matters, quite properly, over the years. We are unquestionably moving forward rapidly, but we have a duty of care to our personnel at all times. We will ensure that it is properly done, on the best advice available, and it will come, ultimately, from the Chief Constable.

 While I welcome the financial settlements that will enable the courageous men and women of the home battalions of the RIR to leave with dignity, I was bitterly disappointed that the statement made no mention of a fund equivalent to the police fund, which rightly supports the widows and families of police officers who were murdered or maimed by terrorist activity. The Minister knows perfectly well that members of the UDR and, latterly, the RIR have been murdered and maimed alongside RUC personnel in the same terrorist attacks. Will he give me a commitment today, without any hesitation, that the MOD will set up a fund equivalent to the police fund?

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="60309-12_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I well understand the hon. Lady&#039;s concern. I mentioned the after-care package in the statement and I am considering the precise elements of the various funds that exist to support those who served in the RUC and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. As the hon. Lady knows better than I, there are several funds, and she mentioned one in particular. I wish to ensure that our after-care package matches that. It may take a different form, because of the different circumstances, but the principles will be the same. That is why I said that the after-care package will be carefully analysed: I do not want to find that we have a discord between two equivalent groups of people who stood together shoulder to shoulder. In many ways, it will best be achieved through the regimental process and letting the Army look after its own. It is the Army family, after all. I take on board the hon.

However, a decision has been made to do away with the Home Service of the Royal Irish. Does the Minister agree that the sacrifices of the Home Service can never be adequately compensated, especially taking into consideration that the members who lived at home had those homes and their families targeted as a result? The price of their life&#039;s blood, which many of them sacrificed, cannot be valued.

I hope that no soldier will be put in the position of being forced to leave if he wishes to remain until the very end. Many of those soldiers, especially the part-time ones, have served in the regiment for more than 35 years. They were there at the beginning, and it is only fair to their honour and dignity that they should be there at the end if that

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for the service he gave as a member of the UDR. He made strong and trenchant points about the role of the UDR and the Royal Irish (Home Service); there is no one better placed to do that. The hon. Gentleman raised issues about the phasing and tranching of the redundancies. Clearly, we have to have some structure. The bulk of the full-timers will go by the earlier date that I indicated in my statement. This has to be managed in a progressive way. We will try to be sensitive to the wishes of individuals at all times, but we have to meet the commitments to try to reduce the numbers as we go forward. In addition, there are operational needs because the 2006 marching season is still to be faced.

<p>
<a name="60309-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_76">The part-timers have made representations to me on this, and the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) has highlighted the sensitivity of this issue. The difficulty is that if everyone wishes to remain in until the very end, that will not be until 2008 and it is not practicable. I do not think that any other date would make it easier. I will take this matter away and reflect on it, as we have done throughout the process, but I am setting out the difficulties. One of the ways in which we are seeking to address the desire of people to be there when, effectively, the flag comes down, is to have a ceremony, which we are planning for later this year so that the bulk of those affected will still be in service. The final arrangements have not been made and a number of processes remain to be gone through, but we are planning something later in the year. I mentioned this in my statement and will make an announcement in due course. We are trying to be as sensitive as possible and I will take on board the point that has been made.

<p><a name="st_73"><a name="60309-12_spnew6"><b> Mr. Mark Francois  (Rayleigh) (Con):</b> 
 I echo other Members in paying tribute to the Home Service battalions and to the Ulster Defence Regiment. They did a difficult job very bravely in tough circumstances. I shall ask the Defence Minister a defence-related question. Given the pressure on the regular and Territorial Army and the problems of overstretch, particularly in the infantry, did Ministers consider attempting to re-role these three battalions either as regular soldiers or as Territorial Army battalions, which have traditionally never been involved in the security situation in Northern Ireland? That would have allowed them to continue as formed units and make an active contribution to the defence of the realm. At a time when we have lost far too many infantry battalions, why are we now prepared to stand by and lose three more? It seems to make no sense.
</p>





<p><a name="st_74"><a name="60309-12_spnew7"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 It does make sense, but before I retort in my usual way to some of the issues to which the hon. Gentleman pointedly referred, I thank him for his earlier comments. There was a request and issues were raised about the possibility of retaining incremental companies. The Army looked at that possibility and rejected it. It was not rejected as a result of some political overlay. The Army did not believe it to be the appropriate way forward. We have taken best military advice on this.

There would have to be retraining, there would be issues associated with full evac and the future Army lay-down in Northern Ireland&#151;a garrison 5,000-strong is planned&#151;would have to be borne in mind.

 I wish to place on record my salute to members of the Royal Irish Regiment, formerly the Ulster Defence Regiment, whom I served alongside in Northern Ireland for a number of years. They were some of the bravest members of the security forces and, unlike many regulars, they went home at the end of their patrols and lived in the community, often in danger. What measures will be put in place to protect individuals who live in very republican communities, often in rural areas, for whom danger will go on after their regiment has been disbanded?

I cannot remember the total sum involved in that, but it was another considerable package. However, this is a debt of honour to our people and cannot be seen as compensation. To squabble about money would be unseemly. We have done what we believe to be right. It has been well received across Northern Ireland and, if not, I will hear about it from those who currently serve.

<a name="stpa_83">New clause 1 allows persons authorised under clause 77 to apply to the court for a warrant for a constable to support them.

<a name="stpa_85">On a general note, however, the Government recently tabled a number of amendments for discussion today, several of which are completely new provisions, yet no accompanying explanatory notes or letters from the Minister have been forthcoming.

My office rang the Minister&#039;s office this morning and we were promised that a copy would be e-mailed straightaway, but that has not appeared. That is regrettable, especially in the light of what happened last week with the Children and Adoption Bill, when Opposition Members were not notified about the imminent publication of a report that was absolutely germane to the business, and was referred to during that business by the Minister of State.

<a name="stpa_91">Government new clause 3&#151;<i>Provision of information about young children: transitory provision.</i>

</p>





<p><a name="st_126"><a name="60309-14_spnew0"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 The purpose of the new clauses and amendments is to allow for a significant improvement in the quality and accuracy of the information we collect about early years provision&#151;that is, integrated child care and early education for children under school age. It will enable more accurate funding to follow the delivery of nursery entitlement for three and four-year-olds and provide essential support to local authorities in the fulfilment of those duties under the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_94">The provisions will enable the Secretary of State and other prescribed persons, such as local authorities, to collect individual child-level information from all registered providers of early years provision in England, in line with the reformed regulatory and inspection framework in the Bill. In Wales, the powers will apply under relevant legislation, consistent with the regulatory framework in Wales. The powers are not to demand information from parents but for local authorities to collect information that providers will hold already.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_95">A key purpose of the power is to manage better the funding of free nursery education provision. At present, the information collected by the Government from local government about free entitlement is aggregated information on all the children enrolled with each private, voluntary or independent provider, rather than individual child-level information. Holding such child-level information will reduce the risk of double counting, which we think is happening to some extent at present, where parents use more than one provider for their free nursery entitlement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-14_para10">
<a name="stpa_96">We are building on the success of that entitlement, progressively increasing the number of hours and weeks, so an increasing amount of public funding is being used to support it. It is thus important that providers receive money for what they actually provide for each child.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-14_para11">
<a name="stpa_97">There are some other reasons for the provisions. The duty for local authorities to improve outcomes for all children and reduce inequalities is one of the cornerstones of the Bill. Local authorities need a full range of information about children in early years provision, to ensure that they are fulfilling that duty.

<br>&nbsp;<br>It is also important for central Government to have that information to evaluate effectively the success of the policy.

 The new clauses are quite chunky, and again I make the point that we had no inkling about them in Committee. It is not clear whether these provisions are connected to the child safeguarding provisions in the next group and which in turn have connections to the forthcoming Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill. From what the Minister said, it would appear that they are more to do with a numbers exercise, to ensure that the correct figures are analysed. If that is the case, the Opposition certainly have some concerns about the wide-reaching nature of new clause 2.

It is that information of &quot;such other description&quot; may be put on to these databases. Specifically, medical records are not included, or such other personal records as the Secretary of State may by regulation specify. In that measure, the sharing of information was specifically curtailed for medical records. For very good reasons, we supported that. There were other categories involved as well. We do not appear to have such safeguards in the new clause.

Can she give me some assurances that that was not intended, and say whether some further detail will be added to ensure that such a conflict cannot happen?

Much in the 2004 Act was essential to promote the sharing of information among professionals in dealing with vulnerable children who might be at risk of harm. We agreed with that, and that was the thrust of what became the 2004 Act. There were also some perfectly good provisions that protected the confidentiality of children and their parents. Those provisions seem to have been ignored in the framing of new clause 2. I would be grateful if the Minister gave us some more detail&#151;which was, alas, not forthcoming before today&#039;s deliberations.

 I concur 100 per cent. with the hon. Gentleman. At the top of my copy of the amendment paper I wrote &quot;Child Protection&quot;. I assumed that the provision was an extension of what we were talking about with the Children Act 2004 in the context of databases. There were some words of reassurance that we were considering numbers relating to payments, but that was not how I understood it. That might be blamed on my interpretation. However, other people might have made the same error. If I had had a red pen in my hand, the amendment paper would have been covered in comments about ambiguity and non-understanding of terms.

 I concur with my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton). The new clause is far too broad. The Government need to be far clearer about what they are trying to achieve with a measure that they seek to introduce at such a late stage in the consideration of the Bill. There is a real danger that parents throughout the country will be concerned about the level of information being collected on their children. It would be ironic if parents were dissuaded from using child-minding services because of concern about the collecting of information that would then be permitted about their child.

Perhaps it will be possible to be more specific about what information will be collected, by whom, by what powers, when, how regularly, where it will be stored, who will have access to the database, and perhaps the central control of the information. If so, the House would be able to say much more confidently whether the proposal before us is good or bad.

<br>&nbsp;<br>to the Data Protection Act 1998, which may conflict with them. I find it difficult to believe that there is any information about the child care industry that it not made available to the Government. Can the Minister clarify the nature of the information that she lacks? The Opposition are struggling to understand why the new clauses are necessary.

<p><a name="st_130"><a name="60309-15_spnew2"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 I sympathise with hon. Members who are anxious about new clauses that have been tabled late in the proceedings, and I shall try to deal with their concerns. Government new clause 2 reflects provisions in the Education and Inspections Bill on individual child data in schools. Those are based on provisions in section 537A of the Education Act 1996, which was passed under the previous Administration. The powers in the new clause are almost identical to those provisions because, as I have tried to outline, we have made a big push on early-years provision, so they need to apply to that sector too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-15_para8">
<a name="stpa_119">The power is an enabling one, based on the long-standing provisions in the 1996 Act. Hon. Members are understandably anxious to probe the nature of the information that will be provided. That will be dealt with in detailed regulations, which will define the nature of the data collected and identify those who can collect it. Information collators may be local authority officers, civil service statisticians or anyone who has the right to collate information on behalf of Government. There is therefore a circumscribed group of people who can collect that information.
</p>





<p><a name="st_131"><a name="60309-15_spnew3"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 Will all the people who are given powers as information collators be subject to scrutiny under the Bichard proposals in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill? Can the Minister guarantee that anyone who is nominated as a collator who has access to that information will be vetted accordingly?
</p>





<p><a name="st_132"><a name="60309-15_spnew4"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill proposes that specific groups of people will be subject to the highest level checks in the barring and vetting scheme if they collect or collate information. Those groups include people who are responsible for the updating and upkeep of data and procedures on the information-sharing index to which the hon. Gentleman has referred. I will go away and ask if those people, and the data provision under the new clause, will be caught. My understanding is that they will not, because that data and information is not of the same order, but I shall certainly ask about that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_133"><a name="60309-15_spnew5"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 I am rather alarmed by that reply, as I thought that the Minister was going to say, &quot;Yes, obviously.&quot; Those people will be in receipt of a great deal of information about where children are, what they do there, how many children there are, what their hours of attendance are, what sort of services they receive and which staff deal with them. It is essential to vet such people because if they had bad intentions they could use that information themselves or pass it on to others who might use it for purposes for which it was not intended. I therefore hope that the Minister will do a little more than go away and check. I hope that she will go away and make sure that the provision is watertight.

<a name="stpa_120">Hon. Members may be reassured to learn that current arrangements involve the transfer of individual child information from providers to local authorities. In the new clause we are seeking to standardise that practice. A survey that we conducted in December among a large number of local authorities demonstrated that that the majority already collect information about early years settings on an individual child basis. The Department for Education and Skills requires that information to be sent to it in an aggregated form.

Gentleman&#039;s question&#151;that will reduce their workload and make their task much simpler. I accept that that does not take into account concerns about the kind of information collected, but we envisage that the amount of that information will be limited. It could include identifying information on children such as gender and ethnicity, whether they receive special educational needs provision, and, of course, the number of hours that they spend in the setting, including the number of funded hours. That is essential because, as I said at the beginning of our debate, some providers lose out if parents take up the free nursery education offer with a number of different providers. Because the information that the Department receives is aggregated, we cannot ensure that funding flows to the providers who are caring for the child for a certain number of hours a week. Providers are particularly concerned about that, as hon. Members will appreciate.

 When the regulations are published, will the Minister include a requirement that the local authority must not keep information on certain things?

</p>





<p><a name="st_136"><a name="60309-16_spnew1"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 It will not be necessary to include things on which the local authority must not hold information, because local authorities and providers can only hold and pass on information if the regulations empower them to do so. Indeed, that information is already circumscribed. For example, it is legally not possible for information on medical records to be held and passed on. We are simply talking about identifying information and the number of hours and weeks that the child spends in the setting. Such information can help us to assess whether child outcomes are achieved by local authorities.
</p>





<p><a name="st_137"><a name="60309-16_spnew2"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 I hope that the Minister understands why we are trying to establish the detail of the proposal. She said that medical records were exempt, and would

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 980</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>not be kept on the database&#151;a point that I made in relation to section 12 of the Children Act 2004. Does one provision override the other? The new clause does not refer to the 2004 Act or to the exemptions in it, so is there a measure that makes it explicit that the new clause is subject to those exemptions? The exemptions apply to national and local databases, and will not necessarily apply to the database that will be collated. I am not sure that there is an interconnection.
</p>





<p><a name="st_138"><a name="60309-16_spnew3"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 Existing legislation is not swept away, as the hon. Gentleman will know from his careful reading of the clauses. The provisions that prevent the holding and passing on of medical records at present will take precedence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-16_para0">
<a name="stpa_122">For both reasons&#151;for the flow of funding, and in order to assess whether local authorities are meeting their duty on outcomes for children in the round&#151;we need the information. It is routinely held and passed on by providers and local authorities. It is important that we standardise that. Our survey of local authorities showed that some were collecting some information and others were collecting other information. The regulations will standardise the collection of information.
</p>





<p><a name="st_139"><a name="60309-16_spnew4"><b> Justine Greening: </b> 
 I understand how the information might be used by central Government, but it seems slightly contradictory that the Bill gives powers and duties to local authorities to make sure that child care provision is available locally. I have many young parents living in my constituency, Putney, and I question whether the level of detail is appropriate. Local authorities are being given powers and duties to provide child minding and child care facilities, but the Secretary of State is seeking such a level of detail that the Department could interfere in individual nurseries. Surely it is for local authorities to take decisions. Why does the Department need such detail? Why can it not accept the summary detail that it gets in other areas of education?
</p>





<p><a name="st_140"><a name="60309-16_spnew5"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is wrong about that. The level of detail that relates to children of other ages is not aggregate. Local authorities must increasingly provide individual level data, because the funding flows from Government to local authorities. Local authorities may allocate it, but the level of provision is based on numbers of children, and in this instance, where those children are accessing the free nursery entitlement that the Government have provided. We want the money to flow more effectively to the providers. In order to give parents more flexibility, so that they have a range of options for that nursery offer, we need to make sure that we can disaggregate in the case of children for whom the offer is spread over a number of different providers. That is happening now and providers are losing out, because only one provider is getting the total amount of money, whereas there might be another one, two or three providers who have the child for part of the week but are not getting the money that flows from that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_123">The other important issue is the outcomes duty. Local authorities will want to test themselves as to how far, for the population as a whole, they are improving outcomes for children and reducing inequality. We as a

 The hon. Gentleman has a smile on his face, as if he thinks he has caught me out, but I think he will find that I have a sound and accurate explanation for him. New clause 3 makes transitional arrangements to enable data to be collected from funded nursery education before the provisions in new clause 2 come into force. New clause 2 will come into force as a whole in September 2008 for all providers, but for providers who are already getting funding for nursery education, we can legitimately get that information, which will of course be partial, earlier because it is already being collected. The new clause gives the legal power for a transitional arrangement to enable that to be done for a year, before the full force of new clause 2 takes effect. Section 7, therefore, is the present clause 7 of the Bill.

Amendments Nos. 19, 20 and 21 add to the Bill specific mention that regulations which govern the activities of providers registered under part 3 may deal with arrangements for safeguarding the children concerned. That arises from my consideration following our deliberations in Committee, so I hope that that small group of amendments, at least, will please Opposition Members and that we may get some kind words about them. We will wait and see.

<a name="stpa_130">Paragraph 4 of schedule 9A to the Children Act 1989 sets out certain grounds on which an individual can be disqualified from providing day care or child minding. Individuals can already be disqualified from providing child care on the grounds of convictions for sexual and violent offences, or orders that show that such a person is unsuitable to work with children, or because his name is included on the Protection of Children Act list, or because the person is subject to a direction under section 142 of the Education Act 2002&#151;in other words, the person is on List 99, on the grounds that he is unsuitable to work with children.

The additions are those whose names are recorded on List 99 on the grounds of ill health. Such directions are made when, for example, a person has a medical condition such as alcohol or substance misuse which means that they are considered to pose a threat to the safety or

That change to the current legislation will ensure that we can provide additional safeguards at the earliest possible opportunity. Hon. Members have already referred to the new Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, and when the new system comes into force, the Secretary of State will require the same powers, which is why we have introduced amendments Nos. 22 to 25.

<a name="stpa_133">On amendments Nos. 19 to 21, we have made it clear throughout that children should be safeguarded and protected from harm and neglect when they are in the care of a child care provider. Hon. Members will recall that during the last day in Committee I made a commitment to look further into whether the Bill should be amended explicitly to address the issue of safeguarding. That commitment was in response to amendments that sought to place a duty on early and later years providers to consider the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children.

<p>
<a name="60309-17_para16">
<a name="stpa_134">We have considered the matter further and have concluded that that point was well made and that such a provision should be included in the Bill. When children are in the care of a child care provider, it is crucial that they are safeguarded and protected from harm. We propose to strengthen and make explicit the position of safeguarding in the Bill. Rather than introducing an overarching duty with a power to make statutory guidance, we have decided to make it clear in the Bill that matters which may be dealt with by regulations include &quot;arrangements for safeguarding&quot; as well as

<a name="stpa_135">Amendments Nos. 19 to 21 will send a clear signal to providers that they are responsible for safeguarding children in their care, which will hopefully contribute to the creation of a culture and ethos that reflects that responsibility. The requirements will be set out in secondary legislation, and they will be checked as part of the registration and inspection arrangements. They will be mandatory, and a breach by a provider may result in registration being removed. Such requirements may include the implementation of the appropriate child protection procedures based on current national standards. In addition, providers must meet certain registration requirements in order to be registered in the first place, including that they are not unsuitable to work with young children. They will not be granted registration if, for example, there is information on enhanced criminal records disclosures that suggests that they are unsuitable to work with children.

What about other conditions? What about people who have HIV? What about people who are suffering from minor mental health conditions? Can the legislation be used to exclude or disqualify people from working in child care if they are suffering from one of those two conditions, which may not be deemed by many people as sufficiently serious or germane to the subject to merit their being disqualified completely from working with children?

In effect, it is possible that a teenager who in a moment of high spirits did something that was not serious enough for them to be charged and given a criminal record, but to which they admitted guilt by accepting a reprimand or a warning, could find when they tried to embark on a career in child care or some other form of contact with children, that they are exempted. It seems draconian to exempt a whole group of people who are not on the face of it a danger to children as most of us might term it.

<a name="stpa_143">There is another issue that I hope that the Minister will deal with when we come to discuss the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, if she is handling it. We need to be able to distinguish between the severity of offences. If a 17-year-old boy or girl has sexual relations with a 15-year-old boy or girl minor, that is against the law. When set against a convicted paedophile who downloads child pornographic images on the internet and engages in molestation of children, I think that most of us would agree that those two offences are on an altogether different scale. There should be some balance in the Bill. Otherwise, people who end up accepting a reprimand or a warning under that wide-ranging section of the Crime and Disorder Act, on the basis that that was the most sensible thing for them to do at the time so that they could move on, may find that it has undermined their entire potential career in the child care work force.

<a name="stpa_144">I heard about an example of that recently. A mother had intervened to stop her son being beaten up by a school colleague who was something of a bully. Without going into the detail of the whole episode, it ended up with her being taken to the police station and being advised to accept a caution for her supposed aggression in separating those children. Given her telling of the story, with other witnesses corroborating it, I have no doubt that what she did was anything more than trying to drag a bully off her son. She thought nothing of it and took the caution. A few years later she applied for a job to work with children in the local youth service. The caution came up and, lo and behold, counted against her so that she could not get the job. That is a high price to pay for somebody who was protecting her son.

It is usually my job to try to change the long titles of Bills that are to do with children. I applaud the Minister for following my example, as many of them are a disaster.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_147">I turn to amendment No. 49, which stands in my name and those of my hon. Friends. Our amendment gives a slightly different angle on the whole subject of protecting children. It would add the words, &quot;child protection arrangements&quot;, to clause 12, which deals with the duty to provide information, advice and assistance. It would be appropriate, particularly given the furore in recent months over sex offenders working in environments where they will be involved with children, to do everything that we can to reassure parents that local authorities and child care providers have gone that extra mile to ensure that their children can go to the nursery with every reasonable measure having been taken to ensure that the people with whom they will come into contact have been properly vetted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-18_para12">
<a name="stpa_148">It would enhance the thrust of clause 12 if an additional piece of information were provided to parents and prospective parents to give an indication of what child protection arrangements have been established by the local authority and are demanded of child care providers, and whether they are being put in place, adhered to, maintained and updated where appropriate by those child care providers. That would be a sensible enhancement of the Bill to give parents a degree of assurance that they are giving their children into the charge of people in whom they can have the greatest confidence, so that they can be sure that such people are there in the interests of the children, not because they harbour some other, less desirable intentions towards those children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-18_para13">
<a name="stpa_149">I hope that the amendment is constructive. If the Minister is unable to incorporate it into the Bill now, I hope that it might be considered later, or at least put into regulations for local authorities to follow so that this important issue is taken into account.

 The Minister will recall that in Committee I was concerned that there appeared to be a loophole on the safeguarding provisions for child care operators in chapter 4&#151;that is, those with voluntary registration. I therefore welcome her statement on safeguarding and the read-across to the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill. I want to emphasise on the record that that Bill now stipulates the following:


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 989</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;Under the new scheme, where work, whether paid or unpaid, involves frequent teaching, caring for or otherwise working closely with children, the employer will be required to check that their employees are not barred from working with children, and they will be committing an offence and will face penalties if they employ a person so barred. This will include those working in childcare not registered by Ofsted.&quot;</p>
</ul>

 I, too, was generally pleased with the amendments. Again, there were no accompanying notes. I picked up the word &quot;health&quot; and I was not sure what it covered, but I believe that the same expression is used in the Protection of Children Act 1999&#151;POCA&#151;list. There may be additional information that I have not had time to find. It would therefore have been helpful to have the information. I have asked a series of parliamentary questions about checks on child care and I imagine that the written statement, which I have not seen, will add to the information that I have gleaned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_151">I, too, am pleased that the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill will apply to child care and that the list or lists&#151;however it ultimately works out&#151;will have to be checked. However, it prompts the question of why criminal record checks are not required in unregulated settings, such as the cr&#232;che under two hours, which I keep mentioning. I had hoped that amendment No. 49 would pick up that point, but its approach is from a slightly different angle. I am still worried that parents do not know that criminal record checks are not carried out on those in unregulated settings. However, I agree that it is helpful to know that the lists will have to be checked before anybody can work with young people.

<a name="60309-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_152">I am pleased with the safeguarding amendments&#151;Nos. 19, 20 and 21. They tie in with other parts of the Bill. However, in Committee, we discussed at great length whether the measure should include the word &quot;may&quot; or &quot;must&quot;. The amendments, which refer to

<a name="stpa_154">for the following matters. On safeguarding, the word should be &quot;must&quot;, as we argued in Committee. The safeguarding amendments make it even more important to revisit the &quot;may&quot; and &quot;must&quot; argument, which I will not discuss at great length because we spent much time on it in Committee. However, it is worth raising it again because we have changed the measure and our awareness is heightened about the necessity of safeguarding and protecting. I therefore ask the Under-Secretary to reconsider the matter.

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 990</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>assurance. It is important that parents have full information about child protection and safeguarding. Information services clearly play a key role in ensuring that parents can make informed decisions on the suitability of various child care providers for their children. We will publish regulations and guidance to try to ensure that that is clear to parents.

<a name="60309-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_156">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) stressed the importance of parents understanding the difference between regulated and unregulated settings. I agree. It is our intention that information services can and must tell parents about the registration status of providers and the implications of that, the difference between a registered and a non-registered setting and the checks that registered providers and their staff undergo as opposed to those that staff in unregulated settings may&#151;or may not&#151;undergo.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_157">Information services will need to inform parents about the questions that they should ask when they choose provision. In regulations, we intend to require information services to provide information about keeping children safe in the community. The information might include what parents should do if they have concerns, for example, about child protection or children&#039;s welfare. It might also include initiatives or publications from the local safeguarding children boards. Their role in the community is to keep children safe in all sorts of settings in many different places.

<p>
<a name="60309-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_160">The hon. Gentleman made some points about the ill health provisions, which relate to List 99, to try to tease out precisely what was intended. He gave a couple of examples, including HIV infection and minor mental health problems. The provisions will mirror List 99. There will not be a separate list so that a minor health problem could suddenly be taken into account to ban somebody from a child care setting. Ill health will be taken into account only when it is already sufficient to prompt questions about an individual&#039;s suitability for teaching children. The provisions will apply to individuals who could already go on List 99 if they are in an education setting. That does not therefore include HIV infection or minor mental health problems. We are considering examples, such as those that I gave earlier, of serious debility arising from ill health that could make somebody completely unsuitable for looking after children in a child care setting.

<p><a name="st_215"><a name="60309-19_spnew5"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 I am grateful for that elaboration but does the Under-Secretary accept that, because the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 991</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>provisions refer simply to &quot;health&quot;, an authority, or an individual in it who was so minded, could exclude people in the two categories that I mentioned? That would be neither fair nor appropriate. The provisions give a broad licence to authorities. Will the guidance notes to local authorities state that they were not intended to apply to the examples that I gave?
</p>





<p><a name="st_216"><a name="60309-19_spnew6"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 We can make that clear. The provisions apply only to those in an education setting who end up on List 99. They are not intended to be any wider.

<p>
<a name="60309-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_161">The hon. Gentleman raised a constituency case to show the potential dangers of barring on the basis of cautions. He made legitimate points about the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, the way in which we intend to make the new barring and vetting process work and the impact that it will have. He gave the example of a mother who intervened to save a child from being pushed around and ended up with soft information on a Criminal Records Bureau record that caused her problems in working in child care. Those issues are central to the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill and establishing the new barring and vetting scheme. We have given the matter considerable thought. We do not intend to provide that any caution would lead to being barred from the children&#039;s work force. We would not have such a work force, which could deal with all the jobs and roles in it, if we cast the net too wide. Obviously, it is important to cast it in the appropriate place, however, and that is certainly our intention. It would be our intention to bar on the basis of cautions only for serious sexual or violent offences. We would not want to see people being barred from the child care work force if they had, perhaps sensibly, received a caution for a very minor matter that would not make them a risk to children.

<a name="stpa_162">The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham is right to draw the comparison, which is sometimes age-related, between circumstances that might relate to a similar offence. He used the example of a 17-year-old and a 15-year-old having a relationship, and compared it to the case of a paedophile downloading child porn then wanting to work in the child care work force. Common sense would suggest to most hon. Members that there is a huge difference between those examples.

<a name="stpa_163">When the hon.

However, I do not think, from what he says, that he disagrees too strongly with where we have tried to draw the line. The provisions that we are putting into this Bill try to make consistent the place at which the bar will fall between the education work force and the child care work force. We are trying to tidy up and make consistent the places where the line is drawn in that regard.

 As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) has pointed out, three months have passed since Second Reading, which was the last opportunity that I had to speak on the Bill, as I did not serve on the Committee. However, today, along with my hon. Friends the Members for East Worthing and Shoreham and for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller), I have been placed on the Front Bench to speak on child care issues. It is a pleasure to see the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle), whom I last saw when we discussed the Disability Discrimination Bill, although at that time, I did not have the chance to have the kind of detailed exchanges with her in Committee and on Report that we might be about to have now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_168">The new clauses and amendments are about sufficiency, but they are also, no less importantly, about sustainability, contestability and fairness in child care provision. These matters were explored to some degree in the Committee proceedings that I have read, but there is yet more action to be taken on them. The Government are formally signed up to work in partnership with PVI&#151;private, voluntary and independent&#151;providers, and they are very proud of that. When the Minister for Children and Families replied to the Second Reading debate, she gave the House statistics on the child care provision that is made by the private and voluntary sector. She will be aware, however, as the issue was raised in Committee, that some PVI providers and others are concerned that the playing field is not as level as it might be, and that the mixed economy in child care is, to some extent, under threat.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_169">In some ways, local authorities have an advantage over PVI providers. My hon. Friends gave some examples of that in Committee&#151;including that in regard to capital spending&#151;and I shall not repeat them here. However, when these matters were raised in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 994</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Committee, the Minister for Children and Families responded to a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) about a National Day Nurseries Association survey by saying
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;for his information, the closure rate of all child care businesses, as recorded by Ofsted, has fallen recently . . . Ofsted&#039;s statistics suggest that, since the publication of the 10-year strategy, closure rates for these small businesses have fallen dramatically.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 8 December 2005; c. 120&#150;21]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_170">Before I turn to the new clauses and amendments dealing with contestability and fairness, I must tell the Minister that the figures that she gave us do not square with information in written answers that my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke and I have recently received. According to calculations made by my hon. Friend, some 200,000 places closed in 2004&#150;05, up from 59,500 the previous year. That seems to be an extraordinary increase. I tabled a written question on this matter recently and, according to the answer that I received this week, the latest figures reveal that, in the six months to last September, roughly 114,000 places opened, but some 73,000 closed. In other words, the closure rate appears to be increasing. We used to say that, for every two places that opened, one would close. According to the latest figures&#151;which might not be sustained; we shall have to see&#151;it now appears that, for every five places that open, roughly three are closing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_171">In short, there is a suspicion that the overall growth in the child care market&#151;which we have certainly seen; there is no doubt about that&#151;could be unsustainable, and that we might be entering a dangerous process of growth and contraction. First comes the growth in the number of places; second comes the closure among the PVI providers as local authority-favoured providers exploit the unevenness of the playing field to expand places; finally, there could be a contraction in local authority places as the flow of Government money into child care places continues to increase but slows down.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_172">If that were to happen, such an outcome would obviously be immensely destabilising for parents, who want certainty, and for children, who need stability. The new clauses and amendments aim to provide more stability and certainty by increasing contestability. They would put into effect some of the recommendations from the excellent CBI report entitled &quot;Children First&quot;, which I am sure the Ministers have read.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_173">New clause 6 proposes that an obligation be placed on the Secretary of State, and written into the Bill, to publish a code of practice by the beginning of next year that would ensure that local authorities operating a best practice regime&#151;in practice, that is nearly all of them&#151;act in a fair and transparent way with regard to child care. New clause 8 underpins new clause 6 by directly placing a duty on local authorities to act in such a fair and transparent manner.

<a name="stpa_174">Amendment No. 60 would help to write sustainability into the Bill. As drafted, the Bill places a duty on English local authorities&#151;the Liberal Democrats need not worry; I am going to deal with Wales in a minute&#151;to

<a name="stpa_186">I want to concentrate on amendments Nos. 5, 13 and 35, all of which deal with the same issue. The Bill does not cover the provision of child care when parents are workless. In Committee, we pointed out that parents might be workless because they were caring, or because they had disabilities themselves. In such circumstances, access to child care might be even more important. I tabled an amendment suggesting that a local authority &quot;may&quot; rather than &quot;must&quot; have regard to providing child care for workless parents. We could be storing up greater costs in the long run by not providing child care, because of the prioritisation of a hard-pressed local authority, when it is deeply needed by both parents and children.

<a name="stpa_187">I remember saying that two deaf parents might have hearing children. The children would really need child care, and the ability to socialise more generally. I am still concerned that the Bill does not even use the word &quot;may&quot; to indicate that in some circumstances local authorities throughout the country&#151;not just the best-funded authorities&#151;may need to provide child care.

<a name="stpa_188">It could be said that amendment No. 10 is slightly in disguise. Let me explain. I spent a good deal of time in Committee, and indeed on Second Reading, speaking about quality, because I think that it is crucial. However, humbled and crushed into the ground by all the Ministers&#039; answers, I tabled this minimalist amendment. I listened carefully to Ministers who kept telling me that I need not worry about local authorities&#039; monitoring quality, because there were Ofsted inspections. I therefore suggested the additional instruction that local authorities

<a name="stpa_192">I stress that such monitoring by Ofsted would be minimalist. The problem would be that monitoring might happen only once every three years. However, Ofsted reports can bring strands together. For example, one report observed that there was a high proportion of child care settings in which not all staff were in place at the time of their opening. There is a need for local authorities to keep an eye on such nurseries.

<a name="stpa_193">Amendment No. 31, which we tabled, picks up on the idea that we must have a level playing field. The hon.

I have no agenda on that because I come from an authority that relies on the private and voluntary sector for the bulk of its provision, which is good. However, there are reports from all over the country that some of our important private providers are not satisfied that there is a level playing field, so it is critical that that problem is taken on board.

I have tabled the amendment to a different clause than I did in Committee because the Minister explained to me that it would not be appropriate for young children to participate in making overall strategy. Amendment No. 59 is a probing amendment that tries to encapsulate the importance of listening to all children. Would it not be groundbreaking to include in the Bill a reference to listening to young children? The Government have funded exciting work on listening to young children, so why not have some recognition of that in the Bill? I think that the amendment could be incorporated in clause 11, but I wait to hear otherwise.

: I support the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman). As hon. Members have already said, the market is mixed. That is one of the values of the market because it ensures that the provision of child care is diverse. An especially diverse group of people lives in my constituency, so the more diverse our provision, the better the choice for my local parents. It is incumbent on the Government to ensure that the Bill facilitates and helps to develop that mixed market, rather than stifles it. It is thus especially important that we have a level playing field for both private child care providers&#151;there are many excellent ones in my constituency&#151;and provision provided by a local authority.

<a name="60309-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_195">We have heard that for every five child care places that come into being, three are lost, which suggests that there is a huge amount of churn in the market. The Bill places a duty on authorities to assess the local provision of child care, but the churn will make that difficult.

However, if the closure is unsustainable, children often find changing their nursery difficult to take. Parents can find it stressful if they suddenly have to find a new child care provider because their existing one was forced out of the market. The more that we can avoid that situation happening unnecessarily, the better.

We also have problems with public transport because although the buses are accessible, our local underground is not. It is important that the Bill urges local authorities to consider the accessibility needs and disabilities of parents when determining child care provision so that some people are not disfranchised from a measure that is meant to help absolutely everyone.

It is good to see him on the Front Bench. We are considering a large group of new clauses and amendments, which cover a range of slightly different issues relating to the general matter of sufficiency, so I will try to deal with them in a way that makes coherent sense.
</p>

<a name="60309-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_198">The hon. Gentleman talked about the role of local authorities at the start of his speech. We have stressed the importance of that role throughout the Bill&#039;s passage. A local authority is the strategic holder of the ring when making sure that there is a sufficiency of child care places for parents in their area. I appreciate that he wants to utilise all the levers that are already in the system to ensure that there is good local authority practice, sustainability and the level playing field about which he spoke. Several of the amendments represent proposals on best value and local area agreements. Although I appreciate the intention behind them, there is perhaps a misunderstanding about the way in which best value and local area agreements work at present.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_199">There is no need for a separate statutory code such as that in new clause 6 because all the functions carried out by a local authority are automatically covered by the best value regime and the guidance that has already been produced. The new clause would lead to a piecemeal change whereby a different duty of best value operated solely in relation to child care provision. Such a change would be not only confusing for local authorities, but unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_200">I can make a similar point about new clause 8 because fairness is an intrinsic part of the best value regime that has already been legislated for. Local authorities must have regard to the combination of economy,

<br>&nbsp;<br>effectiveness and efficiency. In doing so, they must also have regard to a range of considerations that include fairness and transparency. New clauses 8 and 6 together imply that special arrangements would be needed for the child care duty, and that is not the case.

<a name="stpa_201">Amendment No. 60 relates to future sustainability. Again, I understand what hon.

As long as the duty remains in place and is phrased in that way, the requirement is for the local authority to ensure sustainability in the future. Local authorities have to consider and plan for future changes that may have an implication on the requirements.

The Ofsted data show that that rate has fallen quarter by quarter right across the board since the launch of the child care strategy.

<p><a name="st_260"><a name="60309-22_spnew5"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 I do not have those figures, but I agree that there is churn in the private sector part of the child care market. It is not significantly greater than the

<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 1000</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>general figures that I have seen on churn in other parts of the private sector market not related to child care. Private businesses stop trading and operating. The level of that in the child care market is not significantly greater than it is in other private businesses. If we look across the sector as a whole, in terms of the number of places that are being opened and the number that are closing, across the piece Ofsted data show that the rate of closure has fallen quarter by quarter since the child care strategy started and that, on balance, the net rate of places is increasing, because the rate of increase is greater than the rate of closure.
</p>





<p><a name="st_261"><a name="60309-22_spnew6"><b> Mrs. Maria Miller: </b> 
 It is worth teasing out the information a little further. The figures are clear. We have seen a seismic difference in closure of nursery places over the past two years. The year before last, 59,000 places closed; last year, 200,000 places closed. The feeling we get is that that is reducing the take-up of nursery places. At the moment, the figures show that nurseries are running at 79 per cent. capacity, which is well below the level that is financially viable. That came out in the Public Accounts Committee debate on the subject two years ago.
</p>

<a name="60309-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_204">I want the Minister to focus on that. The difference between 59,000 and 200,000 closures is enormous. As my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening) said, it results in uncertainty for children and working parents, which we are not happy about.
</p>





<p><a name="st_262"><a name="60309-22_spnew7"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 I think the hon. Lady will agree that she is using figures up to the end of December 2004. It is the case that, as the strategy was developing, there was turbulence in the system as private providers came into being. Perhaps they did not have the sustainability and went out of business, and some child care places were lost in that sector. I have not got the relevant figures with me, but I shall ensure that the hon. Lady gets them if she does not have them; however, I suspect that the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) has them. On reading those figures, she will see that since December 2004 there has been much greater stability, even in that part of the child care market catered for by private-sector providers. So there has been much greater stability not only across the board, but in that particular part of the market, in the past 15 to 18 months. The market is settling down and we are not seeing the degree of churn that existed 18 months to two years ago, to which the hon. Lady referred. That said, I am concerned about this issue. Like the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Wycombe, we want a diverse and varied market that includes the private sector. As with the voluntary sector, where the private sector achieves good quality provision, we want local authorities to work with it to develop and grow such provision.

<a name="stpa_205">I turn to amendments Nos. 38 and 39 and local area agreements. I appreciate the attempt to use existing levers to ensure that local authorities are working in real partnership, but there are several difficulties with citing local area agreements. First, they apply to England only; secondly, they are voluntary agreements and have no statutory basis, so we could not include them Bill. As I have hinted, because the local area agreement process does not exist in Wales, amendment No. 39 is not appropriate.

<a name="60309-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_206">A number of amendments&#151;Nos. 5, 35, 13 and 59&#151;deal with the ways in which local authorities relate to various groups of people who might want to use child care in their areas. On amendments Nos. 5 and 13, the child care needs of many of the carers cited is already covered by the duty on local authorities. They will be in&#151;or be seeking to be in&#151;employment, education or training, so they will be part of the population to whom the duty on local authorities will apply. There are also other initiatives to support carers of children or adults&#151;regardless of whether they are in employment, education or training&#151;through the social care and social security system: the carer&#039;s allowance, the carer&#039;s grant and council tax discounts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_207">I do acknowledge that parents and carers of disabled children need breaks, and such children also benefit from new experiences and opportunities to interact with other children, away from their families. However, the point is that we do not need new legislation to achieve that. Section 17 of the Children Act 1989, and standard 8, on disabled children, of the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services, already make such provision. We must look to such measures, rather than expanding the duty on local authorities to ensure such provision for disabled families.
</p>





<p><a name="st_263"><a name="60309-22_spnew8"><b> Annette Brooke: </b> 
 I want to repeat my concern that in the light of scarce funds, local authorities will prioritise. Although I appreciate that in some local authorities there may be considerable funding from social services for places, in others there is not, and no increased funding will be coming on board. Unless the Bill deals with this issue to some extent, the focus will be on working parents and some workless parents could be completely left out, simply because all local authorities have to prioritise. The child poverty target has not been met because just one method is being used to get people back into work; other methods need also to be used. If we focus on a single group, others might be totally overlooked. I am genuinely concerned about this issue.
</p>





<p><a name="st_264"><a name="60309-22_spnew9"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 I appreciate the hon. Lady&#039;s concern and I know that it is genuine; she raises these issues because of her regard for such people. We are trying to frame a duty on local authorities to provide sufficient child care, and it is important that in doing so, we strike a balance. It is not that the groups whom the hon. Lady mentions are not important; they are, but we are talking about requiring, in law, local authorities to ensure that sufficient child care is available for certain groups. They will be judged accountable according to where we draw the line for that duty, and the Bill proposes that it should be drawn for working parents and the parents of disabled children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_208">In fulfilling that duty, local authorities will generally make good-quality child care more available across the board, and I have no doubt that it will be available for people outside the groups to which I have referred. We have to decide what we should require local authorities to guarantee, as far as they reasonably can, and the criteria against which we should judge them. The Bill strikes a reasonable balance in that respect, ensuring 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 1002</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that there is more child care for other groups, but not imposing a very high threshold of duty on local authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_209">Amendment No. 35 would place an explicit duty on local authorities to have regard also for the requirements of disabled parents when securing sufficient child care. I agree that the needs of disabled parents must be taken into account and accommodated, although not necessarily by this Bill. A new disability equality duty will come into effect in December this year, requiring all public bodies to ensure that disabled people are treated equally. Obviously, that duty will play a part in what local authorities must provide in connection with this Bill, and that is why the amendment is not necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_210">Amendment No. 59 would include on the face of the Bill the groups that local authorities should consult when carrying out their assessment duty. During the Committee stage, we published a paper outlining our intentions in that regard, and that is still available in the Library of the House. It states clearly that local authorities should consult with parents, carers, providers, employers and local organisations to ensure that the provision meets their needs. As I said in Committee, we will require local authorities by means of regulation to take account of the views of children. I hope that the hon. Lady will be happy with that, as it will give us a quality system for assessing sufficiency.

<a name="stpa_211">Other amendments deal with the relationship between the private voluntary sector and schools, the two parts of the sector that will provide child care. As part of the level playing field argument, amendment No. 7 would require local authorities to set up an appeals process to handle the concerns of child care providers. We discussed the matter very thoroughly in Committee, and the arrangements in the Bill will safeguard the very valuable role that the private and voluntary sectors play in maintaining the diverse market that we want to exist.However, as I said in Committee, if local providers still feel that they have been treated unfairly, processes are in place to ensure that they can complain to the local authority.

<a name="stpa_212">Secondly, we have said that any complaints received by the local authority must be referred to Ofsted for consideration as part of the joint area review.

<a name="stpa_213">Amendments Nos. 31 and 32 deal with the role of maintained schools, and once again are similar to amendments tabled in Committee.

That will take care of the objective contained in amendment No. 31.

<a name="60309-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_214">Amendment No. 32 is similarly unnecessary.

Local authorities already have to have in place detailed and well established monitoring and accountability arrangements for budgets in schools and other maintained settings. It follows that financial

<a name="stpa_215">The hon. Lady rightly pursues the issue of the quality of child care. I hope that she did not feel crushed in Committee, because that was not my intention. I would never seek to do that, especially to the hon. Lady because I know that her sentiments are generally benign, if sometimes a little misguided in terms of how we get where we want to be. I tried to stress in Committee that a substantial part of the Bill&#151;part 3&#151;is about quality, because we are instituting a new regulation and inspection regime, and a new framework for the early years foundation stage as a basis for that regime. That Ofsted framework is the appropriate way to achieve a national consistent standard of achievement. In addition, clause 6 requires local authorities to have particular regard to the need to secure sufficient child care that is eligible for the child care element of the working tax credit. Child care will be eligible for tax credits only if it satisfies the standards set by Ofsted. It does not make sense to require local authorities to duplicate 150 times what we have already established, which is a national organisation that parents trust and that works to consistent standards across the country. That is the way to proceed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-22_para14">
<a name="stpa_216">Clause 11 requires local authorities to carry out an assessment of parents&#039; needs for child care. That will not be just an assessment of parents&#039; needs regarding the quantity of child care but of the quality and flexibility of that child care. Our regulations and guidance underpinning that duty will make it clear that local authorities must consider the types and features of child care that parents require.

<a name="60309-22_para15">
<a name="stpa_217">We have to allow local authorities to exercise leadership in the way that they think best for their area. They are doing so in significant numbers, but that is different from placing them under a requirement that would potentially conflict with or duplicate Ofsted&#039;s role. I am the first to agree with the hon. Lady that the quality of child care is crucial, but I do not agree that the amendment is the way to achieve it.

 The Minister said a moment ago that she had not given us much comfort. I agree, and I shall explain why by returning to the figures. The key word that she used was &quot;churn&quot; and she said that there is a churning of places. She also said that matters had improved since December 2004. From 2003&#150;04 to 2004&#150;05, according to the parliamentary answer that the Minister kindly provided, 16,000 new places were provided, but some 60,000 were closed. We find it hard to see how that can be a churn. Either there is over-supply or there is not a level playing field in the way that the CBI and the National Daycare Nurseries Association have suggested. It must be one or the other.

I was not for a moment claiming that the right hon. Lady is a lawyer, simply that her answer was a good lawyer&#039;s answer, and I am sure that she was assisted by her Department in that. However, it seems to us that although the Bill may contain the measures necessary to ensure that a level playing field is established, it is hard to see them. We do not intended to press these amendments to the vote, but our colleagues in another place will require more reassurance about how the Minister&#039;s Department is going to provide a level playing field once the Bill comes Into effect. At the moment, there is a very strong suggestion that the playing field is not level.

 I was due to serve on the Committee on this Bill, but because of a double booking with Standing Committee on the Equality Bill, I was unable to do so. Equality won out, which is as it should be. I eventually got here, and the hand of fate means that I am involved at the end of the day. I reiterate the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) earlier about the cross-departmental child care team on the Opposition Benches. My hon. Friends the Members for East Worthing and Shoreham and for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) are part of the official Opposition&#039;s strong child care team, and I am pleased to be part of it too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_222">In Committee there was vigorous debate, particularly on issues that I shall cover in this group of amendments. It is a diverse group&#151;something of a shopping list&#151;but these are important amendments and are worthy of further consideration. This group focuses on the duties of local authorities to ensure the well-being of children and I shall subdivide it further so that the debate makes sense.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_223">I shall first look at amendments Nos. 1 and 2, which relate to clause 1, about improving the well-being of children. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State stressed the idea of children having the best start in life, and the Opposition wholeheartedly endorse that. We believe that amendments Nos. 1 and 2 would instil that ideal more into the Bill. Our concern is that &quot;the reduction of inequalities&quot;&#151;the wording currently in the Bill&#151;could be interpreted in a number of ways and lacks the clarity that legislation should provide. Clarity of direction is vital. We believe that the Bill needs to focus on raising standards&#151;an objective that we all share. We have heard today that the Government have failed to meet their target for reducing child poverty, and we share their obvious concern about that. Many hundreds of thousands of children who should have been out of poverty remain in it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_224">We have to focus on what we can do to close the gap between rich and poor, because it must be addressed in terms not merely of targets, which can sometimes create perverse outcomes, but of raising standards for all, especially the quality of experience for the most disadvantaged groups. We believe that the Bill should, and will, set the tone and ethos for what we want from child care. The Bill is important because every child deserves the opportunity to maximise his or her potential.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_225">In Committee, some philosophical differences were expressed about the reduction of inequalities versus improvement in the quality of outcomes. I hope that we can agree that we should continue to work on those points, but we may be closer together than the Committee debate suggested. I refer to an interview given by the Prime Minister on &quot;Newsnight&quot; in 2001, when he clearly stated that the Government&#039;s objective was to level things up. He said:


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 1006</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;Surely the important thing is to level up those people that don&#039;t have opportunity in our society.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_226">We wholeheartedly endorse that view, which our amendments would make much clearer in the Bill. Our philosophy is simple: to maximise the potential of children so that no child is held back or left behind. The amendments would help to make that clearer to the people who implement the legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_227">It will be useful to deal with amendments Nos. 34, 43 and 56 together. They all refer to improving children&#039;s well-being, which relates to the Government&#039;s objective of ensuring that we help the people who need it most, which the Secretary of State stressed on Second Reading. The objective of the amendments is to focus the Bill on doing exactly that. As child poverty remains of great concern, I hope that the Government find the amendments useful in ensuring that our objectives in the legislation are clear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_228">I am sure that the House agrees that we have much to learn from other experience of child care provision. The US head start programme is interesting. It puts tremendous focus on the most disadvantaged families and has resulted in significant, measurable improvements in language, social development and parental interaction with their children, in terms of reading and discipline. In the UK, Sure Start is a welcome help for the most disadvantaged, although it covers only 40 per cent. of disadvantaged children. Indeed, my constituency, which has areas of significant disadvantage, receives no such help, although I am pleased that the situation will change in the future with the establishment of children&#039;s centres.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_229">As the Minister of State has stressed, when I have put questions about the results of Sure Start, these are early days, but is the programme targeted enough on the most disadvantaged? In the light of the national evaluation of Sure Start, will the Minister consider whether more can be done directly to underpin and support the most disadvantaged groups, especially those important groups that the research showed were as yet unsupported by the programme&#151;lone parents, teenage mothers and workless households. We all feel that they deserve more support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_230">We all want to improve the well-being of children in the broadest sense, but it is vital that support for the most disadvantaged is at the heart of our discussions. All three amendments would focus resources more actively on those most in need, which we hope will do most to help children in poverty. The proposals would not merely facilitate but maximise access to the services on offer and not merely identify but target the parents most in need, making the Bill much more active and its support more directed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_231">We are concerned about the structure of the Sure Start programme, which needs some attention. It is rather loose and variable in execution, so it can be difficult to measure outcomes. Our key concern is that we are ensuring help for those who need it, and perhaps that is not ingrained in the implementation of Sure Start to date, as evidenced by the Birkbeck study, which was published in November 2005. I am, of course, aware of the supplementary pamphlets and notes that have been issued as a result of that research. I ask the Minister to comment on whether she feels that that background is sufficient to cause the change that we probably need to see in Sure Start to underpin those important groups.

<a name="stpa_232">The Government clearly have continuing problems with poverty levels. We have been targeting to reduce poverty, but hundreds of thousands of children whom the Government were hoping to lift out of poverty have not been removed from it. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that an additional &#163;1.4 billion will be needed to hit the Government&#039;s targets by 2010. Obviously that is down to the Chancellor, who must ponder and think about it. We accept on both sides of the House that work is an important way out of poverty. Indeed, that was reiterated this morning by a Minister speaking on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions during an interview. The Bill is an important way to support parents with the aim of getting back to work in mind. If we are to ensure that the proposed legislation reaches its maximum potential, there may be room to consider the amendments to ensure that we are focusing our activities in the right direction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_233">Amendments Nos. 40 and 52 were tabled to offer some support and help in improving the well-being checklist. What is on the checklist will dictate the approach that the local authority takes. As we all know, what happens to us as children influences us for the rest of our lives. The way in which we assess the progress of children is of paramount importance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para15">
<a name="stpa_234">Amendment No. 40 is about the physical and emotional health of children. I am sure that we all realise that mental health is a long-term issue that develops over time. It is not static, and cannot be considered at only one point in time. We need to consider the mental health development of children, and that is a continuing process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para16">
<a name="stpa_235">As for amendment No. 52, there is the recognition that children&#039;s relationships with their parents are important in their long-term well-being. I was somewhat surprised to see that that was not recognised in the Bill, particularly after some of the debates that we have had recently on the Children and Adoption Bill, during which we all agreed on the importance of the relationship with parents. This should be a pivotal element of the well-being checklist, and I ask the Minister to consider that carefully. The amendment would lead to a constructive improvement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para17">
<a name="stpa_236">With amendment No. 36, we try to draw attention to the importance of the quality of outcomes. As part of improving the well-being of children, we are improving access. We are also improving the quality of child care on offer. We have already discussed our disappointment that so many private and voluntary nursery places have come to an end, although there has been a net gain. We see that as a positive move, but we are concerned that 200,000 places have been closed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para18">
<a name="stpa_237">We need to ensure that when, or rather if, the Bill is enacted, local authorities focus on quality, not quantity alone. We feel strongly about that, and the issue was debated thoroughly in Committee. It is worthy of being set out in the Bill, and the amendment would do that. It would put into the Bill the importance of quality and the importance of raising the quality of outcomes, which should be at the heart of the legislation.

We all know that our constituencies are diverse&#151;Basingstoke is a mixture of suburban and rural communities&#151;and even within a single constituency and local authority area the Bill will have to deal with a great deal of diversity. The amendments would give the local authority the ability to adapt to local needs, and more autonomy, making sure that they were not just driven by centrally dictated targets but could take into account what was happening in their own communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para20">
<a name="stpa_239">Amendment No. 55 has a specific aim, and echoes the debate about &quot;may&quot; and &quot;must&quot; in Committee. Clause 4 deals with the duty of local authorities to work with relevant partners such as the national health service in the delivery of integrated child care. Members on both sides of the House will agree that collaborative working is vital if the Bill is to succeed. The Bill makes it clear that local authorities must work with their relevant partner agencies, and clause 4(4) says that they

<a name="60309-23_para21">
<a name="stpa_240">That wording suggests that there is a choice. The Government may have overlooked that usage, but we need to be certain that that is the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para22">
<a name="stpa_241">We know from debates on the health service that there is enormous pressure on finances in this area, and that one in four primary care trusts are in financial deficit. When we talk to Ministers about the provision of services in other areas we are told that that is the responsibility of local management. I have asked Health Ministers on a number of occasions about the provision of local health services in north Hampshire, but they tell me that that is dictated by local management. We need to take that into consideration when we assess this part of the Bill. Can the Minister explain where the well-being of children will fall in local NHS priorities? The amendments recognise the need for a statutory directive in the Bill to ensure that it can achieve what it sets out to achieve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-23_para23">
<a name="stpa_242">Finally, after that rather long shopping list of amendments, amendment No. 47 would remove clause 5. Under that clause, the Minister could redefine the nature of early childhood services, thus giving her unlimited powers to change the group of people whom the Bill is intended to help. How would those services be redefined? Will she explain why that provision was included by telling us when and why it would be used? I commend the amendments to the House, and I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response.

We want advice for parents and support for children, but the relationships and dynamics within the family are greater than the sum of its parts, whatever form the family unit takes. If clause 12(1) included a reference to families, we would ensure that information about a raft of family support measures was available. That small amendment would greatly enhance the Bill.

The Bill includes a general duty to improve the well-being of young children in an area, and the hon.

 My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) was making this point: when one attempts to reduce inequalities, one first attempts to bring up the standard of those who have fallen behind, but if one cannot do that, there is only one other option&#151;bringing down the standard of those who are ahead.
</p>





<p><a name="st_292"><a name="60309-24_spnew4"><b> Ann Coffey: </b> 
 I am not sure how that could possibly happen. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s comment reflects the Conservative party&#039;s general paranoia about levelling down. Conservative Members seem to think that there will be a huge move up and down the country to lower outcomes for the better-off in order to achieve a reduction in inequalities. I do not know how they think that will happen or the mechanism that they think we will use.
</p>





<p><a name="st_293"><a name="60309-24_spnew5"><b> Mr. Goodman: </b> 
 It is simple: the law depends on the words in the Bill, which are &quot;reduce inequalities&quot;.

 I thank my hon. Friend for sharing that policy development with Conservative Front Benchers, who are clearly unaware of it. A concentrated effort would be required from all public agencies on levelling down, because all the evidence suggests that better educated and better informed people are, for example, changing their diets, taking more exercise and attending preventive health checks, with the result that their life chances and those of their children are improving at a better rate than those of less well informed people. I imagine that the only way to lower outcomes for the more advantaged would be to stop them getting information in the hope that they will stop doing the things that are improving their health.

<a name="stpa_253">All the evidence suggests that more effort is required to find ways to improve outcomes for the most disadvantaged. The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) has argued that outcomes will improve for the most disadvantaged if effort is concentrated on them, so it does not matter that outcomes for the advantaged are rising. However, if the gap widens and less advantaged people perceive that their life opportunities are much less than those of more privileged people, then they will think that the situation is unjust, and it will become more difficult to sustain a multicultural, diverse community.

 My argument is focused on raising standards for the most disadvantaged, and I have tabled amendments to focus more of our resources on that group.

 That is the most unutterable rubbish that I have ever heard in this Chamber. The investment in children&#039;s centres is a recognition that we have to do something about disadvantage from an early age. Providing a general duty to address inequalities will lead to the development at a local level of policies that take particular account of helping the most disadvantaged because of the way in which that service provision will then be developed.

As part of that initiative, parents might be encouraged to come in and talk about diet. That might help to reduce inequalities in outcomes in the long term. Without a duty to address inequalities, there will not be the same kind of pressure for innovative thinking at a local level to ensure that in every policy area thought is given to ensuring that outcomes for the most disadvantaged are improved.

 Before I begin my remarks on amendment No. 1, I want to say what a great privilege it was to serve on the Standing Committee that scrutinised the Bill. Of course, all Standing Committees are riveting, but this one was in a league of its own, as Members from all parties vociferously debated their case. Several divisions arose, particularly on clause 1.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_257">On Second Reading, some of my hon. Friends may not have given enough attention to the importance of clause 1, which does two remarkable things. First, it places a duty on local authorities to improve the well-being of all young children in their area. Secondly, local authorities must reduce inequalities between young children in their area&#151;but not, as the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) suggested, by dumbing down. As subsection l(a) and (b) make clear, inequalities can be reduced only by improving outcomes for the least well-off more quickly and to a greater extent than for others, so that they catch up and the gap is reduced. We debated that at length in Committee. I am sorry that the hon. Lady was not there to hear that debate.

The problem is that, if the outcomes for all children continue to improve, those at the bottom could be left even further behind. We know that inequality matters, especially in societies such as ours, where we deal largely with relativities&#151;relative poverty and relative disadvantage&#151;and where parents want to provide more than the basics for their children. At least the Tories made their stance on the issue clear in Committee; the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) was less clear.

 If the hon. Lady would like to look back at the speech that I made on Second Reading, she would see that I welcomed the mention of the reduction of inequalities. As I have explained, my reason for being concerned about the expression used is the fact that inequality could be reduced simply by bringing the top down, and if subsection (1)(a) relates simply to an average, that is still quite compatible. Even now, an amendment to that subsection is needed&#151;it is not foolproof. However, hon. Members will recall that I was horrified by the comments of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb). No one could dispute the fact that I certainly believe in the reduction of inequalities, and we must talk about less-advantaged children gaining ground more rapidly than others.

 I shall make a brief contribution because Conservative Front Benchers have unwittingly revealed the problem with today&#039;s Conservative party. On the one hand, Conservative Members use rhetoric that makes it sound as though they are caring, sharing, modern and interested in a fairer society, but when it comes to reality, they oppose the concept. Since my earlier intervention, I have done further research and I have a copy of the interview with the new policy chief of the Conservative party, the right hon. Member for West Dorset, in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on 23 December 2005. He said:
</p>
<ul>

 I think not. It is clear from the Bill that we both want to improve the well-being of young children and reduce inequalities between them. However, amendment No. 1 would remove the notion that the gap should be reduced. There is a simple explanation for that: in its heart, the Conservative party and its Front Benchers do not want to reduce the gap between rich and poor&#151;they do not believe in that. That is a valid position, but it would be better to admit it. They are at odds with the remarks of the Conservative party&#039;s policy chief. Conservative Front Benchers may shake their heads but there is a blatant contradiction between the amendment and the words of the Conservative policy chief.

The Childcare Bill is using those five outcomes as the basis for the outcomes duty and other provisions, which is why we have incorporated them as they are. They are the outcomes that children and families identified, and they were endorsed in the 2004 Act. We are really not in the business of rewriting them now. I agree that relationships with parents are important, certainly in helping to achieve those outcomes, but local authorities should not be responsible for the quality of relationships between children and their parents. However, we want to help parents to support their children. We are sticking with the five outcomes, and that is why I am unable to accept those three amendments.

I am at a loss to understand how the Conservatives feel that criteria for judging whether a local authority has achieved those outcomes for children can instead be defined as &quot;procedures for assessing&quot;. They seem to want to replace an outcome criterion with a process criterion. That is not what we are about. We are interested in outcomes. That is the bottom line, and that is the basis on which the targets for local authorities will have to be decided.

Regulations under clause 12 will require local authorities to provide detailed information about providers, including their registration status, how many places they have, and how many funded places they offer. Authorities will also be required to tell parents how to gain access to Ofsted inspection reports that may include information.

 I am sure that many people listening to the debate will share my disappointment that the Government still hark back to eight years ago and the records of bygone days, rather than starting to talk about their own record.

Knowing the financial position of my primary care trust in north Hampshire, which is &#163;14 million in deficit, I find it difficult to see how great priority is going to be given to the matter in the future.

We are entirely happy with the idea of reducing the gap between people who are disadvantaged and those who are not, but we believe that that is best done by raising aspirations. People listening to the debate will find it difficult to understand why Government Members take such exception to our argument. As a parent, I understand why many parents throughout the country believe that we should have better aspirations for our children&#151;whether we come from the most wealthy or the most deprived areas of the country. We believe that if we put raising aspirations at the core of the Bill, we will make it better.

The sooner she acknowledges that the better. She gave bland responses to the points made by Conservative Front-Bench spokesmen on the previous group of amendments. She can rightly say that nought to five does not cover those people, so the amendment does not relate to them, but the welfare of older children, whose circumstances would otherwise be covered by the Bill, does matter. I hope that the Government take that forward in a more positive way and that there is a process of assessing the outcomes, rather than just having targets.

 This is the most important part of our discussion. We might have had a lengthy and sparky debate on the previous string of amendments, but to my mind learning and development is the most important issue to address.

<a name="stpa_289">I welcome the principles of the early years foundation stage, which lays out the basis of a curriculum so that we can make clear judgments about quality, which is set against milestones. Indeed, the early years foundation stage provides opportunities. However, including the word &quot;taught&quot; means that there is a great possibility of unintended consequences.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_290">As we know, young children learn by being supported to play and by exploring the world around them. That must be reflected in the learning and development requirements. It is difficult to incorporate in the Bill the reality that children learn through play, which is why in Committee we tried to replace the word &quot;taught&quot; with &quot;experience&quot;. As that was rejected, and bearing in mind the clause heading, we have redrafted the amendment to include experiencing and learning.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_291">There is a concern that we might give out wrong messages to child care practitioners. We all know that we have much work to do in upskilling the work force. With the inclusion of the word &quot;taught&quot;, it will be all too easy to incorporate practices that do not generate the type of learning that we would like young children to gain at such a key phase of their development.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 1022</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>&quot;taught&quot;, whatever the dictionary definition, has connotations: it implies a group of young people, children or adults receiving instruction, rather than learning by experience at the right level.

The provider in question responded by providing worksheets, but generally speaking, they are not appropriate at that level. The danger is that we will make this incredibly important stage of learning far too formalised. We will not achieve what we could achieve through this Government&#039;s vast investment in early years provision unless we ensure that there is the right environment and culture.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, which has actually underlined the point that the word &quot;taught&quot; is incongruous. In fact, it is incompatible with the guidance notes that the Minister distributed in Committee, which were almost encouraging in terms of how providers should approach the early years foundation stage. We are simply objecting to the word &quot;taught&quot;, which I sincerely believe should be changed, as all early years providers agree. Whatever the civil servants may be saying, we should look to the professionals in this field.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_294">Early years is the most important period: it impacts on future life experiences and attainments. During early years, children should be in a setting that provides a relevant and positive learning experience, so that they can develop a sense of their own identity&#151;not that of the child care worker&#151;and become self-confident learners. This is about setting the scene for a hopeful and positive education experience, which inevitably becomes more formalised once children go to school. At that early stage, it is absolutely vital that we enable children to develop at their own pace and give them every opportunity to learn and to assimilate as much as they possibly can. Children learn at different rates, and they must want to learn and be ready to learn. When we use the word &quot;taught&quot;, which has specific connotations, we should remember that the ratio of pupils to teachers is usually higher than one to one. At this critical stage, we have to allow children to progress at their own rate.

Clause 46 allows exemptions to the early years foundation stage to be granted to certain providers.

It is worth noting that the phalanx of class-war dogmatists has scarpered now that we are dealing with serious technical matters to do with the quality of child care.

That is the problem, and I fear that talking in the language of school curriculums does nursery-age children a big disservice.

The amendments request clarity and transparency in the Bill and seek to ensure that if any exemptions or disapplications are made, the reasons must be set out clearly and published, so that everybody can understand them and be sure that we are all acting on a level playing field or whether the fear of a two-tier system is justified.

We all share the same intentions and the Minister&#039;s response to my pronouncements on the merits of attachment theory suggested that she concurred with our view on what we should be trying to achieve in those early years. However, the language that the Bill uses will be adhered to by local authorities and child care providers when they seek to do what the Government want them to do. They are in danger of throwing baby out with the bath water, by trying to make baby grow up rather faster than baby needs to, because baby needs to learn about how to be a decent child before getting into a school curriculum.

 I hope to be able to provide some reassurance, although in the light of our experience in Committee I am not convinced that I will be able to allay completely the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) or the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke). I do not think that there is much between us. I know that the word &quot;taught&quot; is between us, but I hope to try to provide some reassurance.

<a name="60309-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_305">It is important to use the word &quot;taught&quot;, and it does not necessarily imply the extreme formality that Opposition Members fear. It is a term recognised by the early years sector, and reflects the language already used in the foundation stage and in the Education Act 2002. It does not necessarily imply sitting toddlers in rows and cramming them with rote learning, no matter what age they are. I accept that &quot;taught&quot; can have that connotation, but it does not necessarily have it.

<a name="stpa_306">The hon. Lady will forgive me if I return to the dictionary definition because dictionaries, especially the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, are the basis from which we start when interpreting what we mean by the words that we use. Although it is true that the dictionary includes formalised definitions of &quot;teach&quot; such as
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;to impart information to skill to (a person) or about (a subject) . . . do this for a living . . . put forward as fact or principle&quot;,</p>

<a name="60309-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_309">My argument is that &quot;taught&quot; encapsulates what hon. Members are seeking to replace it with. To remove the word completely leaves us thrashing around to try to make sure that we can encapsulate fully the meaning of what we are trying to say in the legislation. Clarity is important in legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_310">This is not conclusive, but some technical defects with amendments Nos. 8 and 9 make it difficult for them to be accepted. They illustrate what could happen if we were to remove a word such as &quot;taught&quot; from the Bill, as amendment No. 8 would do by removing the word &quot;taught&quot; from the &quot;matters, skills and processes&quot; that practitioners should offer young children of different abilities and maturities and replacing it with reference to the matters, skills and processes that young children should experience by their involvement in or exposure to learning and development. That is a complicated way of removing a word from the Bill, and does not add to the clarity of the meaning.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_311">Amendment No. 9 would have a more complex effect because it would remove the word &quot;taught&quot; from the Bill by replacing the phrase

<a name="60309-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_313">The effect of that would not be clear, because it would allow learning and development requirements to specify the matters, skills and processes that young children should experience, and it is hard to see how matters and skills can be experienced. I do not think that it would add to the clarity of the Bill if we were to adopt the wording that either amendment suggests, although I understand the point that hon. Members are making.

If they need tidying up, perhaps the hon. Lady could give us a hint that she will go in that direction.

<p><a name="st_351"><a name="60309-29_spnew2"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 No, I do not accept that. I said that the words with which Members have tried to replace the word &quot;taught&quot; are fully encapsulated in that word, so they add nothing. I have tried to illustrate that removing &quot;taught&quot; would make it more difficult to understand the clause. I understand the points that are being made about formality in education at too early an age, which we debated extensively in Committee. I do not think that there is much difference between us in respect of the outcomes that we want.

<a name="60309-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_315">Removing the word &quot;taught&quot; will not solve things or add clarity in any useful way.

 Will the Minister confirm that in Committee it was established that the word &quot;taught&quot; does not appear in &quot;Birth to Three Matters&quot;? We are particularly concerned that we seem to be combining the whole age range.

 But the word &quot;teaching&quot; does appear in that document. We could go round in circles for a long time, but our positions are close enough not to worry too much about that definition. I cannot accept the amendment, but there is not too much difference in substance between what we and Opposition Members are saying. &quot;Taught&quot; is only a little word, but it is obviously a central concept and we need to make sure that everybody understands it fully.

He asked me to provide more clarity about the waiving of learning and development requirements in certain circumstances. I want to reassure him that the measure will not drive a coach and horses through all our early development aims.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-29_para14">
<a name="stpa_319">Such a waiver might occur where a local authority had difficulty in securing the training required to improve the skills of the local child care work force by 2008. For example, a small provider such as a playgroup might not technically yet fulfil all the requirements of the early years foundation stage, but could none the less offer an excellent service, or be not too far from being able to do so; the staff might be undergoing training but not have completed it. We would want the provider to improve so that it could deliver the framework rather than closing it down for a short period until the staff managed to gain the required qualifications. There could thus be a time-limited exemption so that the provider was not closed down when the early years foundation stage was implemented.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-29_para15">
<a name="stpa_320">We want to provide flexibility, while ensuring that quality is maintained and improved. We also want to take into account some of the practical difficulties that small, local organisations might experience in getting themselves up to scratch as we make the transition to the early years foundation stage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-29_para16">
<a name="stpa_321">The hon. Gentleman suggested that it would be appropriate to publish the reasons for exemptions, disapplications or modifications in respect of individual children. It would, however, be unfair to single out individual children in that way. Indeed, Members said earlier, with reference to another matter, that they did not want data about individual children to be published, yet the amendment seems to suggest that we should do just that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-29_para17">
<a name="stpa_322">The situations that we are talking about are likely to be very rare. For example, it might be necessary to exempt specific individual children from certain aspects of the early years foundation stage where it is necessary because of their parents&#039; religious beliefs. For example, I understand that members of the Plymouth Brethren do not really like information and communications technology, and they do not like their children to work on computers. If work on a computer does not conform with a parent&#039;s religious belief, even though that is a minority religious belief, it may be appropriate to exempt an individual child from requirements that relate to ICT.

<p>
<a name="60309-29_para18">

<p><a name="st_362"><a name="60309-30_spnew0"><b> Peter Bottomley: </b> 
 The Minister has been quite convincing on amendment No. 53. I hope that the interpretation of that is that the parent will be told why their children are being exempted from certain things. Obviously, it is at the request of the parent that no information is to be given. If there is some reason why the parent has not asked, it is perhaps worth bearing in mind that parents should be told of the situation. That is a different sense of the meaning of &quot;published&quot;&#151;not keeping secret.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_325">As I think the Minister recognises, she is not on quite such strong ground on amendment No. 51. The main point of the debate is about the word &quot;taught&quot;. The Minister explained that &quot;taught&quot; meant the same as &quot;experienced by&quot;, and then explained that &quot;experienced by&quot; necessarily did not mean the same as &quot;taught&quot;. It seems that that is where she got out of her circular argument&#151;on the wrong spot. It would be a good idea if before this issue comes up in another place the Minister were to seek advice and would ask what would be lost&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_363"><a name="60309-30_spnew1"><b> Mrs. Maria Miller: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for allowing me to intervene. I wonder whether he shares my concerns. The Minister was talking about drawing up regulations. When doing so, should she not take account of the impact that formalised teaching may have on premature babies who are still struggling to catch up in development terms during the important early years?
</p>





<p><a name="st_364"><a name="60309-30_spnew2"><b> Peter Bottomley: </b> 
 The Minister may choose to respond again at the end of the debate, or she may want to consider this question when it comes up in another place. If the clause were not in the Bill, I do not think that anyone would miss it. Most people who are caring for children, especially in an early education setting, are trying to do all these things in any event. Given that the clause is in place, the Minister should be asking those whose opinions she respects&#151;I hope that she respects our opinions in this place, but there are others whose opinions she may respect&#151;that if &quot;taught&quot; means the same as &quot;experienced by&quot;, cannot &quot;experienced by&quot; mean the same as &quot;taught&quot;, and would not that then be satisfactory?

<p><a name="st_365"><a name="60309-30_spnew3"><b> Annette Brooke: </b> 
 I drew a diagram, and I think that the hon. Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley) has expressed the situation clearly. I drew a circle to incorporate everything that &quot;taught&quot; meant. Learning and experience was clearly a sub-set of &quot;taught&quot;, so &quot;taught&quot; means a great deal more than learning and experience. That is clear.

<a name="60309-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_326">The Minister questioned whether learning and experience could be applied to matters and skills&#151;but when I visited the most excellent early years centre that I have ever seen, there was complete free choice for all the young children. Nothing was structured. The experience led me to ask some questions. I was given an example. If, for instance, some children decided that they wanted to fly kites, and it was found that there were not enough kites, others who wished to join them would have to make kites. For that they would need to find scissors from the cupboard. They would need to find paper. They would use scissors because they wanted to make kites, like the others. That is a clear example where one might say, &quot;You must be taught how to use scissors.&quot; However, in the early years, we are talking of a skill that is acquired by learning and experience, when that skill is wanted. I question whether the Minister is right on this point.

Given the lateness of this debate I am not going to press the amendment to a Division, but I very much hope that Ministers will give a great deal of thought to the matter as the Bill proceeds to the other place.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_331">Our debates on the various stages of the Bill have been productive, constructive, at times humorous, and well intentioned. I pay tribute to the commitment that Members in all parts of the House have shown, and to the detailed knowledge that many of them have brought to our deliberations as a result of many years of interest in the subject, going far beyond our experience as parents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_332">Apart from the one, albeit fundamental, dividing line between us on reducing inequalities, we have achieved a remarkable degree of consensus on the principles of the Bill and its aims. That is a measure of the extent to which the Government have shifted the ground. Such transformational change as we have seen over recent years, culminating in the Bill, in marked contrast to previous Government policies, commands consensus across the political parties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_333">The Bill has benefited from the close scrutiny to which it has been subjected, and the changes that have been made have improved it. I thank the Deputy Speakers who have chaired our discussions today, and our Chairmen in Committee. I thank the hon. Members for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) and for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke), who led the debates from the Opposition Benches, and their hon. Friends. I also thank the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle), and all my hon. Friends who have taken such an active part in the debate and helped us enormously, and I thank the Clerks and our officials, whom my hon. Friend has just mentioned, who have supported us ably throughout. I am grateful to everybody.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_334">Let me put the Bill in the context of Government objectives since 1997 of transforming the experience of children, young people and their families. We are doing that, first, because we are serious about increasing social mobility, reducing inequalities and tackling the long-standing disadvantages for many children and families that existed prior to 1997. Secondly, we need to respond to the labour market changes that have occurred over recent years, the aspirations of women as well as men, and the desire for both parents to have the flexibility of combining work and home life in ways that still provide high-quality options for their children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_335">Thirdly&#151;we have not discussed this issue, but it is none the less important&#151;as a nation, we need to maximise the achievement of all our people in the face 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 1033</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of increasing global competition, which includes rising economies such as China and India. We must ensure that every child reaches their potential and goes on from early years to educational success. Investment in early years is not only a social and moral imperative, but an essential measure for parents in their home and work lives and for our international economic competitiveness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_336">The Government have worked to bring about that transformation since 1997. We started with a massive increase in child care places and moved on to the Children Act 2004, the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; programme, the five outcomes, the 10-year child care strategy, the promise of a children&#039;s centre in every community and extended schools, and this landmark Bill extends that process. It is the first ever Bill dedicated to early years and child care, which demonstrates our commitment to early years and &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;. We are providing opportunities and choice, improving outcomes, reducing inequalities and increasing long-term investment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_337">The Bill focuses on outcomes and ensures that parents have a real choice. The Bill empowers local authorities to be the strategic leaders, which is a role that they will fulfil in consultation with parents and providers. Parents will be given the information that they need, and there will be a new approach to inspection and regulation. The early years foundation stage will build on what works and good parenting, and the child care register will extend quality. Last but not least, the need to safeguard children underpins the entire Bill. That is everybody&#039;s business, and we will discuss it in greater detail when we consider the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, which has been mentioned today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_338">The Bill is important and exciting. It starts to redraw the welfare state in terms of what families can expect to be provided for them in their areas on a local basis. The focus is on quality, improving outcomes for children in early years and reducing inequalities. The Bill is an integral part of our &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; programme, and it will ensure that every child has the opportunity to achieve their full potential.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_339">It is good to see the commitment of Opposition Members to the Bill, which I commend to the House.

<p><a name="st_413"><a name="60309-32_spnew0"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 I echo the Minister in saying that we had well-mannered, good-humoured and well-informed debates on Second Reading, in Committee and on Report. I thank the Committee Chairmen, my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) and the hon. Member for Bootle (Mr. Benton). As has happened today, we conducted our deliberations in Committee without guillotines or knives, and the lesson is that we can have a rational debate without being constrained by artificial timings, which the Government Whips too often seek to impose.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_340">I thank my hon. Friends who have contributed. Our Whip in Committee was my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous), who was here earlier today. We witnessed bravura performances by my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening), who mentioned &quot;The Very Hungry 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 1034</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Caterpillar&quot;. My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) is very well-informed, but, alas, she is abroad today and cannot join us. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) made a cameo appearance on the Front Bench this afternoon, when he was the target of so much vitriol from Labour Members&#151;he has now scarpered, as have some of his attackers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_341">Many additional amendments have been tabled. It assists debate if we can have as much notice and as detailed an up-front explanation of those as possible. If the Government intend to table further amendments, I hope that they give colleagues in the upper House a little more breathing space by supplying them as far in advance of the debate as possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_342">We welcome the additional measures to safeguard children. As the Minister knows, over the past few years we have fully concurred and co-operated with the Government in their various Bills to try to make the protection of our children, particularly vulnerable children, a genuine priority and to achieve some genuine change from the poor outcomes that they have experienced for far too long. It is absolutely right that this Bill, like the other legislation that is yet to come before us, should be proof against those who would abuse and undermine our children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_343">There are other good things in the Bill. The Minister called it a landmark Bill and said that it is part of the redrawing of the lines of the welfare state. That suggests that the Government set rather more store by the great dogma of their programme than we do. As far as we are concerned, the Bill is about affording more people the chance to access quality child care to improve the start that their children get in life, whether they come from disadvantaged or advantaged backgrounds. That is why we have wanted to concentrate on those from a disadvantaged background getting those opportunities as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_344">It is interesting, amusing and reassuring that we can occasionally rattle the great class warriors who still exist on Labour Benches, albeit in a rather confused way that contradicts their own Prime Minister. They set great store by phrases about reducing inequalities instead of concentrating on improving outcomes for those who need and deserve our support most of all. I do not think that those two things are mutually exclusive. It is interesting that there have been so many attempts to put divisions between what Members say. All that we are trying to achieve is better outcomes for the most disadvantaged, but for many, the argument about reducing inequalities is more important.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_345">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) rightly said that one of the most important parts of the Bill concerns the word &quot;taught&quot;&#151;just six little letters and one little word. We had a great debate about that. The Minister was at pains to say that although there was little between us, that one little word was so fundamental that it had to stay in the Bill. That is a shame, and I hope that the Government will reflect on it. My noble colleagues in the upper House will certainly return to the subject as the Bill proceeds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_346">It was encouraging that we almost had a rebellion from the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman), who has also scarpered. She threatened to vote with the Opposition at one stage and abstained in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 1035</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>one vote. Given her great expertise on early years child care and the whole subject of play for children, the Government would do well to listen to her comments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_347">The Government accepted many of our arguments and sympathised with many of our intentions, but in the end they did not accept any of our amendments. That is disappointing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_348">It is worth pointing out that the success of the Bill will rely enormously on the way in which local authorities embrace, interpret and enact its provisions, which of course bring no additional moneys with them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_349">All our discussions in the House will amount to nothing unless local authorities are able to do their job of ensuring that there is sufficient child care and that it is provided in a balanced way, because many of the private and voluntary independent providers, who have provided so much child care in the past, are threatened by unfair competition. The child care places that are lost must be set aside the creation of new ones. We admit that the net figure has increased, but the sustainability of those places is important.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_350">The Bill is not just about the numbers or the shiny new buildings that may house those child care places, whether in nurseries or whatever, but about the quality of provision and ensuring that we are giving those children the very best start in life. That is absolutely fundamental. We can write all the terms into the Bill that the Government wish and we can exhort local authorities to ensure that the numbers tally with what the Government want, but the most important thing is the quality of the outcome that the Bill achieves for those children and its impact on them, particularly in those crucial early years&#151;years 1, 2, 3 and 4.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_351">We welcome the Bill. We have supported it throughout, but we want it to work in practice. I hope that the Government have taken on board the serious concerns that we have expressed throughout our good debates. I hope that they will reflect on them and that, when the Bill reaches the upper House, they will allow some of the amendments that our noble colleagues table to see the light of day and be included in the legislation. Ultimately, we support the Bill. We wish it well, and we will certainly support its Third Reading this evening.

<p><a name="st_414"><a name="60309-32_spnew1"><b> Annette Brooke: </b> 
 May I, too, thank the Chairmen, Deputy Speakers and all the hon. Members on both sides of the House who have participated in Committee and on Second and Third Reading? I certainly agree that we have had some very good debates&#151;perhaps longer ones than I had anticipated, given the nature of the Bill&#151;on some rather interesting issues. I particularly thank my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) for picking up some rather important Welsh omissions and for emphasising the rural nature of some of the child care settings in Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_352">It has long been Liberal Democrat policy to invest in children&#039;s early years, and we are delighted that the Government have proceeded with a large commitment since 1997. I know what a difference that has made to my constituency. I am sure that many children will be much better prepared for life. I am pretty convinced that we will eventually see some very goods returns on a lot of the Sure Start schemes. Whenever we&#151;I use the royal &quot;we&quot;&#151;are rather punitive towards young people, I hope 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 1036</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that the early intervention that is taking place will make a real contribution to our local communities and society, and I mean that very sincerely.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_353">I was going to count the number of times that Ministers have said &quot;Oh, that&#039;s going to be in the regulations&quot;, but I found a better use for my time. They said that an incredible number of times in Committee, and that has been followed up at the same pace, if not an increasing pace, today. That makes scrutiny rather difficult. I am sorry that we could not have more information as we went through the Bill. I admit, of course, that we could not do so, because consultations were going on. I would not want to impede the consultations, but the lack of information seems a pity and it has made things difficult at times, because we have moved amendments to be immediately told, &quot;That&#039;s all right: it&#039;s in the regulations&quot;&#151;but we have not seen them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_354">I also welcome the additional safeguarding measures. Although we mentioned safeguarding in our deliberations in Committee, experiences in school settings before Christmas heightened our awareness and made it important to table such amendments. The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill will also deal with some of those issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_355">We have discussed quality at great length and we can never lose sight of its importance. As has been shown, it makes all the difference to outcomes, especially in the very early years. I am not convinced that we have managed to include enough about quality in the Bill, but we had good debates about it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para16">
<a name="stpa_356">I would like to believe that the Bill will make a difference. Clause 6 states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49">&quot;An English local authority must secure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the provision of childcare . . . is sufficient&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para17">
<a name="stpa_357">Without the resources, &quot;reasonably practicable&quot; will mean minimal. I hope that the Government will monitor that to ensure that the Bill makes a difference. It may well be necessary to provide a top-up in resources. We must not make false promises to our constituents. The words in the Bill are generally good but, without the resources, they will not mean anything for our constituents. They will not make the genuine difference to the disadvantaged about which we all care, however we express that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-32_para18">
<a name="stpa_358">I sincerely hope that the word &quot;taught&quot; will be changed, but I have probably said enough about that for one day. I support Third Reading.

<br>&nbsp;<br>account of part 3&#151;it is important to reduce the avoidable disadvantage, distress and handicap that they may face and to improve their well-being, which is a mixture of wealth and welfare. The development stages, which part 1 covers, are vital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_360">Although the measure is primarily about the duties of local authorities, everybody in local authorities will want to involve parents. Trying to develop the confidence and competence of parents is the key to developing the confidence and competence of children in the early stages and building on that through the primary school years, secondary school years and adult life.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_361">Earlier, I referred briefly to the Plowden report, which was published in 1967. The research papers are worth rereading and I commend them to people in local authorities as well as to those who advise Ministers. The Court report on child health services again showed that parents&#039; actions matter. There is no point in relying on what local authorities or health services can provide if we do not engage parents in what they can do. The reports may be 30 to 40 years old but, if the work was redone now, the same conclusions would be reached. What was learned in Home-Start and what Sure Start is introducing are lessons that are not especially new. Every generation needs to relearn them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_362">The bipartisan approach to the issues that local authority responsibilities cover matters. We have the problem&#151;or challenge&#151;of trying to ensure that that gets across to parents in all parts of the country in every generation. If 600,000 to 700,000 children are born each year and at least half are first children in a family, many new parents need to know what is available, what their child&#039;s experience will be and what the normal hiccups, obstacles and problems are. All those who dedicate themselves to children, whether in the voluntary sector or in other ways in their professional lives, matter a lot.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_363">My final word of caution is to enthusiastic Ministers in this third way, new Labour Government. Life did not start in 1997, and nor did the co-operation between health and education. It has been said in a slightly jokey way that, when my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) was booked into a hotel room at a party conference with his wife, Lady Young, they were the Ministers for the under-fives in health and education, and that the two Departments have had better dealings with each other ever since.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_364">We need to monitor the outcomes that people have worked for. When my wife, who is now in another place, was Minister for Health, she was as concerned about these matters as Ministers are now. I suspect that Ministers will be coming to the House in five or 10 years&#039; time to report on the measurable outcomes. The issue of whether reducing inequality&#151;which is not how I would have put it&#151;or raising people up from levels at which they should not be allowed to stay is the more important will become clear.

<a name="stpa_365">An example of inequalities for the elderly in our constituencies is that they have to wait nearly two years for a hearing aid, but if they go privately they can get one almost straight away, for a vast sum of money. We could reduce that inequality by saying that people should not buy hearing aids privately. Alternatively, we could reduce the level of unfairness by saying that everyone should get their hearing test and their hearing aid within 18 weeks. I commend that to the Ministers as well.

<p><a name="st_425"><a name="60309-33_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gordon Marsden  (Blackpool, South) (Lab):</b> 
 The Blackpool to Fleetwood tramway, which spans 10.4 miles from Starr Gate to Fleetwood and carries 6.5 million passengers a year, is genuinely unique. Opened in 1885, it remains the oldest continuously operating UK tramway. Along with the tower, the winter gardens and the Big One, it is the thing that defines Blackpool for millions of people in Britain. The tramway has also been a star of the silver screen, from the films of George Formby with his little stick of Blackpool rock to the shocking demise of Alan Bradley, who was crushed under the wheels of a tram in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, and, most recently, the BBC hit drama series, &quot;Blackpool&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_368">The tramway also annually frames and garlands the greatest light-show in the UK, the illuminations, and the best way to see the illuminations is still by tram. The Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for Halton (Derek Twigg), as a north-west MP and a history enthusiast, will appreciate all this. He will also understand the pivotal role that the Blackpool to Fleetwood tramway has played, not only in our broader social history but in the identity, life and success of Blackpool as a seaside resort, not least because hundreds, if not thousands, of his own constituents will have travelled on Blackpool trams.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_369">However, just as Britain cannot live in the past, neither can Blackpool. At 120 years old, the tramway is showing its age. It is in urgent need of modernisation and renewal. It serves not only Blackpool but Cleveleys and Fleetwood, which is why Blackpool council and Lancashire county council have come together on a bid that is enthusiastically backed by all the Fylde coast MPs. I want to emphasise at the outset that the bid is not a heritage project, as some people have suggested.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_370">It is not something that could be hived off for lottery funding elsewhere, even if the necessary sums were available. Nor is it a tourism project. Some 60,000 people use the tramway every day in Blackpool as a vital element of work and daily travel in the town. It is vital in particular because a larger than average number of elderly people live in Blackpool, and Blackpool still has the lowest car density in the north-west. Having used the tramway to travel from my home and office base in South Shore up to North Shore, I know that it is still a very important practical link&#151;and the journey is of course very evocative, whether one is seeing winter gales or summer sunshine over the Irish sea. Ultimately, the tramway meets a core transport need for the residents of Blackpool and the Fylde coast.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_371">The Blackpool scheme should not be regarded as a blue-sky scheme. It must not be seen as part of the network of assorted light rail proposals that have been submitted to the Department for Transport in recent years, however worthy they may be. For my constituents, this bid is an essential bread-and-butter&#151;or perhaps, as we are talking about Blackpool, I should say fish-and-chips&#151;component of public transport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para13">
<a name="stpa_372">The revised project cost of &#163;88 million, of which the Government would contribute &#163;72 million, covers the delivery of fully accessible platforms at stops, new 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 1041</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>rolling stock which would include articulated trams and low-floor trailers for older trams, a major programme of track renewal, the complete renewal of the electrification from Thornton Gate to Fleetwood, and the revision, substantial extension and modernisation of the tram and bus depot.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para14">
<a name="stpa_373">If any evidence is needed of the urgent need for this project, I can draw the Minister&#039;s attention to the following facts&#151;and they are facts. Less than a quarter of the existing track is in good condition. More than 55 per cent. of it requires attention now and in the near future. A full tramway service from Starr Gate to Fleetwood has not run in any winter since 2001, and the winter of 2004&#150;05 saw Manchester square closed to tram travel south to Starr Gate. Indeed, on that occasion a &#163;1 million emergency maintenance scheme funded by the Department for Transport was needed to retain access to the depot. The worst part of the track is between Central Pier and South Pier, but the electrical infrastructure north of Cleveleys is powered from a 60-year-old electrical substation, and there is an urgent need for track renewal if the whole system is to remain open beyond 2006&#150;07.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para15">
<a name="stpa_374">The tramway is key not just for Blackpool and Fylde in the present, but for Blackpool and Fylde in the future. An updated tramway is crucial to Blackpool&#039;s continued regeneration efforts, and to the success of the town&#039;s master plan. Not only would the proposed scheme provide a mass transport system for Fylde coast regeneration by linking Blackpool with Cleveleys and Fleetwood; it would provide the option in future years for further developments to the coast south of Fylde, with considerable potential for links to Blackpool, North and Blackpool airport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para16">
<a name="stpa_375">The tram will deliver the economic and social benefits of resort regeneration by providing a high-quality public transport link between the central area and the main tourism destinations, including some of the large hotels. Transport is a major element in the application to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport for a regional casino in Blackpool, and we know that potential developers regard the tram as a key asset in that context.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para17">
<a name="stpa_376">There is considerable&#151;indeed, substantial&#151;local support for the bid. I have mentioned already the support from Members of Parliament. There has also been concerted co-operation and collaboration between Lancashire county council and Blackpool, and full integration with all the planning and local highways authorities. Popular local support for all aspects of regeneration and specifically for the renewal of the tram system has been sustained and widespread. After his recent attendance at the Labour party spring conference, the Minister will know of the intense enthusiasm for the project, not just from the local papers but from delegates and others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para18">
<a name="stpa_377">Perhaps most significantly, the bid has attracted unqualified and unhesitating support from the Northwest Development Agency and from the North West regional assembly. The tram bid was recommended as a priority in the top quartile for regional funding allocation. The Minister will know that, on 22 February, Steven Broomhead, the chief 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 1042</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>executive of the Northwest Development Agency, wrote to him in support of the project. He said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52">&quot;The Tramway scheme scored well in each area and was well placed in the top quartile of these schemes examined. It has been recommended by the Region as a priority for funding . . . because this scheme is partially a deferred maintenance scheme it carries less risk . . . I would be grateful if you could place on record the Agency&#039;s full support for the Blackpool and Fleetwood Tramway project&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para19">
<a name="stpa_378">That underlines just how strong and unanimous the support for the scheme is across the region.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para20">
<a name="stpa_379">It is also important to comment briefly on the basis for the resubmitted scheme that Lancashire county council and Blackpool have put forward, because that indicates how they have responded positively to the demands that the Department placed on them after the initial submission of the scheme resulted in a request for revision. The revised scheme emphasises that it is a tramway, not a light rail system and that it updates an existing system, rather than building an entirely new tram network. The scheme scores well on deliverability and value for money. Blackpool already has a right of way and other assets that will provide cost savings. The scheme has been nearly five years in development and so the costs and the patronage figures that are quoted in the submission are far more robust and involve far less risk than might otherwise be the case. The relatively modest cost&#151;&#163;88 million at 2005 prices&#151;works out at a cost per kilometre of &#163;4.9 million, which is a fraction of the cost of most other light rail projects. The tram routes in Blackpool are free of utilities equipment, so there will be no need for expensive relocation work. The project is phased across a range of financial periods. Government contributions are requested to be &#163;8.1 million in 2006&#150;07, &#163;26 million in 2007&#150;08 and &#163;37 million in 2008&#150;09.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para21">
<a name="stpa_380">Importantly, the scheme will ensure that there are modern articulated trams that are compliant with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The positive benefit-cost ratio that the Department has asked for is in line with its requirements. However, no direct account is taken in the submission of the positive synergy between a tramway upgrade and the development of key sites in the regeneration area. I would argue, therefore, that the economic benefits of the scheme as outlined have been substantially underestimated. In my view, that strengthens the case for it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para22">
<a name="stpa_381">The devil is always in the detail of such projects, as we know, but I would argue that Lancashire county council and Blackpool between them have produced sufficient detail to satisfy the most demanding transport anorak. Let me cite some of what has been achieved. The revised bid, which was submitted in July 2005, reduced the capital cost by a third. It reduced the Government&#039;s contribution to &#163;72 million over three years from 2006&#150;07. It also produced a benefit-cost ratio of 1.59:1, to which I have already referred. Blackpool has cut costs by reducing the number of stops from 61 to 40, reducing the number of points and crossings from 147 to 54 and reducing the number of vehicles from 19 new and 20 refurbished ones to 16 new and 12 refurbished ones. All that was done in line with Department for Transport guidance and advice, and the consideration went right down to the type of coaches that would be commissioned if the bid went ahead.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 1043</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para23">
<a name="stpa_382">The Minister must forgive me if he detects a slight note of frustration, as well as enthusiasm for the bid, in my voice, given the time over which the bid has been going on. We in Blackpool believe that we have done virtually everything that the Department has asked of us. The cost-benefit information shows that the bid is as robust and conservative as the driest economist might wish. However, even at this stage, if there are aspects of the bid that are not clear to departmental officials, the council and others in Blackpool stand ready to provide even more information.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para24">
<a name="stpa_383">We have tried to respond to what officials have asked for and produced a proposal that meets the Government&#039;s tight priorities. Other light rail schemes have been criticised because of runaway costs and over-optimistic forecasts. Our tram appraisal, as now submitted, is tight, informed and on the button.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para25">
<a name="stpa_384">I suggest to the Minister that the time for a decision is very close. I hope that with the examples that I have cited, I have underlined that I do not believe that the possible closure of elements of the track due to health and safety concerns is a question of exaggeration or bluff. I thus ask him to reflect on and respond to several specific questions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para26">
<a name="stpa_385">Will the Minister tell me why there has been confusion among officials about the new submission? There is evidence that they did not realise that it was a new bid, rather than a resubmission. Will he tell me why issues around supporting information on capital costs were not raised until recently by Department for Transport officials as part of the KPMG assessment?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para27">
<a name="stpa_386">Does the Minister realise that because Blackpool&#039;s bid involves the upgrade of an existing system, the project would be much cheaper than a typical light rail scheme and be a low-risk project? The bid has much evidence on which to base costs and patronage figures. I understand that it will involve no costs or Transport Act requirements for moving utilities or existing cables. Is the Department fully aware of the endorsement of the tram project by both the Northwest Development Agency and the North West regional assembly, and that they have placed it in the top quarter of priority of all the projects that need funding in the north-west regional transport plan, which is now with the Minister and his officials?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para28">
<a name="stpa_387">I know that in a tight fiscal climate, any Minister will always want to be satisfied about the detail. However, we in Blackpool ask that the bid is judged on fair and transparent criteria that apply to it, rather than to other bids for light rail schemes. We ask that the goalposts are not continually moved throughout the process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-33_para29">
<a name="stpa_388">For us in Blackpool and on the Fylde coast, the tramway&#151;and its survival and renewal&#151;is not tourism frippery or an end-of-the-pier show. The bid is a core funding proposal for something that is essential to the future functioning of public transport in Blackpool and on the Fylde coast, and that is the basis on which I ask the Minister to approve the scheme urgently. Although he will want to exercise throughout the process all the analytical powers that I know that he will bring to bear, I hope that he will not ignore the honourable place that history would afford him&#151;along with George Formby and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;&#151;as the man who gave new life to a treasured, iconic and very practical public transport system and made it fit for purpose in a 21st century, regenerated Blackpool, rather than dooming it to curio status and possible closure.

<p><a name="st_426"><a name="60309-34_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Derek Twigg): </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)on securing this debate. He and my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) are great champions of Blackpool and the issues it is faced with. I welcome the opportunity to hear at first hand the views on the Blackpool and Fleetwood tramway and to set out the Government&#039;s position in respect of its future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_389">I am aware that the Blackpool to Fleetwood tramway is the oldest continuously operating tramway in the UK. It has been operating since 1885, and it currently carries about 4 million passengers a year. The Government recognise that the tramway is an established part of the transport network on the Fylde coast. Blackpool council has spent &#163;4.5 million over the past four years on essential maintenance to keep the tramway running. It says that a minimum of a further &#163;16 million will be required over the next three years to maintain the existing tramway.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_390">We therefore recognise the situation regarding the tramway&#039;s future. To do nothing in the next few years would mean that it could no longer operate in the way that it has been doing for many years. We also need to consider the tramway in the wider local and regional context. Blackpool&#039;s provisional local transport plan was submitted in July 2005. It highlighted three significant changes since the previous local transport plan, which crucially affect the context within which Blackpool council will seek to deliver its transport strategy. They are the decision to bid for the tramway upgrade; a revision of the local land use planning framework; and the development of a master plan for Blackpool and subsequent formation of an urban regeneration company to take this vision forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_391">Blackpool council&#039;s master plan aims to transform the town, widening its appeal to fresh tourist markets both from the UK and abroad, and providing opportunities for the people of the town, especially those in the most vulnerable groups. The council recognised that the most significant challenge during its local transport plan period will be to deliver the development necessary to regenerate its resort economy, while still meeting sustainable transport objectives. Those objectives aim to minimise the impacts of traffic, encourage modal shift away from the car, minimise poor air quality and improve the accessibility of vital jobs and services, especially to the residents of deprived areas. The council considers that continuing access to a mass public transport system in the form of a modernised Blackpool to Fleetwood tramway is integral to the sort of regeneration anticipated by the master plan.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_392">In 2001, Blackpool and Lancashire councils submitted a bid for a major upgrade to the system. That was rejected by my Department on value for money grounds. The promoters submitted a new major scheme business case in July 2005. Their preferred option, as set out in the business case, is to renew the existing track, replace the electrification infrastructure on the most northern section of the line and replace the overhead conductor over the entire length of the line. They propose to meet the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 by a combined fleet of new 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>9 Mar 2006 : Column 1045</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>low-cost tram vehicles, accessible trailer cars coupled to refurbished heritage trams and raised platforms at stops to enable level boarding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_393">The forecast outturn cost of that would be &#163;96 million, of which the local councils would provide &#163;24 million. The promoters are therefore seeking central Government funding of &#163;72 million. In terms of value for money, which my hon. Friend referred to, the promoters say that their preferred option would have a benefit-to-cost ratio of 1.57:1. Their assessment is that it will have a strong economical benefit and will have some additional benefits in terms of environment, safety, accessibility and integration objectives. My officials are reviewing the promoters&#039; BCR and other claims. If the reported BCR turns out to be accurate, and it is established that all the non-monetised impacts will be positive, the scheme would be classified as offering medium value for money under the Department&#039;s guidance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_394">We require promoters, when presenting a business case to the Department, to consider alternative options. In this case, the promoters have considered three other options for system upgrade, which I shall briefly set out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_395">The next best alternative is similar to the preferred option, but with a reduced length of operation. It proposes the loss of a third of the northernmost section, with services turning around at the proposed loop at Thornton Gate. A lower cost alternative would further reduce the length of tramway, with the line terminating at Thornton Gate and Pleasure Beach. That would be coupled with minimal investment in infrastructure and vehicles. Special services would be provided by refurbished heritage units. Finally, a &quot;do minimum&quot; option has been considered, which proposes the retention of a tramway only between Pleasure Beach and North Pier, accepting the loss of its local transport function. My officials have worked closely with the promoters on their proposals and are carrying out an economic assessment of the business case to provide me with value for money advice on the scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_396">My hon. Friend raised specific questions about the Department&#039;s handling of the Blackpool bid. He suggested there has been some confusion among my officials about whether the bid is new. I assure him that there has been no confusion. My officials met Blackpool council in July 2005, before the bid was submitted, to understand the context of the bid. We have treated the submission as a new bid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_397">My hon. Friend asked whether the Department recognises that the bid has been substantially revised to meet the Department&#039;s earlier concerns about affordability and value for money, and that it meets the Department&#039;s requirements. We recognise that the costs have been reduced significantly compared with Blackpool&#039;s previous bid. As I said, we are considering the value for money assessment, and I cannot say at this stage what the results will be.

<p>
<a name="60309-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_398">My hon. Friend also asked whether I accept that the costs and risks of upgrading an existing system are lower than for a new system. I confirm that we recognise that certain risks are lower for an upgrade. For example, a new light rail system would require utility diversions and Transport and Works Act 1992 powers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_399">My hon. Friend suggested that questions have been raised only recently on the capital costs. We raised issues about the information on capital costs at the end of 2005, following the Department&#039;s and our consultants&#039; initial assessment of the bid submitted at the end of July. Also, we recently had to consider how the costs in the bid relate to the costs indicated in the advice that we received from the north-west region at the end of January on its priorities for use of the regional funding allocation. As I indicated, we are still completing our assessment of the bid, and at this stage I have not made any decisions in respect of the Blackpool and Fleetwood tramway. Therefore, the debate is very timely. I will take my hon. Friend&#039;s points into account, as well as other advice that I have received and the advice that my officials will give me in due course.

<a name="60309-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_400">Following the publication of regional funding allocations last year, the north-west regional bodies have provided me with advice on which schemes are prioritised within the region. My hon. Friend asked whether I am aware of the endorsement of the tram project by both the Northwest Development Agency and the North West regional assembly. The advice that I received from the regional bodies gives priority to the refurbishment of the tramway to help the economic regeneration of Blackpool. I have also had a representation from the North West regional assembly supporting the scheme.
