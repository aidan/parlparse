We want to make further progress, which is why, for example, we are banding renewable obligation certificates in legislation that is before the House, why I have made announcements on feed-in tariffs, and why the Planning Bill is intended to speed up the siting of new renewables facilities.

He is right to say that, as we think about the current downturn, some people will say to us, &#147;It&#146;s time to abandon your climate change objectives.&#148; However, the green jobs agenda and moving to a low-carbon economy gives us an opportunity to prepare for the upturn and to find new ways of employing people.

 Our team will definitely undertake to meet my hon. Friend, and I will definitely consider his suggestion. It was right to end the moratorium on new nuclear power stations, but the priority on nuclear is to work out how we can get new nuclear facilities built. The situation will be helped by the EDF takeover of British Energy. EDF wants to build four new nuclear power stations, which I think is right for our country. Lots of people have changed their opinion of nuclear power on the basis of the climate change challenge that we face. I think that we have got the right policy on nuclear, but I will endeavour also to look at the issue that my hon. Friend has raised.</p>

Will the Secretary of State confirm that the National Grid Company seven-year statement takes no account of whether projects will get planning consent or even whether they will get the funding to build them? Will he also confirm that it does not take account of the extent to which generating capacity will be lost? Almost 15 GW of capacity is likely to be lost, as more of our capacity in nuclear, oil and coal closes down, so will the Secretary of State take the opportunity to set the record straight and admit that the outlook is much tighter than the Minister suggested?</p>

 My hon. and learned Friend the Minister of State was absolutely right in the figures that he provided, which come from the National Grid Company. As I said in my answer, there are issues about the next decade, but the prospect for new build happening is a good one. The difficult question for all of us is how to ensure that the supply of new build is diverse and not simply more gas-fired power stations.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right that we need a balanced approach and that we need proper domestic effort to deal with these issues.

 I will. I know from our discussions that the right hon. Gentleman is a sceptic about some of our climate change targets. It is of course the case that the targets in the Bill will be judicially reviewable. It is also the case that there are limits to the actions that can be taken against Governments. However, the important point is that when the House set out its general cross-party consensus on long-term targets, it was a way of binding the hands of Ministers in this Government and Ministers in future Governments. No Parliament can completely bind the hands of the next Parliament, but this was an important innovation because it set out so clearly&#151;in a cross-party consensus&#151;the objectives that Ministers needed to follow to meet the targets.</p>

 On prepayment meters, Ofgem has given the companies until December to respond to that point and we have indicated that if the companies fail to respond adequately, we are prepared to legislate. On gas prices, the gas companies say that they buy their gas sometimes up to about six months ahead on the advance markets and, therefore, it takes time for the gas price reductions&#151;the last time I looked they had fallen by about 22 per cent.&#151;to come through into gas bills.

 I was grateful to the Secretary of State for the opportunity to discuss with him my Committee&#146;s report on fuel prices that was published in July, which proved that increased prices were the fault not of the companies but of the market. We are addressing market failure. Since we published that report, there has been a significant deterioration in market conditions. BizzEnergy, an electricity supplier in my constituency, has gone bust, with 160 jobs lost. The Government are allowing British Energy to be bought by EDF.

social tariffs. There is an argument for greater standardisation of social tariffs, and I have some sympathy with it, but the companies take a view, as, indeed, Ofgem does, that there is a market and this is one of the areas where they need to compete. Some 600,000 people are able to access these lower social tariffs, and I want to put more people on them so that they pay lower prices. That is why the Pensions Bill contains a provision to allow data sharing by the Department for Work and Pensions to enable the energy companies to know which people are on pension credit&#151;in due course we would want to extend that further&#151;so that they can be put on a social tariff, as I hope would happen.</p>

I look to those other energy companies to follow its example and start to say when some prices will come down. Parliament has said that it wants an independent regulator, which Ofgem is, so Ministers cannot keep telling the regulator what it has to do, because it is supposed to be independent.

 All the way through the early part of this decade, we have had much lower gas prices than most of the continent, because the market was able to operate very effectively to ensure that prices fell. Europe operates using a different system. It operates long-term and often not very transparent deals, particularly in the business sector. Deals that can last for some years are signed, holding down some of those prices. When our market falls and we get the benefits, Europe does not. When the market starts to rise and our prices rise, it takes some time before Europe renegotiates some of its long-term contracts. We are pressing, with the EU Commission, to get more transparency into some of those deals and to get a more effective market operating in Europe. We want to ensure that we all get the benefit of a more successful and competitive market, because we all want to pay the lowest price that we reasonably can.</p>

 We are already looking at the market for heating oil, which does cause me some concern. We want to ensure that it operates efficiently and effectively. The market for coal is now much more international&#151;and certainly more European&#151;than regional, and that affects the price. Some 90 per cent. of the coal supplied in the UK goes to the power stations, so very small amounts go to domestic use. My hon. Friend is right to say that many people are worried, especially in former mining constituencies such as mine, where people receive and use free coal. Others choose to use coal and therefore have to pay the price, and we want to ensure that they are not overcharged.</p>

Lady is right to say that there is a short-term problem with the accumulation of recyclables  <br>

because of the economic downturn, but we expect that to be dealt with over time. This is not the time for us to begin to discontinue our recycling effort&#151;we must recycle because that saves new resources being used. She is right that getting energy from waste can be one of the solutions to recycling, but it is not the only one. We still need plants that recycle waste and the new developments in recycling plants, especially for plastics, will help to resolve some of the problems.</p>

 The answer to the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s first question is clear: actually, our prices are lower than the EU average for the individual consumer. Historically, that has been the case. As was said by my hon. and learned Friend the Minister of State, we are more subject to ups and downs in the market price. If the right hon. Gentleman does not like the market system that was introduced in the 1980s and 1990s, he can say so, but the most important thing that we can do, given the system that we have, is first to look at the system to make sure that it is the right one&#151;we will do that&#151;and secondly to put all necessary pressure on the energy companies to lower their prices.

 My hon. and learned Friend the Minister of State and I recently attended a reception where there was a demonstration of technology that can be retrofitted to coal-fired power stations to reduce their CO2 emissions by 50 per cent. That would enable coal-fired power stations to be kept in use after 2015, and will reduce our carbon emissions greatly. The technology was developed by British Coal, and it was called the topping cycle at the time. Incidentally,  <br>

One of the ideas brought forward was the one that we discussed the other day. I very much hope that the energy companies will look into such new projects, and run them alongside carbon capture and storage, so that we can ensure a future for clean-coal technology. We know that the Opposition&#151;the Conservatives, at least&#151;take the view that coal does not really have a role unless new technology is delivered in exactly the way that they want. We say that there is a range of ideas out there, and we want to see those ideas develop.

We take a less dogmatic position; we ask how quickly we can ensure that carbon capture and storage can be attached to coal-fired power stations. That is what we are considering at the moment.</p>

 I am glad that the hon.

Of course, we will keep this under regular review, but the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, admirably chaired by the right hon.

 Following the reply by the Deputy Leader of the House to the previous question, and given that the volume of secondary legislation is so vast&#151;some 12,000 pages in 2006&#151;is it not time to undertake a proper review to allow greater scrutiny at the secondary legislation stage?

 If the Deputy Leader of the House truly means what he says about timetabling, will he and the Leader of the House take a little time during the Prorogation to consider establishing a proper business Committee composed of senior Back Benchers who would determine the allocation of the House&#146;s time?</p>

 No, I will not. The hon. Gentleman knows that perfectly well, which is why he is sitting down with a great big smile all over his face. If there were to be a business Committee, I am sure that he, as one of the most senior Members of the House, would sit on it. I know that other Conservative Members also think that there should be one. However, to suggest that there should be such a Committee shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how the House operates. The only reason why we are the Government is that we have a majority in the House. That arrangement is very different from that in the United States of America, where the Executive are separate from the legislature.</p>

 I am grateful to the Deputy Leader of the House for confirming his previous answer. As he will know, the second of the new Welsh legislative competence orders went through Committee yesterday, and many more are expected. Given that those are important constitutional instruments conferring primary powers on the Welsh Assembly, how content is he that the only opportunity for debate of those measures is for one and a half hours in Committee? What consideration would he give, in certain cases at least, to extending such debates to the Floor of the House?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is not quite right to say that those instruments are considered only in Committee sittings of one and a half hours; they also undergo pre-legislative scrutiny through the Welsh Affairs Committee. I want to pay tribute to the members of that Committee, particularly to its Chairman, my hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon (Dr. Francis); the Committee is taking on a significant new burden and a large number of legislative competence orders are now coming through from the Welsh Assembly. Some come from members of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party who have recommended them as effectively being private Members&#146; Bills from Wales, and some come in other ways. However, it is early days, and we want to keep the process under review.</p>

The reality is that we spent two hours discussing the timing&#151;two hours of concern about the length of time given for debate. An amendment could have been tabled to our programme motion, which we laid before the House seven days before the matter was debated. If a proposal for an extra hour&#146;s debate on regional Committees had been introduced by the Opposition, or from those on our Back Benches, it stands to reason that we would have accepted it. They could have done that, instead of our spending two hours discussing timing. I have learned that the Opposition perhaps need to be encouraged to table amendments, rather than fulminate for two hours when they have failed to do so. That is what I have learned, and I would ask what the right hon. Lady has learned. We are all clearly in a learning environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="81113-0004.htm_para20"><a name="08111373000185">The right hon. Lady asked about world gender equality, and mentioned the equality Bill. I am grateful that she will actively support that Bill when it is introduced after it is announced in the Queen&#146;s Speech. She also said something rather curious about my having allegedly been &#147;sidelined&#148; on equality, which shows a misunderstanding of the movement for women&#146;s equality. I do not own that movement, so it is not a question of my being sidelined. We should have more women Ministers, more women Members of Parliament, and more action taken by women in voluntary organisations throughout the country; that is not a question of being sidelined, but of the agenda being mainstreamed. I have overall responsibility for the equality Bill, and the Solicitor-General will lead the Bill through the House, just as the Attorney-General took the lead in the House of Lords on the Counter-Terrorism Bill. The Law Officers are able not only to give advice to the Government but to lead Bills through the House, and the Solicitor-General will do an excellent job. She will have my full support.</p>

There were 60 occasions when the family and the baby were seen by social workers, police and health professionals, which is why everyone finds this case so particularly tragic. We all want to ensure that lessons are learned. Children, Schools and Families questions will take place on Monday.</p>

For any individual, in whatever circumstance, to lose their job is a matter of great concern. Many people worry not only when they will find their next job, but if they will lose their house in the meantime. That is why we are introducing extra help with mortgages and why we are putting extra investment into Jobcentre Plus, and into private and voluntary sector organisations that can help people to find their next job. In the summer, we had a record high number of 30 million jobs in the economy. In the last quarter, according to the available figures, there were still something like 600,000 vacancies in the economy. It is important  <br>

that we try, by stabilising the economy, recapitalising the banks, taking international action, introducing public sector projects and helping small businesses, to ensure that people do not lose their jobs. However, if people do lose their jobs, we must ensure that every bit of help possible is available to them.</p>

Lady&#146;s&#151;is the effect of the economic crisis on all aspects of life for businesses and families.

If Members have an opportunity to hold a Treasury Minister to account and make speeches, does it matter whether it is technically in Government time or in the debate after the Queen&#146;s Speech, which happens in Government time but for which the Opposition choose the subjects? It is important for the House to debate the economy, and for the public to see that we are doing so and holding Treasury Ministers to account. I will ensure that there is a continuous stream of statements and debates on the economy and that the House has plenty of opportunity to discuss it.</p>

Today we have a topical debate on combating obesity, which is important but not topical, given that there are such issues as the safety of young children, youth unemployment, general employment and the state of the economy to discuss. Those are huge matters, which are much more topical, by any definition, than combating obesity. May we please have a structure for discussing the subjects for topical debates before they are announced? Even if the Deputy Leader of the House, using false constitutional arguments, claims that the House should not have a general business Committee, will the Leader of the House consider whether we can have a business Committee that is representative of the parties of the House to examine topical debates? At least we could then learn whether that was a good precedent that could be applied more widely.</p>

However, it is nonsensical not to have a general debate about what the statement should contain, but simply to respond to it. I hazard a guess that the Chancellor will make some announcements that are intended to have effect before the Budget. I am sure that the Chancellor is not just going to tell us what his thoughts are for next year without wanting to do something now. Colleagues in the House ought to have an opportunity to debate that before Monday week. There is plenty of time next week, but if the Leader of the House can find no other way, may I ask that the topical debate next week, ahead of the pre-Budget report, be on the economy and be extended to the whole of Thursday?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raised the defeat in one of the votes yesterday. That was because the vote was on House business and was therefore on a free vote. That is the way of the world. When there is a whipped vote, we expect to win but do not always do so; when there is an unwhipped vote, we hope to win but do not always succeed. That is the way of things. It is rather odd that the hon. Gentleman is complaining that our position was defeated on an unwhipped vote. That should prove to him that there was a free vote.

I hope that in that period even those who voted against the proposal will put themselves forward to join the Committees and make them work.

The problem with having an economic debate immediately before the pre-Budget report is that if it is just a few days before the Monday of the pre-Budget report, the Chancellor will not be able to say a great deal in that debate. The reason the Government introduced the pre-Budget report was that previously we had just the Budget in March&#151;the announcement was made and that was it. This Government introduced the pre-Budget report, which was an innovation, so that the Chancellor could announce what would be in the Budget and make any necessary interim announcements. However, I hear the hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestion for a topical debate on the economy. Bearing in mind what other hon. Members have said, let me assure him that we always keep our mind open to whether there should be a topical debate on the economy, irrespective of the upcoming pre-Budget report.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for raising that issue. Along with our hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), she has been a champion for the protection of leaseholders. Many people bought former council properties, but then, with the big investment in council estates following the decent homes programme, those on modest or low incomes, including retired people, were clobbered with bills of up to &#163;40,000. While house prices were rising, it was possible for those people to have a charge taken on their homes, so that they would not have to stump up the cash immediately.

 As we move into this recession, we have seen unemployment rise massively in the past three months, and forecasts for the future are pretty gloomy.

Edinburgh and Lothian Members, including the Chancellor, are conscious of that, and MPs in the Halifax area are also aware of the concerns in their constituencies. May we have a debate, in Government time, so that the Government can justify their continued support for the shotgun merger of Lloyds TSB and HBOS, and the potential loss of jobs, and to hear the arguments from both sides of the House?

That is why the Chancellor has made it clear that he will do whatever it takes to stabilise and protect all existing financial services organisations, including taking over Northern Rock and the action that we have taken on Bradford &amp; Bingley.

One point that was made forcefully to us was that labour organisations and unions in this country are so much more ahead and part of the debate than they are in the United States.

 This is going to sound very trivial, but it is actually quite important to our landscape and countryside. May we have a debate on conkers or, perhaps more properly, on invasive pathogens on native British trees? Horse chestnuts are being assailed by Phytophthora, leaf miner caterpillar and, most seriously of all, by Pseudomonas syringae&#151;a new and very aggressive disease, which has affected possibly 50 to 75 per cent. of the native horse chestnut population. We do not want to see the same sort of depredation that happened to elms as a result of Dutch elm disease, so may we have a debate to discuss what can be done?</p>

 Just as elms were part of and defined the landscape of England, Wales and Scotland, so, too, do horse chestnuts after the demise of those elms. The hon. Gentleman raises a very important point. It is partly to do with viruses and partly to do with the effect of climate change. Indeed, this is just one manifestation of climate change, which is why we must step up all-party action on it, both nationally and internationally.</p>

 For the best part of 40 years, since the Government of Harold Wilson established the excellent Girobank, the Post Office has been involved in one way or another with banking services. In view of last week&#146;s interesting suggestion by Lord Mandelson about a possible future role for the Post Office in banking services, and regardless of what our right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions says in his statement at 12.30, does the Leader of the House agree that the credit crunch has completely transformed the debate about the future of the Post Office? Once we have absorbed what our right hon.

 My hon. Friend is right that the credit crunch has provided an imperative to think afresh about the delivery of financial services.

I myself do not call for Governments to compensate in the absence of fault, nor are Governments the guarantors of last resort; but the House must have an opportunity to explore whether or not the Government were at fault.

 There is no lessening of the work done by not only the Metropolitan police, but police authorities throughout the country, to deal with the trafficking of young girls.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall make a statement on the future of the Post Office card account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="81113-0006.htm_para5"><a name="08111373000268">The Government created the Post Office card account in 2003. We announced that there would be a successor in 2006. On the basis of the legal advice that we received at the time, we put the contract out to tender. During that process, I have been unable to comment publicly or privately on the matter. I know that that has been frustrating for hon. Members, and I thank them for their patience and understanding. <i> [Laughter.]</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="81113-0006.htm_para6"><a name="08111373000269">I also know that all hon. Members would agree that the Post Office is at the heart of their communities. It reaches the places and people that no one else reaches. That is why the Government have invested &#163;2 billion in the Post Office since 1997; why we have, for the first time, set out access criteria to preserve its reach; and why we will invest another &#163;1.7 billion between now and 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="81113-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08111373000270">There is no doubt that the Post Office card account is central to maintaining a viable post office network. It not only generates a key part of the Post Office&#146;s income, but brings with it a footfall that is vital to individual sub-postmasters. Post Office card account customers have shown how much they value the service through the postcard campaign that has resulted in large postbags for hon. Members over the last few months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="81113-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08111373000271">It is also clear that maintaining a viable Post Office network is even more critical now than it was two years ago. The financial turbulence that began in America and the string of consequences that followed it have understandably made many people, particularly the most vulnerable in our society, more concerned about financial transactions. The Post Office, with its trusted brand, is seen as safe, secure and reliable as a provider of financial services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="81113-0006.htm_para9"><a name="08111373000272">So I believe that now cannot be the time for the Government to do anything that would put that network at risk, particularly as post offices are often the only providers of banking services in both rural and deprived urban areas. The Post Office also has a proven record of being able to move billions of pounds in cash safely around the country and prides itself on meeting the needs of vulnerable customers. Sub-postmasters know their customers and provide a social service as well as a banking service. Delivering this vital social service for groups in our communities who need it most is not only an objective of the Post Office. It is an objective that the Government share passionately as well. To safeguard that service, we must help and support a viable Post Office network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="81113-0006.htm_para10"><a name="08111373000273">For that reason, I can announce today that the Government have now decided to cancel the current unfinished procurement exercise and to award a new contract for the continuation of the Post Office card account directly to Post Office Ltd, within the terms of the relevant EC regulations. The contract will run initially from April 2010 to March 2015 with the possibility of an extension beyond that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="81113-0006.htm_para11"><a name="08111373000274">I recognise, of course, that this decision will disappoint those other bidders who had reached the final stage of the competition. I want to emphasise to the House, as I  <br>

have done to them personally, that my decision does not reflect in any way on their ability to have provided the services in question. Nor is it a step we have taken lightly. We recognise the importance of competition in the awarding of public contracts, but we have concluded that, in these circumstances, protecting vulnerable groups by preserving a viable Post Office network justifies the award of a contract outside the competitive process. These are exceptional times and we believe that this is a proper and proportionate response. The Post Office considers that this decision, along with the extra money invested by this Government, will ensure a commercially viable future for the post offices that will be in place after the modernisation and network change programme is complete.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="81113-0006.htm_para12"><a name="08111373000275">I said that I would make a decision as soon as I could. I said that I would not rush the decision. I said that what was important was that we made the right decision. I believe this is the right decision.

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="81113-0006.htm_para16"><a name="08111373000280">Is it not the case that the tender terms were a complete mess and opened up the award of the contract to great confusion? Can the Secretary of State confirm that the legal status of the decision is 100 per cent. watertight? Can he tell the House that there is no risk of or scope for any legal challenge from anybody who was not awarded the contract? What is his estimate of the revenue that Post Office branches will enjoy from this new contract compared with the one that currently exists? Is it not the case that the POCA is absolutely essential to some of the most vulnerable, and as unemployment rises&#151;in large part thanks to the Government&#146;s incompetence&#151;even through the 3 million mark, that POCA will become even more significant during the economic downturn?</p>

hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan). I should be grateful if the Secretary of State clarified why the Department decided to cancel the contracting exercise rather than award the contract to the Post Office. Does it mean that the terms of the tender would not have allowed the Department to award the contract to the Post Office? To enable us to make our own decision on that, will he release the specifications, the invitation to tender or negotiate, and the descriptive documents, which the Government have refused to release up to this point&#151;indeed, on Monday, he again said that he would not be able to release them. I would be grateful if he made them public now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="81113-0007.htm_para4"><a name="08111373000296">The Secretary of State said that he has decided to award a contract for the continuation of the POCA within the terms of the relevant EC regulations. If he can do that now, why could he not have done it before or why did he choose not to do so? I would be grateful if he clarified that point. The reasons that he gave for the decision relate to the current economic climate. What is it about that climate that means that the Government can now reconsider? This situation leads to the suspicion that as 1,500 jobs are being lost every day in the UK, he knew that the Government could not afford to close a further 3,000 post offices&#151;at least&#151;with all the accompanying job losses. Will he tell us exactly what has changed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="81113-0007.htm_para5"><a name="08111373000297">The Secretary of State also said that he believes that it is not the time to do anything to put the network at risk, particularly as post offices are often the only provider in rural and deprived urban areas&#151;that is what the Liberal Democrats have been saying for the past two years, as have a number of Labour Members. As that was the case when the Government decided to put this out to tender&#151;it remains the case&#151;what has brought him around to our way of thinking and to deciding that now the Post Office does need to be saved? Why did he think last week that it was okay to risk the only providers in those deprived areas, but that now it is not okay to do so?</p>

Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) said, the DWP has behaved appallingly so far on this matter; there has been delay after delay. This has been going on for nearly three years and the decision was 11 months overdue. That has caused huge stress for POCA customers, sub-postmasters and all who are concerned for their community facilities. Why has there been such a delay? It also raises issues about the cost of the process and the waste of money involved. Legal questions have already been posed about changing the competition rules halfway through the process, but this has been a waste of money not only for the bidders that did not receive the contract, but for the post offices and the Government. The Secretary of State has said that he will be providing compensation, but will he finally give us an estimate as to how much money has been wasted? Why is the amount of compensation considered to be commercially confidential? Nevertheless, I welcome today&#146;s announcement and the saving of post offices.</p>

the truth is that they were so confident of their way of thinking that they tabled a motion that was written by my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle). It was not their way of thinking at all, but that of Labour Members. We were glad to see the Liberal Democrats voting in support of his motion this week, but as we know, it had been overtaken by the changes that we had made in response to the lobbying and campaigning on behalf of their constituents carried out by my Labour colleagues.</p>

What has changed is that there has been a significant reduction in confidence about financial transactions, and people have turned to the Post Office because of its trusted brand. The Post Office provides a service that is not only a banking service, but a social service, and that becomes even more important when people are worried about financial circumstances. In the light of that, we commissioned legal advice, which has said that this is the right way for us to proceed. The truth is that for all the heat and bluster, everyone in this Chamber agrees that this is the right way forward.</p>

Lord Mandelson for it. Does the Secretary of State recognise that it comes against the background of a significant post office closure programme and that if there is constant attrition, it will not matter what services are offered because there will be no post offices to offer them? Will he ensure that the longer-term programme is based on a minimum level of post offices? If not, it simply will not be viable.</p>

 I believe that the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s Front-Bench spokesman said in March that he fully expected the network to shrink, and that is the reality that people recognise. It has been a difficult but necessary process that has put the Post Office in a viable position from which it can make progress. As I made clear in my statement, the Post Office believes that the decision will enable it to preserve a level of post office provision after the network change programme is completed.

 Yes, this is the right decision, but it was a waste of time and money to have the tender in the first place. The most important aspect of the Secretary of State&#146;s statement was about protecting vulnerable groups by preserving a viable post office network. That represents a sea change in Government thinking and is a welcome response to the poverty of imagination that has surrounded the future of that network. Given that the Secretary of State now recognises the vulnerability of many&#151;especially the elderly&#151;in these changed financial circumstances, is it not time to revisit the recent round of closures and allow some post offices that have been closed by the Government to make a new case?</p>

 It is not a sea change. What has changed is the approach taken by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Government, which the Chairman of the Select Committee outlined. That approach led to under-investment in the network in the 1990s. Money was taken out of the network then, but this Government have invested in it to ensure that it is viable. That is why we put in &#163;0.5 billion into the IT system, which has enabled post offices to expand their services&#151;for example, they are now the main provider of currency services. This Government introduced the POCA, and we have now awarded the contract to the Post Office. I wish that the hon. Gentleman had welcomed that.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right that we need to make opening an account as easy as possible. It is already easier than opening a bank account, but the new contract will make it even easier.

Will pensioners who have an account at present keep it automatically without having to go through a migration process? Also, will the right hon.

Bearing in mind that we are now taking a new, fresh, radical approach, would it be possible to spend just a fraction of the money spent on bailing out UK banks on post offices?

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="81113-0009.htm_para0"><a name="08111373000381">It was almost a year ago today that the foresight programme report served notice of the grave threat posed to health by obesity. That group of eminent scientists claimed that modern society had created an obesogenic environment, which, without radical action, would result in nine in 10 adults and two thirds of all children being overweight or obese by 2050. The prognosis is truly frightening. Within a generation, three in five cases of type 2 diabetes and a fifth of all heart disease cases will be caused by obesity, and for the first time in centuries we face the terrible spectre of some children living shorter lives than their parents unless we reverse current trends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="81113-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08111373000382">Yet the prescription, on paper at least, is simple: we all need to eat a little less and exercise a little more; we will then, hopefully, live a little longer. In practice, though, the challenge is rather more difficult. People live hectic lives. Time is at a premium, and so often, exercise or healthy food can be edged out by family commitments, work, a lack of good leisure facilities or a lack of shops that sell fresh food in the area. Fundamentally, making the big lifestyle changes is a question of access, opportunity and will. Those are the issues that we must address emphatically if we want to turn the tide on obesity. The Government have already taken important steps: for example, we have allocated &#163;65 million to NHS primary care trusts to help them to identify, monitor and support obese patients. We have updated the child health promotion programme and expanded the new family nurse partnership programme. In partnership with the children&#146;s plan introduced by the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, that will help to support the health and well-being of children and young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="81113-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08111373000383">Working with Ofcom, we have placed new restrictions on the broadcast advertising of unhealthy foods to children, and are continuing to work with industry on the healthy food code to reduce salt and fat content in manufactured foods. But&#151;and it is a big but&#151;changing behaviour is not something that we can do from the Department of Health, Whitehall or this House. We need a lifestyle revolution driven not from above but from below, and embracing all aspects of a person&#146;s life. That means that everyone&#151;schools, councils, local businesses, charities and community groups&#151;must play a role in helping people to make space for the little things that can make a big difference.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I know that he follows the issue closely. In debate, we have to consider how we engender changes in lifestyle, because we cannot force families or individuals to make those changes. We must consider what sort of partnerships we need to create and sustain to deliver that. I want to go on to give some examples, because he makes an important point. As I am sure he will agree, those changes include taking part in important campaigns such as the &#147;5 a day&#148; campaign, kicking a ball around with the children, ditching the car on the school run, and sharing family meal times, as he said.</p>

 Will my right hon. Friend turn, at some point, to the influence of commercialisation on food choices? Testing shows that even very young children are influenced by brands.

 The Minister is indeed generous, and is making some powerful points. She spoke about the need to encourage a change in lifestyle, but does she accept that we must ensure that when young people leave school they know how to cook? One of the greatest failings at the moment stems from the fact that people buy pre-cooked food because they do not know how to cook. Changing that would not only be cheaper but healthier.</p>

 I certainly agree, and each intervention has touched on the fact that there is not one, simple solution to the problem; it is about what we eat, where we eat, how the food is prepared, what our knowledge is, opportunities to exercise, the way we arrange our lives, and about making choices. The role of government is to create partnerships, offer choices, and provide information, then support individuals as they seek to make those choices. That is our strategy, and it means anything from improving parks to building more cycle routes; cookery classes in school; encouraging children to do more sport; and working with employers and retailers to make it easier and more practical for people to take more exercise and eat more healthily. What the Government are being told is that people understand what the choices are and want the opportunity to act on what they know, and that is what we have to provide.</p>

 I thank my right hon. Friend for her generosity in giving way. She will be aware of initiatives in Bristol such as the &#147;Thank you for not driving&#148; campaign, which aims to tackle the school run, and the healthy schools initiative. The other day, I presented an award to St Anne&#146;s infants school, which has received a healthy schools certificate. Does she agree that children have a role to play as ambassadors to try to encourage their parents to adopt a healthier lifestyle?</p>

 I certainly agree with my hon. Friend. As a constituency neighbour of hers, I know that Bristol is a cycling city: it is undertaking the &#147;active Bristol&#148; programme and considering how it can improve its parks, provide family-centred facilities and safe corridors for family activities, so that children can undertake that exercise. It is a small step, if the House will forgive the pun, and it also enables children to set an example to their parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="81113-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08111373000395">Of course it is about money, and the Government have invested in such programmes, but it is also about creating a movement. At the centre of what we are doing is the Change4Life movement, which is a huge coalition for better health that brings together many different initiatives under one banner. Returning to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) made, before I received notice of this debate I was supposed to be in Newcastle for the first Change4Life partnership with local convenience stores, which will help to break a simple barrier to good health: the fact, that in some parts of the country, local shops simply do not stock fresh fruit and veg. The project is about making that easier, by supporting retailers and working with them. The first step is the launch of 12 development stores, which will be provided with funding, so that they can offer such opportunities. By May next year, it is hoped that there will be 120 such stores across the north-east. Assuming that the scheme is successful, it will be rolled out across the country. We have every reason to believe that it will be successful, because similar projects have worked in Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="81113-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08111373000396">This is not just one issue&#151;we have to look at wider considerations and say which organisations and agencies must come together to develop and support a wide range of initiatives at community level. What is happening in the north-east is mirrored across England. The coalition is impressive, and 12,000 grassroots organisations are involved in Change4Life, working with leading charities and big high-street names such as Asda, Tesco, Kellogg&#146;s and PepsiCo. It is about breakfast clubs, sponsoring sport and making sure that people can make those changes to their lifestyle. Fittingly, a year on from the foresight report, this week we have announced the nine areas chosen to become &#147;healthy towns&#148;, receiving a share of &#163;30 million to pioneer approaches that will enhance choices for their local communities and their ability to live a healthy life.

people with free activities or healthy food when they visit the gym or take exercise. Tower Hamlets is running a scheme to persuade shops and restaurants on the main road to the Olympic park to push healthier options. In Tewkesbury, people are developing an urban garden programme which will help residents to keep fit, rebuild green space in the wake of last year&#146;s floods, and make sure that they have access to such opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="81113-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08111373000397">We must celebrate and encourage that diversity of approach, because obesity is not confined to one social group or area, and we know it is exacerbated by poverty. That also means getting the message across that Change4Life is for everyone: children, busy parents, health professionals, and even hon. Members and, dare I say, Ministers of State. We all need to get involved because we can all benefit. In challenging economic times, when family budgets are under pressure, we must spell out the message that healthy eating does not have to be expensive. In fact, as the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara) said, healthy home-cooked food is often considerably cheaper than a takeaway burger or pizza.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="81113-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08111373000398">This is not about interfering in people&#146;s lives, or about creating a nanny state, but we are not prepared to neglect the issues that face us, or hide behind vague notions of nudging people to better health. Quite simply, the cost of inaction and neglect is too great. It is the human cost of 9,000 premature deaths a year because of obesity. It is the increasing economic damage from the causes of rising chronic disease, and it is the cost to our society, rising to &#163;50 billion a year within two generations, if we do not tackle the problem. In the face of those dangers, we need concrete action, not platitudes. Our obesity strategy is a comprehensive, proactive agenda for change, delivered for communities, by local communities, in local communities. I am confident that that will help our nation to shed the pounds, and give us all the chance to lead healthier and more enjoyable lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para0"><a name="08111373000402">We have already mentioned the industrialisation of food production: the ready, microwaveable meal, fast-food production and the decline in home cooking and home food production, which is coupled with the inevitable but contrary rise in the purchase of cook books&#151;regularly bought but invariably not used very much. Further to that, there is the habit, as alluded to in one intervention, of people not eating as families but engaging in activities known as foraging and snacking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08111373000403">Then there is physical activity and the end of playing out, which used to be such a simple thing. Children would play out in the street in which they lived or in the neighbouring street, but in many cases that is now seen by neighbours as a social nuisance or a threat, and by parents as a personal hazard or social danger, so it does not happen a great deal. If we add to that the reduction in school sports, as extra-curricular activity is squeezed by the need to get good results, we have an increasingly inactive youth population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08111373000404">Even things as praiseworthy as the Disability Discrimination Acts, which are intended to serve the needs of the disabled, have led to a plethora of lifts, so that able-bodied and overweight people need to go neither up nor down stairs. I am slightly amazed and appalled&#151;the puritan in me is coming out&#151;when I see people in this place who are clearly overweight but take a lift to go one floor down. I feel like commenting, but I restrain myself, and perhaps it is just as well. It does happen, however. We can add to that another social problem, which is the increase in social drinking, because drink, believe it or not, contains calories, and it gives society a huge additional headache.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08111373000405">Some individuals&#151;we do notice them&#151;counteract those factors by efforts of will: they jog in their lunchtime, although jogging along the banks of the River Thames has almost become in itself a social nuisance; and some go to gyms in the evening. But I do not think that anybody can be anything other than fatalistic about relying on heroic acts of individual will, and if we considered more mundane things such as the slimming industry and its value for money, we would arrive at some pretty grim conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08111373000406">Science offers some, albeit limited, hope. We will understand more about metabolic rates and the tendency of some people to put on weight and others to do so to a lesser extent, and we will get better at identifying risks and diagnosing the physiological and psychological factors in eating and overeating. However, at the end of the day, as the Minister suggested, the cultural changes are sizeable and we might genuinely question whether any Government have the tools to address them because, as we all know, the fundamental problem is that too much of the wrong food is eaten and too little physical activity is undertaken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para5"><a name="08111373000407">My analysis is that the population once stayed fit through what I call inertial factors, that it got fat through inertial factors&#151;it was not a question of people deliberately deciding to behave differently&#151;and that we can only really solve the problem through inertial factors. We can solve it only by creating a climate in which people stay thin&#151;a non-obesogenic environment.</p>

welcome the educational programmes and the recent more long-term thinking about school dinners and the disastrous effect&#151;I observed this in the past as a teacher&#151;that unguided choice in developing dietary preferences has had. I have seen children walk past salad bars and all sorts of healthy eating options only to go for the pizza and the chips, and the next day do exactly the same&#151;and the day after that as well. However, I worry that if we concentrate too much on children&#146;s eating habits and mishandle the issue, we may aggravate eating disorders among children and adolescents, and we want to do nothing of the sort.</p>

 This is an interesting debate that contrasts several modern dilemmas. First, we must recognise that we in this country have the luxury of debating obesity. Most of us have the opportunity to travel around the world, and we go to many places where obesity is not an issue at all, so we should always remind ourselves that in the western, developed world, the subject of the debate might be termed a luxury.</p>

<p><a name="st_o263"><a name="08111373000414"><a name="81113-0010.htm_spnew4"><a name="08111373001211"><b>Dawn Primarolo:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is looking at the whole question of obesity, but by way of information, India, for instance, has the two extremes in one nation: obesity and those who do not have enough. Regrettably, obesity is not just a European or north American challenge.</p>

<p><a name="st_o264"><a name="08111373000415"><a name="81113-0010.htm_spnew5"><a name="08111373001212"><b>Alistair Burt:</b>
 I take the Minister&#146;s point, but India is a developing society and it counts itself as one. If we went to parts of Africa, we would not find that the issue was handled in the same way. I take the Minister&#146;s point that obesity affects all nations that have reached a certain status, but, for us, it is a slight luxury to be dealt with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08111373000416">We have the dilemma of being an information-based society&#151;there is no shortage of information about health, diet and everything else&#151;that takes no notice. It is not a class issue, but the problems are concentrated among the poorest. We have another dilemma whereby the Government do not want to lecture, or to finger-wag, as the Secretary of State said when he launched &#147;Change for Life&#148;, but they have to pick up the very substantial bill for a nation that neglects the issue of obesity. The debate is interesting because, as several contributors have said, there is a limit to what we can do about it. However, talking about the issue and raising it is what we do, and it is very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08111373000417">I shall concentrate on four points. First, I shall return to the international situation. More than 923 million&#151;perhaps 1 billion&#151;people in the world are hungry.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="13 Nov 2008">

<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column 990</b><br>
Every day 16,000 children die from hunger-related causes, and every year more than 20 million low-birth-weight babies are born in developing countries, where they risk dying in infancy or growing up with various diseases. If food was left on the side of the plate in Victorian times, the mother or father would pronounce to the child the maxim, &#147;This is needed in some other part of the world. If you were living somewhere else, they would want it.&#148; Well, we cannot all do that, and it does not quite translate in the same way, but it should be an issue in this country, and people should be reminded that, when compared with other places, the luxury of food in this country means that perhaps the imperative that we take what we want, but eat what we take, actually matters. There is no harm in introducing that point to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08111373000418">Secondly, on the Government&#146;s role in the provision of information, there is no shortage of information about what obesity means and what we might be able to do about it. Obesity is a contributory risk factor in many chronic diseases: heart disease, stroke, some cancers, type 2 diabetes and so many other things. Obesity and lack of physical activity are risk factors in several major cancers, and, in addition, obese people are more likely to suffer from a number of psychological problems, such as low self-image, lack of confidence, social stigma, reduced mobility and an overall poorer quality of life. Despite all those documented risks, the prevalence of obesity in England more than trebled between 1980 and 2002, which is an extraordinary increase in such a short time. It went from 6 per cent. to 22 per cent. in men, and from 8 per cent. to 23 per cent. in women. The increased prevalence can also be seen in children aged two to 10. Between 1995 and 2003, levels of obesity among children rose from 9.9 per cent. to 13.7 per cent., and the combined overweight and obese levels rose from 22.7 per cent. to 27.7 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para11"><a name="08111373000419">In my own area of Bedfordshire, it is estimated that approximately one quarter of the adult population&#151;some 83,000 people&#151;are obese. An additional 40 per cent. of men and 30 per cent. of women there are overweight; perhaps 128,000 people there are at an increased health risk. If trends continue, by 2010 94,000 adults in Bedfordshire will be obese. That is an extraordinary number. The sheer number of obese and overweight people from my area would fill Wembley stadium to bursting point. The national costs of obesity are huge. The Health Committee has estimated them at between &#163;3.5 billion and &#163;4 billion a year; if the overweight are included, the figure rises to between &#163;6.6 billion and &#163;7.4 billion a year. Between 1998 and 2004, there was a seventeenfold increase in the drugs used to treat obesity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08111373000420">We know the figures, but the lack of interest is remarkable. The Library put together an excellent debate pack. I was struck by Department of Health survey statistics that revealed that just 11.5 per cent. of those with children who are overweight or obese recognise the fact. Only 38 per cent. of adults know that obesity could lead to heart disease, and only 6 per cent. of adults recognise the links between cancer and being obese or overweight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08111373000421">I suspect that there is a frustration on both sides of the House that so little is done about the information, despite all our efforts and the fact that it is well known.

targets and in aiming for weight reduction, particularly among children. By 2020, their target is to reduce the proportion of obese and overweight children to the levels of the year 2000. They recognise that, sadly, there is only so much to be done with adults, but that as much as possible must be done with children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08111373000422">There is a limit to the responsibility of the Government and local government. The provision of information is one aspect of their responsibility and the promotion of active and healthy lifestyles is another. The completion of various cycle ways has made a lot of difference in Bedfordshire. Furthermore, we have schools that are devoted to fitness and healthy food and GPs have joined in the PCT&#146;s targets. I should like to refer to two or three particular things that might make a difference. First, we should emphasise fitness rather than only attacking weight. The hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) was coming to this point, before his remarks concluded; I sense the direction in which he was going, and perhaps I complete the point that he was going to make. Sadly, due to the nation&#146;s obsession with celebrity and how people look, attacking weight is leading to its own problems, as youngsters get caught up with eating disorders and the like. I was struck by a couple of comments in the Library briefing. At a recent British Dietetic Association conference, Claire Mellors, a dietician, said:</p>
<a name="81113-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="08111373000875"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a real fear of obesity is an emerging and worrying trend...From my clinical experience I would say that as healthy living messages have become more prevalent, there has been a corresponding rise in referrals for children with disordered eating&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para15"><a name="08111373000423">Andrew Hill, a medical psychologist at the university of Leeds, has said:</p>
<a name="81113-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="08111373000876"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is vital that children develop an understanding of why exercise is important. There are risks of inactivity that they do need to know about. But why does it always have to be hung on a peg of obesity? They should grow up enjoying activity, not doing it because it makes them thin.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08111373000424">We have to be careful in balancing the messages and making sure that they get out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08111373000425">Secondly, we have to be prepared to speak out firmly. I noted the point made by the Secretary of State in introducing Change4Life&#151;that it was not about finger wagging and lecturing. However, on some occasions we are entitled to do that. We are all picking up the bill for obesity, and in some cases people can do something about their condition themselves. We must not move completely away from a sense that the issue is about personal responsibility, as well as about providing opportunities for food, exercise, dieting and everything else. If we continue to produce excuses for everybody and say that it is not their fault, but all a cultural thing, we will not get to the necessary stage at which people accept their personal responsibility and do something about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para18"><a name="08111373000426">When Jamie Oliver came to give evidence to the House, he was more direct. He said that the issue was not about class or poverty because people had material goods coming out of their ears. The problem was that people had forgotten how to cook and could no longer be bothered to cook. He was very direct and critical, and said things that politicians should say equally clearly. I tell the Minister that she is entitled to wag her finger and tell people that they could do better.</p>

 I totally accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about individual responsibility, but commercial responsibility is also involved. Many of the food companies that are keen on labelling have retail outlets in which the only things people wanting a bag of crisps or bar of chocolate can buy are a grab bag or a very large bar. The companies know that; it is a sales strategy.</p>

<p><a name="st_o266"><a name="08111373000428"><a name="81113-0010.htm_spnew7"><a name="08111373001214"><b>Alistair Burt:</b>
 That is a fair point. Looking at the commercial practices of companies can lead to difficult issues. On the one hand, they sell goods that people like and enjoy and, in small measure, are good for us&#151;&#147;A little of what you fancy does you good,&#148; &#147;Moderation in all things,&#148; and so on. Yet when such things are taken to extremes, they cause the very problems that we are speaking about. In addition to the commercial responsibility, there is also the responsibility of individuals, not only when they buy for themselves, but when they buy for others. I want to encourage the Minister: occasionally, a bit of finger wagging may not be a bad thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08111373000429">The encouragement of cookery at school level is important, as the Minister knows because I have told her in the House about the kids&#146; cookery school that I have visited. It tries to provide opportunities for youngsters, particularly in poorer areas, to learn more about practical, basic cooking, which can make such a difference to diet and budget. I encourage her to do more on that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para20"><a name="08111373000430">My last point about finger wagging and lecturing relates to the fashion industry. As a bloke, I am not attracted to size-zero women. The determination to drive women to a particular size because of the notion that that will somehow make them more attractive to blokes and the world at large is misplaced. We love women of all different shapes and sizes. We love them not because of how they look or are dressed, but because of who they are&#151;their spirit, style, humour and everything about them. We do not need an industry to force women into a box. The fashion fascistas should be lectured on every possible occasion by those who say, &#147;Don&#146;t do it for us, because we&#146;re not interested.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para21"><a name="08111373000431">Finally, I turn to the issue of sport and fitness. I belong to Biggleswade athletic club and I commend all those who work and provide coaching in various youth and sporting organisations. I am also president of the sea cadets in Biggleswade and I know that all youth organisations do so much to encourage physical activity, not only for its own sake but for a sense of the fitness and discipline that go with it. As new houses make the populations of areas such as mine larger, having in place a decent leisure strategy for the growing numbers of people becomes essential. They will need to use facilities that are often undervalued and overrun.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para22"><a name="08111373000432">I pay particular tribute to Phil Dean, who died last week. He was the motivator behind the recent success of the Biggleswade swimming club and a remarkable man whose very nature, spirit and style said much about the area he came from and his personal determination to see youngsters have the chance to be fit and have opportunities for swimming and fitness in my area. He was a giant of a bloke and will be sadly missed by his family and all those who knew him. However, there are many Phil Deans who work hard as youth coaches and motivators, and we need to encourage them all. We need to help volunteering, including in sport, and encourage our youngsters to be fit, rather than just to lose weight.  <br>

 I listened carefully to the Minister of State, and I suppose that there was very little that I, or indeed anyone in the House, could disagree with. However, I am disappointed by the degree of seriousness that the Government attach to the subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para23"><a name="08111373000434">Those of us who become Members of Parliament do not, presumably, come here just to time-serve but to try to achieve something. For instance, when I was proud to pilot through the House the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000, which tasked the Government with eliminating fuel poverty, I thought: &#147;Fantastic! Everyone is going to be warm in their homes and fuel poverty will be eliminated.&#148; I then found out&#151;although there has been no publicity for this&#151;that the Government took the definition of &#147;eradicate&#148; in the Act to a court of law, where its terms have been overturned despite our discussions and arguments in Committee.</p>

Of course, I would say that, because it was my idea to have the inquiry. We worked as a team under our excellent then-Chairman, David Hinchliffe, together with the current Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, who was then a member of the Committee, and my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns), who was one of the leading lights in our inquiries. The reality is that the Health Committee triggered the national and international debate on obesity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para25"><a name="08111373000436">I say that I am disappointed with the Government&#146;s response so far because, as a Conservative, I am not into gesture politics. I said to my colleagues at the time that, as a nation, we need to be serious about obesity. Perhaps we are not serious and we want to fatten everyone up&#151;if so, we are succeeding. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) said, the excellent briefing from the Library shows that of the OECD countries, Britain is second to America in the extent of obesity, and rapidly catching up. It is costing this nation &#163;3.7 billion a year to treat people with ailments caused by obesity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para30"><a name="08111373000441">So where do we stand now? The Government have recently made two announcements, which, as ever, caught the headlines. The first concerned tackling childhood obesity. We had a great opportunity to do that when our report was published four years ago. Much as I applaud the fact that the four supermarkets are going to work together to tackle childhood obesity, I want to hear a little more from the Minister to convince me that this is not gesture politics and that there will be a sustained follow-up to that announcement. Then we had the healthy towns initiative. Will the Minister explain how those towns were chosen? Were they invited to bid? Do I need to tell off my own town of Southend for failing to put in a bid? It is a great idea, but are these pilot schemes, and how will the Minister decide whether they have been a success?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="81113-0010.htm_para31"><a name="08111373000442">We drew a number of conclusions in our report, saying finally:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08111373000444">On one of the Committee&#146;s trips, we went to America, where we met people from all the big names in the food and drink industry. McDonald&#146;s, Nestl&#233;, Coca Cola&#151;you name it, we met them. To a woman and to a man, they were in total denial that the responsibility was theirs. All they wanted to emphasise was physical activity. I do not want any of my colleagues to boo from a sedentary position, but I am an unashamed enthusiast for the Olympic games. The Minister for the Olympics is reported to have said at a dinner earlier this week that if we had known then what we know now, perhaps we would not have bid for them, but I am delighted that we are going to have them, because there will be a sustained focus on physical activity. We debated the legacy a couple of weeks ago. I hope that the physical activity will not end with the closing ceremony and that people will continue to run, jump, swim, dance and all the rest of it. That is splendid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08111373000445">We do not die if we do not take physical exercise, but we do if we do not drink and eat. The nature of the human beast is that we are all sinners. We all like to drink and we all like food. We like our taste buds to be triggered in some way or other. The key is to get the food and drink industry to take seriously the fat, salt and sugar content of the things that we eat and drink. In trying to get the supermarkets to agree on what we recommended in terms of traffic light labelling, we have ended with a shambles. It is no good having two systems&#151;we are all very busy, and when we go round the supermarket the additives have to be clearly identified. I go back to what I said to Melanie Johnson during the inquiry.</p>

want them to assure me that obesity is at the top of their health agenda, because I am not convinced that it is. There are no quick fixes, but what we have are all the gestures that the Government participate in, seemingly every six months or in a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08111373000447">When the Select Committee visited a town in Europe, however, we saw a fantastic project&#151;no motor vehicles were allowed in the town, and everyone was riding a bike. I suppose that it was a little bit like Cambridge. Since the publication of our report, I see no evidence that the Government have set any sustained target for wider involvement of the public. We had the BBC&#146;s &#147;Fat Nation&#148; for a while, but we seem to be going in and out of the process of involvement.</p>

 It is important to give every opportunity to people to take responsibility for their own health, but we must also be cognisant of the important issue of stigma. It is very much the Government&#146;s approach to ensure that no stigma is applied to the obese in initiatives to combat obesity. It is important that we recognise that many people suffer from obesity for reasons of genetics or metabolism rather than greed. It is not acceptable for us to take the approach of bullying the school fatty, or for society to hold a view that implies that obesity means slowness of gait, or of wit or mind. Recently, I was the subject of criticism by the Sri Lankan Government because I took an interest in the peace process in that benighted isle. They made many criticisms of me, but one&#151;that I was fat&#151;may well have some truth. That is a sign that accusations concerning size are a matter of stigma, attack and derision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08111373000450">More seriously, I would like to speak from personal experience about the important dovetailing of the issues of obesity and mental ill health. I went through a period of mental ill health that coincided with significant changes in weight between 72 kg and 104 kg, which is a range of 44 per cent. I had an illness, followed by purposeful use of antidepressants to improve on my lowered weight, but we must recognise that antidepressants have an unintended effect on the weight of many of those taking them, which can have a significant effect on their willingness to continue to take them. One of the most significant reasons for non-compliance in the taking of important antidepressants is unintended weight loss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08111373000451">The Government have been supportive in their provision of additional resources for mental ill health, and in my locality, we benefit greatly from the South London and Maudsley trust, which is an excellent, world-beating provider in the area of mental health. Nevertheless, there is a lack of sufficient resources to provide the counselling, advice and therapy for those with mental ill health, and for those who might need such support   <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08111373000452">I would like to mention briefly the way in which combating obesity links to diabetes. My local primary care trust in Croydon has undertaken important initiatives in that area, but I still believe that additional steps could be taken to identify a number of different causes and symptoms of diabetes. It is a particular curse for the large south Asian community in my constituency, and it is most appropriate that we are debating this issue just ahead of world diabetes day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08111373000453">Another important link between this subject and ill health is eating disorders, which have already been referred to by other Members. They particularly affect young ladies, who can be oppressed by social and peer pressures. I was impressed by the work done by the Greater London authority. Dee Doocey, who is a Liberal Democrat Member of the London Assembly, and Boris Johnson have considered the matter, and asked whether funding should continue for London fashion week when there is such an obsession with size zero models. Such models put pressure on many young girls and young ladies to believe that they are fat or obese when that can hardly be the case. It is fair to say that I have some doubts about my ability to be a judge in the &#147;Miss Croydon Advertiser&#148; contest that will be taking place this evening at House of Fraser in Croydon, but the good news about that contest is that it is about the style, poise, intelligence and attitude of real people. I know who the finalists are, and they are between sizes eight and 12. It is good to see that people recognise that there is beauty to be found in young people of all sizes, and in all of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08111373000454">I would like to touch briefly on the comments made by the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) about the important role of food companies, particularly as there is a great temptation in times of great economic stringency for people to buy cheaply, but wrongly&#151;to buy food that might not be nourishing, but which is more likely to add to their obesity. Despite the rather ill-judged reputation that one company in Croydon has, I am pleased to say that Nestl&#233; UK takes a responsible attitude by ensuring that it sells good food to its customers. It is a very good Croydon company.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08111373000455">We often make fun of ourselves and the Government by mocking the cross-cutting approach taken across Departments to deal with important social issues. It is ambitious of the Government to pursue proper co-ordination among Departments and between different public sector bodies. It is therefore important to see how the annual report will bear out matters next year in its measurement of providing the most effective co-ordination between Departments, and to extent to which it has been possible to inculcate an absorption policy in local authorities and local schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08111373000456">A number of Members have mentioned the importance of sports. An area of cross-cutting governmental co-ordination I find of interest is the extent to which the Building Schools for the Future programme has taken cognisance of the danger of trying to secure capital receipts and therefore compromising the provision of school playing fields. I am a former chairman of education, and it is fair to say that I have sold playing fields myself, so I plead guilty to that, but I hope that the Government are resisting that temptation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08111373000457">It is also important to have joined-up government in the areas of social services and sports provision. I would like to highlight the good practice, which I am sure is being pursued elsewhere, that was taken up as an initiative by Croydon council before the Government took a more national approach. The council saw that there were significant savings to be made in social services care for senior citizens by providing free swimming. Free swimming, at little extra cost, means that many of our senior citizens enjoy a better quality of life, through more active minds and bodies. I congratulate Councillor Steve Hollands on Croydon council on making that policy judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08111373000458">It will be interesting to note in next year&#146;s annual report the extent to which there has been an early trend towards a fall in obesity levels.

 Not only the scale of the problem&#151;the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) set out the statistics well&#151;but the speed and trajectory at which it is becoming a major disaster for Britain and the wider world are shocking. My friend Dr. David Haslam of the National Obesity Forum spoke of a time bomb; he said that there is no obesity time bomb because it has already exploded and that we are now suffering its aftermath. We are dealing with the effects of a disaster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08111373000460">We have already heard about the effects of obesity, including the huge increase in diabetes. An obese person has approximately 30 times the risk of diabetes compared with somebody of normal weight. As we all know, diabetes can significantly shorten life; it causes heart disease, strokes and vascular problems, not to mention the damage to eyes, nerves and kidneys. It is a multi-system disorder, which can cause significant problems. Type 2 diabetes is almost exclusively related to obesity. It is unusual to find somebody who is not obese with type 2 diabetes&#151;the link is that great.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08111373000461">We have also heard about the link between obesity and cancer. Several cancers are directly related to obesity, as are heart disease and degenerative diseases such as arthritis. Obesity shortens life and causes misery. It has been estimated that obesity can knock nine years off life. I do not exaggerate when I say that, if the trend continues, a generation of young people will pre-decease their parents. That would be the first time in the civilised world that a generation had pre-deceased its parents through non-war-related effects. The position is that serious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08111373000462">We have heard about the reasons for the increase in obesity. We eat far more refined food, which, almost by definition, is more calorie-dense than non-refined food. For example, a bag of crisps has a far higher calorie density than a pile of mashed potato. People experience more problems because they eat more processed food.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08111373000463">One of the big debates about obesity is whether calorie intake, lack of exercise or a combination of both causes it. The obvious answer is that it is a combination of both. However, a misleading statement that we often hear from several quarters is that people are not eating more than they did. People say that because they completely ignore food that is eaten outside the home.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to say that we must examine calories and exercise, but we must also consider salt and fat, which do not necessarily fall into calorie content, but are just as dangerous and cause obesity.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right about fat. Salt in itself does not cause obesity&#151;it can cause other problems, such as high blood pressure, and it has a significantly damaging effect on health. Fat is the main problem because it is the most calorie-dense food. It has approximately nine calories per gram, whereas carbohydrate and protein have approximately four to five calories per gram. Fat is, therefore, almost twice as calorie-dense as carbohydrate and protein. Anything people can do to switch from fat to carbohydrate will reduce their calorie intake. It is difficult to determine the scale of the problem in terms of what people are eating simply because it is hard to measure what people eat outside the home. Many surveys ask what food people have eaten and bought in the supermarket, but that ignores the bag of crisps, the bag of sweets and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para19"><a name="08111373000466">Although we have labelling on foods bought in a supermarket, there is no such requirement for food in a restaurant. Many restaurants simply do not give information about the calories in their foods. When I tackled McDonald&#146;s about the matter, it said that the information was available if one looked for it and that it was also on the website. However, people queuing to buy a Big Mac are not simultaneously checking the website to find out the number of calories it contains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para20"><a name="08111373000467">Some fast-food outlets and restaurants provide such information, but it is not uniformly available. If one goes out for a curry, one has no idea how much fat, salt and sugar and how many calories it contains. It is therefore almost impossible to measure calorie intake because the information for reaching a conclusion is unavailable.</p>

 When I was a lad, school dinners were not under-caloried, if I may put it like that. There were no tuck shops in those days, but children ate an awful lot of sweets, and did not seem to get obese, which inclines me to the view that lack of activity rather than calorie intake is the principal cause of obesity.</p>

 I hate to disagree with the hon. Gentleman, but he is wrong. People eat more calories&#151;they can afford more food than they could in the past. There was a tuck shop at my school, but I could not often afford to buy anything from it. Food, like alcohol, has become relatively cheaper over the years and that means that it is more available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08111373000470">However, it is interesting and paradoxical that obesity in this country is a disease of poverty. People who are poor are far more likely to be obese simply because poorer people tend to buy more energy-dense foods, which are cheaper&#151;people can fill their children up for less money. The children are thus more likely to become obese.</p>

 That is an interesting question, which I can answer. The Select Committee on Health, of which I am now a member, is undertaking an inquiry into health inequalities. Last week, Jamie Oliver came to talk to us about that very issue. I take issue with the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess), who said that there were two labelling schemes&#151;there are three. One is guideline daily amounts without traffic lights, one is GDA with traffic lights and the other is traffic lights. There are three competing schemes. I told Jamie Oliver at the Health Committee sitting last week that I did not understand the GDA system, and he said that he did not, either. I then asked, &#147;If I&#146;m a mother with three young children and I pick up a packet of something in the supermarket, which says, &#145;This packet contains 13 per cent. of the GDA for this particular nutrient&#146;, what does it mean?&#148; He said that he did not know. This morning, I tackled the Food Standards Agency about the matter, and it could not give me the answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08111373000473">We must have a far more robust mechanism whereby people can receive information quickly. We have the eight-second rule in politics: if we put a letter through someone&#146;s letter box, we have eight seconds to convey our message. That is the time it takes to pick up the letter off the floor, take it to the bin and throw it away. That is what happens to political leaflets. People probably have less time than that in the supermarket. If they are busy and trying to buy food for their kids, they pick up a bag of whatever, and think, &#147;Yes, oven chips&#151;in the basket.&#148; We must forget the idea that someone can digest a range of nutritional information such as GDA percentages per 100 grams, per half a pack and so on, at the same time as doing the weekly shop with two children in tow. It cannot be done. People do not deliberately avoid or misunderstand the labelling&#151;it is simply opaque and obscure. I have been a doctor for a long time and I do not understand it, so I cannot assume that anybody else does. That is why, frankly, the current voluntary system that food manufacturers and vendors are operating is not working. Voluntary systems did not work with smoking, and in the end we had to legislate. Voluntary systems are not working with food labelling, and we will probably have to legislate on that, too. I ask the Minister to consider that carefully in her response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para23"><a name="08111373000474">I know that time is pressing and I do not want to detain the House for too long, but we have to take robust action. We need far more robust action on advertising and on point-of-sale labelling and information, so that people have a much better idea of what they are eating and understand exactly what is in it. We must work with the food production industry to ensure that the salt, fat and sugar levels in food are lower wherever possible and to encourage it transfer from saturated to non-saturated fats. All those things can be done, I hope not by forcing the industry, but by persuading it to do them on its own initiative.</p>

I am very pleased that we are now measuring body mass index as part of our quality and outcomes framework, so that we at least have records of it. In addition, the Prime Minister&#146;s welcome announcement on vascular screening this year means that we are not only weighing a far broader section of the population, but measuring blood pressure and cholesterol levels far more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para25"><a name="08111373000476">However, it is one thing to identify people with a problem&#151;raised cholesterol, body mass index or whatever it might be&#151;but another to sort it out. I make a plea to the Minister for far more support in general practice, so that when we pick up someone with a problem, we have the resources to address it, instead of just saying, &#147;Get a diet sheet from the nurse&#148; or &#147;Take tablets.&#148; I do not want to go down that road. I want to ensure that we have enough information and community resources to refer people to an appropriate service where needed, whether it is a slimming club, a dietician or whatever.

As a society, we ignore the problem not just at our peril, but at the peril of our children and grandchildren, because if we do not sort it out, it does not bear thinking about.</p>

 It is a pleasure to respond to this debate on behalf of Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition. This debate is important, but it is difficult to call it topical on a day when BT has announced 10,000 job losses and at a time when 2,000 jobs a day are being lost in the British economy. Even the Minister was surprised to find herself here this afternoon responding to a debate that she did not know was going to be called.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="81113-0011.htm_para28"><a name="08111373000480">On the serious issue of obesity, however, many figures have been cited but probably the most worrying is the one from 2006, which is that one third of all children then were classed as technically obese. That means, on the Government&#146;s own statistics, that unless we all do something, 60 per cent. of the British population will be obese by 2050. That is why this is such an important debate.</p>

lower socio-economic groups in our society&#151;I will come to that&#151;but it dramatically affects certain ethnic groups, too. As we become a more diverse population, some ethnic groups, particularly certain Asian groups, suffer disproportionately from obesity and the medical problems associated with it. I am aware that the Bengali community is particularly worried about type 2 diabetes, which is affecting it so much and which seems to be becoming a genetic problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="81113-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08111373000482">There were reports in the press this morning that having fat in certain parts of the body affects a person&#146;s likelihood of contracting cancer. One report said that having &#147;love handles&#148;&#151;that is, fat in the abdomen area, round the body more generally&#151;makes a person more likely to get cancer. I am worried by such research and the way that it is reported in the press. As other hon. Members have said, the issue should not be about a stigma, but about helping people to live healthier lives. We are all different shapes and sizes, so we should not worry people by saying that if they have the odd extra pound around their abdomen they are more likely to get cancer; rather, we should address the issue of obesity.</p>

Members who have talked about the push by the fashion industry and others for size zero, and about those who say that only sizes eight and 10 are acceptable. That is abhorrent, and we should treat it with the contempt that it deserves. I only wish that my daughters would do so. They are absolutely paranoid about their weight&#151;even though they are very sporty, they worry a great deal about what they eat. That worries me as a father, and I am sure that other parents in the House are similarly worried.</p>

It cannot be right that legislation alone is the answer; there must be a partnership between the community, businesses and Government. I was conscious that the Minister did not refer to food labelling. I hope that she has time to do so towards the end of the debate. I know that it is difficult for her to talk about that, because legislating is difficult.</p>

 The Minister is indicating that it is not a problem, so perhaps she will explain later why she did not mention it once in her 10-minute speech, even though it is one of the most controversial food issues at the moment.</p>

 I look forward to looking at the Health Committee&#146;s evidence. I had the honour of being a member of that Committee. I too had meetings with officials of the FSA recently, but they indicated to me that European law was a concern. If there is a concern, we need to go for the best possible option. I agree that the guideline daily allowance system is not perfect, but at least it means that information for people who are willing to look for it is on the front rather than the back of packs. Perhaps a voluntary traffic light code would be the way forward.</p>

Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) referred in an intervention to the fact that it would be much better if fewer of our constituents drove their pupils to school. I agree with him. There were some excellent community-based ideas, such as walking buses and so on. When I ask my constituents why they drive their children to school, they say, &#147;Fear.&#148; They do not feel that it is safe to let their youngsters walk to school any more, either with a friend or with another parent. We must address that. People in all parties are worried about that, and rightly so.</p>

Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) was cut short&#151;I am sure that he will learn from that crisis&#151;he was absolutely right to say that interaction with youth is very important. I am conscious of the fact that, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) said, when school facilities are not being used, when schools are closed in the evenings, clubs and other sporting people should have the opportunity to use them.</p>

 I declare an interest as someone who boxed for some 30 years. I cannot think of a better way of keeping fit than boxing, and it should be brought back into schools. It is about the fitness regime, not the bouts. If the calories are going in, one can certainly burn them off with a decent boxing trainer. Parents should not fear allowing their children to participate in amateur boxing&#151;the protection these days is very good.</p>

I am concerned about the poorest groups in the community using more and more ready-made meals, which are getting cheaper and cheaper in our supermarkets but, because of the salt, fat and sugar contents, are the most damaging to our constituents.</p>

mentioned was published&#151;prior to the 2005 election. I agree that it was one of the greatest reports, although the report on smoking was also remarkable for its cross-party basis and for the legislation that it prompted, perhaps in a way that the House and country might never have believed could happen.

Any action we take has to be cross-departmental and based on joined-up thinking with businesses, schools and parents. I hope that this morning Jamie Oliver did not use some of the colourful language he often uses in his TV programmes. He and other chefs have undoubtedly driven forward the whole concept of cooking. My own daughters now cook on a regular basis, which I would never have dreamed of a few years ago. The debate needs to continue. It is shame that the Government have not adopted more recommendations from the 2004 Health Committee report. I look forward to hearing from the Minister how many of those recommendations we can hope to see introduced in the future.</p>

 With the leave of the House, I would like to respond to the issues raised in this interesting and well informed debate. Let me start with the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh), whose comments were echoed by a number of Members, including the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling) and the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="81113-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08111373000498">Crucial points were made about balance, and it is important that none of us implies that there is a single answer to the problem; it is far more complex than that. The hon. Member for Southport highlighted the importance of activity, food labelling, cooking healthy food, planning, urban design, advertising, reformulation of foods, using pester power to generate pressure for healthy foods, calories on menus, portion sizes and so forth&#151;all matters of great importance that we are taking forward. The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of self-image; the way in which we conduct the debate is crucial for us all&#151;whether it be the Government, non-governmental organisations, local authorities, health service bodies, local communities or whatever. The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire touched on that, as did the hon. Member for Croydon, Central.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="81113-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08111373000499">The information we convey about maintaining a healthy weight and a healthy lifestyle must not just be about what we eat or how much exercise we take. Nor is it just about making people in our society so obsessed with their diet that they do not eat enough; we have seen the difficulties people get into with eating disorders. As the Minister responsible for public health over the last year and a half, I have sought to be careful with the language that I use and to stress the importance of a healthy lifestyle and living healthier and longer lives rather than going for a one-size-fits-all solution. I endorse all the points that Members have raised in the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="81113-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08111373000500">The contribution of the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire was helpfully divided into four parts. He made international comparisons, which were absolutely  <br>

valid, and he spoke about the luxury of food and eating what is necessary. The Government can play a role, as highlighted in the Select Committee report, in the matter of portion size, as it takes us into labelling, how much we are eating and what our food contains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="81113-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08111373000501">The hon. Gentleman spoke of the need for reliable information. We are bombarded with reports and research from all over the world, but what people need is reliable, simple, accurate information, and that is what Change 4 Life seeks to provide. The hon. Gentleman also perceived a lack of interest. The results of surveys suggest that while people consider obesity to be an important problem, they do not feel that it applies to them. Therein lies the real issue: it is always someone else&#146;s problem. Even the parents of obese children do not recognise it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="81113-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08111373000502">The way in which we are conducting the debate on this subject allows us to polarise the issue. We think of it as applying to the person who weighs 50 stone, 20 stone or 30 stone, but once our body mass index rises above 25, we should all be wary of the health implications. We need to ensure that the information is there, that it is accessible and that people perceive it as relevant rather than accusatory or polarising, or paving the way for unintended consequences. The hon. Member for Croydon, Central made the connection with mental health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="81113-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08111373000503">Following the Health Committee&#146;s excellent report, the Government acted on all its recommendations. We gave funds to primary care trusts to enable them to produce the necessary information, we updated the child health promotion programmes, we put more funds into the family-nurse partnership, and we changed the national child measurement programme so that parents can be informed of their children&#146;s weight and height and told whether the statistics fall within a healthy range. We worked with Ofcom to change the advertising rules, particularly those applying to children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="81113-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08111373000504">The Food Standards Agency has worked relentlessly on reformulations of foods. It has worked relentlessly on salt and sugar, and huge steps have been made, but more needs to be done. The question that I would put to the food industry is, &#147;If some changes can be made by some manufacturers, why cannot all the changes be made by all the manufacturers?&#148; My hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) asked that question as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="81113-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08111373000505">A great deal of work is being done to build on those successes. Following the Health Committee&#146;s report, we commissioned the Foresight report. We asked scientists to look critically at all the elements that were contributing to a substantial public-health challenge. The hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) felt that he did not have all the information that he ought to have in connection with the Health Committee&#146;s report. I should be happy to send the details to him, and I hope he is now satisfied that the Government acted on its recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="81113-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08111373000506">As for the healthy towns initiative, perhaps the hon. Gentleman should have a conversation with his local council. There were 160-odd expressions of interest in the initiative. Councils had to make specific proposals related to what their communities said they needed, and a selection process finally reduced the number to nine. Those nine councils will be monitored, and the measures that are found to work will form the basis of programmes for the future and funding to help all the councils implement their plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="81113-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08111373000507">That brings me to the point made by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central. This is about partnership across Government. It is about what can be done by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, by the Department for Children, Schools and Families, by the Department for Transport and by the Department for Communities and Local Government. Of course it is about the Department of Health, but it is also about the Department for Work and Pensions and what we can do with employers to ensure that there are healthy workplaces. We must work with the Food Standards Agency and local authorities through local area agreements and make this issue a high priority. I look forward to that annual report and I hope that Members will welcome the progress that we are making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="81113-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08111373000508">I fear that we will need to return to the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford on food labelling. The Government have been clear that the best and swiftest agreements to achieve with the industry are those of a voluntary nature, but we have made it clear that if progress cannot be made, we will consider other methods. He is right in terms of comparing ourselves with other countries; there is a great deal of information on food labelling and the traffic light system is very clear, but there is still not one system. That is why the FSA is undertaking research to settle once and for all the best, simplest and most straightforward information that needs to be available on food. It will be based on the traffic light system and will ensure that one of the building blocks&#151;but only one&#151;is in place as the Government work with local government, communities, the health service, NGOs and community activists in partnership to deal with the biggest public health challenge that has faced this country in a very long time.</p>

For, as he has stated many times, the global problems we face require global solutions. We cannot tackle dangerous climate change without involving Africa and developing countries. We cannot address pressure on resources and energy without involving Africa and developing countries. We cannot hope to feed the world without involving Africa and developing countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="81113-0012.htm_para28"><a name="08111373000520">Economic history has shown us that, given the reliance that many such countries have on exports, remittances and aid flows, global downturns can have a devastating and potentially long-term impact on the world's poorest countries. Caribbean and central American countries are already seeing a decline in remittances because of a fall in employment in the United States of America. As such sources of financing begin to decline, spending on essential services such as health, education and water supply can suffer quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="81113-0012.htm_para29"><a name="08111373000521">For that reason, the international community must keep its promises to help deliver the millennium development goals. We must keep our pledges on the quantity and quality of aid we provide to the developing world and we must ensure that policies to stabilise the global economy are effective in helping developing countries both to tackle short-term crises and to meet long-term development needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="81113-0012.htm_para30"><a name="08111373000522">To those ends, I wish to update the House on the United Kingdom&#146;s role in launching a new international aid transparency initiative that aims substantially to increase the transparency of information on global aid flows; in securing an ambitious outcome at the recent high-level forum on aid effectiveness in Accra; and in securing global commitments to reinvigorate efforts to meet the millennium development goals at the recent United Nations high-level event in New York.

 Let me deal with each of those points in turn. We have set criteria in respect of looking to support countries. We consider their commitment to reducing poverty in their own country, and we examine their systems of public financial management when we consider whether budgetary support should be provided. We also examine the issue of human rights, which is why, for example, the UK is involved in the EU dialogue on human rights in China.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="81113-0013.htm_para0"><a name="08111373000525">The health indicators for China&#151;in particular, western China&#151;show significantly high continuing levels of tuberculosis, as a consequence of the significant number of people who continue to be afflicted by poverty in that country, and India still has more poor people than the whole of sub-Saharan Africa. In that sense, we face a real choice. If, as I have stated, we are serious about meeting the challenge of the MDGs, we are required to work in India, which has a significant number of poor people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="81113-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08111373000526">It is worth bringing another dimension of this matter to the House&#146;s attention. The global rebalancing of economic power that will take place in the years ahead means that it is strongly in this country&#146;s national interest to maintain strong partnerships with both India and China. This is not simply about development, where it is unquestionably the case that a country such as China will have a long and continuing engagement with Africa&#151;we have real opportunities to influence how China seeks to exert its influence in that continent&#151;but about the British national interest. It would be precisely the wrong time to communicate a message, whether advertently or inadvertently, to either India or China that somehow we did not recognise the fact that there is a continuing partnership between the United Kingdom and those countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="81113-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08111373000527">Of course, we will be closing our programme in China in the years to come, but there is a continuing challenge to be met in India, given the high levels of poverty of which I have spoken. We have an obligation to continue to work on the programmes that are in place to ensure, for example, that we help to secure the eradication of as basic a disease as TB and that we combat infant and child mortality in India, the effects of which I shall see for myself when I travel there next week&#151;we have a continuing obligation to work in that country too.</p>

 That was an extensive reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) on the subject of India and China. Will the Secretary of State explain why, in these difficult economic times, we continue to give aid to Russia, a country that has more than $500 billion in reserves and sits on some of the world&#146;s largest oil supplies?</p>

 Programmes were put in place in Russia at the time of the change following the fall of the Berlin wall and the change to the Commonwealth of Independent States, as was. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I hope the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I finish the point. The reason why I answered the question on India and China was because it was what I was asked. That may be an unconventional approach for some, but I endeavour to answer the question that is put to me.</p>

If Russia is looking, as it certainly is, on the basis of the progress that it has made economically in recent years&#151;notwithstanding the recent fall in the stock market and the difficulties that it will face with a falling oil price&#151;to exert its influence internationally, there is a case for having a dialogue with Russia about how it will engage in development issues. In the same way, it is important that we engage with Russia on nuclear proliferation issues and on a wide range of strategic concerns.</p>

 In the Secretary of State&#146;s response to the question about aid to India, China and Russia, is he not falling into the trap of blurring the distinction between international development policy and foreign policy? Money spent by his Department is not supposed to be used to support the latter.</p>

<p><a name="st_o291"><a name="08111373000532"><a name="81113-0013.htm_spnew4"><a name="08111373001239"><b>Mr. Alexander:</b>
 I am always happy to be challenged on whether our aid is tied, but it is interesting to receive such questions from members of the Conservative party, which is well remembered for having tied British aid, for having halved British aid, and for being upbraided by no less an institution than the High Court for not having upheld development principles, for example in relation to the Pergau dam. If the hon. Gentleman is asserting that the Conservative party is a repentant sinner and recognises that it was wrong to tie British aid and to halve it&#151;we have doubled it&#151;in the past, I welcome his support today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="81113-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08111373000533">There is no contradiction between a clear focus on poverty reduction&#151;writing that into law and ensuring transparency in the provision of that aid&#151;and recognising that that relationship allows us an opportunity to engage in dialogue with countries with which we are working. In that sense, it is not an especially difficult point to grasp to say that if one is in dialogue with developing countries, we should seek to influence them benignly in terms of the international environment. That is fundamentally different from an approach that seeks to use British aid money to support British commercial concerns, as was the case under the previous Conservative Government, and that led inexorably to the embarrassment and shame of projects such as the Pergau dam.</p>

 The Secretary of State may have misunderstood the question asked by my hon.

 I am glad to receive that assurance. If we are in the business of offering assurances this afternoon, perhaps the hon.

At least one of his colleagues, when introducing the debate on global poverty in this House on 24 July, was only too happy to do so. It would be regrettable if the development community in the UK were left with the mistaken perception&#151;as a result of a search for headlines&#151;that the Conservative party had changed its approach on budget support.</p>

That is why it is a matter of consistency that the Government have prioritised international development, not a matter of electoral tactics or a desire to catch up with others. In that sense, I sincerely hope that the work we have undertaken to ensure that every section of British society recognises the importance of development expenditure truly extends to both sides of this House.</p>

To bandy about suggestions that there are somehow no strings attached to hundreds of millions of pounds worth of British aid does a disservice to the quality of debate that we have reasonably come to expect from all parties. We have a responsibility to ensure the highest levels of propriety in how British aid money is spent&#151;I will be happy to speak about that in the course of my remarks&#151;and, at the same time, to ensure that the search for headlines does not get in the way of the truth.

 I am grateful, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to continue where I left off. If the hon.

That causes me concern. When one gets to the core of Conservative party thinking, one sees that as the intellectual tide has turned against Conservatives they have been left defenceless and uncomprehending about the true nature of the problem. That is why, at a domestic level, they have opposed the steps we have taken on short selling and to protect mortgage holders, and why they did not initially support the significant steps that our Chancellor and Prime Minister have taken. I understand that this is a moment of acute intellectual peril for the right, given that we cannot nudge, privatise or deregulate our way out of the international financial crisis.

 Of course, my right hon.

As I recollect, he appeared only recently in a joint session with the Foreign Secretary&#151;it was before either the Defence Committee or the Foreign Affairs Committee&#151;to answer exactly that sort of question in respect of Afghanistan.

Transparency limits the scope for corruption in developing countries. The extractive industries transparency initiative, launched by the Government in 2002, requires Governments, as well as oil and mining companies, publicly to declare the value of contracts. That initiative has helped Nigeria to increase revenue collection by $1 billion&#151;money that is now available to spend on meeting the needs of the Nigerian people. In recognition of the power of such transparency to increase the impact of aid, the Government launched a new international initiative in September. The initiative was intended to make information on aid flows more easily available and accessible, so that citizens of both donor and recipient countries could see where and how aid was invested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="81113-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08111373000566">The first area of agreement regards mutual accountability between donors and recipient countries. Donors have a legitimate right to monitor the performance of developing country Governments to ensure that aid is well spent&#151;a responsibility that this Government take seriously. We know that aid is more effective when recipient countries in turn monitor donor performance. In Mozambique, for example, independent reviews of both donor and Government performance have helped to improve the predictability of aid and reduce the costs for all parties involved. The House may be interested to learn that such rankings have rated DFID as the most effective donor for the past three years. In Accra, both donors and recipient Governments agreed to develop stronger mechanisms to hold each other accountable for meeting commitments, so that the good practice that I described in Mozambique is in future the rule, not the exception, in international aid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="81113-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08111373000567">The donors gathered in Accra made a commitment to improving the co-ordination of aid. Developing country Governments spend far too much time managing donors, and are left with too little time to conduct the proper business of government as they take their countries forward on their development paths. Over the past four years, Government staff in Uganda have dealt with more than 1,000 donor-led projects. In one year alone, the Government of Vietnam played host to 791 donor missions&#151;more than three for every working day. Government staff in Mozambique have to maintain 1,000 different  <br>

bank accounts simply to meet differing donor requirements. It was because of such concerns that this Government last year launched the international health partnership to improve donor co-ordination in the health sector. The agreements made in Accra take that approach beyond the health sector. Developing countries committed to taking the lead in co-ordinating and agreeing an effective division of labour between donors. In turn, donors agreed to respect those priorities and work together to put better co-ordination into practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="81113-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08111373000568">In developing countries where aid funding can be equivalent to as much as 75 per cent. of the national budget, it is vital that donors provide as much clarity as possible regarding intended future aid flows. Our Government are taking part in 10-year agreements in the education sector; as part of that, developing countries provide robust, costed 10-year plans. We have already made such agreements in a number of countries, including Ghana, Mozambique and Rwanda. By doing so, we are giving those countries the confidence that they need to build a school; they know that the money will be there to maintain it, and can train teachers knowing that they can afford to pay a salary at the end of that training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="81113-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08111373000569">In Accra, donors agreed to provide regular and timely information on the aid that they expect to provide in the next three to five years. Donors also agreed to increase the share of aid channelled through to partner country budgets. Those measures will help developing countries to plan and manage their budgets better, to use resources more effectively and to provide the services that their citizens need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="81113-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08111373000570">The successful conclusion to the meeting of donors and developing countries in Accra provided a positive precursor to the high-level event on the millennium development goals held later in September at the United Nations in New York. That meeting brought together literally the broadest alliance ever assembled to fight for a common goal to tackle global poverty. The UN Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly were joined by 140 countries, alongside dozens of multinational chief executives, faith leaders and non-governmental organisations. The commitments made included a malaria action plan, launched to point the way towards universal coverage of insecticide-treated bed nets by 2010, and achieving near-zero malaria deaths by 2015. Those gathered made commitments to provide emergency food aid in the horn of Africa, and the rapid distribution of support, including seeds and fertilisers for 30 priority countries in time for the next planting season. A major new financing force was launched with the aim of raising funds to help recruit 1 million health workers and save 10 million lives. To get 25 million more children into school by 2010, as a milestone to universal primary education by 2015, international partners launched a &#147;Class of 2015&#148; partnership. Those and other commitments combined to form $16 billion-worth of pledges to tackle poverty. In response, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the meeting</p>

the end of this month, donors should agree that changes to international financial regulations will not harm the interests of the poorest countries. All parties should reaffirm the commitments on aid effectiveness made in Accra. Donors should agree to keep promises on aid, as the UK, I am glad to say, is doing, and they should reaffirm their commitment to maintain open markets and resist the threat of protectionism.</p>

It is not only our moral duty to help our fellow men, women and children to lift themselves out of poverty but it is in our interest as a nation to do so. Government Members, at least, are united in that conviction.</p>

In our response to dangerous climate change, the depletion of natural resources, the threat of global disease, and indeed the threats to our global security, there is quite simply no more &#147;over there&#148; and &#147;over here&#148;. Tackling those great problems requires a truly global mindset, and calls for global solutions, which means bringing the fifth of the global population who live in extreme poverty into our global community. The United Kingdom will therefore keep working to tackle disease, illiteracy and hunger. As I have set out, we will continue to lead international efforts to ensure that any aid delivered provides the benefits that the world&#146;s poorest need, and that British taxpayers rightly demand.</p>

 The year 2008 has been a distinctly mixed one for international development. We remain stubbornly off-track to meet the millennium development goals, and fuel prices and food shortages have left millions at risk. Natural disasters have hit, leaving destruction in their wake&#151;floods in India, a cyclone in Burma, and an earthquake in Pakistan. Manmade emergencies in Zimbabwe, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sudan have brought insecurity and misery to many. Amid all that, the global financial crisis has thrown the whole developing world and the international aid industry into turmoil.</p>

There is, however, some cause for hope. DFID&#146;s reputation as an outstanding development agency continues, and we are all rightly proud of it. The Department has continued to fight poverty in some of the world&#146;s poorest countries; it has accepted that poor sanitation is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths and launched a new policy for that sector; and, as the Secretary of State outlined, it has led international efforts to improve aid co-ordination, championing in Accra an agreement that serves as a booster to the three-year-old Paris declaration.</p>

Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce), made: most people want international development to be removed from the realm of party politics all together. International development policy is not Tory, or Labour, or Liberal, but British. But, of course, we on the Opposition Benches have a role to play in holding the Government to account on their international development work and policies, so we will support and encourage DFID when we believe that it is doing the right thing, but probe and ask questions of it when we think that there is room for improvement. We will also press the Government to do more in areas that we consider to be important. That should be the nature of a responsible Opposition&#146;s approach to development, and it is certainly our approach on the Conservative Benches.</p>

 The problem that Government Members have with the hon.

 I do not wish to be unfair to the Secretary of State, but before he jumped in, I was just about to answer my hon. Friend by saying that a transparent international aid policy is one that is accountable to its investors, the British taxpayer, as well as to its end-users, the local people in developing countries. The policy must be efficient and effective, or face a critical response from those who have a stake in it. Most importantly, it must deliver.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="81113-0014.htm_para14"><a name="08111373000587">We welcome the launch of the international aid transparency initiative. We Conservatives have repeatedly championed greater transparency in aid. We have consistently argued&#151;not least as I did in my speech at the Conservative party conference the year before; as the Secretary of State is an enthusiast of my speeches, he will have noticed&#151;that as well as championing effectiveness in aid spending, we must stand up for transparency. We will watch closely to ensure that the new international aid transparency initiative is fully implemented by the Department for International Development and the other agencies that have signed up to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="81113-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08111373000588">The Secretary of State has no room for complacency on this issue. One of the initiative&#146;s commitments is to:</p>
<a name="81113-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="08111373000888"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;share more detailed and more up-to-date information about aid in a form that makes information more accessible to all relevant stakeholders.&#148;</p>

The DFID website is a most important tool, but it is woefully light on information about DFID spending on development. When country profiles exist, they often lack up-to-date, systematic detail on what DFID money has been spent on and how. Many recipients of our aid do not even have a country profile on the website, and in many country programmes there is no obvious way for a member of the public in a developing country to find out in detail how DFID aid money is being spent there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="81113-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08111373000590">For example, the DFID website offers just a few paragraphs about how our &#163;3 million aid budget is spent in The Gambia and contains no easily accessible detail about the six major sectors in which many millions of British pounds will be spent in that country in the next few years.

It is not only the vital means through which British people can find out how their money is being spent, but an essential reference point for journalists, civil society and ordinary citizens in developing countries. I welcome the Secretary of State&#146;s commitment to redesigning the DFID website, but will he reassure me that its content&#151;and not only its appearance&#151;will be comprehensively overhauled? Will he learn lessons from sites such as that of the global health fund and publish a detailed breakdown of spending to which everyone can have access?</p>

The casual observer in London, Nairobi or Freetown would not necessarily spot them straight away, but the Conservative international development team is nothing if not sharp-eyed. In the Department&#146;s report, the statistics show that no money was spent in Djibouti in 2006-07. When the new international development statistics were published in October, the figure was mysteriously changed to &#163;4 million, apparently all for other bilateral aid. Similarly, the Madagascan bilateral programme rose by &#163;14 million and the Ghanaian programme by &#163;13 million; there are numerous other examples. In the winding up, will the Minister explain the reasons for those discrepancies and will a system for explaining them as they arise be established? A revamped website with comprehensive information will be seriously hindered if the statistics in it can be changed year on year without explanation.</p>

In 2007-08, &#163;366 million of British aid was spent in that way. According to the respected non-governmental organisation, Transparency International, the UK gives some of its largest donations to Governments who have real problems with governance and corruption. For example, Tanzania ranks 102nd on the corruption index, yet it received &#163;105 million as direct budget support last year.

 I have no doubt of the Secretary of State&#146;s bona fides on what he said to the President of Tanzania. I went there myself last year because I wanted to find out the extent to which we were monitoring the large amount of taxpayers&#146; money going into the Tanzanian budget. I must tell the Secretary of State that I am not satisfied from that visit, or from the discussions that I had with Tanzanian Ministers and also with his officials, that the money in question is properly accounted for, which is why I am making this point.</p>

 I will come directly to the Secretary of State&#146;s point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="81113-0015.htm_para7"><a name="08111373000613">The fact that we give money to Governments who are not trusted by their own citizens is, I submit to the House, a serious concern. The Secretary of State should review urgently whether it is right that hard-working British families are contributing directly to the Governments of those countries. It might also be appropriate for the Select Committee on International Development to investigate the issue further, and I hope that the Chairman of that Committee will reflect on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="81113-0015.htm_para8"><a name="08111373000614">I accept that giving aid directly to Governments through budget support can be the right way forward in some circumstances, but we need to apply stringent tests and to ensure that the money is used properly. Where there is doubt, the money should be given to specific sectors such as health or education, and overseen more carefully. Whenever Britain gives budget support, up to 5 per cent. of the total amount should be earmarked to help local Parliaments, civil society and audit institutes to track where the money is going and to hold their Governments to account. During a recent visit to Ghana, which rightly receives budget support, I was most impressed to witness on television Members of Parliament being held to account by parliamentarians in forthright terms for their spending of public funds. We should actively encourage that.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has brought his characteristic rhetorical authority to a point in claiming that we should not give budget support in all circumstances&#151;we do not. He suggested that where there is evidence of corruption, we should take action&#151;we do. He suggests that we should not provide budget support uniformly&#151;we provide it to fewer than half the countries in which DFID has programmes of &#163;10 million or more. I would be interested to hear the specific examples that he wishes to bring to the Department&#146;s attention. Otherwise, it would seem, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove) suggested earlier, that he is making simply a rhetorical, derivative statement of what is already Government policy.</p>

 I clearly set out that the Secretary of State should acknowledge the approach that the Conservative party would take, were we to form a Government after the next election. I specifically raised with him&#151;privately, but I know that he will not mind my mentioning the matter in the Chamber&#151;budget support to Cambodia, which he has now brought to a conclusion, at least temporarily. However, he must accept my point that budget support has raised serious questions in the minds of taxpayers. In particular, he and the Department should examine carefully the report of the Public Accounts Committee. Transparency means being open and honest when we get things wrong.</p>

Last year, the Government agreed to increase British aid to Burma, after sustained pressure from leading NGOs and Opposition Members.

 My hon. Friend makes a fair point. Considerable concern has been expressed about the improbability of the charge that Mrs. Kabuye faces and about the process being conducted. Perhaps my hon.

and repatriate the rump of the Hutu genocidal regime, which fled to Kivu from Rwanda in 1994 and has never left. That is the crux of the matter. It is the presence of those forces that allows General Nkunda to claim the spurious pretext of protecting the Tutsi population.</p>

I hope to be in Goma this weekend to see the humanitarian situation for myself. It is not correct that fundamentally new political agreements are needed. They are already there in United Nations resolution 1804 of March this year, in the Goma agreement of January, which was signed by 22 armed groups, and in the Nairobi communiqu&#233; of last November between the Governments of Rwanda and the DRC, which was reaffirmed last weekend. Nor is it true that MONUC&#151;the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo&#151;lacks the mandate to provide threatened communities with the necessary defence. We are talking about a chapter VII assignment, which enables such power as the UN can deploy to be used to protect civilian populations. The issue, therefore, is not the mandate; it is the effectiveness and capacity of the force.</p>

I would make two points about that, however. First, such deployments would give an opportunity to European countries whose armed forces are not so overstretched to play a meaningful role, if at some point it is decided to send European Union troops. Secondly, the UN force on the ground in the DRC now is already the largest in the world, with no fewer than 18 countries providing troops and direct support, and is already deployed in Goma. That force is the first and best way for the international community to exercise its responsibility to protect. We welcome today&#146;s announcement by the UN that the force is to be reinforced. If the force is deemed insufficient and if, God forbid, its members are hurt defending civilians from attack, the international community must immediately stand by and reinforce them. Otherwise, the responsibility to protect will be seen as a piece of international grandstanding by the world&#146;s leaders&#151;a sham, with neither credibility nor bite.</p>

 Even that intervention, when combined with what was said earlier, leads me to make a couple of points that, frankly, I had not intended to make&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I did not interrupt any Opposition Members. This is a democracy, but it is also an elected Parliament in which some of us are entitled to express our opinions.</p>

<p><a name="st_o357"><a name="08111373000650"><a name="81113-0016.htm_spnew7"><a name="08111373001305"><b>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold) (Con):</b>
 All of us.</p>

<p><a name="st_o358"><a name="08111373000651"><a name="81113-0016.htm_spnew8"><a name="08111373001306"><b>Mr. Clarke:</b>
 Indeed. I agree that we are all entitled to express our opinions, and I am about to express mine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="81113-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08111373000652">We were asked, for example, about India. What are we to assume from these interventions? Members of all parties visited India a year or two ago to examine the very serious issue of tuberculosis, yet 1,000 people still die there every day. Quite frankly, the people we met there in the saddest of circumstances were not asking questions about their Government&#146;s foreign policy or about nuclear weapons. The same applied when, as I vividly recall, we visited Uganda. Lord Steele was with us on that visit. We sat outside a mud hut where a young man, surrounded by his family, friends and other villagers, was within just a few hours of dying of HIV/AIDS. Again, frankly, most of those people did not ask about the policies of their Government. I am not saying that we should not ask about them, but what I am saying very strongly is that I have never believed that individual human beings, wherever they live, from Delhi to Darfur, should be punished because of the policies of their Governments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="81113-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08111373000653">Let me continue with the points that I had intended to make. Given the global crisis, I welcome the commitment given by Opposition Front Benchers as well as by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to foreign aid at 0.7 per cent. of gross national income by 2013 or, indeed, earlier. When I last raised this matter on 16 July, my right hon. Friend gave me an assurance that the Government were still on course to achieve that target. I believe that the House has reached a consensus on the matter over the years, notwithstanding what might have been said today, and I also know that hon. Members on both sides of the House feel strongly about it. If individual Members put it on the record that they believe in this agreement and if all the political parties adhere to it in their manifestos, I will certainly leave the House a much happier person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="81113-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08111373000654">I welcome this debate. As has been said, it is consistent with the aims of the International Development (Reporting and Transparency) Act 2006, which I had the privilege of piloting through the House with a great deal of support. The Act will mainly be remembered because it has led this Government&#151;and it will be compelling for future Governments&#151;to present an annual report to the House. Principal among the issues that we expect to be covered is how well we are doing on the 0.7 per cent. GNI target and, I hope, by how much we have advanced on it. The Act embraces our commitment to the millennium development goals. Given that its title includes the very word &#147;transparency&#148;, transparency is clearly of the essence&#151;and I am very pleased that the Government have taken it on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="81113-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08111373000655">In the same spirit, I welcome DFID&#146;s recent annual report to Parliament, which we have not had a chance to debate until today. I genuinely believe that this report is excellent. It is an informative tome for scholars and  <br>

members of the public alike, presenting helpful information in a clear and transparent way about what is being done and what needs to be done. Indeed, armed with that information, our debate helps to underline how important transparency is and how the report takes us forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="81113-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08111373000656">I do not want to get into further exchanges with Conservative Members, but I gently point out to them the European Union issues covered in the latest annual report. Page 115 presents a comprehensive and transparent account of our relationship with the EU. It even gives the Government&#146;s interpretation of the Lisbon treaty. I do not think for a second that my right hon. Friend can reasonably be criticised on that score.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="81113-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08111373000657">There must be transparency at every level: in the Department itself, in terms of coherence between Departments, and in the holding to account of the European Union as well as the other international bodies, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. I welcome DFID&#146;s commitment to the international aid transparency initiative, but the truth is that it works both ways. The developed countries must know where the money is supposed to go, and the developing countries must know when it will arrive and how much there will be. The absence of that knowledge has been cited as one of the main reasons for the lack of aid effectiveness. Most important of all, the people who are meant to be helped by the aid must know when it is coming and how it should be spent. That enables us to judge whether it is being spent as effectively as we all want it to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="81113-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08111373000658">There are a variety of ways in which the Governments of developed and developing countries can help. In Uganda, for example, an information campaign helped to increase the share of funds reaching schools from 20 per cent. in 1995 to 80 per cent. in 2001. We can only imagine the positive impact that that is having on people&#146;s lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="81113-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08111373000659">I want to talk about some current issues, in each of which transparency is of the essence. I followed last week&#146;s debate on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but it is appropriate to return to that important subject. I say that especially in view of the announcement by the United Nations earlier today that 3,000 more troops were to be sent to the eastern DRC. That is a positive action which I broadly welcome, but I feel that there are other countries, particularly in that region, with a wider role to play. I am thinking particularly of Rwanda. As this is a debate about aid and transparency, I think it appropriate to point out that we give the Rwandan Government &#163;46 million in aid every year. I think that I am as familiar as anyone can be with the circumstances in Rwanda and the DRC, both of which I visited recently. On those visits, along with colleagues, I had the opportunity to meet Presidents Kabila and Kagame.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="81113-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08111373000660">As was mentioned in last Thursday&#146;s debate, our programme of aid for Rwanda comes with a 10-year memorandum of understanding which expressly states that the Rwandan Government must be committed to regional stability. It was therefore a great shock to me to read the following comments of a spokesperson from the Rwandan Foreign Ministry:</p>

leads some parties seeking to intervene to demand a meeting between the heads of state of Rwanda and the DRC as a solution to the internal crisis in the DRC.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="81113-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08111373000661">That strikes me as somewhat naive. The DRC crisis is a problem on Rwanda&#146;s doorstep, and President Kagame&#146;s unique status gives him the opportunity to exert a positive influence on an outcome that could lead to the kind of reconciliation that Rwanda itself has experienced.</p>

<p><a name="st_o359"><a name="08111373000662"><a name="81113-0016.htm_spnew9"><a name="08111373001307"><b>Mr. Mitchell:</b>
 I, too, noticed that comment, and I was surprised as well, but I think there is a clear explanation. The conflict is not between the Congo and Rwanda, which is why, as I understand it, the President was unwilling to attend a bilateral meeting with President Kabila. He did, however, attend a meeting in Nairobi last weekend with a number of Heads of State of countries affected in the region.</p>

<p><a name="st_o360"><a name="08111373000663"><a name="81113-0016.htm_spnew10"><a name="08111373001308"><b>Mr. Clarke:</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that helpful intervention. We all support the UN&#146;s efforts to try to get a solution to this dreadful problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="81113-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08111373000664">In that situation as elsewhere, mineral extraction has once again formed the backdrop to tragic events. At this juncture, I would like to touch on the comments made in last week&#146;s debate by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs. He spoke about the extractive industries directive, an initiative that I wholeheartedly support. In the same debate the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), who I very much welcome to his post and who is to wind up the debate, undertook to look into transparency in mineral extraction. I was wondering whether he would take the opportunity to inform us further of the Government&#146;s thinking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="81113-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08111373000665">There are challenges of poverty eradication, providing clean water, reducing the rates of infant mortality, substantially improving health care, investing more in education for girls and boys and dealing with conflict and its effect on developing countries. They are ongoing, as is the importance of climate change and the environment&#151;all of them encapsulated in the millennium development goals. It is in that spirit, too, that I welcome not only DFID&#146;s annual report to this House, but the UN&#146;s 2008 millennium development goals report, which offers insight that can lead to real optimism. Those objectives and much more can be achieved only on the basis of the transparency to which we are absolutely committed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="81113-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08111373000666">The existence of corruption, the absence of accountability and the need for good governance are compelling reasons for all the actions that the Government have taken and which my right hon. Friend explained in his opening speech. A debate of this kind would be incomplete were we not to take on board the impact of the global economic crisis on the poorest countries in the world today. The truth is that whatever anxieties we in the western world are experiencing, they cannot be compared with the devastation on top of existing poverty that those who live in developing countries find are heaped on their misfortunes. There is no prospect of a level playing field and it would be idle to pretend that it is within our reach. What we can do is acknowledge that declining commodity prices, disappearing markets, unfair trade practices and even the fear that we in developed countries feel about our own situation as we struggle  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="81113-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08111373000667">That is why I would like to ask the Minister today to explain DFID&#146;s thinking on some of these matters. What special consideration has been given to the global economic crisis and its effect on developing countries&#146; economies? Is a specific plan being formulated to offer both fiscal and technical guidance in respect of the problems those in the developing world now face?

 I hope that the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke) will not take offence if I say that this debate has had a surreal quality to it, because that is in no way a reflection on his contribution. Again, I pay tribute to the sterling, unrivalled work that he has done in this Chamber over many years on international development and to his groundbreaking legislation, which is at the centre of today&#146;s debate. My observation about the surreal nature of the debate is based on the complexities of what we try to resolve on occasions such as this. Perhaps only in this arena could we be talking with such passion about untied aid that definitely has strings attached. Those who are new to the debate will not fully comprehend that.</p>

On the one hand, we saw the despair in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, on the other hand we saw the elation in the village of Kogelo in western Kenya at the election of Senator Obama to the presidency of the United States of America. One image was a bleak reminder of the cycle of conflict and crisis that have typified much of the development debate over generations, and the other was a celebration of the close human links between the developing world and the rich west. As the right hon. Gentleman said, we must hope that under a new American Administration those will be strengthened considerably.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that one of the problems that we face, particularly in Africa, is that, in a sense, out of sight means out of mind? What is happening in the DRC, a country I visited some years ago, is terrible, but the situation in Darfur is as bad as it ever was and it has fallen off the front pages because of events in the DRC. The west, in particular, is very bad in this regard, because it loses interest. As a result, I fear that momentum will be lost and some of the changes that were taking place in Sudan will not now happen; and next year is a particularly important one, given that elections are to take place. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman shares my misgivings.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s valid point puts an extra onus on all in this House who have an interest in these matters and care all the time about them to ensure that we bring them back to the forefront of the agenda. Although Darfur has not been mentioned other than in his intervention, I hope that we might have the chance in the near future to debate the humanitarian situation there and the efforts that are being made by the Department for International Development to support the communities affected.</p>

For example, 100,000 people constitute the population of the entire region of which my constituency forms a part, and to imagine every last person there being beyond help, as so many are north of Goma at the moment, is striking and worrying. I hope that as the Secretary of State did not get the opportunity to focus on that situation in his speech, the Minister who winds up the debate will be able to talk about the aid package for the DRC. We hope to see it successfully delivered on the ground in the next few weeks as the situation unfolds.</p>

The international focus has so far been on creating stability and injecting vast capital sums to secure domestic financial systems. That is the correct thing to do, but the danger is that the impact of the crisis is so great that we will overlook what is happening in developing countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="81113-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08111373000682">This weekend, leaders of the G20 will gather to tackle some of the pressing issues. The reform agenda of the Bretton Woods institutions will be central to those discussions&#151;and not before time&#151;although we must hope that that is not where the discussions end. Already, countries around the world are resiling from their aid commitments. The UK must help to stop that trend in its tracks. It has been made explicit this afternoon that all hon. Members on both sides of the House support the UN target of 0.7 per cent. of GNI in overseas development assistance. We have to push everyone else to continue in that direction and not to move backwards.</p>

<p><a name="st_o368"><a name="08111373000683"><a name="81113-0017.htm_spnew0"><a name="08111373001316"><b>Malcolm Bruce:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend share my concern that Italy is likely to take over the leadership of the G8 at a time when it has effectively dismantled its aid programme and abandoned its commitment to aspire to even half of the GDP target that others are working towards? Should the European Union take that up with Italy if it is to have the responsibility of leading the world on the issue?</p>

<p><a name="st_o369"><a name="08111373000684"><a name="81113-0017.htm_spnew1"><a name="08111373001317"><b>Mr. Moore:</b>
 I agree. This country works in close partnership with Italy, and it is a great shame that it has taken those backward steps, especially as it is to take that key leadership position. It is important that we do not allow that to distract us from our global efforts towards what is, frankly speaking, only a modest target. It is only a very small amount of money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="81113-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08111373000685">Anyone who doubts the scale of the challenges that we face need only cast their minds back to the debate in New York at the summit on the millennium development goals. The right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill was right to celebrate the optimistic elements of that summit, and I do not wish to be a naysayer. However, the MDG report by the United Nations highlighted the fact that the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day in sub-Saharan Africa is unlikely to be reduced by the target of 50 per cent. A quarter of all children in developing countries are considered to be underweight and at risk of their future being blighted by the long-term effects of under-nourishment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="81113-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08111373000686">This debate is not primarily about the MDGs. The global meltdown in the financial markets almost completely overshadowed the summit at the time, but we need to bring back the issues considered to the forefront of public debate. Renewed efforts must be made to try to ensure that we regain some of the momentum that we had towards reaching those targets and our broader development goals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="81113-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08111373000687">As both Front Benchers have so far indicated, there is a strong appetite among the public to try to understand our development objectives. High standards are always demanded when we spend taxpayers&#146; money. Some people are even questioning our commitment to the level of support we give. Some do so directly, because they think we should spend the money here at home, and some do so indirectly, because they do not support the specific goals being funded. On the first point, as I said a moment ago, at the moment we offer a tiny proportion of our wealth as a country. On the second, I do not believe that anybody should tolerate corruption and we must be rigorous in tackling it.</p>

I hope that the Department will take them as challenges to improve. On balance, I think we would all accept that DFID always seeks to tackle overseas development and to eradicate corruption, but it would be presenting a false picture if we were to suggest that there was not still a major problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="81113-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08111373000689">In our debates, we often focus on how much assistance we give. Equally, we know the costs of delivering development assistance in an inefficient or ineffective way. There are real perils if we turn a blind eye to corruption. Progress might indeed be grindingly slow, but the debate about the &#147;How?&#148; rather than just the &#147;How much?&#148; of international development is not new. The Paris declaration, followed up in Accra a few months ago, put the spotlight on that. The subheading of the declaration in 2005 illustrated the size of the challenge facing donors and recipients. Seeking to increase the effectiveness of our aid, the signatories highlighted their commitment to promoting ownership, harmonisation, alignment, results and mutual accountability. Transparency is the theme that runs through each of those ideas.</p>

Although the Accra agenda for action welcomed the improvements that we have seen in areas such as the co-ordination of donor funding, it outlined the need for urgent action on country ownership, increased efforts to build more inclusive partnerships for development and a more results-oriented and accountable approach to aid, all to help to ensure that we meet our commitments on aid effectiveness within the agreed time frame.</p>

 Like some of the previous speakers, I have visited Uganda with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association on a cross-party visit. Like others speakers, I came back with vivid memories of the country. Yes, there was an enormous amount of poverty there, which I will come to in a moment, but surprisingly, in parts of Kampala, and on the road between the airport and the capital city, there were obvious examples of large amounts of wealth. One day, a number of us flew to a refugee camp in the Gulu province. As has been mentioned, we sat around a mud hut where there were people suffering the effects of malnutrition. There was very little food, and people were getting what they could from the UN agencies. People faced the constant threat of being robbed or raped at gunpoint by the Lord&#146;s Resistance Army and other terrorist organisations. There was something particularly surprising about that scene because when one sees such images on the television, one naturally assumes that they are of refugee camps out in the middle of nowhere, but just a few miles down the road, we were able to drive into a fully functioning town with paved roads, its own radio station, and a bustling market. We were treated to a banquet, which all the local dignitaries attended, at which we discussed the fact that not enough aid was getting through and that there was not enough transparency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="81113-0017.htm_para26"><a name="08111373000711">Another day, back in Kampala, we were treated to an official dinner by the Ugandan Government&#151;another great big banquet, with course after course in the Sheraton or perhaps the Hilton. Once again, we nodded over coffee and ice cream, and agreed that there was not enough aid coming through to African countries, and that there was not enough transparency. Afterwards, I wandered outside for some reason, and I saw a long line of sleek, black Mercedes-Benz with chauffeurs. Doubtless, if I had been able to go over and talk to them&#151;they were there to collect Members of Parliament and Ministers who attended the dinner&#151;and if they were minded to exchange small-talk, they, too, would have agreed that there was not enough aid coming through to central Africa and that there was not enough transparency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="81113-0017.htm_para27"><a name="08111373000712">I wanted to discuss those issues with DFID in Uganda, and I was looking forward to meeting its officials when we visited the British embassy, but there was no sign of DFID there.

in that part of Africa have been. Millions of pounds have been spent on it, because it is a huge security risk and terrorist target. It is quite right that the money has been spent, but there was no sign of DFID in the embassy. It did not like being there, and wanted to be elsewhere, so it had rooms on the other side of Kampala in a luxury suite of offices&#151;a first-world building in a third-world country for which, I am sure, the British taxpayer paid first-world prices. I looked forward to speaking to the head of DFID in Uganda and asking him about transparency and why we were not saving money by locating the Department in the British embassy. However, I could not do so, because he was busy doing something else. He was doing important things&#151;too important to speak to a cross-party group of Members of Parliament representing the taxpayers who paid his salary. We were not told what he was doing, but it was made quite clear to us by his deputy that our appearance in Kampala was somewhat inconvenient. Perhaps the Minister will pass on our apologies for troubling them when he next visits the place. However, I never found out much when I was in Uganda.</p>

 No. If the Minister cares to look at what I just said, I made a factual comment. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Hang on, will the Minister listen to me for a moment? I made a factual comment about the head of DFID in Uganda who was not able to see us on a cross-party visit with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in 2006. If he wants to check his facts, I am more than happy for him to do so. What I am giving is a factual statement, and I am not making any comment about DFID members of staff in other parts of the world. The Minister had better check the record, and perhaps he will apologise to me when he has done so and realises that his comments were a complete misrepresentation of what I said. I do not believe, however, that members of DFID are risking their lives in Kampala. They would do so if they went to northern Uganda and Gulu province, but they are based in a first-world office block in Kampala. No doubt, they go to that province on occasion, but it is not where they are based, and Kampala is not a particularly dangerous place. If it was, I was risking my life, along with other Members of Parliament, many of them in the Chamber today, who have been there.</p>

Now, I shall give the Minister credit for one thing, which is that DFID&#146;s mission statement, when compared with most Departments&#146;, is&#151;surprisingly&#151;absolutely clear and, I might add, a refreshing change. Its website states that DFID is all about handling Britain&#146;s aid to the world&#146;s poorest countries, so I looked through the list of places where DFID has offices, and I was surprised to find that among the places that are presumably considered poor are Paris, Vienna, Geneva and Brussels.

States of America obviously suffers from a great deal of poverty, because it has two DFID offices, one in Washington and one in New York.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="81113-0018.htm_para1"><a name="08111373000716">I should like to know from the Minister why we have a base in sunny Barbados, where the average GDP is $19,000 per head. It also benefits from the munificence of the British taxpayers and the presence of a DFID office, which, the website states, is there to draw up regional development plans. No doubt if any staff take offence at my speech, they will demand that I come over and see how hard they are working. I might be available around about Christmas time, if the Minister wants to sanction that one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="81113-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08111373000717">There are other offices about which I have questions, and other Members have already mentioned some. Those offices are located in cities in Brazil, South Africa, Thailand and Russia. Poverty exists in all those countries, there is no doubt about it, but those countries also have huge amounts of wealth. They are not really the poorest of the poor, but countries where, if there were a will, something could be done about the existing poverty. In the case of Russia in particular, I find it extraordinary that, on the one hand, we make bellicose statements to its Government about what they have done in South Ossetia, even though it now appears that the whole thing was started by another country, while, on the other, we hand out aid to them. It seems to be a remarkable contradiction. Yes, people are dying of tuberculosis in India, and that is an absolute tragedy, but there are people dying of starvation in British hospitals, and that is also an absolute tragedy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="81113-0018.htm_para3"><a name="08111373000718">The fact is that we should send our aid to countries where we can make a difference. Why on earth, therefore, do we bother to send millions of pounds in aid to China, for heaven&#146;s sake? China is likely to overtake America as one of the world&#146;s great superpowers over the next few decades; it is spending millions of pounds on its space programme and on its nuclear weapons; it has just announced that it is going to try to build a bigger navy than America&#146;s; and, irony of ironies, we saw plenty of evidence of China&#146;s own aid programme in Uganda, where it is building Government offices. We give money to the Chinese, and the Chinese give their money to African nations, securing all sorts of concessions in return. The idea that in 20 or 30 years&#146; time, the Chinese, as one of the world&#146;s pre-eminent superpowers, will look back and think, &#147;Oh, we&#146;ll treat the British slightly differently because they gave us what in relative terms was a small amount of money,&#148; just shows the left-wing, colonial and patronising attitude that is all too prevalent in some parts of the Government and, dare I say it, in Departments. They think that because we give out relatively small amounts of money, somebody is going to care or remember in a few decades&#146; time. It is complete and utter naivet&#233;, and as someone who has a Chinese family, I can assure the House that the Chinese must be laughing up their sleeves at it.</p>

We can argue all day about whether that budget should increase, but we should all agree that it should be spent as wisely as possible. I am suggesting that rather than having 80 offices all around the world in places such as Paris, Geneva and Brussels, we concentrate on a dozen or two dozen of the very poorest countries in the world, perhaps those with previous links to Britain.

The Minister gets angry when anyone criticises his Department, but I tell him that the role of a Member of Parliament, who is elected by taxpayers, is to ask difficult questions about how Government money is spent. I have a concern about the attitude of some DFID members of staff&#151;not least because of my own experiences, but also because of the experiences of constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="81113-0018.htm_para6"><a name="08111373000729">I recently met a retired eye surgeon from Abergavenny. Over the years, he had done some work in Ethiopia. Having retired, he wanted to work for free. This was not some naive 21-year-old just out of university knocking on the door and asking to work on an aid programme, but a retired eye surgeon who wanted to give up his time for free and start a project training people to undertake basic surgery to enable people with certain eye diseases to see again. He told me that he got no help whatever from DFID and was treated as something of an inconvenience. The very idea that Government money could be given to an individual, even one with enormous skills and expertise, to do what the mission statement says the Department is all about, was simply incomprehensible to the officials involved. I believe the gentleman concerned because he is highly respected and because he went out and set up the charity himself. He is now training people in Ethiopia to go out and give people their sight back. In other words, he is exactly the sort of person whom we should be supporting but were not able to&#151;presumably because people were busy drawing up action plans instead of giving practical help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="81113-0018.htm_para7"><a name="08111373000730">My points are that we are spread too thinly across the world and that we are in many of the wrong places. Many of the countries in which we are present are perfectly able to help themselves if they wish to and our presence will not make any difference to their foreign policy over the next few decades. If we concentrated our efforts on 12 or 20 of the poorest of the poor countries of the world, we could make a significant difference to people&#146;s lives.</p>

 I certainly do not intend to try to follow that pub rant from the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies), which seems to be considerably at odds with the views of the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell) and gives a degree of discomfort to the idea that we have a modern, reformed, liberal-minded Conservative party that wants to engage in these issues. Of course, there is an entirely reasonable debate to be had about how DFID should deploy its staff and its resources and in how many countries, and what its priorities are. My Committee, the International Development Committee, regards its prime function as to call the Department to account, challenge it on its policies and make constructive recommendations, which I hope that we do.</p>

measurable result, but we must try to do it, as far as possible, for exactly the reasons that have been stated&#151;to reassure taxpayers at home that the money is being spent effectively to achieve the objectives and to reassure people in the countries on the receiving end that their Governments are using the money to good effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="81113-0018.htm_para9"><a name="08111373000733">As I understand it, a significant aspect of providing direct budget support is to try to enable the developing country to build up the capacity to control its own budget and expenditure and to deliver services, ultimately to the point at which the revenues that are generated allow the development support to be phased out and withdrawn. Whenever my Committee and I visit DFID offices in various countries, we always ask the staff to what extent their budget is being distributed under direct budget support, and what engagement they have with the people with whom they are working in government to ensure that as far as possible&#151;allowing for the fact that it is their choice, not ours, what the money is delivered for&#151;it is being spent properly. That is a difficult ask, and the situation needs to be consistently and constantly monitored and improved. Several of the Government&#146;s initiatives represent at least an attempt to put in place processes and procedures that will improve the quality of that process. I do not think that they will be offended if I say that we have some way to go, but that is not necessarily to suggest that we are doing the wrong things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="81113-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08111373000734">The hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield expressed concern about some of the countries that are receiving direct budget support and suggested that our Committee might investigate that, and we are happy to discuss whether and how we might do so in future. I assure him that we continually discuss and ask about direct budget support. We are going to visit Kenya and Tanzania in pursuit of our inquiry into sustainable development in a changing climate, but also with an awareness that Tanzania is the largest recipient of direct budget support in Africa. The Committee will want to ask about that and try to provide reassurance, which I hope might be helpful to the Department as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="81113-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08111373000735">The new Administration in the United States should not be lost sight of in this context. The US Congress and the present Administration have argued that they do not approve of direct budget support and will not give it. It is sometimes argued that they are hiding behind the idea that congressional rules will not allow it, but Congress has the capacity to change its rules. It has been suggested that under the new Administration the United States might be willing to move, albeit gently, towards giving direct budget support in partnership and co-ordination with other donors, and we must not say anything that deters them from doing that. We should not say that it is fundamentally wrong, only that it is challenging and that we must ensure that it is effectively delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="81113-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08111373000736">Indeed, it is in that context that co-ordination among donors is important. If we can get all the European donors, the United States, Canada and perhaps even Japan to agree to a set of rules, or even to channel aid through the same vehicles, as we are trying to do in Afghanistan, there will be a much greater chance of delivering better accountability, better transparency and better quality aid, and we will do so in such a way that the country on the receiving end will have the capacity to absorb aid more effectively.</p>

 Will the Chairman of the Select Committee make two particular inquiries about direct budgetary support transparency? First, my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell) mentioned substitution, whereby giving aid to a country allows their leaders to spend money on jets, for example, which is undesirable. Secondly, will the right hon. Gentleman examine how much money is getting to the projects it is supposed to support on the ground, rather than being creamed off in corruption at the centre?</p>

<p><a name="st_o383"><a name="08111373000738"><a name="81113-0018.htm_spnew10"><a name="08111373001331"><b>Malcolm Bruce:</b>
 I am perfectly happy to do that, but I can also assure the hon. Gentleman that those are the sort of questions that we have asked. On Uganda, about which questions have been raised, it is interesting that the Ugandan Government had an agreement with the community about money being spent on education in which they undertook to nail on the school door a breakdown of the budget allocated, where it was coming from and how it would be spent so that the community could monitor the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="81113-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08111373000739">That brings me to my second point: we have to develop countries&#146; capacity to monitor their own expenditure effectively. That means working with Parliaments and with civic society. When we have a debate about ownership of aid and development by developing countries, we have to understand clearly that we are talking about ownership not only by the Government, but as far as possible, by the people. We need to give Parliaments information that allows them to call their Governments to account, and work with civic society to challenge MPs and inform the public. That is probably the best defence against money being misappropriated, although we have to accept that in many cases it will take many years for a strong and sophisticated capacity of that sort to develop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="81113-0018.htm_para14"><a name="08111373000740">It has sometimes been argued that there is a sort of perverse, inverse relationship between aid and development. Professor Collier calls it the Dutch disease; he asserts that in some cases, the more aid a country is given, the less responsive it is&#151;the poorer it gets, in other words. His argument is that the purchase of local currency creates a drain, which cannot be offset if there is no strong economy. To counter that, I would say that his is an argument for ensuring that the aid is of high quality and is well targeted, not an argument for not giving the aid.</p>

<p><a name="st_o384"><a name="08111373000741"><a name="81113-0018.htm_spnew11"><a name="08111373001332"><b>Mr. Tom Clarke:</b>
 The right hon. Gentleman is making an interesting speech. On Uganda, I remind him that during the visit I mentioned earlier, we had the opportunity to meet the Minister of Finance. He opened the books, and one of the most glaring aspects of what he told us was debt repayment. It was absolutely astonishing. We found that developed countries were already benefiting a great deal from the poorest countries in the world, and given the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s experience, I am sure that he would want to acknowledge the progress that we have made in that field.</p>

 I do. It is always difficult when one gets drawn into a detailed debate about an individual country, because of the complexity within. It is absolutely true that debt repayment, and in some cases the liquidation of that debt, has been a key part of the process. At the end of the day, it is important that future arrangements  <br>

do not sink into that sort of relationship. Countries should be able to borrow, but on their own terms, not unfair terms, and with debts that can be properly serviced, not what might be called odious debt. We must avoid returning to that situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="81113-0018.htm_para15"><a name="08111373000743">Two or three topical concerns have already been raised, but one has not been, and it is one on which I suspect the Minister cannot make any immediate comment. I was somewhat horrified, just before I came into the Chamber, to see John Ging being interviewed live from Gaza on BBC News 24, saying that 750,000 people there are desperately in need of food aid from the United Nations Works and Relief Agency, and that they have had no supplies delivered since yesterday. He says that the food is on the Israeli side of the border and that the Israelis are refusing to allow it to pass, which is contrary to their international obligations and the law, which permits humanitarian relief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="81113-0018.htm_para16"><a name="08111373000744">I hope that the Under-Secretary will at least use his good offices to ensure that the UK applies appropriate pressure so that the food gets through. Those who need it are mostly destitute women and children and unemployed men, who have no other form of income in a small territory where there is no other food to be had. That is not usually the case&#151;even in the poorest countries, it is amazing how food can sometimes be obtained. However, given that Gaza is shut in, the problem is serious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="81113-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08111373000745">Yesterday, members of the Committee had the opportunity to ask the Secretary of State about the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We did not get a clear answer&#151;he undertook to write to us&#151;about the reason for the extent of the delay in reaching some people, or even identifying them. It was disturbing to read about and see television pictures of people who had had no food for two or three days, and sometimes up to six days. Clearly, the consequences do not require stressing in the Chamber.</p>

 The problem is that people are not fleeing to semi-established or established camps. They are fleeing, in the clothes that they stand up in, into a most inhospitable jungle territory. That is why it is taking so long to get desperately needed support to those who are suffering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="81113-0018.htm_para18"><a name="08111373000748">Several of us attended the round-table briefing about Afghanistan, which brought us up to date, at the Foreign Office this morning. The results of a BBC poll, based on a stark and rather silly question, were published yesterday and showed that 68 per cent. of the British people wanted our troops to be withdrawn within a year. The question did not provide any context, but revealed a problem. Liberal Democrat Members&#151;and, I believe, most Members&#151;believe that engagement with Afghanistan is necessary. It is in the interests of British security and right for the people of Afghanistan, even if it is a difficult and challenging place to be. There are concerns about the way in which we communicate that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para0"><a name="08111373000749">It is understandable, given that the United Kingdom&#146;s military commitment is in Helmand and that significant numbers of men and women in our armed forces are dying in that engagement, that the British people question  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="13 Nov 2008">

<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column 1043</b><br>
the reason for putting our troops in harm&#146;s way to that extent in such a far-away place. That tends to lead to an exclusive focus on what happens in Helmand, and does not take into account the fact that Afghanistan is a substantial country, and that not everywhere is in the same position as Helmand. Indeed, approximately 75 to 80 per cent. of British aid and development expenditure happens in other parts of the country through the national Government to help achieve important development objectives, such as getting children, including more than 2 million girls, back into school, and impressively providing at least basic health care throughout the country. Other objectives include improving communications and roads and are mostly financed by the United States. In other words, the picture is not all negative and bad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08111373000750">The nature of society in Afghanistan means that it has never had a unified Government and bureaucracy running the entire country. It has always been run through some form of agency&#151;local leaders, warlords, tribal chiefs and so on. It is therefore not surprising that that continues to happen to some extent. It does not mean that the country is not being governed, that state money is not being properly spent or that services are not reaching the people. However, as our Committee found when we visited, the people of Afghanistan are all too often unaware of what is happening. It is simple for a local governor to pretend that all the largesse&#151;it is not much largesse; we are considering a very poor country&#151;is somehow his creation rather than something that has come from the central Government. Similarly, central Government want to claim the credit, rather than admit that the help comes from the international community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para2"><a name="08111373000751">That is a dilemma. It is a problem if we cannot win the Afghan people&#146;s hearts and minds and show them that we are in a genuine partnership&#151;a partnership between the international community and the people, to try to achieve the stability and ability to develop that they want, and between the people of our country and Afghanistan to enable it to build up a viable state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para3"><a name="08111373000752">That is a challenge for us, but we all have a responsibility to fulfil it, at least so that the great sacrifices of our forces will have been made not in vain or for a failed project, but for one that, however difficult, might ultimately be achieved. I suggest&#151;I say this with the Secretary of State in his place once more&#151;that there is scope for more explanation of the interaction between the military and DFID in Afghanistan and of how things work. Those of us who are engaged in the debate understand that, but even in the House and certainly among the wider public, there is a lack of understanding about how those aspects interact. There is a form of transparency that is not about just money, but about understanding aims and objectives and what is happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para4"><a name="08111373000753">The Secretary of State quite understandably mentioned the undertakings that were made in Accra and has probably read, as I have, Simon Maxwell&#146;s blog. Having honestly said that he was not sure what Accra was all about when he went, Simon Maxwell paid tribute to the Secretary of State for the energy that he had expended in trying to secure an agreement that contained real commitments, rather than just platitudinous statements, which is what people told the Committee they feared it  <br>

would contain when we visited earlier in the year. I am happy to share that acknowledgment. As Simon Maxwell also said, it is fine to get a lot of countries signing up to a big commitment, but people will want to see what that means in terms of ownership and buy-in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para5"><a name="08111373000754">That leads me back&#151;I am happy to conclude on this point&#151;to the relationship between the donors and the developing countries and the people living there. The reason why DFID was created as a distinct Department was to separate foreign policy from development and to focus on poverty reduction, so that development policy would not be compromised by being an instrument of foreign policy or by commercial interests. That has been a success, both in persuading the British people that our aid programme is worthy of support and in determining our approach, which has helped DFID to achieve a position of leadership throughout the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para6"><a name="08111373000755">I must also echo what the Under-Secretary said. The entire staff of DFID comprise about 2,500 people, which includes foreign nationals employed in overseas office. That core&#151;the UK part of it, at least&#151;is under the same strictures of staff reduction as staff in other Departments are. That is a challenge for the Department and there is no doubt a shortage of expertise. There are ways around the problem, ingenious or not, that need to be pursued. There are also questions about how one might prioritise&#151;in terms not only of money, but of staff&#151;what we do and do not do, both sectorally and in individual countries.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman makes a good point about the constraints on numbers that operate across Whitehall, including DFID. Let me reiterate that we think it is absolutely absurd that DFID staffing figures are being restricted at a time when the budget is rising significantly. The staffing level should be set to meet that rising budget, not the reverse.</p>

 I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. The Committee has not completed its report this year, but we certainly acknowledge the pressures and have expressed our concerns. The permanent secretary is obviously constrained by the rules across Government, but she conceded that the Department was struggling. That is something that we should take to heart.</p>

Whenever our Committee visits countries in which we have an engaged programme, we visit DFID. I am sure that other Committees visit their relevant Departments. We usually get an extremely thorough, detailed briefing from the DFID office, showing what is being spent, what the priorities are, the breakdown, and an honest question and answer session. A lot of that information could be in the public domain. It would help if we could go to the website and find out exactly what the budget is and what the priorities are in more detail and in a more up-to-date way. That would  <br>

make the website more interactively beneficial and the Department more transparent. It could address some of the concerns: it is not that people are against what is being done; they just do not know what is being done, which makes them either suspicious or inclined to ask questions. Will the Secretary of State consider whether more could be done to make the information more accessible and transparent?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para9"><a name="08111373000760">The Committee&#146;s report looked at how we as a country and the international donor community could work more effectively together. It became clear in that process that how effectively we can work depends on whom we are working with. The Committee, in choosing which of our European partners to have a dialogue with, made a journey from Rome to Berlin to Copenhagen and then, via video link, to Stockholm. Not to put too fine a point on it, I am glad that we did it in that order, because the reverse process would have been deeply depressing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para10"><a name="08111373000761">The reality, as far as I can see, is that the Italians have pretty well opted out of supporting the commitment to international aid and development. The previous Italian Government were in the process of setting up their own development agency; the present Italian Government have abandoned it. I am grateful that they are continuing to support the multi-national organisations, but that is probably about saving face among their peers. They support the Rome-based institutions but, beyond that, there is very little commitment.</p>

We are definitely like-minded and work together. Doing so can have a huge impact in driving the right kind of development. By that, I mean development that is designed to reduce poverty, to give poor people in developing countries a degree of ownership and control over the quality of aid and development, and to help them to call their Governments to account. In that way, they can be part of the process of lifting themselves out of poverty and achieving the success and development that they have been denied for so long, but which they richly deserve.</p>

However, the agenda clearly has a long way to run to establish good linkage between, on the one hand, the high-level rhetoric that we use in the Chamber about development, the commitment to tackling poverty around the world, and the nature of our interventions and assistance, and, on the other hand, the hard outcomes such as the lives saved, the children educated, and all the things that members of the public would understand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para14"><a name="08111373000766">The second backdrop is the current economic crisis, which is not just a crisis for the developed world, but very much for the developing world, too. Other Members may not share my experience, but I am no longer receiving any letters or e-mails from constituents urging me to do more to tackle global poverty. When I was elected three and a half years ago, I was flooded with postcards, campaign letters and e-mails as part of the &#147;Make Poverty History&#148; campaign. The agenda has moved on, so where we agree on the promise to give 0.7 per cent. of our gross national income in overseas assistance and to do more to tackle global poverty, it is now incumbent on us to remake the case for more and better aid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para15"><a name="08111373000767">There is still a cross-party consensus on this issue, but the mood of the public has changed discernibly and understandably, at a time when many of my constituents are fearful of losing their jobs, when many jobs are being lost up and down the country and when people are having their homes repossessed. Quite rightly, their first thoughts and concerns are about their immediate livelihoods. There remains a huge amount of public good will and residual support for doing more to tackle global poverty, but it is understandable that people&#146;s immediate concerns have moved on. We have to remake the case, as I said, for this rather large and quick ramping up of overseas aid spending that the Secretary of State has announced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para16"><a name="08111373000768">Let me deal briefly with a couple of other points. On aid to China and India, if hon. Members of any party choose to question whether continuing our overseas aid programmes to those countries is the best use of our resources, particularly given that they are both making big strides towards reaching middle-income status, that does not necessarily imply that they are any less committed to tackling global poverty. It is arrogant, however, to believe that the &#163;40 million or &#163;50 million of overseas aid that we give to China each year makes a jot of difference to the country&#146;s progress towards reducing poverty. Its success in doing so is almost all down to the remarkable economic growth rates that the country has achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para17"><a name="08111373000769">I do not agree that we should cut our aid programme to India, on the other hand, because the country still has the world&#146;s largest concentration of poor people, and a third of the poorest. We will need a substantial programme in India for some time to come. We can still ask about the nature of our programme and whether enough goes to support judicial or police effectiveness, for example, which might do more to reduce the propensity towards communal violence that we saw this summer when the Christian community was attacked in Orissa state. Those sort of measures might help to further India&#146;s trajectory of growth and rising prosperity, but I  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para18"><a name="08111373000770">I want to conclude with some points about Zimbabwe. In last week&#146;s International Development questions, my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) asked about aid to Zimbabwe, and the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis) replied:</p>
<a name="81113-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="08111373000899"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The aid that we give to Zimbabwe goes directly to the United Nations and does not go through any governmental organisations within Zimbabwe.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 5 November 2008; Vol. 482, c. 238.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para19"><a name="08111373000771">He and Ministers before him have gone to great lengths to demonstrate to the House and the public that we have not supported Mugabe&#146;s regime with overseas aid. However, the answer he provided to my hon. Friend did not paint quite the whole picture. He tried to maintain that our aid does not go through any of the Zimbabwe governmental organisations, but the global fund&#151;a multilateral initiative to which we are a major donor; we have some leverage over its policy&#151;is about to make a very substantial contribution to Zimbabwe. It is going to be deposited directly in the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, which is controlled by one of Mugabe&#146;s henchmen. It is entirely legitimate to raise that issue in the context of wanting greater transparency about the aid we give to that country. I hope that when the Minister concludes the debate he will return to this point and clarify whether he is satisfied that an adequate assessment has been made of the risk attached to this considerable sum of money, which the Government of Zimbabwe will shortly receive.</p>

 Holding the Government to account is the job and the responsibility of us Opposition Members. It is also our duty. Scrutinising overseas aid effectiveness today, given the economic crisis that we are experiencing in our own country, is therefore of paramount importance.</p>

After 10 years in power, they have become truly arrogant. That could be seen in the way in which they have behaved during the debate. My hon. Friends and I have tried to raise a number of important issues, but in my three and a half years as a Member of Parliament I have never seen a Minister behave as the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis) has behaved today. The constant laughter sounds like someone strangling a cat; it is a very strange laugh. I have never seen any behaviour like that.

That is simply wrong. Whatever happened to Robin Cook&#146;s ethical foreign policy? China has the fastest-growing economy in the world. Its expenditure on arms is the second largest in the world. It has a major space project and a huge, thriving economy. Why we are giving money to China at a time when our own constituents are suffering&#151;at a time when our own constituents are not receiving life-saving medical treatment and operations&#151;is simply beyond me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para23"><a name="08111373000780">India has the largest number of billionaires in the world. It has nuclear weapons, and is experiencing huge economic expansion. Moreover, many Indian companies are currently buying up United Kingdom companies.</p>

The fact that we are giving aid to Russia is simply unacceptable. When I tell my constituents that we are still giving aid to Russia, they look at me in bewilderment. They simply do not understand how we as a country can afford to do that. As I have said before, our country is borrowing &#163;40 billion this year alone just to keep our budget afloat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para25"><a name="08111373000782">In a very long speech, the Secretary of State did not refer to the European Union once.

I have no doubt that some of the work that the EU does is important and vital, but I shall be asking the Chairman of the Select Committee to invite the relevant Commissioner from Brussels to come before our Committee to explain to us how the EU budget is spent.

One which took me aback was that the President of Congo-Brazzaville has many luxury apartments in Paris and Monte Carlo. Why does <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> and other media cover this? It is simply because it sells newspapers. Why does it sell newspapers? Because it is a travesty; it is strange for the President of Congo-Brazzaville to have yachts in Monte Carlo and luxury flats in some of the best residential parts of Paris while aid is going to that country. Is the Secretary of State raising the issues directly with the President of Congo-Brazzaville?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="81113-0019.htm_para29"><a name="08111373000788">The King of Swaziland has bought a huge luxury jet.

He spent the equivalent of all our aid that we gave to Swaziland on his 36th birthday party. I find that simply unacceptable when I am fighting tooth and nail for life-saving drugs for my constituents. That is why it is so important to hold the Government to account on these matters.</p>

our aid is properly scrutinised and audited, and that there should be a proper, independent audit watchdog. That is paramount to Conservative party policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="81113-0020.htm_para7"><a name="08111373000802">A number of things have been said about how and where our aid is spent, and which countries receive it. My hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) mentioned Russia and the fact that it has built up a sovereign wealth fund of $500 billion. I think that the British Government have now stopped all aid to Russia, but I ask the Minister to confirm that. I am sure that my hon. Friend will welcome it, if it is true. Of course, the Conservatives also wish to curtail UK aid to China. In no way do we wish to resile from our 0.7 per cent. target, but we simply feel that a country such as China, which has a GNI that works out at more than $2,500 a head, should be coping with its own problems from its own huge surplus. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire that the UK should continue to give aid to India, because it has the greatest concentration of poor people on earth; it will shortly have more poor people than the whole of sub-Saharan Africa put together. It must be right that we continue to give aid to that country.</p>

If we cannot encourage the international community to come up with a solution to dreadful problems such as the vast suffering in the Congo, in Darfur, which was mentioned by my neighbour, the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), in Zimbabwe, which has been mentioned by other speakers, and in Burma, which my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield mentioned, intervening at an earlier stage on the basis of the doctrine of the responsibility to protect, which was introduced by the United Nations in 2005, that doctrine will shortly mean very little. All in the civilised world need to pay close attention to that.</p>

Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore), on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, was right to mention President-elect Obama. We were delighted by that outcome and, like the Secretary of State and the Government, we look forward to a positive agenda and relationship with the incoming Administration. In that connection, there are two important multilateral discussions going on. The hon. Gentleman mentioned one&#151;the trade round in Doha. The third world&#151;the poorest people on earth&#151;has more to gain from a successful Doha round than do richer nations. Therefore, it is important that we breathe new life into those negotiations. To all those countries and areas&#151;India, the US, the EU and Argentina, for example&#151;that have, at some point in the negotiations, put up blocks that have meant that the negotiations have not so far succeeded, we say that they need to be prepared to compromise so that we can have a successful round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="81113-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08111373000805">The Government could give those talks much more impetus.

is important to try to reach agreement on those, because if we do not manage to agree on carbon emissions&#151;and limit the increase in external world temperature to just 2 per cent. in the next 50 years&#151;world temperatures may spiral much higher. To put that threat in context, I would point out that the last ice age was only 5° below the present temperature. Again, it will be some of the poorest countries on earth that will suffer, and we have begun to see that in famine, flood, tsunamis and other events attached to climate change.</p>

As the Secretary of State said, aid funding is up to 75 per cent. of the national budget in some countries. Indeed, in Rwanda, which several of us visited in the summer, total development aid is about 50 per cent. That is undesirable. We should give these countries a hand-up so that they can start to wean themselves off international help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="81113-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08111373000809">The right hon. Gentleman mentioned Afghanistan, a country that needs more of a hand-up than most. This morning, he and I attended a round-table conference at the Foreign Office on Afghanistan, and one theme that emerged was that the international effort there is not being disseminated to the public very well. If our constituents only see the worst coming out of Afghanistan, they will be very sceptical about our efforts. The right hon. Gentleman was right to say that what the public do see is very Helmand-centric. However, there are many things happening, not least of which is the number of girls going back to school, which is wholly to be welcomed. Other positives include the number of roads and hospitals being built, which are very welcome indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="81113-0020.htm_para15"><a name="08111373000810">My hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire made some important points, not least about the world economic situation. At a time when we are all running into deeper and deeper economic problems, even recession, it is regrettable that several countries are thinking about reducing their international aid efforts. The Chairman of the Select Committee mentioned the possibility that Italy will do so. That is highly regrettable. If we are to make proper progress with some of the world&#146;s worst problems, we have to bear that in mind. We all want to meet the millennium development goals that were mentioned by the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill, but we are a long way off meeting some of them&#151;most notably the goals on universal education and climate change. That is highly regrettable. We should breathe more life into that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="81113-0020.htm_para16"><a name="08111373000811">As I said at the beginning of my speech, if the doctrine of responsibility to protect is to be worth anything, we have to find solutions to the dreadful problems in such places as the DRC, Zimbabwe and Darfur. It should not be beyond the wit of the civilised western world in the 21st century to find solutions to those problems and to intervene at an earlier stage, so that hundreds of thousands of people are not displaced  <br>

 On the whole, this has been a high-quality debate. I want to reiterate what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said about the importance of maintaining global support for development despite the economic downturn. Now is not the time for either the United Kingdom or our international partners to turn our backs on the world&#146;s poorest people. As developing countries are hit by the global economic downturn, they need our support more than ever, and we need theirs. If we are to tackle global challenges such as climate change, resource shortages and growing demands for energy, we will not be able to do it alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="81113-0020.htm_para17"><a name="08111373000813">Now is not the time to undermine confidence and support among the British people in investment in development, either in pursuit of a cheap headline or as a manifestation of a future hidden agenda. It is essential that we work together with developing countries and that we keep our promises to deliver more and better aid and to meet the millennium development goals by 2015. In order to do that, donors need to make sure that every penny we spend is put to the best possible use. As my right hon. Friend said when he opened the debate, DFID is playing a key role in improving the effectiveness of our aid and ensuring that other donors provide aid as effectively as we do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="81113-0020.htm_para18"><a name="08111373000814">Our leadership at Accra meant that developing countries can now expect to receive longer-term support from donors that is better co-ordinated and makes better use of their budget systems. We secured agreements that donors and developing countries would hold each other more accountable for the use of aid and we pushed hard to improve the global transparency of aid through the international aid transparency initiative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="81113-0020.htm_para19"><a name="08111373000815">We are leading by example. We have already met seven of the 10 Paris declaration targets on aid effectiveness and are on track to meet the remaining three. We have developed an independent advisory committee on development impact to provide a serious challenge function to DFID&#146;s work, with independent membership and National Audit Office observation. We have strong systems in place to control and monitor the expenditure of UK aid and are supporting developing countries in their efforts to fight corruption. By putting such measures in place, we can be confident that UK aid is having the greatest possible impact. Later this month, we will once again be at the forefront of the fight against poverty at the financing for development conference in Doha.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="81113-0020.htm_para20"><a name="08111373000816">Let me turn to the contributions that have been made during the course of the debate. First, the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell) took the opportunity, once again, to describe DFID as a world leader in the field of development. I thank him for recognising that on behalf of all those who work incredibly hard on the front line in some of the poorest countries in the world. His comments were in stark contrast to some of the contributions made by Back-Bench Members of his party. He said that we should remove this subject from the realm of party politics. As a new member of this  <br>

team, I am delighted to see that we appear to have political consensus on the importance of this country&#146;s leadership in international development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="81113-0020.htm_para21"><a name="08111373000817">Equally, I would say that the Conservative party has a record and form from the time it was in government. It is also true&#151;let us make it clear&#151;that this Government and, more specifically, this Prime Minister have led the world in demanding that the richest countries fulfil their responsibility to the poor. That is not party politics, but a statement of fact in a world where people ask every day, &#147;Does politics make a difference? Are politicians all the same?&#148; Well, this is one area where we have not been all the same: we would not be leading the world in international development if we had not had a Labour Government in power for 11 years and a Labour Prime Minister who has this matter at the heart of his moral compass.</p>

 May I gently say to the Minister that people watching him make these remarks will regard them as disgraceful? We are talking about some of the poorest people and most difficult issues on the planet and he is playing party politics. I have made very clear the Conservative party&#146;s stance on the matter, as well as our commitment to the aid budget.</p>

<p><a name="st_o405"><a name="08111373000819"><a name="81113-0020.htm_spnew6"><a name="08111373001353"><b>Mr. Lewis:</b>
 I very much welcomed the contribution made by the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield, who speaks on these matters for the Opposition, and the fair way that he paid tribute to DFID&#146;s work. That was my starting point, but I am proud of the fact that international development demonstrates most clearly the virtues of having a Government who have at heart a commitment to social justice, both in this country and around the world. I do not apologise for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="81113-0020.htm_para22"><a name="08111373000820">The term &#147;no strings attached&#148; was used in the debate, but the string between the Opposition Front and Back Benches is so thin that it causes me serious concern. I shall say for one last time that the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies) has every right to raise concerns about getting access to DFID staff in a particular country. If he felt slighted that a member of staff was not available at the time, I apologise&#151;although I do not know the details, and there may well have been good reasons for that. However, I have to say from this Dispatch Box that I will not tolerate his using that incident to cast aspersions on the commitment of our staff, who are often working in the most difficult circumstances in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="81113-0020.htm_para23"><a name="08111373000821">The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) talked about DFID staff sitting in offices in capital cities, but what impression is that designed to give of the contribution that our staff make? I have worked in a number of Departments, and I have never seen a group of people so mission-driven. I am proud to work with them, but that does not mean that we cannot do better. Although we are the world leaders in this area, we can still ensure that every day we improve what we do. That is the basis for any organisation that seeks to do its best&#151;a recognition of the need to improve continually. However, I will not have the organisation that is DFID, or its staff who work so hard, demeaned and undermined in the way that has happened in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="81113-0020.htm_para24"><a name="08111373000822">May I also say to the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield that I welcome his support for the overhaul of the DFID website? He asked some valid questions about how it should operate in future, and I hope that he will give us full support in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="81113-0020.htm_para25"><a name="08111373000823">The hon. Gentleman talked about independent scrutiny, but I refer him to the work of the National Audit Office, the Public Accounts Committee and the International Development Committee. Also, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, he is required to make an annual report to Parliament&#151;in terms of independent scrutiny, that is a pretty high level of transparency in how we account for the resources that we spend in the name of the UK taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="81113-0020.htm_para26"><a name="08111373000824">I remind the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield that his party is on the record as saying that it supports budget support, and that we should go even further in future. However, he cannot give the impression that sustaining budget support will not mean that tough judgments will always have to be made, on a country-by-country basis, in very difficult circumstances and about very difficult political and security matters.</p>

 I am most grateful to the junior Minister for giving way. I have set out very clearly my party&#146;s attitude to budget support, and explained that, in principle, it is the best form of aid. However, I made it very clear why it has to be made more accountable&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> .] </i>For the second time, the Secretary of State has muttered from a sedentary position &#147;Daily Telegraph&#148;&#151;referring, I think, to an article written by the Whitehall editor in today&#146;s edition of that newspaper. Although we support the thrust of what DFID is doing, the Under-Secretary must not expect us not to investigate, debate and discuss these issues. In the context of supporting the general thrust of British development policy, it is possible to argue across the House about how best to deliver it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o407"><a name="08111373000826"><a name="81113-0020.htm_spnew8"><a name="08111373001355"><b>Mr. Lewis:</b>
 The hon.

Even a junior Opposition Member would never have used such a misleading term in an interview with a national newspaper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="81113-0020.htm_para27"><a name="08111373000827">I now turn to the contribution of my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke). I pay tribute to him for the leadership he displayed on the issue long before the mainstream majority believed that it should be a priority for the Government. I echo his point that we must maintain our commitment despite the global economic turmoil, as our Prime Minister and the Secretary of State have made clear.</p>

Of course it is right that every Government in that situation uses their power and influence to do the right thing and to try to get an immediate cessation of violence. I must correct some of the misleading impressions given in the House today. The UN Security Council has not yet agreed to the deployment of an additional 3,000 troops. It is still actively considering the offer. We believe that the priority is redeploying the 17,000 troops.

deployed, but my information is that the UN Security Council, having met on Tuesday, has not made a final decision. I also point out that this country has not expressed a view as regards the European Union. The hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield referred to the issue, but there has been no request for additional troops from a European Union member state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08111373000829">The hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore) talked about humanitarian aid. I assure him that progress is being made on that. Food deliveries continue to arrive in Goma daily. There are 20 trucks a day from Uganda, Tanzania or Rwanda. Aid agencies continue to contain cholera outbreaks across a number of towns. Emergency non-food items supplied by DFID to UNICEF will be packaged to get to those with the greatest need, and two of our humanitarian advisers have now arrived on the ground to enhance the humanitarian support available. On a daily basis, we are getting the necessary humanitarian aid to those countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para2"><a name="08111373000830">We have closely considered the issues to do with CDC, and we believe that it is abiding by the highest possible standards, as is expected, in its approach to taxation. I also say to the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk that the recent report in <i> The Observer </i>on our position on international agreements was inaccurate. It is our policy to strengthen the Committee of Experts on International Co-operation in Tax Matters, although we are not convinced that it should become an intergovernmental body. We want to strengthen it, but we are not convinced, as regards its future status.</p>

Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce), the Chairman of the International Development Committee, made a measured contribution. He said it was very important that we did not give a false impression that budget support was not the right direction to take, particularly as we want the United States to support that direction of travel. He was right to say that it is vital that we improve co-ordination for donors. He was also right to say that the issue is not just accountability to donor countries; we have a responsibility to make sure that Governments in the countries that receive our aid are far more accountable to their local population. Better information is an important part of that.</p>

Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb) said that we needed to remake the case to our constituents for the importance of aid, both because it is the right thing to do, from a social justice point of view, and because it is in our national interest. I agree entirely with that. The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) felt that I was laughing at his contribution; the only point in it when I laughed was when he said that socialists were responsible for the current global economic turmoil. It is socialists, apparently, who controlled Barings bank and other financial institutions around the world, and who occupy the White House. I note that he opposed supporting a DFID aid programme to India, whereas the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire, who spoke before him, said that he fully supported the need to continue aid to India&#151;a case of Back Benchers in slight disarray.</p>

 For almost 20 years, my constituents have been living with the possibility of a large reservoir being built on open land near their homes. This is not just any reservoir. Thames Water&#146;s proposals are for a reservoir of some eight square miles, taking 10 years to build and filled with 150,000 million litres of water. It would cost some &#163;1 billion. It would be situated just south of Abingdon, between the villages of East Hanney and Steventon, but it would affect many more communities in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para10"><a name="08111373000841">The reservoir is proposed on the basis that it will provide additional water for London, Swindon and Oxfordshire to cope both with London&#146;s increasing population and with the potential effects of climate change. It is an astonishing fact, especially in the light of the soaking we have received in the last few days, and the flooding that hit my constituency in July 2007, that the south-east is one of the most water-stressed areas not just in this country but in the world. As a constituency MP, I am mindful of my responsibility to represent my constituents&#146; views and concerns as forcefully as possible, but I am mindful, too, of the national interest. Indeed, I suspect that my view on the reservoir represents that of the majority of my constituents. A few of them are opposed to a reservoir come what may, quite understandably. Some of them would welcome a reservoir as a leisure resource and a nature reserve, but the vast majority say to me, &#147;If Thames Water can convince me that it is essential, I will reluctantly accept it.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para11"><a name="08111373000842">The point that I want to make is that Thames Water has not convinced local people. I wish to praise the efforts of the local community in holding Thames Water to account, particularly the tireless efforts of the local county councillor, Iain Brown, and the Group Against Reservoir Development&#151;GARD&#151;which has raised a lot of money to pay for expert opinion. I know that Minister cannot, here and now, give me a considered view of the merits or otherwise of a reservoir, but if my points are to have force, it is necessary briefly to set out the parameters of the debate. A few years ago, reservoir-sceptics like me could oppose the reservoir on the ground that Thames Water was not doing enough to use the water to which it already had access efficiently. That primarily centred on the need to fix leakages and to increase water metering. As anyone who has looked around London recently will have seen, Thames Water has at last undertaken a massive programme of repair. Given the financial and logistical restraints under which it operates, it would be hard, I concede, to ask it to do much more other than continue its work programme on leakage reduction. In 2006-07, leakage accounted for some 672 million litres a day being lost&#151;roughly equivalent to twice the amount of water that one would get from a reservoir. After work to some 6,500 km of water mains, Thames Water will reduce that figure to just over 400 million litres a day&#151;an enormous figure, but one which is deemed justifiable in economic terms. In addition, I welcome moves by both Thames Water and the Government to introduce compulsory metering. We pay for all other utilities in that way, so it seems absurd  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="13 Nov 2008">

<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column 1059</b><br>
that water is not metered as a matter of course. Metering will ensure that we use this precious resource more carefully, and I am pleased to learn that compulsory metering will start in 2010 and eventually cover more than three quarters of London households and almost 90 per cent. of Thames Valley households, although I should point out that the Environment Agency still feels that Thames Water could still do more on that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para12"><a name="08111373000843">If water leakage and water metering have been, as it were, taken care of, is the case for the reservoir therefore proved? Not yet. There are still a number of outstanding issues. The first is a disagreement about the expected level of demand for water use. In the Government&#146;s water strategy for England, published in February 2008, they suggested that household per capita consumption could be reduced to 130 litres per person per day by 2030. By contrast, Thames Water forecasts a significant increase in per capita consumption, up to 165 litres per person per day by 2030. The difference in the Government&#146;s estimates, and those of Thames Water, based on a population forecast of about 9.25 million people, is 340 million litres per day&#151;surprisingly, almost the same amount of water that a reservoir would provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para13"><a name="08111373000844">So my first question to the Minister is, who is right? Is the Government&#146;s prediction right or is Thames Water&#146;s prediction right, because quite a lot hangs on those figures? Even if one were to accept Thames Water&#146;s predictions and say that, therefore, we needed to access more water, one would still have to ask whether a reservoir was the right way to go about it. Is there an alternative to a reservoir scheme? Many other schemes have been suggested, some fanciful, some less so. A detailed breakdown of some of the other schemes is contained in the report that GARD commissioned from a water expert, Chris Binnie, who cites a number of other, different sources of water. For example, both GARD and the local district council have suggested the possibility of a reservoir at Longdon Marsh to assist transfer from the River Severn, aquifer storage and recovery and the revision of the lower Thames operating agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para14"><a name="08111373000845">However, there is one option to which I am particularly attracted: the rather euphemistically titled, effluent reuse. Some 2 billion litres of treated waste water are discharged into the sea every day, and some of it could be treated to a standard whereby it was perfectly acceptable for drinking. In a submission to the draft water resources management plan, the Environment Agency, which also takes Thames Water to task on the issue of water use forecasts, states clearly that Thames Water</p>
<a name="81113-0021.htm_brev4"><a name="08111373000906"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;has not fully explored the role of demand management and alternative supply options, such as effluent reuse.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para15"><a name="08111373000846">The agency continues:</p>
<a name="81113-0021.htm_brev5"><a name="08111373000907"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are disappointed the company continues to discount effluent reuse options and believe there may be opportunities for using effluent reuse to contribute a significant amount of water.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para16"><a name="08111373000847">I should be interested in the Minister&#146;s&#151;indeed, the Government&#146;s&#151;views on effluent reuse generally, if not specifically as an alternative to the reservoir. I am particularly interested in the light of the new technology that is available, and the kind of technology that, I understand, is operated in Essex at Langford. By using   <br>

the Langford process in London, Thames Water could, I am told, potentially supply six times as much water from effluent reuse as from a reservoir.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para17"><a name="08111373000848">These are important issues, and, as a Member of this House, I am lucky enough to be able to debate them here. That brings me to the fundamental reason why I asked for tonight&#146;s Adjournment debate. My constituents do not share my luck. The combination of the draft water resources management plan and the new infrastructure planning commission means that it is highly likely that there will be no public inquiry into whether the reservoir should be built. The draft water resources management plan and the three-month extension of the deadline for presenting all WRMPs to DEFRA will, by sleight of hand, allow the case for the reservoir to be accepted through the back door. The newly created planning commission is likely to nod through the proposed site. I therefore ask the Minister seriously to consider the need for a proper public inquiry, not just into the possible site of a reservoir, but into whether it is necessary at all. From my correspondence with the Minister&#146;s predecessor, it seems clear that the Government intend to railroad the proposal through via the WRMP and then the national policy statement. My constituents&#146; voices will not be heard. Equally, the arguments will not be properly tested and cross-examined, a process that could benefit all parties involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para18"><a name="08111373000849">While I am here and on my feet, I should like to raise two ancillary matters&#151;general points that the Minister might like to consider. First, the only organisation apart from Thames Water directly involved in this debate on the reservoir is the Vale of White Horse district council, which is a statutory consultee on the ground of being the local planning authority. I congratulate its officers, and in particular its recently departed chief executive Terry Stock, on an excellent response to the draft WRMP. Its officers have asked me, however, how such a small district council could gather the resources necessary to make a proper case on behalf of the local population. Surely in these circumstances, local councils should be able to apply for specific funds to enable them to put their cases properly. I am not talking about a large amount&#151;perhaps &#163;100,000 or &#163;200,000, so that it could have a dedicated team and access expert advice. Such a sum is small, but it would be very significant for that small district council charged, in effect, with being the planning authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para19"><a name="08111373000850">I also seek assurances from the Minister that, should the reservoir go ahead, local residents and businesses will be properly compensated. A number of homes will have to be demolished, as will the site of the largest milking-goat herd in the United Kingdom. I seek assurances that people will be compensated at proper, negotiated, commercial and market rates that will enable the businesses to be re-established locally and the livelihoods of those displaced by any reservoir to be protected. If the reservoir goes ahead, I also hope that the Government and Thames Water will give adequate compensation to those whose lives will be seriously inconvenienced for up to 10 years.</p>

that we experienced in the summer, the drought that lasted from 2004 to 2006 is still fresh in our memories, as is the knowledge that a third dry winter after 2006 could have caused serious problems in some areas of the south-east. How we manage this precious resource to ensure a sustainable supply is important, and I am grateful for the opportunity to show what the Government are doing about the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para20"><a name="08111373000852">The hon. Gentleman has spoken passionately and made his case robustly. He questioned the rigour of the appraisal process. I am somewhat more constrained than I like to be in Adjournment debates because of the process that will be carried forward. I should take a moment to explain what that will be. It is for each water company to justify any proposals for reservoirs or other new water supply resources. That must be on grounds of need, taking account of economic and environmental considerations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para21"><a name="08111373000853">A fundamental element of that process is that the plans are subject to public consultation, and that was at the heart of the case for making the plans statutory. The water companies produced their draft plans earlier this year and consulted on them over the summer. That consultation period is now closed, and the companies are preparing their responses to the comments that they received about their plans. Those responses will then be published; they will show the consideration given to the comments received and whether any changes have been made to the plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para22"><a name="08111373000854">In the case of Thames Water, more than 300 stakeholders and other interested parties responded to the public consultation with views on the draft plan. Thames Water is now preparing its statement of response to the representations that it received and has until next February in which to publish its response. At that point, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will determine whether to call for an inquiry or a hearing on the plans or to issue directions on changes to be made to the draft plans before publication. In deciding whether to hold a hearing or an inquiry on a water company&#146;s plan, he will consider whether they have complied with the legislation on process and content, including robust appraisal of the options to determine the proposed way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para23"><a name="08111373000855">I will therefore speak in general terms and will be unable to deal with some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific questions, although in other circumstances I prefer in debates of this nature to respond as closely as I can. I hope that he will understand the constraints under which I am working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para24"><a name="08111373000856">We face a serious challenge when it comes to water management. Our population is growing and using more water as a result of our changing lifestyles, and we have a changing pattern of land use. That is putting more demand pressure on the water available, especially in areas where the supply of water is under stress; the hon. Gentleman says that his constituency is located in precisely such an area. Climate change, which will lead to hotter, drier summers&#151;although I cannot remember many of those recently&#151;and milder winters with more intense and sporadic rain will worsen the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para25"><a name="08111373000857">Protecting our water resources is therefore essential. In 1997, the Government set up the UK climate impacts programme to encourage private and public sector organisations to assess their vulnerability to climate change so that they can plan their own adaptation strategies. Their research is invaluable in helping us to  <br>

understand and adapt to these pressures. New forecasts on the impacts of climate change are expected next year. Our new water strategy, &#147;Future Water&#148;, sets out the Government&#146;s plans for water in the future and the practical steps that will be taken to ensure a sustainable supply of water for people and businesses. I will return to &#147;Future Water&#148; in a moment when I deal with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about consumption at 130 litres per person. The steps include measures to reduce the demand for water, as well as to improve the supply&#151;for example, through the abstraction licensing regime or, where the case is well made, by agreeing the need for new infrastructure. The overarching message of the new strategy is the need for everyone to value water and to take responsibility for protecting this unique resource.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para26"><a name="08111373000858">The Environment Agency plays a vital role in that protection. It is the statutory body with a duty to manage water resources in England and Wales, and its aim is to ensure that the management and future development of our water resources is carried out in a sustainable manner. It achieves that by regulating such activities as the abstraction of water through a licensing system, and it has also provided guidance to the water companies on drafting their water resources management plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para27"><a name="08111373000859">Ofwat is the independent economic regulator for the water industry, and it sets water price limits. As the hon. Gentleman knows, in August, as part of the 2009 review of water prices, water companies submitted to Ofwat their draft business plans for the period 2010-2015. Those plans set out each company&#146;s initial view of what it needs to do to maintain its assets, improve services to customers and deal with its impact on the environment. As part of this review process, DEFRA has submitted to Ofwat key documents that cover how it might contribute to wider social and environmental matters. Additionally, we will look to the Environment Agency to ensure that important environmental objectives can be achieved through the plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para28"><a name="08111373000860">Water companies themselves have statutory duties to maintain adequate supplies of wholesome water. Central to the long-term planning for water supply are the water companies&#146; 25-year resource management plans. Those became a statutory requirement for the first time in 2007 and describe how each company aims to secure a sustainable demand-supply balance over the next 25 years. In their plans, water companies should look at the full range of options for reducing water demand, and where those are insufficient or unjustified in cost terms, they should proceed with developing sustainable new supply-side measures, which is why we are debating such proposals this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="81113-0021.htm_para29"><a name="08111373000861">The hon. Gentleman raised the option of effluent re-use and asked what the Government&#146;s view was on such technology. We accept that it is one of many options that water companies may consider to achieve a demand-supply balance as part of their water resources management plans. It is for Thames Water to consider the options, and to undertake a robust options appraisal. It must justify its preferred options as the most cost-effective way forward. I understand that Thames Water has received representations on how that is addressed in its draft plan, but it is for the company to respond to those representations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="81113-0022.htm_para0"><a name="08111373000862">The demand-side management options that water companies have to consider include leakage management&#151;the hon. Gentleman raised that point. Controlling leakage  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="13 Nov 2008">

is a vital component in the management of supply and demand for water. Since 1994, Thames Water has reduced leakage by a third, and I am grateful to him for acknowledging that. It has achieved that progress in part through its commitment to replace more than 1,500 km of mains by 2010, and the programme will continue with increased mains replacement up to 2020. It has also achieved the leakage targets set by Ofwat in each of the past two years. Those targets are set to reduce the leakage of each water company to the economic level of leakage below which it would cost more to address the leak than to produce water from an alternative source. Thames Water is on track to reduce leakage to that economic level by 2009-10.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="81113-0022.htm_para1"><a name="08111373000863">The water saving group, of which I will be the chair, has made significant progress in the development of a programme of measures to promote water efficiency in households. That includes a project led by Waterwise, working with water companies, to update the evidence base of the cost-effectiveness of water efficiency measures. We have amended regulations to allow water companies in areas of serious water stress, including Thames Water, to consider compulsory metering as part of their water resources management plans. I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments on that. Ofwat has also consulted on proposals for water efficiency targets for water companies and an independent review of charging will look at options for metering water supplies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="81113-0022.htm_para2"><a name="08111373000864">The hon. Gentleman referred to the figure of 130 litres per person per day. That is an aspiration within &#147;Future Water&#148;, not a target that must be met. It represents our view of what could be achievable by 2030, through cost-effective measures, if all stakeholders&#151;water companies, manufacturers, retailers, plumbers, consumers and others&#151;acted together in a concerted way to manage demand. Water resources management plans contain a water company&#146;s view of future per capita demand based on its own assumptions and modelling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="81113-0022.htm_para3"><a name="08111373000865">I am unable to comment, while the statutory process is ongoing, on the contents or merits of Thames Water&#146;s  <br>

plans, although the hon. Gentleman is obviously free to do so, as he has done. Water companies need to consider all these options to ensure that the most cost-effective option is chosen, so that customers&#146; bills are not higher than they need to be. In the cases where demand management by itself does not achieve a sustainable supply-demand balance, or is not cost-effective, new or enhanced supply needs to be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="81113-0022.htm_para4"><a name="08111373000866">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will understand that while those plans are following the statutory process, it would be inappropriate for me to prejudge any decisions that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State might make on the evidence presented. Should Thames Water&#146;s final water resources management plan include a proposal for a reservoir near Abingdon, the water company would nevertheless still need to obtain development consent. Under the terms of the Planning Bill that is making progress through Parliament, that scheme would be a nationally significant water infrastructure project, as the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, and as such, Thames Water would need to apply to the infrastructure planning commission for development consent. However, if Thames Water sought development approval before the Planning Bill proposals reached the statute book, it could apply to the Secretary of State for a compulsory works order under section 167 of the Water Industry Act 1991 or to the local planning authority for planning permission. Again, I will not comment on the merits of any application or prejudge the outcome, because that might fetter the Secretary of State&#146;s discretion in making decisions about any proposals that come before him.</p>
