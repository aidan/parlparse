pilot phase was extended after the terrorist attacks on 7 July 2005.
Enrolment stations were closed and staff were deployed elsewhere to
give the project supplier, Sagem, more time to demonstrate system
stability. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the response to his question to
the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality, my hon.

evaluation of the pilot roll-out was scheduled for completion by the
end of summer 2006 and key findings would be reported within that time

individual support orders to look at in detail, a positive picture is
already emerging about how young people&#146;s behaviour is changing,

behaviour orders are applied for and issued on criminal conviction,
when often a pattern of criminal behaviour has been established. Does
he agree that the earlier agencies intervene the more chance there is
of preventing young people from developing criminal behaviour? It is
disappointing, therefore, that so few applications have been made for
stand-alone civil antisocial behaviour orders with individual support
orders attached? As he knows, they are designed to tackle the
underlying causes of a young person&#146;s antisocial behaviour

helping to tackle antisocial behaviour in her constituency, which is, I
am sure, why she has so much to say about the matter. As she knows,
ISOs allow positive conditions to be attached to ASBOs for up to six
months. We are keen to see them expanded, which is why we gave youth
offending teams &#163;500,000 to support their take-up, and I am glad
to be able to tell my hon. Friend that take-up is rising very rapidly
indeed.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 689</b><br><p><a name="0605151000037"><b><a name="0605151000457">Mr.

streamlined to ensure that they are more effective. They are, of
course, part of a package of measures, such as warning letters,
acceptable behaviour contracts, parenting contracts, parenting orders,
injunctions and fixed penalty notices for disorder. A wide array of

Affairs Committee on antisocial behaviour, particularly our conclusion
that significant funds in urban redevelopment, regeneration, social
services and education could be brought to bear much more effectively
on the support of individuals and dysfunctional families by using
individual support orders and other means? Will he apply his mind to

we have proposed for the months to come include reform of youth
provision, &#163;52 million for extended parenting support and
&#163;28 million for intensive family support projects throughout the
country. Yes, we intend to toughen the sanctions for those who commit
antisocial behaviour and cause hell for their neighbours and

by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) about the cost of

thoroughly follow up ASBOs, because there seems little point in issuing
them if they are not properly
enforced?</p><p><a name="0605151000042"><b><a name="0605151000462">Mr.

is important that breaches of ASBOs are followed up and that offenders
are given a clear message that, where there are breaches, there will be
sanctions. Between 2000 and 2003, nearly 800 breaches of ASBOs were
reported to us, 437 of which resulted in a custodial sentence being
imposed, so it is absolutely right to say that a clear message must be
sent when ASBOs are breached.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 690</b><br><p><a name="0605151000043"><b><a name="0605151000463">John

Birmingham where antisocial behaviour has been a problem for some

Before answering the question, I should like to take the opportunity to
offer my own heartfelt condolences to the family of Nisha Patel-Nasri,
whose tragic death in the early hours of Friday morning touched us all.
The role of the special constable is often a forgotten one, but I
believe that I speak for the whole House in thanking that group of
public servants, whose endeavours provide a invaluable link between a
local community and its police
service.</p><p><a name="0605151000047">My first
priority is to protect the public by addressing urgently the need to
identify, control, consider for deportation and, where appropriate,
deport those foreign nationals released from prison where no such
process was applied. Additional resources are being allocated to that
task. In slightly slower time, I will formulate proposals based on
recent experience and my analysis of underlying problems. That process
of investigation was started by my predecessor, and as it proceeds it
is uncovering systemic problems that need to be addressed, and I will
address
them.</p><p><a name="0605151000048"><b><a name="0605151000467">Mr.

comments about Special Constable Nisha
Patel-Nasri?</p><p><a name="0605151000049">The Home
Secretary will be aware of the role played by the probation service in
supervising some overseas prisoners already released into the
community, but he will be aware that, with things such as custody plus
and the new special orders that will come into place, the probation
service&#146;s resources are under very great pressure indeed. If it
is to be effective, will he, in his new role, review the resources
available to that service, to ensure that it can continue to do its
very professional
job?</p><p><a name="0605151000050"><b><a name="0605151000468">John
Reid:</b> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his comments
about the hard work being done by the probation service. From his
previous experience as a Minister covering probation between 1992 and
1993, I know that he will understand the work that is done and 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 691</b><br>the great challenges that are faced. On his substantial point, there has
already been an increase in probation service resources and in
personnel&#151;I think from some 14,000 people to 20,000. We have
certainly had 5,000 extra since 2001. In addition, we are revising and
reforming the probation service under the National Offender Management
Service. However, neither of those two things leads me to believe that
we have anything like perfection. As I study the urgent
requirements&#151;following up in the case of the deportees, which
has engaged the House&#151;I believe that we are uncovering some very
serious and systemic underlying problems in the relationship between
prisons, probation, deportations and so on. I hope, in the not too
distant future, to come to the House not with solutions, but with a
statement about what I think the problems are and how I think we should
proceed in solving them. Resources may be one of those
aspects.</p><p><a name="0605151000051"><b><a name="0605151000469">Patrick
Hall (Bedford) (Lab):</b> In his second recent statement to
the House on overseas prisoner removals, my right hon. Friend&#146;s
predecessor referred to prisoners being deported straight from prison.
May I remind my right hon. Friend of the fire that was deliberately
started at the Yarl&#146;s Wood removal centre in 2002? One of the
features of that incident was the presence of prisoners en route to
deportation who had been convicted of violent crimes, mixed with
ordinary failed asylum seekers and looked after by staff untrained in
dealing with formerly violent prisoners. Will he review the current
practice and try to ensure that potentially violent prisoners are
removed straight from prison and not via the detention
estate?</p><p><a name="0605151000052"><b><a name="0605151000470">John
Reid:</b> I shall look at that, among many other aspects. As I
said, I hope to come to the House with a statement in the not too
distant future. There are three things that I ought to attend to. The
first is the urgent nature of the discovery and consideration for
deportation of those 1,023&#151;now accurately defined as
1,019&#151;people who were released without due consideration. The
second is continuing the process started by my predecessor of examining
the underlying problems&#151;one of which may be what my hon. Friend
mentioned. Thirdly, there is setting the shape for the future. In that,
I have no doubt personally that it is the feeling of the people of this
country&#151;and ought to be the position of the
Government&#151;that any foreign nationals who are convicted and
serve a significant custodial sentence in this country should face
deportation when that is finished.</p><p><a name="0605151000053"><b><a name="0605151000471">Sir
Peter Tapsell (Louth and Horncastle) (Con):</b> May I
congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on his eighth promotion, which I
am told brings him perilously close to the dispute between Nos. 10
and 11 Downing street? Has he noted how fitting it is that
one of his first tasks as Home Secretary is to deal with the problem of
the Afghan highjackers? May I suggest that he would get off to a flying
start if he sent them home and brought the British troops back, as I
advised him in his previous appointment?</p><p><a name="0605151000054"><b><a name="0605151000472">John
Reid:</b> As I move effortlessly from position to
position&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Higher,

party 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 692</b><br>conference. As I shift endlessly from position to position, I find that
the hon. Gentleman, with great ease, shadows me to the point of
stalking. On this occasion, I have had quite enough difficulty coping
with the dangerous terrain of Afghanistan under his supervision,
without entering the even more dangerous territory of Downing
street.</p><p><a name="0605151000055"><b><a name="0605151000473">Ian
Lucas (Wrexham) (Lab):</b> Is not the most fundamental issue
relating to overseas prisoners the identification of those prisoners in
the first place? At present, neither the police nor the Prison Service
have any way of verifying the information that is given to them by the
individuals who present themselves. Is that not the best argument yet
for having an identity register?</p><p><a name="0605151000056"><b><a name="0605151000474">John
Reid:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. One of the
many problems that we face is that at no stage of the whole
process&#151;through investigation, arrest, inquiry, interview,
trial, sentencing, consideration, custodial sentence and
release&#151;as far as I have been able to determine in the limited
time that has been available to me, is there any legal requirement on
anyone to be responsible for discovering a nationality, or indeed, on
anyone else, to volunteer their nationality. That is a not
inconsiderable problem when it comes to dealing with foreign nationals.
As my hon. Friend says, this is one of the areas in which identity
cards would be a huge
boon.</p><p><a name="0605151000057"><b><a name="0605151000475">Mr.
William Cash (Stone) (Con):</b> Will the Home Secretary accept
that one of the underlying problems to which he refers in the context
of the probation service&#146;s costs and resources is the cost of
being involved in questions of deportation, extradition, control orders
and the like, all of which fall within the framework of the Human
Rights Act 1998 in one form or another? Will he thus look to reducing
that cost by repealing or amending the Act so that we can guarantee
that the public&#146;s safety in this country comes before so-called
human
rights?</p><p><a name="0605151000058"><b><a name="0605151000476">John
Reid:</b> Just as the hon. Member for Louth and Horncastle
(Sir Peter Tapsell) has a route map on which all roads appear to lead
to Afghanistan, in the case of the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash),
all roads appear to lead to Europe. Let me address the question of the
Human Rights Act. People in this country want a system of law and order
and justice that is intrinsically fair as enshrined in law, and by
&#147;fair&#148; I mean getting a balance between the rights of one
individual and the rights and safety of millions of other individuals.
Secondly, they want the interpretation of the law to be fair and,
thirdly, they want the administration of the law to be competent and
fair. Those three areas are at the forefront of my mind as I approach
my new position, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that I will attempt to
achieve those aims. If legislation is needed, we will consider it, but
if the matter is merely one of interpretation and competence, we will
deal with it in such a way. We will end up with laws that are
interpreted and applied in a system that the people of this country
believe to be fair to the vast majority of decent, law-abiding
citizens, as well as other individuals.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 693</b><br><p><a name="0605151000059"><b><a name="0605151000477">Mr.

responsibility for a series of serious matters and mistakes, which,
ultimately, he probably discovered only relatively lately. He took
responsibility for beginning to remedy the problems, and we should
accept that he dealt with the situation in a very honourable fashion.
As elected politicians, it is in the nature of our position that we are
quite rightly often expected to bear the burden of responsibility for
our Departments and not to lay the blame on civil servants, and he was
careful not to do that. In fairness to some of the leading members of
the Department&#151;I include in that group the permanent secretary
and several other directors&#151;they have relatively recently
arrived in post. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North

that that is my strategic objective. I hope to come, in the not too
distant future, to the House with a statement outlining honestly what I
see as some of the underlying problems, and thereafter to make
proposals on how they may be rectified. I cannot at this stage tell him
in what time scale the proposals will be put forward, because I want to

use the same words, and I understand why&#151;because we have to deal
with realities at the Dispatch Box, not overblown rhetoric. In terms of

be completed. What I can do is give him what information I have; I can
do no better than that.</p><p><a name="0605151000066">Of the most
serious offenders, which the right hon. Gentleman will recall include
rape, murder, manslaughter and sexual abuse against children, the
current figure, having updated the categories by two methods&#151;one

ought to have been included in the first place within the more serious
category; the second is to have scrutinised, or rather the police to
have scrutinised, each case out of 800 on their way to 1,023, with a
view to previous offences and reoffenders&#151;is 35, of whom 26 are
already under control. All of them have been considered, and the
initial consideration has resulted in deportation decisions in 29 of
them. Two only have been not considered for deportation, and I am
asking for details of why not, and one has been deported. Of the more
serious categories, we now include in that 144, of whom 55 are under

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr.

support officers was published on 26 January this year. The report
found that PCSOs have been well received by the public and that they
are valued for their visibility and accessibility. They are helping to
restore respect in local communities by providing reassurance and
tackling antisocial behaviour and low-level
crime.</p><p><a name="0605151000069"><b><a name="0605151000485">Tony
Baldry:</b> Thames Valley police estimate that over the
next 18 months they will need to recruit between 26 and 32
community support officers in my constituency to provide proper
coverage. So far, they have recruited just six. There appear to be two
problems: vetting, which seems to be very cumbersome, and funding. The
Government fund only 75 per cent. of the posts, so Thames Valley police
have to find the 25 per cent. from other Government programmes, which
does not seem particularly joined up. Indeed, at the moment, Horton
hospital is funding two of the community support officers. I must tell
the Minister that between the spin and the reality lies
frustration.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 695</b><br><p><a name="0605151000070"><b><a name="0605151000486">Mr.

right calibre of people become police community support officers. We
are providing significant funding for neighbourhood policing, including
for PCSOs, over the next two years, and we have made it clear that our
investment will be maintained after 2008. However, community safety is
an outcome shared by a number of agencies, and it is appropriate that
other partners contribute and that money is used from the safer and
stronger communities fund and the neighbourhood renewal fund. If all
those agencies work together, we shall see PCSOs not only in the hon.

the vast majority of people&#151;who are decent, hard-working and
responsible citizens&#151;rather than a service that is unfairly
balanced against their interests.</p>

Gordon Prentice (Pendle) (Lab):</b> What steps
are being taken to ensure that chief constables whose posts disappear
with restructuring are given appropriate posts in new merged police
forces.

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Joan
Ryan):</b> There will be open competition for all chief
constable and deputy chief constable posts. We are considering
including in the amalgamation orders a provision enabling any chief
constable not securing a post to transfer to the successor force for
three months on their existing pay and conditions. A chief constable
not securing a substantive post will be given a severance
package.</p><p><a name="0605151000124"><b><a name="0605151000530">Mr.
Prentice:</b> That is a disappointing reply. Why only a
three-month period, and why are we saying to chief constables who were
not successful in getting an appointment that people who are presumably
at the height of their powers are going to be pensioned off? Will not
this reorganisation, like every other one, cost an absolute arm and a
leg, and might it fail to deliver the benefits that we are told to
expect?</p><p><a name="0605151000125"><b><a name="0605151000531">Joan
Ryan:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for making those points. I
know that his own Lancashire and Cumbria force is very keen to see the
merger go ahead. He will know that, in line with restructuring, the
senior appointments processes are being developed through a joint
police advisory board and police negotiating board working group, on
which the Home Office&#146;s chief police officers staff association
and the Association of Police Authorities sit. So it would be a little
premature to outline to my hon. Friend the exact nature of the terms
and conditions, but he can rest assured that they are being looked at
in some detail with the very people who will be affected and their
representative organisations. As my right hon. Friend the Home
Secretary pointed out, this can be an expensive process; however, it is
about creating police forces that can provide for our communities the
protection that they both want and
deserve.</p><p><a name="0605151000126"><b><a name="0605151000532">Sir

mergers has been brought forward with intemperate haste, without proper
consultation, in constituencies up and down the country. There is real
danger to morale in the police force and, furthermore, to morale among
the public, who will consider that they will have a much more remote
police force and will not continue to have a local chief constable.
Will the Minister please take more time over
this?</p><p><a name="0605151000128"><b><a name="0605151000533">Joan
Ryan:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his good wishes. I
repeat to him what my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said in
response to a similar point&#151;that he will consider all these
matters. Our first priority must be to take account of the report by
Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary, &#147;Closing the
gap&#148;, which said, as my right hon. Friend pointed out, that the
43-force structure is not fit for purpose in protecting the public.

575.</p><p><a name="0605151000131"><b><a name="0605151000536">Mr.

they suggest that some of the gross overcrowding of the past has been
stabilised and reduced. However, can the Minister tell me whether the
work on the expansion of the prison has recommenced after its
interruption? When does he expect that work to be completed? That will
give the prison an extra 120 spaces, which will help to prevent
overcrowding and help it to re-establish itself in
future.</p><p><a name="0605151000132"><b><a name="0605151000537">Mr.

increased above the original estimates and that, as he intimates, the
project was temporarily suspended. It was determined to be value for
money and is back online. The conversion of the old health care centre
into offices is complete, and work on the new house block and visitor
centre is well under way. That will provide the 120 extra spaces to
which the hon. Gentleman alluded. The work is expected to be completed

necessary, ultimately 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 704</b><br>international terrorism will be best countered by democratic values,
discussion, persuasion and social solidarity. The key is to engage in
genuine and sensitive dialogue with the Muslim communities and not to
shy away from difficult issues. That process has already begun. I am
aware that the hon. Gentleman has a longstanding interest in the
matter, and I would be happy to discuss the issues with him personally
should he so
wish.</p><p><a name="0605151000135"><b><a name="0605151000540">Michael
Gove:</b> I thank the Secretary of State for his robust and
balanced response and for his invitation, which I look forward to
taking up. Last Thursday, my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and
Wyre (Mr. Wallace) asked him whether the suicide bomber,
Mohammad Siddique Khan, had been under sustained surveillance before 7
July. The Secretary of State replied that at the time, his
understanding was that there was not a sustained programme of
surveillance. This weekend, <i>The Sunday Times</i> reported that MI5
had extensive transcripts of Mohammad Siddique Khan planning jihadist
activities. It appears that the Secretary of State may have been misled
by the security services. Can we have a guarantee that, in the absence
of a full independent inquiry, every transcript and detail of the
surveillance of all the suspects is passed to the Intelligence and
Security Committee of this
House?</p><p><a name="0605151000136"><b><a name="0605151000541">John
Reid:</b> May I, through the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question,
correct some of the misleading statements and misrepresentations in the
weekend press? First, when I engaged with the hon. Member for Lancaster
and Wyre (Mr. Wallace) after the discussion in the Chamber, it was
reported that I said that the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre was
right and that I was wrong. In fact, I said the opposite, and there
were at least five witnesses to the conversation. I said that I had
been right in the Chamber when I said that there was no sustained
surveillance of the two gentlemen in question, Khan and Tanweer, that
they had been peripheral to another investigation, that the decision
had been made because they were peripheral, and that it would be a
wrong judgment to use resources and assets to pursue them rather than
the main characters in the main conspiracy that was being pursued. That
is the first point, and I stand by that.</p><p><a name="0605151000137">My second
point is that the Security Service gave the Intelligence and Security
Committee full co-operation in its investigation of 7 July. Indeed,
since the weekend, the Security Service has reviewed the evidence that
it gave to the ISC in the light of recent press allegations. It remains
confident that nothing that the service knew has been withheld from the
Committee. I do not intend to go into specific details, for obvious
reasons, but I am glad that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath
(Michael Gove) has given me the opportunity to set the record right and
to correct the misleading impressions that formed the basis not only of
the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments but of the front page story,
which was in several areas very misleading.</p><p><a name="0605151000138"><b><a name="0605151000542">Mr.
Shahid Malik (Dewsbury) (Lab):</b> I commend the Government on
their overall approach to dealing with terrorism. They are taking a
twin-pronged approach, and the first prong involves robust anti-terror
legislation, of which I have been a strong and vocal supporter.
Mohammad Siddique Khan was one of my constituents. 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 705</b><br>The other prong involves dealing with causal
factors. Over the weekend, research reports were published by the
universities of Oxford, Warwick, Birmingham and Derby showing that
there was disproportionate unemployment, underachievement and
overcrowding in Muslim communities. Can the Home Secretary reassure me
that the Government are not going to take their eye off the second
prong of their approach to dealing with
terrorism?</p><p><a name="0605151000139"><b><a name="0605151000543">John
Reid:</b> I can absolutely guarantee that to my hon. Friend,
and I commend him on the work that he has done in this area. I want to
restate the view that I 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 706</b><br>put forward at the beginning of this question, which is one that I have
carried over from my other positions in the Government: we will not
defeat terrorism by security forces, intelligence services and the
armoury of weaponry that comprise the conventional forms of defence
alone. They are a necessary but insufficient condition. Unless we
address the underlying socio-economic problems, both domestically and
internationally, we will not be successful. I therefore commit the
Government to continuing in that direction. We have made a good start,
but I believe that we have a long, long way to go. I look forward to
working with my hon. Friend on this
matter.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 707</b><br><a name="06051513000001"><h3 align="center">Points of

thanking my friend and predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for East

been a great wrench for him to have to leave this Bill to take up his
new post in the Department for Work and Pensions.
<i>[Laughter.]</i></p><p><a name="06051513000046">Today, we are debating a series
of important amendments to the Bill, which are in large part the
Government&#146;s response to some of the criticisms raised and fears
expressed about the Bill. As my hon. Friend the Member for East
Renfrewshire made clear at earlier stages, the Government did not
approach those issues with a closed mind. We said that we would listen,
but we were also anxious to have a better regulation system, which
could root out and change unnecessary or outdated burdens on business,
the public sector, charities and the voluntary sector. We should not
forget that this is the third time in 12 years that Parliament has
legislated on these issues.</p><p><a name="06051513000047">The amendments today will
rightly take us into some detail, but the wider need for the Bill could
not be clearer. We operate in a more global and competitive world
economic environment than has ever been the case in our
history.</p><p><a name="06051513000048"><b><a name="06051513000204">Mr.

his interesting job. Can he tell the House what kind of measures he
will want to bring forward for repeal or amendment under these clauses,
as his predecessor seemed to find it difficult to give us a list of
examples? He can rest assured that Conservative Members are waiting for
those and will support them.</p><p><a name="06051513000049"><b><a name="06051513000205">Mr.

each year the Department of Trade and Industry puts on its website a
list of all the new amendments that it will make on two dates during
that year. The latest item on the website shows that over the next year
we shall see 40 pages of new regulations. Why will the Minister not
commit himself to producing a list of the 40 pages that are to be
scrapped?</p><p><a name="06051513000054"><b><a name="06051513000209">Mr.

Governments of both colours, which is precisely why we need a robust
mechanism that can root out and remove unnecessary
regulation.</p>

and perhaps will, exchange results of surveys showing how Britain is
placed in various international economic leagues, but Labour Members,
certainly, believe that it is well placed to succeed in the globalised
economy. Employment is at record levels, reflecting the success of
policies intended to secure employment opportunities for all. We have
one of the highest rates of employment in the G7. We are a
hard-working, enterprising and creative country. Our openness and
flexibility are great strengths. The way forward is not to hide from
the changes that are taking place in the world, or to wish them away;
it is to ensure that we are best placed to succeed in this world by
making certain that Britain remains a great country in which
creativity, enterprise and hard work are allowed to flourish and to be
rewarded.</p><p><a name="06051513000060">It is
sometimes said that this is a race to the bottom&#151;a competition
to level down standards and conditions of work. We reject that notion.
We believe that people should be treated decently, that there should be
a clean environment, and that there should be a labour market that
ensures fairness. As I said earlier, however, we also know that under
Governments of both parties regulations have tended to grow. We must
have a process in Government to root out unnecessary regulation, and a
remedy to hand that allows Government and Parliament to act when

identified.</p><p><a name="06051513000061">It is
precisely because the need for competitiveness is so important in the

bigger picture as we debate the legislation over the next two

its potential effects, may I say how pleased I am that his predecessor,

expressed not just by Labour and Opposition Members, but by the Trades
Union Congress and other bodies? While the Government did not intend to
do any of the things that it was suggested they might do, other
Governments could have, and I am very pleased that, as far as I can

clear that those powers apply only to regulation and not in any way to

the burden that will be removed is the burden on Government to put

that respect, I thank the Chairs of the relevant Select Committees
which produced reports on the Bill; they have contributed positively

this new clause allowing for the unscrambling of eggs that were wrongly

with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point then, so at this stage I will
say only that it would seem odd to legislate for a new regime of
deregulatory powers to give people certainty and then to say that they

predecessor fell into when discussing the Bill, which is simply to
assert that something will not happen or that he could not conceive of
it happening or that it is not the Government&#146;s intention for it
to happen, rather than actually expressing in statutory form that it
cannot happen. That is exactly the difficulty that the hon. Member for
Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher) pointed out; although the
Minister may be absolutely convinced that he has no intention of using
the Bill for an inappropriate cause, a future Government may, and that

the abolition of jury trial to be necessary to achieve a ministerial
objective. Will he give way on amendment No. 74, which would insert the

new clause 19, which is the hub of the whole thing, I am very grateful
to him for giving way. I have listened to him give way repeatedly.
Although the new clause is well-intended, its terms are still amazingly
broad. Am I right in believing, looking at subsection (3), that these
powers could be used to abolish a tax, to relieve an interest group or
trade from a burden of taxation, or to abolish a crime, to make
something lawful that was previously unlawful under the criminal law?
Those may be very desirable things, but they are subject to more
safeguards than consultation and Select Committees. They should be
subject to parliamentary debate, before any such step is
contemplated.</p><p><a name="0605151000222"><b><a name="0605151000586">Mr.

July 1999 that we kept trying, but we never
succeeded.</p><p><a name="0605151000224"><b><a name="0605151000588">Mr.
McFadden:</b> I was not aware of that, but I will let the
statement speak for itself.</p><p><a name="0605151000225">I will deal with new clauses 20
and 21 in more detail in due course, but let us explore new clause 19
further, because it provides a power to make provision in an order for
the purpose of removing or reducing burdens&#151;direct or
indirect&#151;that result from legislation. The definition of
&#147;burden&#148; in new clause 19 would allow a Minister, by
order, to remove or reduce burdens that take the form of a financial
cost; an administrative inconvenience; an obstacle to efficiency,
productivity or profitability; or a sanction, including criminal
sanctions, for doing something or failing to do something in the course
of an activity. That means that a Minister may propose by order to
decriminalise offences or reduce or remove sanctions if they are no
longer considered appropriate.</p><p><a name="0605151000226">That definition of
&#147;burden&#148; is deliberately broader than that in the
Regulatory Reform Act 2001. That is because the definition of
&#147;burden&#148; in the 2001 Act has proved too narrow in that it
allows the removal of only a requirement, condition or restriction. As
a result, the concept of &#147;burden&#148; in the 2001 Act is
complex and difficult to apply. It puts a heavy and sometimes
disproportionate burden of legal analysis on Departments. For instance,
the regulatory reform orders under the 2001 Act cannot clarify or
simplify legislation unless in so doing a narrowly defined legal burden
is removed, reduced, re-enacted or imposed.</p>

another group? I do not understand how the interpretation of subsection
(3) of the new clause would relate to, for instance, employment rights.
From the point of view of the employer, which may be the state or a
private company, employment rights are undoubtedly a burden on
efficiency and productivity. According to my reading of the new clause,
it would appear that employment rights could be removed by order of a
Minister.</p><p><a name="0605151000228"><b><a name="0605151000590">Mr.
McFadden:</b> There is, of course, the protection of necessary
rights and freedoms, which is set out in the Bill. That would protect
against the kind of situation that my hon. Friend outlines. The new
definition of &#147;burden&#148; will also allow us to target more
effectively the order-making power on removing or reducing the burdens
that businesses, charities and voluntary organisations wish to see
removed.</p><p><a name="0605151000229"><b><a name="0605151000591">Mr.
Garnier:</b> I listened carefully to the answer that the
Minister gave to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) on taxation. Clauses 5 and 6 offer us some
comfort. However, it is quite clear that, under clause 6, the Minister
is not prevented from adding to the criminal statute book offences that
attract a penalty of up to two years. There are plenty of offences that
the criminal courts deal with now that carry a maximum penalty of up to
two years. Is he telling us that the word &#147;burden&#148; does
not encompass new criminal offences that a Minister might dream up that
do not attract a penalty of more than two
years?</p><p><a name="0605151000230"><b><a name="0605151000592">Mr.

was proposing something that unnecessarily dealt with imprisonment of

that.</p><p><a name="0605151000231"><b><a name="0605151000593">Mr.
Garnier:</b> The great thing about Report is that one can have
these to-ing and fro-ing debates. That is important and I am grateful
to the Minister for entering into the debate in that spirit. This point
is most important. We are dealing with primary legislation that gives a
Minister huge powers to make legislation. If the Minister is telling me
that I, as a representative of my constituents, will have to rely on
some as yet unformed Select Committee to exercise its judgment in a way
that would be helpful to me and my constituents, that is extremely
worrying. He must surely be able to understand that the making of
criminal law should be dealt with here, right the way through every
stage.</p><p><a name="0605151000232"><b><a name="0605151000594">Mr.

some ways, reflect those in the proposals before us. Under the 20-odd
regulatory reform orders that have been produced under that Act, I do
not think that the kind of problems that the hon. and learned Gentleman

better regulation initiatives that the order-making power will allow us
to deliver include reducing the administrative burdens of regulation,
consolidating and simplifying legislation to make it easier to
understand and work with, and deregulation. It will also allow us to
reduce administrative burdens, such as by simplifying administrative
requirements for business when setting up a business or hiring staff,
by ensuring that inspection is risk-based to reduce the burden on those
who comply with regulation, thus concentrating inspection on those who
do not, by simplifying and making more transparent and less onerous the
way in which people and businesses need to apply for consent from
public authorities, and by allowing, in certain key instances, the
complete exemption of small businesses, charities and others from
burdensome regulation to allow them to concentrate their effort where
it is most
needed.</p><p><a name="0605151000236"><b><a name="0605151000597">Mr.
William Cash (Stone) (Con):</b> The Minister probably knows
what I have in mind already. The omission from, or black hole in, the
Bill&#151;and, indeed, his speech&#151;is the lack of any attempt
whatsoever to deal with the problem of the burdens on business that
come from European
legislation.</p><p><a name="0605151000237"><b><a name="0605151000598">Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman knows that the Bill deals
with us having a much clearer and more simple process of translating
into British law some of our obligations from the EU. It does not
somehow change our relationship with the EU on a policy basis so that
we do not have such obligations, although I suspect that he wishes that
it did. I am afraid that whatever I can offer the House today, I cannot
offer the hon. Gentleman satisfaction on that
point.</p><p><a name="0605151000238"><b><a name="0605151000599">Mrs.
Gwyneth Dunwoody (Crewe and Nantwich) (Lab):</b> Of course, I
do not have the advantage of being a lawyer, but I am rather worried
about what the Minister has just said. Is he suggesting that if the
Government of the day decide, those who run small businesses may be
exempted from safety legislation that is available to those who work in
larger
companies?</p><p><a name="0605151000239"><b><a name="0605151000600">Mr.
McFadden:</b> No, I am not suggesting that at all. If a
measure that would do away with a necessary right or freedom was
proposed, it would not be in line with clause 3 of the Bill, so I do
not believe that such a thing could
happen.</p><p><a name="0605151000240">If I can move
on to deal with the four definitions, it may help the House. On
financial cost, an order may change legislation if its effect would be
to remove or reduce a financial cost on an individual, business,
voluntary organisation or charity. A Minister may thus propose an order
that reduces or removes any unnecessary costs that result from
legislation. That definition includes both direct and indirect costs,
so an order may reduce both the costs incurred by a regulated business,
charity or voluntary organisation and the costs that they pass on to
their customers. For 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 720</b><br>instance, the power could be used to deliver exemptions for small
businesses from some disproportionately stringent audit requirements,
which could have a marked effect on reducing their costs. It could also
be used to deliver a proposal in the Charity Commission&#146;s
simplification plan that would exempt small charities from certain
audit and registration requirements altogether so that they could focus
their resources on providing help to those whom they were set up to
support.</p><p><a name="0605151000241"><b><a name="0605151000601">Mr.
Kenneth Clarke:</b> Let me return to my previous point. The
hon. Gentleman is giving a narrow illustration of what lifting a
financial cost means, but I still cannot understand why the Bill would
not allow a Minister to seek to repeal a tax by using the process. Let
me be helpful to him. If, for example, a future Government wished to
repeal the climate change levy, it seems to me that that could be done
by statutory instrument so long as the Government ensured that they had
a majority on the relevant Select Committees. I would hope that no
Government would want to do that, but we do not want to legislate to
enable a Government to do so. It is no good for the Minister to say
that such a thing will not happen because that is what his predecessor
kept saying. Will he point out the provisions in the Bill that would
rule out any abolition of a tax by use of statutory
instrument?</p><p><a name="0605151000242"><b><a name="0605151000602">Mr.

because I have to leave the Chamber shortly to go to a meeting, but I
suggest that my hon. Friend outlines to the Opposition the background,
which they do not seem to understand, to new clause 19 in terms of the
safeguards that are built into the Bill. It is not a matter of a
Minister simply putting some forward. My understanding is that if the
Government amendments are successful, any proposal will have to go
through two Select Committees. There may be a Government majority on
those, but there is a Government majority in the House. That is the way
in which the House works. Having voiced considerable concerns on Second
Reading, I am now worried that there are so many safeguards that the
Government have gone too far the other way. I urge him to keep an open
mind and explain the
safeguards.</p><p><a name="0605151000251"><b><a name="0605151000608">Mr.
McFadden:</b> My hon. Friend and constituency neighbour makes
a typically sensible point. I have referred several times to the
safeguards in terms of a Minister making a proposal, his explanatory
note for the proposal, the consultation required and, crucially, as he
said, the consultation with the Select Committees and their power to
reject a
proposal.</p><p><a name="0605151000252"><b><a name="0605151000609">Mark

will allow me.</p><p><a name="0605151000254">The
definition of burden relating to administrative inconvenience will
allow the Government to deliver reductions in administrative burdens on
business that are being identified through the comprehensive
administrative burden reduction project taking place in government. The
final results and Government targets to reduce administrative burdens
will be published in departmental simplification plans in due course.
Where appropriate, the order-making power will allow the Government to
deliver real savings in time and money for businesses, charities and
voluntary organisations by, for instance, reducing form-filling
requirements and making it easier to comply with regulations. Those
reductions in administrative burden will free up time and money so that
businesses can improve productivity and promote innovation.</p><p><a name="0605151000255">The definition
of burden as &#147;administrative inconvenience&#148; will also
allow the Government to amend rules that are now considered unnecessary
but, because they are enshrined in statute, can still bind companies
and impose an administrative inconvenience. For instance, the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has committed to
taking forward a proposal, submitted via the better regulation portal
on the internet, to amend the rules on selling game. I am sure that
many Conservative Members will take an interest in that.</p><br>

Game Act 1831, anyone wishing to sell game from a shop must apply for a
licence from the council and affix to the front of the shop a board
stating so. Repealing those requirements will save businesses hundreds
of thousands of pounds and relieve the administrative burden on them.
That is a small measure, but it is the kind of thing that could relieve
those affected of a substantial burden. As the rules are enshrined in
primary legislation, only a Bill could repeal them. The order-making
power in new clause 19 will provide a more proportionate measure for
repeal.</p><p><a name="0605151000257">I emphasise
again that we also want to reduce administrative inconvenience for our
public services and voluntary organisations. Reducing administrative
inconvenience will, for example, allow teachers, who often raise this

definition of a burden involves a sanction, whether criminal or
otherwise, and we wish to allow Ministers to propose by order to
decriminalise offences or reduce or remove sanctions for regulatory
offences. That has been carried over, as I said earlier, from the legal
definition of &#147;burden&#148; in the Regulatory Reform Act 2001.

supply the wide-ranging better regulation initiatives necessary to
deliver the reform that businesses, the public sector and voluntary and
charitable organisations want. The new clause focuses the order-making
power in a different way from the 2001 Act, as it is output-focused and
concentrates not on the way in which legislation should be reformed,
but on the reasons for that reform. The order-making power in the 2001
Act concentrated more on the way in which legislation could be
reformed. It removed legislative restrictions and so on but, after five
years, that has proved limiting, and it has not provided the 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 724</b><br>breadth of better regulation initiatives necessary
to deliver the Government&#146;s better regulation agenda. It
has not provided the scope of deregulation to which
the main Opposition are committed, so useful regulatory reform orders
could not be delivered. The change in emphasis will make it easier and
quicker for Government Departments to introduce proposals to make a
genuine difference to the regulatory and inspection
burden.</p><p><a name="0605151000274"><b><a name="0605151000623">James
Brokenshire (Hornchurch) (Con):</b> It is interesting to
consider to whom the burden applies. There is a protection built into
new clause 19, as the provision cannot apply only to a Government
Minister or a Department. However, the caveat is limited by proposed
subsection (4), which exempts Ministers and Departments that
&#147;exercise...a regulatory function&#148;. Can the Minister
tell me where &#147;regulatory function&#148; is defined, or can he
provide me with an assurance that that provision will not be
misused?</p><p><a name="0605151000275"><b><a name="0605151000624">Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman anticipates the next part of
my contribution. If he bears with me, I hope to provide him with
reassurance.</p><p><a name="0605151000276">New
clause 19 has been drafted to prevent the inappropriate removal of
orders that fall only on Ministers or Government Departments. In
earlier proceedings, the fear was expressed that the order-making power
could be used by Ministers suddenly to stop providing public services.
The new clause provides that burdens falling only on Ministers or
Government Departments can be removed, but only in so far as they are
burdens that affect the Minister or Department in the exercise of a
regulatory function. We believe this answers the fears expressed on
those core public service points, although we did not believe that
those fears would ever be realised through the operation of the Act.
The new clause ensures that it will not be possible to make an order
that stops the provision of public services because they may be
considered a burden on
Government.</p><p><a name="0605151000277"><b><a name="0605151000625">Mr.
Garnier:</b> To some extent, what the Minister has just said
is reassuring. However, public services are increasingly being farmed
out to the private sector or the quasi-private sector. They are being
off-loaded by Ministers so that they need not have responsibility for
them. Would the Minister&#146;s comments bite on those
extra-governmental organisations which provide a public
service?</p><p><a name="0605151000278"><b><a name="0605151000626">Mr.
McFadden:</b> The Department remains responsible for the
regulatory function. I am interested to hear that the hon. and learned
Gentleman seemed to imply some criticism of flexibility in the
provision of public services, to which his party is also committed. The
new safeguard is substantial and ensures that an order can remove a
burden falling on Government only where the Government themselves act
as
regulator.</p><p><a name="0605151000279"><b><a name="0605151000627">David
Howarth: </b>On the point raised by the hon. and learned
Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier), the central question is what is
meant by Government Department. How far does that go? Does it include
quangos, private sector providers and anyone who might count, for the
purposes of the Human Rights Act, as a public body, which would include
bodies such 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 725</b><br>as universities? The Minister should take the
opportunity to explain to the House what is meant by the
phrase.</p><p><a name="0605151000280"><b><a name="0605151000628">Mr.
McFadden:</b> If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to continue,
perhaps I shall do
that.</p><p><a name="0605151000281">The
Government have a number of regulatory functions&#151;for example,
the company law regulatory functions within the Department of Trade and
Industry, and the pesticides directorate, which has regulatory
functions in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
The Government believe that these regulators, too, should conduct their
business in a manner that is risk-based. For that reason, it should be
possible to use an order, if necessary, for better regulation purposes
to change an aspect of these Government regulatory functions, so that
all regulators conduct their business in a way that is risk-based.
Orders should be able, for instance, to move these Government functions
into those of an independent regulator if it were more efficient to do
so.</p><p><a name="0605151000282">Two consequential
amendments should be mentioned in this context. Of the many amendments
before us, I draw the attention of the House to amendments Nos. 38 and
39, which ensure that any Minister laying an order to be made under new
clause 19 must include in the explanatory document laid before
Parliament, as appropriate, an assessment of the extent to which it
would remove or reduce burdens as defined in new clause 19. So we have
on the one hand the more focused order-making power, and on the other
hand an explanatory memorandum from Ministers relating precisely to
that power.</p><p><a name="0605151000283">Two further
consequential amendments on which I shall touch briefly are amendments
Nos. 60 and 62, which relate to the definition of regulatory functions.
Amendment No. 62 inserts the definition of regulatory functions, which
was previously part of clause 24, in clause 32 instead. That is because
it is now relevant to both part 1 and part 2, because of new clauses 19
and 20.</p><p><a name="0605151000284">New clause 19
provides that an order may not remove or reduce burdens which affect
only a Minister or Government Department unless, as I said, that is in
the exercise of a regulatory function. New clause 20 provides that a
Minister may, by order, make provision which he considers would secure
that regulatory functions are exercised so as to comply with the five
better regulation principles. We shall discuss that new clause in more
detail later in our
proceedings.</p><p><a name="0605151000285">The
focusing of the power in new clause 19 on the removal or reduction of
burdens and the additional safeguard that has been added mean that we
are confident that the clause creates the output-focused rationale for
a legislative vehicle to deliver regulatory reform
effectively.</p><p><a name="0605151000286"><b><a name="0605151000629">Sir
Robert Smith:</b> The Minister accepted amendment (b) in
defining the scope of new clause 19. Without amendment (b), all overall
burdens are not necessarily removed. Provisions can be restrictive in
allowing just the removal of any burden. In the process of that door
being opened by removal of any burden, that could overall provide more
burdens on people.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 726</b><br><p><a name="0605151000287"><b><a name="0605151000630">Mr.

concerned about the potential application of the new clause to the
proper responsibilities of public services. Let me offer the Minister a
scenario. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that there are
responsibilities on, for example, national health service trusts under
the terms of the Health and Social Care Act 2001, where they are
considering changes in the provision of services to involve local
people in and consult them on the proposed changes. Can the Minister
assure me that nothing in the clause would ever allow such public
agencies to argue for a removal or reduction of their public
consultation responsibilities? On the face of it, the danger exists, at
least under a less benign and progressive Minister than the hon.
Gentleman, for precisely such an eventuality to
occur.</p><p><a name="0605151000290"><b><a name="0605151000632">Mr.
McFadden:</b> It is clear&#151;it has been made clear in new
clause 19&#151;that only Ministers and Departments will be affected
in terms of their exercise of a regulatory function. In these
scenarios, which have been rehearsed throughout the passage of the
Bill, it may always be possible to predict this and to predict that. If
we go down that road, we will end up with a Bill that will be a
beautiful parliamentary instrument in that it closes up every possible
avenue to which the hon. Gentleman and others may draw attention. At
the same time, it would not be an effective weapon in reducing
deregulation.</p><p><a name="0605151000291">That
scenario has not been dreamed up by me. It is what has happened on two
occasions when the House has tried to legislate on these matters. I ask
hon. Members who raise these matters, which they have every right to
do, to bear in mind that business is watching our proceedings.
Businesses, charities and the voluntary sector want an outcome at the
end of this proposed legislation that will work. We must beware of
continuing to amend, close off and hamper legislation so that it
becomes, as I have said, a beautiful parliamentary instrument but not a
useful deregulatory
instrument.</p><p><a name="0605151000292">I shall
draw my remarks to a close by saying that new clause

the House spent discussing fox hunting. If the right hon. Gentleman
thinks that any Minister could propose a deregulation order that would
sail through a Select Committee, he predicts a future House that I do
not think will be in place. However, there is another point that has
been raised in relation to the Bill, which relates to the extreme
Government point, as we might wish to term it. What if these powers
could be used by an extreme Government to destroy our freedoms? If we
ever had an extreme Government in the United Kingdom, I do not think
that at the top of our list of worries about what they might do would
be regulatory reform

clause 19 and its associated amendments are a response to some of the
fears and concerns that have been raised about the Bill. I hope that,
in discussing them today, we have been able to assuage some of those
fears. Those amendments give us a deregulatory power that is firmly
focused on the better regulation aims that we want, and which the
official Opposition say that they want, to achieve. They focus the Bill
in such a way as to answer those fears and concerns, but they have not
crossed the boundary that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West (Rob Marris) rightly warned us about crossing. I commend
them to the
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0605151000440">4.30
pm</h5><p><a name="0605151000301"><b><a name="0605151000639">Mr.
Heald:</b> We are grateful to the Minister for setting out the
effect of these significant new clauses and amendments. We particularly
welcome new clause 19, which is a major climbdown; combined with the
other new clauses and amendments, it is definitely a step in the right
direction. But as will become clear during our debate&#151;you would
expect this of any good Oliver, Mr. Speaker&#151;we want
more. <i>[Interruption.] </i>The Minister scoffs, but I thought it
worth making the
point.</p><p><a name="0605151000302">The House will
be aware that these new clauses and amendments would not have been
necessary had the Government been prepared at the outset to listen to
the widespread concern about, and criticisms of, their original
proposal. I pay tribute to the Select Committees and their Chairmen,
which have played an important role in the campaign, but also to those
outside Parliament such as the TUC, the Institute of Directors, the
press and other media, and various blogsites. This is an important
victory for Parliament and parliamentary scrutiny.</p><p><a name="0605151000303">Time and again in recent years,
we have had to deal with badly drafted and ill-thought through
legislation, or legislation that simply does not have the effect that
the Government intend or claim. That was certainly the case with this
Bill, which in its original form was dubbed by some of its fiercest
critics an attack on parliamentary scrutiny, and even the
&#147;abolition of Parliament&#148; Bill. It is good that a major
concession has 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 728</b><br>been made at this stage, rather than having to rely on their lordships
in the other place to make all the running.</p><p><a name="0605151000304">Of course, the Bill should have
been about deregulation and reducing the burdens on British business,
which have escalated under this Government. Perversely, it has turned
out to be almost entirely constitutional in its impact. Deregulation
was not mentioned at all, despite the fact that, as I pointed out on
Second Reading, the British Chambers of Commerce estimates that the
increase in regulatory burden has cost some &#163;50 billion since
1997, that we are passing 15 regulations a day&#151;50 per cent. up
on the figure under the previous Government&#151;and that during the
same period, we have fallen from fourth to 13th in the league of the
world&#146;s most competitive countries, according to the World
Economic Forum. According to the International Institute for Management
Development&#146;s &#147;World Competitiveness Yearbook&#148;, we
have fallen from ninth to 22nd, but whatever measure one looks at, it
is clear that, after nine years of Labour, Britain is less competitive
and moving in the wrong direction. The burden of regulation is one of
the most consistent complaints that Members in all parts of the House
hear when talking to business men and women, whether at national or
local level.</p><p><a name="0605151000305">Like all
the business organisations that responded to the Government&#146;s
consultation before the Bill was introduced, we were in favour of
legislation that would make deregulation easier. I thank the BCC, the
CBI, the IOD, the Forum of Private Business and the Federation of Small
Businesses for all their help and support. They wanted proper
safeguards to be included in the Bill, just like everyone
else.</p><p><a name="0605151000306"><b><a name="0605151000640">Mr.
McFadden:</b> I predicted that we would be trading surveys.
Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the World Bank survey of September
&#146;05 said that the United Kingdom was second in the European
Union and ninth in the world as regards the country with the best
business
conditions?</p><p><a name="0605151000307"><b><a name="0605151000641">Mr.
Heald:</b> The Minister says that he wants to trade surveys,
but the problem is that our position is getting worse. All the surveys
show that the trend is adverse&#151;it is against Britain and against
competitiveness, and that is what needs
changing.</p><p><a name="0605151000308">This really
was a dreadful Bill, and we said from the outset that a range of
changes needed to be made if it was to have any chance of making it on
to the statute book. It needed to focus on deregulation, and it needed
to have what I described as a veto. Luckily, Ministers are now prepared
to consider that, although their proposals are still too restrictive.
The Bill also needed to specify what kinds of laws cannot be dealt with
using the order-making power. When first introduced, it said that a
Minister could change any law in any way for any purpose. That was
clearly unacceptable. Ministers are now moving to try to concentrate on
deregulation and provide the veto. That is welcome. However, there
remain some areas of concern that we will want to debate, not least the
Law Commission proposals, where there seems to be very little to
constrain what happens, and the veto, which seems to have been very
tightly drawn.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 729</b><br><p><a name="0605151000309">When the concessions started to
be made, I was quite amused by the way in which Ministers
described what they were doing. The hon. Member for East Renfrewshire
(Mr. Murphy), who struggled through this long campaign and must be
relieved to have moved on,
said:</p><a name="0605151000430"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The time
has come for those who claim to want to tackle bureaucracy to stand up
and be counted, and let the Government of the day get on with the
crucial task of cutting unnecessary red
tape.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0605151000310">The Minister, who
is not in her place,
said:</p><a name="0605151000431"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I...stress
the need now to get on with the task of removing barriers to
productivity that will benefit hundreds of thousands of businesses,
charities and public sector
workers&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0605151000311">One begins to
ask oneself where they have been for the past nine years as the
Government have piled on the bureaucracy and the red tape, and which
party has consistently argued for proper deregulatory measures during
that
time.</p><p><a name="0605151000312"><b><a name="0605151000642">Mr.
Redwood:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that our proposal
before the last election of having an annual deregulatory Bill to
implement the necessary regulatory budgets Department by Department
would be a much better way forward, because we would not only be able
to debate all these matters in Parliament, but genuinely cut the
burden?</p><p><a name="0605151000313"><b><a name="0605151000643">Mr.
Heald:</b> Of course, my right hon. Friend has a proud record
in this area. Let us not forget that it was the Conservatives who
invented deregulation.</p><p><a name="0605151000314">The Department for Trade and
Industry has on its website a list of all the measures that are going
to be taken on the two dates when regulations are laid. It amounts to
about 40 pages of new regulations that are coming through. The
Government spend a lot of time talking about the principle of one in,
one out&#151;for every new regulation, one will be
scrapped&#151;but does it ever happen? Does it heck. We see no list
of regulations that are to be scrapped, just vague promises. It is time
to change the culture in Whitehall to one that is about light
regulation, deregulation and trying to take the burdens off the back of
business.</p><p><a name="0605151000315">New clause
19 may not be perfect, but it is a major step forward, and we certainly
welcome that.</p><p><a name="0605151000316">New
clauses 1, 4 and 8 represent my attempt to focus the fast-track
procedure solely on deregulation. The Government have gone far enough
for me not to wish to press the new clauses. However, new clause 4
touches on a point made in amendment (b), tabled by my hon. Friend the
Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope). He was very active in Committee
and was one of the original members of the deregulation taskforce, so
he has strong credentials on deregulation. If he moves that amendment,
I am likely to support him. My hon. Friend is seeking to establish that
the net effect of an order made under new clause 19 should always be
deregulatory. We believe that that is a sound principle, and that
proposal is to be supported.</p><p><a name="0605151000317">Amendment (a) to new clause 19
and amendment No. 74, tabled in the names of the hon. Members for
Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) and for Cambridge (David Howarth), would
require Ministers to be 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 730</b><br>reasonable in their considerations under new clause 19 and clause 3
respectively. I look forward to hearing the arguments for those
amendments, which I suspect are implied in their
wording. I certainly would not rule out supporting that approach. There
is always a possibility of judicial review if a Minister acts in a
totally unreasonable way, but the amendments could add a lesser
sanction to the provisions that would provide a useful way of
concentrating minds.</p><p><a name="0605151000318"><b><a name="0605151000644">Mr.
Winnick:</b> I was quite critical of the Government&#146;s
original proposals, and I am very pleased that these changes&#151;the
hon. Gentleman calls them concessions&#151;have now been made, as I
said to my hon. Friend the Minister earlier. I have been listening
carefully to the hon. Gentleman since he started speaking at the
Dispatch Box. Is it the case that he does not agree&#151;I will put
it no more strongly than that&#151;with his hon. Friends, whose
various interventions on the Minister gave the impression that the
Government would continue to have the powers that we do not want them
to have, even theoretically? May I assume from what the hon. Gentleman
is saying that he disagrees with his hon.
Friends?</p><p><a name="0605151000319"><b><a name="0605151000645">Mr.
Heald:</b> I would go so far as to say that the amendments
tabled by the hon. Member for Cambridge and my hon. Friend the Member
for Christchurch would improve the drafting of new clause 19, and I am
therefore supportive of their efforts. However, I cannot argue with the
fact that new clause 19 represents a major climbdown and a step in the
right direction. I personally feel that it has saved parliamentary
accountability in an important area. I am still unhappy with certain
other areas of the Bill, however. For example, it confers far too wide
a power in saying that the Law Commission may make a recommendation on
any matter&#151;even a highly controversial and important
one&#151;without any guarantee that it will be debated on the Floor
of the House. I do not accept that. Similarly, the terms of the veto
that have been offered are inadequate. However, new clause 19 is a step
in the right direction. I hope that that explains my view to the hon.
Gentleman.</p><p><a name="0605151000320">I also welcome
amendments Nos. 23 and 26, which will tighten the way in which the Law
Commission&#146;s recommendations are to be dealt with. I am still
not satisfied with the overall arrangements for the Law
Commission&#146;s recommendations, but I welcome that tightening. We
would certainly be prepared to look at the whole Law Commission issue
with the Government. Previously, the House has always dealt with Law
Commission recommendations using the Standing Orders of the House.
Standing Orders Nos. 58 and 59 apply a fast track to consolidation
measures, for example. I am not sure that that is not a better way of
tackling Law Commission measures than what is proposed in the Bill.
Unless we can find a way of allowing non-controversial Law Commission
recommendations to pass, while ensuing that controversial ones are
properly debated, I shall be unhappy with new clause 21. That is just a
warning, however, because we have not reached that new clause
yet.</p>

<p><a name="0605151000321">New clause 9
is an important proposal, and I look forward to hearing the
Government&#146;s views on it when the Minister winds up the debate.
We believe that it is necessary to consider the needs of small
businesses separately when measures of deregulation are proposed. 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 731</b><br>There is already a plethora of examples of that happening, including
exemptions in different categories involving
businesses with fewer than five, 10 or 15 employees, and so on. Some
exemptions apply when a business&#146;s rateable value is below a
certain point, or when its turnover is lower than a certain amount.
There is also a range of regulations providing different kinds of
exemptions for small businesses.</p><p><a name="0605151000322">When considering the regulatory
regime for business, there is a strong case for requiring the
appropriate Minister to consider whether the proposed regulation will
be appropriate for small businesses. There is wide support
for that requirement in the business community, even among large
businesses. For example, the Institute of Directors believes that, on
balance, there is a case for applying small firm exemptions. In its
report on the subject, it said:</p><a name="0605151000432"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The burden of
regulations often has a disproportionate impact on SMEs because they
lack both the resources and the staff to deal with
them...Exemptions...should be determined on a case by case
basis. Small businesses have flourished in the USA partly as a
consequence of this
approach.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0605151000323">What we are
talking about is allowing Government the choice to impose a regulatory
burden on big business, which might be appropriate, and to decide that
it would not be appropriate for small
business.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0605151000441">4.45
pm</h5><p><a name="0605151000324"><b><a name="0605151000646">Andrew
Miller:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making a series of
interesting points. On this point, however, will he give the House a
few examples of precisely what he means?</p><p><a name="0605151000325"><b><a name="0605151000647">Mr.
Heald:</b> I would be happy to do that. As the hon. Gentleman
knows, the Better Regulation Commission considered whether providing
exemptions created disincentives to growth, but did not find much
evidence of that. Its report, &#147;Helping Small Firms Cope with
Regulation&#148;, on exemptions and other approaches, made it clear
that small firm exemptions were a useful tool to ensure that there was
not an over-burdensome regime for those companies. I mentioned the
various categories and thresholds that apply, and there are small
business exemptions in 50 or 60 areas. At the moment, however, there is
not a legal requirement that there comes a time when the small business
impact is considered, although the Cabinet Office talks about that. I
believe that there would be no harm in a specific provision that deals
with small business, and I suggested such a provision in Committee.
Interestingly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants has said that it
believes that the relative proportion of the burden of regulation on
small business is too large, and that it hopes that Ministers will
consider such an approach.</p><p><a name="0605151000326"><b><a name="0605151000648">Andrew
Miller:</b> I want to clarify this point, as the Regulatory
Reform Committee, of which I am Chairman, must look to the future when
there might be a less benign Government. Is the hon. Gentleman saying,
on behalf of the official Opposition, that he would not include in
those remarks measures such as the minimum wage and the Health and
Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974?</p><p><a name="0605151000327"><b><a name="0605151000649">Mr.
Heald:</b> All that I am saying is that, at a time when
regulations are being made or removed, the role of the small company
needs to be considered. I am going no further than that. As the hon.
Gentleman will 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 732</b><br>know, our policy is to accept the minimum wage. <i>[Interruption.]
</i>Well, we accept the minimum wage, so he has not made a superb
point.</p><p><a name="0605151000328">New clause
17, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), seeks to
ensure that where a fast-track deregulation order is made in connection
with a provision concerning our EU obligations, it would be legally
binding and effective. It is hard to disagree that that should be the
position, and I believe that it probably is the position, but I would
be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s views. The manner in which
members states make their law is a matter for member states, and if
Parliament decides to make law by order, that is for our Parliament
rather than the EU.
</p><p><a name="0605151000329">The Government
climbdown in new clause 19 is to be welcomed. There is a case for some
amendment of it, about which we will hear in a moment, and we are open
to considering that. I would like to hear the Minister&#146;s
response to new clause 9, which is designed to help small business. At
this stage, we are minded to support my hon. Friend the Member for
Stone on new clause 17, which clarifies the law as regards the
EU.</p><p><a name="0605151000330"><b><a name="0605151000650">Andrew
Miller:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that new clause 19
represents progress&#151;indeed, substantial progress. To send a note
of caution to my hon. Friends in the Cabinet Office, let me say that I
was mightily pleased to receive a letter dated 11 May promoting me to
the Privy Council, which I thought was a real step in the right
direction, and then I saw that my name was spelt
wrong.</p><p><a name="0605151000331"><b><a name="0605151000651">The

there have been two steps forward and one step back. The new clause
represents real progress, but this debate would have been unnecessary
had the Government listened to my Committee&#146;s advice in the
first place. The Committee said that the matter should have been dealt
with by means of pre-legislative scrutiny, and a number of Ministers
have told me privately that they agree with that. The House produced a
device for the purpose of looking to the future, and we could have used
it sensibly. After all, the underlying principles of the Bill do not
divide the House; what we are arguing about are the detailed mechanisms
involved.</p><p><a name="0605151000334">I consider new
clause 19 to be a substantial step in the right direction, and I urge
the House to accept the principles that it embodies, but a number of
points should be considered carefully. The Minister will deal with most
of my concerns when he explains where the line will be drawn in the
limitation of orders, but we shall not be able to get to grips with
some other aspects until we examine the Standing Orders and determine
how the RROs should properly be dealt with. We need to establish
whether they will be dealt with through the existing Legislative and
Regulatory Reform Committee, through a hybrid of some kind, or through
a vehicle yet to be devised. We need to keep an eye on the ball. We 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 733</b><br>also need to think ahead about how we will expect the House to empower
the Committee or Committees involved to do the necessary
work.</p><p><a name="0605151000335">I agree with the
thrust of the Minister&#146;s remarks, but what he should glean from
the debate and his extensive and interesting weekend reading is the
fact that, while the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 has not proved as
effective as it might have, the blame lies not with the House but with
Government Departments. I do not blame Ministers. There is an inertia
in the system, with which any Member who has been in the House any
length of time will have had to deal. Certainly two or three
Conservative Members who have been Ministers in important Departments
will take the point. It is extremely difficult to achieve momentum,
however determined a Government may be.</p><p><a name="0605151000336">On page 13 of my
Committee&#146;s report, the First Special Report of Session 2005-06,
we have published a chart. It is in microdot form, but there is a good
deal of data that are worth examining. The worst example given is that
of the Sugar Beet Research and Education Order 2003, which was dealt
with by the predecessor Committee. I do not suppose that any Member
present recalls what the order did&#151;that does not constitute a
challenge&#151;but it spent 1,800 days floating around the Department
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. That is extraordinary. I do
not know the reason for that because no one ever explained it to the
House, but therein lies the core problem that makes the
Minister&#146;s job that much more
difficult.</p><p><a name="0605151000337">We worked
hard&#151;I say &#147;we&#148;, because the Government generously
consulted all four relevant Select Committees closely, and there has
been dialogue with the Liaison Committee through the Father of the
House, as well&#151;to find a way through the difficult area of
definition, and I hope that the methodology adopted proves to be right
way. It is better than the alternatives that some of us floated, which
included having omnibus lists of exclusions&#151;I look at the hon.
Member for Cambridge (David Howarth), who had the biggest omnibus of
the lot. I think that the mechanism adopted is the better one, but we
need to be extremely precise and to make sure that it is clearly
understood that we are discussing not burdens on Ministers, but burdens
on people outside this place&#151;burdens that the Minister has the
power to do something about, for it is he, the Minister, who will bring
an order before our Committee.</p><p><a name="0605151000338">Under existing legislation, we
spent a tortuous afternoon dealing with the most recent Forestry
Commission order. We had to debate what the Forestry Commission was, in
constitutional terms. Before that debate, I was not aware that the
commission is a non-ministerial Government Department. That raised the
interesting technical question: if it is a non-ministerial Department,
which Minister introduced the order? However, just as the House accepts
the Paymaster General introducing orders on behalf of Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, we accept the structure that
relates DEFRA Ministers to the Forestry
Commission.</p><p><a name="0605151000339"><b><a name="0605151000653">Mr.

like the House to consider giving my Committee or a successor body
investigatory powers and the power to recommend to the Government areas
in which they should act. The right hon. Gentleman has done private
work in that respect on behalf of his Front Bench. Serious
consideration should be given to whether, in future, my Committee or
its successor should have investigatory powers, which it lacks under
its current Standing Orders. In our everyday work, we all come across
examples of regulation that cause us to ask why they are still on the
statute book, or why they were put on to the statute book, whether by a
Conservative or a Labour Administration. That matter should be examined
in the context of the debate on the Standing Orders.</p><p><a name="0605151000341">I congratulate
the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, my hon. Friend the Member
for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. McFadden), and his
predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for East
Renfrewshire (Mr. Murphy), on the sterling job they have done
of getting us away from the rather odd debate in which the House found
itself as a result of the Bill that emerged from Committee. Substantial
progress has been made, although a few obstacles remain in the way of
getting the legislation smoothly on to the statute book. I hope that
during our proceedings today and tomorrow, Ministers will listen
carefully to the serious points that are made, in particular by members
of the four Select Committees, with a view to ensuring that the
Government&#146;s replies do not preclude further amendments, should
they be necessary. However, I congratulate my hon. Friend the
Parliamentary Secretary on adopting the imaginative approach that new
clause 19 and the associated amendments reflect. I hope that the new
clause will have the support of the
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0605151000442">5
pm</h5><p><a name="0605151000342"><b><a name="0605151000655">Mr.
Heath:</b> The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston
(Andrew Miller) said that the Bill that left Committee engendered an
odd debate. I do not think the debate was remotely odd; it was entirely
proper and necessary, because the loose wording that had been adopted
drove a coach and horses through our proper parliamentary scrutiny,
which is why so many of us were extremely
concerned.</p><p><a name="0605151000343">I again
welcome the Minister to his new responsibilities. I am sorry that his
first parliamentary outing is on one of the most controversial Bills of
the year, although at least he has the advantage of introducing
amendments that improve it rather than make it worse. He tried manfully
to put as good a gloss on the process as possible, although he was not
aided by the Minister for the Cabinet Office who left after
12 minutes, which I found surprising given the context of the
Bill&#151;but there we
are.</p><p><a name="0605151000344">The Minister said
that the Government had listened to what had been said by the
Committees that have considered the Bill. The Government may have been
listening but they certainly did not give the impression that they were
prepared to budge an inch in the 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 735</b><br>Standing Committee, where the then Under-Secretary at the Cabinet Office
simply replied with assertion after assertion after assertion that it
was not his intention, and that if it was not his intention it could
not possibly anyone else&#146;s intention, to abuse the terms of the
legislation, so it was all right.</p><p><a name="0605151000345">The only thing that made the
Government think again was the message from the Government Chief Whip
in another place, who told them that the Bill was as good as dead
unless it was substantially amended before it went there. That is why
the Government have tabled the amendments that we are discussing
today&#151;rightly so, because the Bill is important. We all wanted
to support it and to develop a consensus that enabled us to do so, but
we can do that only if the Government remove the wholly unsatisfactory
parts of the measure. However, I can tell the Minister that I
wholeheartedly agree, without demur, with one of his amendments: No.
10, which leaves out clause 1. That is an extremely good
amendment.</p><p><a name="0605151000346">New clause
19 makes the situation better, but it is by no means the final article.
It moves some way towards providing a limiting definition, but that
definition is still open to misinterpretation and abuse. The problem
with the original scope of the Bill was the huge width of
interpretation that it allowed Ministers, and indeed a future House. In
Committee, we argued that that could be dealt with in three ways:
prescription, proscription or protections. All three are valid and more
than one of them will be necessary to achieve a workable
Bill.</p><p><a name="0605151000347">In this case, the
Government have adopted prescription. They have set out the matters
that are the province of the Bill. They have said, by definition, what
the Bill is intended for and thus, by implication, that there are other
matters for which it is not intended and that are outside its
scope.</p>

<p><a name="0605151000348">Some hon.
Members would argue strongly&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for
Cambridge (David Howarth) may well be one&#151;that it would be
better to have a proscriptive list of those statutes or aspects of
statute that should fall outside the Bill&#146;s scope. Nevertheless,
I welcome new clause 19 as at least a move in the right direction, but
as the Minister knows, we and others have tabled amendments to new
clause 19, and I ask him, rather than simply rejecting them out of
hand, to look carefully at what they would do, because they would not
work against the principles that he espouses. Indeed, they would
support his view. Amendment (a) would introduce a single but very
important word&#151;&#147;reasonably&#148;&#151;into new clause
19. That test of reasonableness would provide an objective, rather than
subjective test of whether a Minister was doing what the Minister says
would always be a Minister&#146;s intention in those
circumstances.</p><p><a name="0605151000349"><b><a name="0605151000656">Mr.
Redwood:</b> Is there anything that the Liberal Democrats
would like to deregulate under the Bill? I always think of them as
being very regulatory and bossy, rather than
otherwise.</p><p><a name="0605151000350"><b><a name="0605151000657">Mr.
Heath:</b> I cannot deal with the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s misconceptions about my party, but when he
intervened earlier on the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston
(Andrew Miller), I thought that the reply was 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 736</b><br>valuable. The Regulatory Reform Committee ought to have a wider brief
than simply responding to what Ministers put to it. The hon. Gentleman
suggested an investigatory role, but it could have a collating role. I
should like that Committee to perform a genuinely deregulatory function
in inviting suggestions for deregulation that ought to be put before
the House in the form of an order.</p><p><a name="0605151000351">I do not
understand why such things must come from a Minister. The hon.
Gentleman said that he excused Ministers from responsibility over what
happens in their Department. I do not excuse them for a moment. They
have the responsibility of making decisions in their Departments and,
if they do not do that well enough, another Minister should be found.
It is helpful to listen to the business world and the outside world
generally about what deregulatory measures could properly be
introduced.</p><p><a name="0605151000352">I also
think&#151;this is partly an answer to the right hon.
Gentleman&#151;that the need for sunset clauses in legislation made
by order is a prerequisite for good regulation. We should not have
regulations that simply carry on, year after year, long after the
original need has been removed but remain on the statute book, applying
burdens to people in business that they could well do without. As one
of the few Members who has run a small business, I know of what I
speak, and I feel that that is a necessary protection for
businesses.</p><p><a name="0605151000353">Amendment
(a) would apply the test of reasonableness to the decision that the
Minister takes when determining whether he is acting in an
appropriately deregulatory way. It is no good for Ministers to say,
&#147;We don&#146;t need the term
&#145;reasonably&#146;&#148;, because they use it in another part
of the Bill&#151;not, of course, applying to Ministers, but to
members of the public who may wish to make a complaint about the way
that Ministers behave. Let us not argue about whether the word
&#147;reasonably&#148; is otiose but simply consider whether it
adds to Ministers&#146; responsibilities, and I say that it does. I
do not want to make a Minister&#146;s decision justiciable in that
sense, because I do not want decisions of parliamentary procedure to
become a matter for the courts, but I want Ministers to behave
appropriately in making that decision, and the insertion of the word
&#147;reasonably&#148; would have that
effect.</p><p><a name="0605151000354">The hon. Member
for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) will speak to his amendment (b), but, as
the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) said, it is
self-evidently a necessary protection. I hope that the Minister will
seriously consider it. He seemed to dismiss it earlier, but if he
thinks about it further, he will realise that it is a sensible change
that would not reduce the Bill&#146;s effectiveness but simply define
it more accurately.</p><p><a name="0605151000355">I
do not propose to talk about amendments (d) and (e) today, for the
simple reason that they also relate to new clause 15, which leads a
group of amendments tomorrow, and I can explain the purpose for which
they were tabled at that point. We have a slightly confused process.
Nor do I need to dwell on amendment No. 4, which relates to the
definition of reforming. The reformulation of the Bill means that we
will have to return to that in another place. At the time when we
tabled the amendment, it was crucial, but it is less crucial in the
context of the Minister&#146;s new clauses. 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 737</b><br></p><p><a name="0605151000356">Amendment No. 74 also
inserts the word &#147;reasonably&#148;, but this time in clause 3,
which covers the preconditions that a Minister must apply. Again, I
hope that a Minister would behave reasonably. He would be required to
do so under administrative law because otherwise he would be subject to
judicial review, but I do not want to be in the business of encouraging
the judicial review of Ministers&#146; decisions in terms of how they
present matters before the House. That is not the right way of doing
business. We should make it absolutely clear that we are not talking
about an assertion&#151;to use a term that I used earlier&#151;by a
Minister or a subjective view. A Minister should have to test
objectively whether he is behaving reasonably when applying those
preconditions and accepting whether they have been met. That seems
sensible.</p><p><a name="0605151000357">The last
amendment that I wish to mention is amendment No. 78, which deals with
something that has not been mentioned yet. It is a probing amendment on
clause 34, which comes right at the end of the Bill and relates to its
extent. When I asked the Minister&#146;s predecessor in Committee, he
did not appear to have a clue why the clause was written in the way
that it was. I do not want to cast aspersions on the previous Minister,
but I can see why he had to be promoted, because he clearly did not
understand this aspect of the Bill or many others. I want to know why
the Bill asserts extraterritorial jurisdiction for itself. I am
struggling to find the areas in which the orders that might be amended,
repealed or replaced might apply outside England and Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland. Under what circumstances would that apply and
under what circumstances would it be appropriate for the House to
fast-track an amendment to legislation, which, for one reason or
another, applied presumably to a Crown dependency? There are very rare
occasions on which we have extraterritorial jurisdiction, for instance
in relation to some sexual offences. I simply want the Minister to
explain why he thinks that that has to be in the Bill. I did not get an
explanation in Committee, so I hope that I will now.</p><p><a name="0605151000358">I feel strongly about amendment
(a), because it is the litmus test of whether Ministers are serious
about rewriting the Bill. I hope to have the opportunity to test that
in the House, given that the Bill has been completely rewritten. We are
virtually back to the Committee stage with this part of the Bill, so I
hope that we will have the opportunity to test the will of the House on
that. I also hope that, unless the hon. Member for Christchurch gets a
satisfactory answer, he will feel able to press amendment (b). If he
does, we will support it.</p><p><a name="0605151000359">I know that the hon. Member for
Stone (Mr. Cash) will wish to speak on new clause 17. It is axiomatic
that, if a matter is dealt with through this procedure in order for a
deregulatory measure to go forward, it should not be overridden by the
European Communities Act 1972 and provision elsewhere. If the
principles of subsidiarity are to mean anything, they must mean that. I
hope that the Minister will be able to reply that that is already the
case, but I fear that he may not. If he does not, and the hon.
Gentleman intends to press new clause 17, I will advise my right hon.
and hon. Friends to support him.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 738</b><br><p><a name="0605151000360"><b><a name="0605151000658">Mark

<p><a name="0605151000373">That is
not the burden of my speech. Instead, it is the extent to which the
Government are rowing back from that disastrous position with new
clause 19. It is a good and serious attempt, but it is not quite right.
It needs to be buttoned down in a solid way. The dangers inherent in
the original Bill were enormous and complacency still exists, with hon.
Members in some interventions saying, &#147;I spotted it all.&#148;
The original Bill gave powers to Ministers to subvert the process and
bypass the whole of Parliament. The &#147;abolition of
Parliament&#148; was not a loose phrase. We could have packed up and
gone home with the removal of almost all our functions, yet neither the
press nor the House was up in arms in the way that they should have
been. I am delighted that the Government are rowing back with new
clause 19, but it is not quite enough.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 740</b><br><p><a name="0605151000374"><b><a name="0605151000671">Pete
Wishart:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman have a view on why the

mistake by civil servants or something more
sinister?</p><p><a name="0605151000375"><b><a name="0605151000672">Mark
Fisher:</b> It is not for me to speculate on why and I am not
sure that it is interesting now. Hon. Members, and there are plenty on
both sides of the Chamber today, have been concerned about how the
shift of power in politics has moved from Parliament to the Executive
over recent years. Indeed, the former right hon. Member for Bexley and
Old Sidcup, in his last speech on the Conservative Benches, said that
it had been moving inexorably during the 50 years that he had been a
Member of the House. Those of us in the group Parliament First, who are
interested in such matters, recognise that the balance of power has
shifted enormously. The Bill seemed to be the most dramatic and
horrific example of that. Had it gone through unamended, it would have
totally changed the balance and nature of our parliamentary system.
Indeed, it would have neutered large parts of it.</p><p><a name="0605151000376">New clause 19 is important
because it is the one hand against that trend. I congratulate the
Minister on introducing it and ensuring that the Bill has some
constraint. In the light of the generous number of interventions that
he took, I hope that he will go back and think about some of them, and
see that there are still weaknesses. I do not feel that he responded
fully to the point that the right hon. and learned Member for
Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) made on the climate change levy. He deflected
it by saying, &#147;Ah, but legislation is covered by clause
5.&#148; However, it is only covered in one direction&#151;to
&#147;impose or increase taxation.&#148; The right hon. and learned
Gentleman suggested the possibility that orders could reduce or delete
taxation. The Bill, with the current wording, does nothing to stop an
order being made. It would have to go to a Select Committee, but a
Select Committee of a different House, with a different Chair and a
different balance could well wave it through. It could be persuaded
that a climate change levy was a thoroughly malign thing. That would
not be good for Parliament. It would be extremely bad for the way in
which we conduct our business.</p><p><a name="0605151000377">I suspect that the same is true
of a future Government deleting the top rate of tax. That could happen
and it could bypass the scrutiny of a Finance Bill. It is certainly
true of the rather less important and frivolous example of fox hunting.
I deplore the fact that the House has wasted 700 hours debating fox
hunting. Anything more pointless and more to the shame of this House
could hardly be imagined. Under this Bill, an order to delete all that
legislation&#151;if the order got through a Select
Committee&#151;would not need to go before the House; it could be a
ministerial order. As a member of the middle way group who voted
against the legislation, I would be happy and relaxed about that, but
that is not the intention behind the Bill or the way in which we should
conduct parliamentary business. I do not see anything in new clause
19(3), which defines the burdens, to prevent such things from
happening. I know that the Minister intends that subsection (3) will
preclude all those things, but that is not apparent from the wording.
It would be very much simpler if the Bill were confined solely to
regulation. Does the Minister want to
intervene?</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 741</b><br><p><a name="0605151000378"><b><a name="0605151000673">Mr.

perdition.</p><p><a name="0605151000381"><b><a name="0605151000675">Mr.
Kenneth Clarke:</b> May I begin as everybody else will begin
by praising the policy intention behind the Bill? I very much doubt
whether there is any right hon. or hon. Member, either present or
elected to this House, who does not support the principle of
deregulation. We all acknowledge the tremendous pressure that we are
under to reverse the inexorable growth of regulation in recent years
and the constant reminder we are given by British business about its
damaging effects on our competitiveness, so this ought to be a
non-controversial Bill. It is a minor miracle that the Government have
succeeded in turning it into an extremely controversial piece of
legislation. I agree with the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central
(Mark Fisher) that there is no point in going back now, but I cannot
understand why the Government thought that they could carry general
support for deregulation into support for a Bill of the kind that they
first drafted.</p><p><a name="0605151000382">New
clause 19 is indeed extremely welcome. It is the first time that the
Government have moved substantially from where they started. The
original Bill was drafted in an extraordinary fashion; parliamentary
procedure would have been bypassed on every kind of occasion if a
Government were minded to do so. New clause 19 has sought to narrow
that, but it still has not gone far enough. The Government are still
not inclined to restrict their scope sufficiently to reassure me that
there is not the danger, perhaps a few years hence, that the provision
will be misused and in a way that would further erode the power of this
Parliament to check the activities of the Executive. In light of recent
history, that is something of which we in this House should always be
conscious.</p><p><a name="0605151000383">The best
point made by the new Minister, whom I welcome to his post and who did
his best to get back to common sense on deregulation, was that there is
a danger that we will all be so sensitive about parliamentary procedure
that we will become extremely pedantic and Governments will again find
that their deregulatory legislation is quite inadequate for anything
except making such minor changes as to be of no consequence to anyone.
I tell myself&#151;and I hope that everybody else will in this
debate&#151;that one must guard against that before looking at new
clause 19 and saying that it is not adequate. However, I have done that
and I still think that whoever produced the new clause has been too
cautious.</p><p><a name="0605151000384">Proposed
subsection (3) leaves open the possibility of the repeal of any kind of
taxation in response to demands from pressure groups and commercial
lobbies. Procedures made illegal by the criminal law could be
legalised, and debate prevented by the fast-track procedure. I cited
the example of the repeal 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 742</b><br>of the climate change levy, because I thought that the proposal might
attract the Minister&#146;s interest. Conservative Members support
that repeal&#151; presumably, he is not favour of the
measure&#151;and there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the
Government from introducing it. The Bill could be used to provide an
exemption to value added tax on goods or services in response to a well
publicised and financed commercial lobby. VAT has become nonsense
because so many exemptions have been allowed over the years for
political purposes. Plenty of people would argue that their goods or
services are so desirable that an exemption is the obvious thing to
provide. It would be easier to give way to them, if any Government are
so minded, by using the legislation. Airport passenger tax, insurance
duty and all kinds of unpopular measures could be repealed under the
legislation, subject only to the consultation and the veto of the
Select Committee on which the Minister relies as
protections.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0605151000444">5.30

Cash: </b>I am not sure that I intend to make an offer to my
right hon. and learned Friend, but the very fact that VAT and other
measures that he cited derive from European legislation means that they
cannot be touched by the Bill. I may be able to elaborate more when I
speak to new clause 17.</p><p><a name="0605151000386"><b><a name="0605151000677">Mr.
Clarke:</b> Our debate has touched on new clause 17, but I
cannot begin to understand it. Having heard reference to it, I look
forward to my hon. Friend&#146;s explanation of what it is supposed
to do. If it merely restates the existing or original law, I shall not
be upset, but I do not think that it intends to do so. I believe that
my hon. Friend is trying to insert a subtle provision to allow all our
treaty obligations to be ignored, provided that procedures under the
Bill are followed. That would encourage any Government of whom he
wholly approved to make frequent use of the measure if they ever
assumed office. However, let us wait for his explanation.</p><p><a name="0605151000387">Turning to the criminal law, I
have suggested that the procedure could be used to end the illegality
of fox hunting. Most of the great liberal reforms abolishing criminal
penalties have been introduced by the House, but some people advocate
the introduction of things that they regard as liberal reforms. I do
not approve of euthanasia or assisted suicide, but the criminal penalty
on that act could be lifted under the Bill, subject only to the
safeguards on which the Minister relies. He disappoints me by repeating
the arguments deployed by his predecessor in response to such examples.
He accepts that the Bill as drafted would allow anyone to repeal such
penalties, but he says that the Government do not envisage doing so. He
says that it is not realistic to expect anyone to do so in
future.</p><p><a name="0605151000388"><b><a name="0605151000678">Mr.

Gentleman or any other Member to rely purely on my personal assurance
in the case of the emotive examples that he has just cited. May I
direct him to clause 3, which deals with the protections, rights and
freedoms that would clearly be infringed by those examples? It is not
my personal assurance that provides a guarantee against such measures
being taken by a future Government&#151;it is the
Bill.</p><p><a name="0605151000391"><b><a name="0605151000681">Mr.
Clarke:</b> I do not see&#151;perhaps in the reply an
attempt will be made to persuade me to see&#151;that clause 3 answers
my arguments on taxation or the criminal law in the slightest. Of
course they could be put forward, and they would have the effect of
lifting the criminal penalty from a particular category of people, or
lifting the financial burden from another category of people, but it
would be difficult to say that that automatically restricted the
freedoms of others. It might deeply offend the sensibilities or the
interests of others, but not their freedoms, so clause 3 is not an
answer.</p><p><a name="0605151000392">If the
Minister wants to give a specific answer, let him deal with my example
of taxation. I have not heard him yet explain why clause 5, which could
deal with the point, could not be amended to include any reduction in
taxation. If my point about changing taxation is so preposterous, why
does the wording of the Bill leave it open to allow the change in the
burden of taxation? Why does clause 5 not include reductions in
taxation, so that lobbies cannot try and persuade a Government to use
the power?</p><p><a name="0605151000393">That goes
back to a point that I made not on the Floor of the House, but in a
private debate with the Minister&#146;s predecessor in the precincts
of the Palace organised by the Hansard Society. There would never have
been any difficulty with the Bill if all the things that Ministers have
been prepared to say as assertions, promises and beliefs in principle
had been incorporated into the text. If Governments are accepting
various scenarios, why do they not bring them fully into the
text?</p><p><a name="0605151000394">I move on to the
safeguards to which the Minister keeps coming back: all these things
require consultation, and all would fail if the two Select Committees,
or the relevant Select Committee, were prepared to exercise a veto.
That is not good enough. That could be used to take away the powers of
Parliament on practically every subject. If we could all be reassured
by that, why on earth are we spending our time debating anything on the
Floor of the House?</p><p><a name="0605151000395">There are occasions when debate
on the Floor of the House is needed, not always because the majority is
opposed to some prospect, but to protect the rights of minorities as
well. I have taken part in protracted debates on the Floor of the House
where I have been in the large majority in the House. We have known
that we would get our legislation and I have known that I would be
voting on the winning side, but that does not mean that I thought it
was an irritating waste of time to allow a powerful section of public
opinion to voice its objections, to test the detail and to go through
the arguments. That is the whole point of Parliament. It must never be
regarded as just a nuisance that stands in the way of the parliamentary
majority for the time being getting its way.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 744</b><br><p><a name="0605151000396">What about the
protections about which we are told? I regret to say that I do not
think that the veto by a Select Committee is good enough. The two
Select Committees that have studied the Bill have done a very good job.
Select Committees do a very good job in the House, but I would not rely
upon them as the last defenders of parliamentary privilege and
parliamentary process in every case. It is a fact that the Government
determine the majority of every Select Committee. A Government
determined to get their way, who are irritated by what they see as
time-wasting and filibustering opposition, will ensure that Select
Committees do not veto their legislation and get it back on to the
Floor of the
House.</p><p><a name="0605151000397"><b><a name="0605151000682">Mr.
Heald:</b> Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that to
strengthen the Select Committees, an absolute veto is required, so that
they can say, &#147;We don&#146;t like the look of this order for
this process&#148;? A veto such as the one suggested, which we shall
debate later and which is so hedged round with restrictions, does not
give much confidence in the

<p><a name="0605151000398"><b><a name="0605151000683">Mr.
Clarke:</b> I agree entirely. I am glad to know that when we
return to the matter, my hon. Friend will press those points strongly,
because he is right.</p><p><a name="0605151000399">In
expressing my reservations still, in spite of the need for as flexible
a deregulatory measure as possible, let me make it clear to the
Minister that I do not fear that we will suddenly go to extreme
government. I realise that some of the examples that have been cited by
opponents, including the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) in
his article, were fairly preposterous in the context of today&#146;s
politicians. Those examples would never happen. We no longer need to
argue whether the right to jury trial would be taken away. There are
those in the Government who would like to take it away in a wide range
of cases, but in the modern state that is today&#146;s Britain, they
would never have dared to suggest that that should be done without any
proper parliamentary
process.</p><p><a name="0605151000400">As I have
said, I do not think that we are going straight away to extreme
Government. However, over 50 years we have seen a steady nibbling at
the edges of the parliamentary process. Those of us who have been in
this place for any length of time have seen a considerable nibble,
almost always for the best of intentions in the mind of the Government
of the time. I fear that for this Government, and may be for future
Administrations for all I know, the pressure on the parliamentary
timetable leads them to look for short cuts. I am not reassured by the
Minister for the Cabinet Office&#151;recently the Government Chief
Whip&#151;who is now in charge of the Bill. To get vast amounts of
legislation through the House, the time made available for debate on
any particular measure has been confined as never before.</p><p><a name="0605151000401">We can hear the arguments
already when the first of the proposed changes in legislation or in the
criminal law comes up. We shall hear: &#147;We have a mandate. We
have just fought the election. The opinion polls are wholly in favour
of what we propose. The people who are obstructing the process are
unrepresentative. They are an irritating minority.&#148; Already,
time and again, the Government keep making proposals, at present about
the procedures of the upper House. Those proposals 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 745</b><br>are designed to stop the time-wasting, the day-by-day discussion, which
irritates the Government because it delays their ability to get their
way. Secondly, it reduces the amount of legislation that they can
introduce, and holds up other measures on
Report.</p><p><a name="0605151000402"><b><a name="0605151000684">Mr.

seeking to argue for new clause 19, at least in part, on the basis of
what he describes as the pressures of the parliamentary timetable, as
though they were some independent variable with which Ministers have to
reckon. Does he accept that the pressures of the parliamentary

generous. For the second time in five minutes, I must accuse him of
being a little too sanguine. He said that the Government would never
use a procedure for nibbling away at jury trials. They have used Order
in Council procedure to do just that in the context of the Criminal
Justice Act 2003. They have used Orders in Council to remove the
requirement for prima facie evidence for extradition to the United
States. That is precisely the way in which the Government work. That is
usually on the pretext of fighting terrorism or rebalancing, whatever
that might
mean.</p><p><a name="0605151000415"><b><a name="0605151000695">Mr.
Clarke:</b> I accept the rebuke. I was going to end by saying
that although I do not think that we are going for extreme
Government&#151;I do not think that we are likely rapidly to see
unlikely things happen&#151;we have seen some unlikely things happen.
During the past three or four years I have seen processes on the Floor
of the House that I would not have believed could take place had I been
challenged 10 years ago to say that such things might happen. The
Minister dealing with the Bill on anti-terrorist measures calmly
announced on Report that he was abandoning its previous
wording&#151;that he was going to alter it all in the House of Lords.
We spent the timetabled three hours&#151;the entire Report
stage&#151;discussing the text of a letter that had accidentally been
leaked, and which had given the House some inkling of what that Bill
was eventually going to be like. That was, so far, the occasion on
which the Government have most clearly demonstrated their extreme
contempt for the processes of this House when political pressures are
upon them.</p><p><a name="0605151000416">Although
such dangers might not be imminent on all fronts, they are very real.
That is why, although what has been achieved so far is very welcome, it
is most definitely not enough. I hope that the Government will accept
some of the amendments being pressed on them today, and that this House
and the other place will continue in their efforts to ensure that the
wording eventually reflects the intention behind the Bill, and that it
ties this Government down to that intention
only.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051513000192">5.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06051513000091"><b><a name="06051513000237">Mr.
Redwood:</b> It is a great pity that so far in this debate on
this important new clause, we have had from Government Members and the
Liberal Democrats not a single example of a deregulatory measure that
could be deployed under this power, with the single exception of game
licences. Although I am very happy to welcome that one, it is not going
to change the world a great deal. One would have expected the
Government, when constructing this legislation over many months, to
have in mind many examples of how they wished to use this
power&#151;to be limited a bit under new clause 19&#151;and why it
was reasonable in the light of what they wish to do.</p><p><a name="06051513000092">I want the Government to
succeed at deregulation. It is a bit like suggesting that a tiger
should become a vegetarian, but one lives in hope that the Government
believe that deregulation is necessary and wish to do it. 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 747</b><br>However, it would have been so much easier to have
done it in the way that we proposed in a debate before the last
election in this very House. We gave the Government 63 items for
deregulation, including some very big ones, which were also given in
writing to the Minister&#146;s predecessor. The Government said that
a parliamentary debate somehow did not count as a way of expressing our
views on this matter, so I followed it up with a letter to the
Department, thereby enabling officials to see that list of items for
themselves. We said that that list should form the content of a
deregulation
Bill.</p><p><a name="06051513000093">That we are yet
again having a longish debate about the constitutional implications of
this Bill, just as we had to do on Second Reading and in Committee,
shows that it is not a very good way of achieving the desired
objective. Given that the leading Opposition party is more in favour of
deregulation than are the Government, if they had introduced a proper
deregulation Bill full of good ideas, it would probably have gone
through much more quickly than the constitutional outrage before us on
Second Reading, or the rather more limited constitutional outrage
before us today.</p><p><a name="06051513000094">The
hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher) is a Member whom
I normally respect and praise. He is very good at defending the virtues
of this House and its liberties, but he should have taken the
precaution of attending Second Reading or reading the <i>Hansard</i> of
it. Had he done so, he would have realised that I and my hon. Friends
the Members for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) and for South-West
Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) made it very clear that the substantial and
wide-ranging powers taken in the first draft of the Bill presented to
this House were unacceptable. They allowed Ministers to regulate and
legislate without going through the normal parliamentary processes.
They enabled a major bypass of constitutional practice by effectively
allowing primary legislation to be made by Ministers with very little
reference to the House of Commons, in a regulatory, as well as
deregulatory,
direction.</p><p><a name="06051513000095">We are now
told that new clause 19 will limit these wide-ranging powers to
legislating in a deregulatory direction. As someone who desperately
wants more deregulation, I say one cheer for that. But as someone who
strongly believes that Parliament has a right to debate all such
matters properly, I still share the concern of my right hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and others that
there are still too many powers inherent in new clause 19. It would
still give Ministers wide-ranging powers to do things that would be
better done in the open.</p><p><a name="06051513000096">When I advised a former
Government with a very large majority and a strong sense of political
direction on privatisation, we had a choice. We could have said,
&#147;Let&#146;s take one piece of legislation to the House of
Commons to give us an overall power to privatise anything we
wish&#148;, and then do it by order-making, industry by industry; or
we could have done it by primary legislation, industry by industry. I
advised&#151;I think that the Cabinet was of the same view
anyway&#151;that it should be done industry by industry with separate
pieces of legislation in each case. That meant far more effort and
difficulty for the Ministers concerned, but it was the right and
democratic thing to 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 748</b><br>do. Because those major nationalisations had been put
in place by separate pieces of legislation, industry by industry, we
thought that they should be undone industry by industry, with much more
lengthy and bruising debates in the House of Commons. It is
extraordinary that the Government can still think it right, despite the
change of heart represented by new clause 19, to propose deregulatory
measures that take the form of removing pieces of primary legislation
that have been passed by this House without going through the reverse
process that would be expected.</p><p><a name="06051513000097">Why should not we have not only
an annual Finance Bill but an annual deregulation Bill? Indeed, the
House might discuss and vote on the proposition that there should be a
combined finance and deregulation Bill every year. It would be
wonderful if the Treasury learned the habit of deregulation and
legislated for its tax revenues in a deregulatory way instead of the
very regulatory way that it does under this Government year after year,
with hundreds of pages of new and complex provisions for old taxes as
well as new ones. We could then have deregulatory budgets, Department
by Department, so that each year a Department would know that there was
a piece of legislation that it could use to fulfil the requirement to
cut the amount of regulatory burden that it was imposing.</p><p><a name="06051513000098">Alternatively, the Government
could achieve their deregulatory aims by ensuring that each major
departmental piece of legislation that went through had an additional
deregulatory section. We hoped that that was what the Prime Minister
had in mind when he told us, in respect of regulations, that it would
be a case of one in, one out. We hoped that each piece of regulating
legislation would therefore contain a complementary deregulatory
section so that we could be assured that the overall burden was not
going up. But the Government never do that. They do not take advantage
of the many legislative vehicles trundling through this House of
Commons year after year, usually covering each of the main Departments
in turn, by including them in their deregulatory ambitions. Today, we
are again left with a truncated and guillotined debate on big changes
in constitutional practice.</p>

reaffirm the recommendation of our predecessor Committee that
Departments should be assessed on their progress in removing
unnecessary regulations and controls and not simply on their progress
in simplifying
matters.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051513000103">Does he agree
with
that?</p><p><a name="06051513000104"><b><a name="06051513000239">Mr.
Redwood:</b> I seem to remember that in the &#146;80s the
Government carried out a lot of deregulation and liberalisation that
greatly benefited whole sectors of industry such as telecoms, in which
I was privileged to be involved as Minister.</p><p><a name="06051513000105">Yes, I do agree with the
recommendation by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Committee. I praise him
for him for its work and for being one of the many voices that drew
attention to the problems involved in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06051513000106"><b><a name="06051513000240">Mr.
Heald:</b> I imagine that my right hon. Friend is aware that
amendments that we tabled in Committee, and now new clause 2, would
require a regular report on
progress.</p><p><a name="06051513000107"><b><a name="06051513000241">Mr.
Redwood:</b> I agree. Of course, it was a Conservative
recommendation from before the last election that every Department
should have a regulatory budget. Under Conservative control, those
budgets would be reduced year after year across all Departments as a
whole, and if one Department needed or wished to increase its
regulatory burden, it would have to find other Departments that would
take a proportionate cut so that the overall burden did not go up. One
would need an annual deregulatory Bill to go through to implement
that.</p><p><a name="06051513000108"><b><a name="06051513000242">Mr.
Shepherd:</b> My right hon. Friend says that he will vote for
new clause 19. Would it not be more cautious to say that that is
dependent upon acceptance of the qualifying amendments (a), (b), (c)
and (d), so that the vote is conditional? That is what I would urge on
him and on my
party.</p><p><a name="06051513000109"><b><a name="06051513000243">Mr.
Redwood:</b> I, too, would like those amendments to be
carried. However, I think that I said that it would be churlish to vote
against new clause 19 and left open the position on how far we would
get in amending it and whether we wanted to increase the
Government&#146;s possible majority.</p><p><a name="06051513000110">Finally, I turn to the
amendments on the European issue tabled by my hon. Friend the Member
for Stone (Mr. Cash). Nowadays, so much of our regulation 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 750</b><br>comes from Brussels that we cannot exempt that from scrutiny and from
our deregulatory urge. New clause 17 makes a good attempt to draw the
House&#146;s attention to that and to make Ministers understand that
they cannot have a deregulation policy worth anything unless they are
prepared to tackle quite a number of the regulatory burdens coming from
Brussels. That would preferably be through renegotiation of those
individual items, but it would be good to have a legislative back-up to
make it crystal clear that if this House wishes to deregulate
something, that should be law made here in the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06051513000111"><b><a name="06051513000244">Mr.
Cash:</b> I am glad to follow my right hon. Friend the Member
for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) in his remarks. I, too, have reservations
about the principal objective of this Bill, which is to have a
fast-track procedure for dealing with matters that is very far-reaching
even with the changes proposed in new clause 19, as my right hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and other hon.
Members have said. The fact is that this is a very invasive Bill. No
doubt we shall wait to see what happens on Third Reading, when all our
other debates have been
concluded.</p><p><a name="06051513000112">In an
earlier intervention, I said that there was a vast
omission&#151;indeed, a black hole&#151;in the proposal before us,
which has been dressed up and presented as a deregulatory measure to
reduce the burdens on business. That raises some practical questions. I
am delighted to say that some six weeks ago, 50 of my right hon. and
hon. Friends put their names to my amendments, which would ensure that
we got the clarification in our own law that would enable us, where
necessary and after appropriate negotiations&#151;it would be done in
a responsible and prudential fashion&#151;to insist that we should
deregulate on our own terms at Westminster and make it law in this
country, binding on the judiciary and overriding the requirements of
section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 in that regard. Having
spoken to senior advisers in the House, I understand that this is the
first time that an amendment of this significance has been selected for
debate since 1972. There was an attempt, during the passage of the 1972
Act, to table an amendment that proposed that nothing in the Act should
derogate from the sovereignty of the United Kingdom
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06051513000113">Some of
us will recall the Single European Act that was passed in 1986. I
tabled a similar amendment to that legislation. It was on the Order
Paper, and my name remained in splendid isolation until I walked into
the Lobby on the afternoon of the debate, where a certain very
distinguished parliamentarian came up to me and said, in his inimitable
fashion, &#147;I think you will be interested to see that I have put
my name to your amendment.&#148; Of course, it was none other than
the right hon. Enoch Powell. He perfectly understood the object of the
exercise.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051513000193">6
pm</h5><p><a name="06051513000114">Despite the
best efforts of the European Scrutiny Committee and the European
Standing Committees, the present volume of European legislation, and
the fast-track procedures that are used to introduce that legislation
into the House, are such that the accusations made by my right hon. and
learned Friend the Member 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 751</b><br>for Rushcliffe about the reduction&#151;and, some would say, the
redaction&#151;of our legislation within the procedures set out in
our Standing Orders could easily be explained in terms of the European
legislation that we have to accept under section 2 of the European
Communities Act. That legislation receives scrutiny, but if anyone ever
attempts to do anything about it by voting against a particular
provision in a European Standing Committee, the House immediately
reverses the decision. Many people, including me, regard those
procedures as a waste of parliamentary
opportunity.</p><p><a name="06051513000115"><b><a name="06051513000245">David
Howarth:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman think it wise that this
country should breach the principle of the supremacy of Community law,
which is what his amendment would appear to seek to achieve, by means
of a statutory instrument and not of a
Bill?</p><p><a name="06051513000116"><b><a name="06051513000246">Mr.
Cash:</b> That would be a valid point, were it not for the
fact that the only way in which it is possible to assert the
legislative supremacy of this House is under, and by virtue of, primary
legislation. The hon. Gentleman is a distinguished lawyer, and he
probably anticipated my saying that. In my legal opinion, it would be
impossible to seek to override section 2 of the European Communities
Act 1972 merely by order. However, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that
the mechanism that I have employed in my new clause has been before
parliamentary counsel and cleared for this purpose. It says</p><a name="06051513000179"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;notwithstanding the European
Communities Act
1972&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06051513000117">and refers to any
order repealing, amending or replacing other legislation that has been
introduced under section 2 and is therefore binding on this Parliament
only by virtue of the 1972 Act. We could not change that by order, but
if the authority were given by primary legislation, using the
words</p><a name="06051513000180"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;notwithstanding
the European Communities Act
1972&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06051513000118">that would attract
the legislative supremacy of the primary legislation that the Bill
before us would then provide. At that point, the provision would have
effect with regard to the fast-track procedure, notwithstanding my
concerns about the fast-track procedure in principle, which will no
doubt be resolved on Third Reading.</p><p><a name="06051513000119"><b><a name="06051513000247">David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made my point for me. The
only kind of procedure available under the Bill is the statutory
instrument, which does not receive sufficient parliamentary scrutiny.
That is why many of us have objected to the Bill over the past few
months. The hon. Gentleman is seeking to use a regulatory reform order,
which would not receive sufficient scrutiny, to violate the principle
of Community law supremacy. That would be an extraordinary thing to do,
diplomatically.</p><p><a name="06051513000120"><b><a name="06051513000248">Mr.
Cash:</b> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman added the word
&#147;diplomatically&#148; there. Ultimately, this is a matter not
only of grave constitutional importance but of political significance.
I would say it was more political than diplomatic, but it is a matter
of great importance, for all the reasons that I shall
outline.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 752</b><br><p><a name="06051513000121"><b><a name="06051513000249">Mr.
Redwood:</b> The ill-judged intervention by the hon. Member
for Cambridge (David Howarth), who clearly does not understand the
important point that my hon. Friend is making, shows that the Lib Dems
are craven and slavish on European matters. They want our regulations
to come from Brussels, and they do not want this House to be able to
influence or change them.
</p><p><a name="06051513000122"><b><a name="06051513000250">Mr.
Cash:</b> I do not want to antagonise the Liberal Democrats
too much. I am not in the business of laying traps for people, but the
hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) said that he was minded
to support my new clause, and I hope that he will stand good on that
when we go into the Lobby.</p><p><a name="06051513000123">Important
questions arise that are not merely of an abstract nature. The House
has a long history in this regard. Those who have studied
constitutional law will remember Henry VIII and the Statute of
Proclamations, the great Edward Coke, the achievement of the
legislative supremacy of Parliament in 1688, following the final
denouement of the Stuarts&#146; attempts to insist on the divine
right of kings at the expense of the people of this country, and the
assertion in the Bill of Rights in that year that decisions would be
made by Parliament and not by the monarchy. Those issues are not
dissimilar to the questions that arise in the context of the European
Communities Act 1972.</p><p><a name="06051513000124"><b><a name="06051513000251">Mr.

Clarke:</b> I am sure that my hon. Friend would not suggest
that any of those great measures should be set aside by statutory
instrument, subject to the veto of two Select Committees. He is helping
the arguments of those who think that the Government have not gone far
enough. The Government say that no politician would conceive of
abolishing a tax or a criminal offence by statutory instrument, yet my
hon. Friend is advocating the repudiation of our treaty
obligations&#151;and, effectively, our leaving the European
Union&#151;by a parliamentary process that would allow those of us
who are pro-European merely the opportunity to object to a statutory
instrument, or to get a Select Committee to block
it.</p><p><a name="06051513000127"><b><a name="06051513000254">Mr.
Cash:</b> I am delighted that my right hon. and learned Friend
has now entered into the debate with gusto. I had hoped that I might be
called to speak before him, so that he could have engaged in a series
of interventions on me. I am afraid that the issues that he raises do
not add up.</p><p><a name="06051513000128">Since
1972, we have been subjected to a constant stream of legislation that
has been brought in by prerogative. Let us take the Maastricht treaty
as an example, or the treaties of Nice or Amsterdam. I do not need to
weary the House with the vast amount of legislation of that kind that
has gone through this House, actively encouraged by my right hon. and
learned Friend. Much of it has been resisted by popular sentiment, even
though not everyone has 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 753</b><br>understood every jot and tittle of it. My right hon. and learned Friend
himself said that he found it difficult, to use the words of new clause
19,</p><a name="06051513000181"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;for example, where
the legislation is hard to understand&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06051513000129">With regard to the population at large,
the same applies to much of the European legislation, which is
regularly visited on them by virtue of the extremely truncated,
undemocratic and unaccountable methods employed through the European
treaties and the mechanisms of the House. Ultimately, those lead to
legislation going through effectively because we are told that the
European Communities Act 1972 is inviolable, cannot be touched and is
in concrete, that there is an acquis communautaire, that we should
forget about any changes, and that the constant stream of European
integration must therefore continue. Well, I have news for my right
hon. and learned Friend&#151;this is a moment when we say
no.</p><p><a name="06051513000130"><b><a name="06051513000255">Mr.
Andrew Turner:</b> Is not my hon. Friend being a little
incautious in his advocacy of this altogether welcome new clause? The
manner in which he is proposing it and dealing with interventions not
only from my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe
(Mr. Clarke) but from the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) is
widening the gulf between those who are in favour of the new clause and
those who are against it, rather than bringing together those who have
some concerns with those who are in favour of the new clause. When the
hon. Member for Cambridge says that the supposed supremacy of European
law is being set aside by a mere order, it is not an order that is
doing that but this new clause. My hon. Friend was wrong to agree with
the hon. Member for Cambridge on that.</p>

<p><a name="06051513000131"><b><a name="06051513000256">Mr.
Cash:</b> With respect, my hon. Friend might consider that
matter again. The mechanism to enable the constitutional procedure to
have the effect that I desire is contained in the new clause. I think
that the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) understood that. We
need the backing of primary legislation, using the magic
words,</p><a name="06051513000182"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;notwithstanding
the European Communities Act
1972&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06051513000132">and then referring
to the fact that it shall be binding in legal proceedings in the United
Kingdom. That provides the mechanism whereby the judiciary are under a
duty to give effect to that latest Act of Parliament.</p><p><a name="06051513000133">Before I move on to the
question whether legislative supremacy is a principle to which we still
adhere, I want to deal first with the reasons why, from a practical
point of view, I regard it as extremely important that we understand
how invasive the burdens have been in relation to the business
community, industry, competitiveness and enterprise. Leaving aside the
system that I have employed to achieve my results, that is my main
point. For example, a short time ago, the British Chambers of Commerce
produced figures showing the accumulated cost of burdens that arose in
respect of a number of regulations. It did not, however, demonstrate
that the top six&#151;the most burdensome and most costly
ones&#151;were all of European origin, of 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 754</b><br>which I could give several examples. The total cost, from the moment
that the burdens were introduced to the moment that the figures were
published, came to &#163;25 billion. The regulations concerned
included the working time regulations, the Data Protection Act 1998,
the Employment Act 2002 and so on.</p><p><a name="06051513000134">In addition,
Sir David Arculus, the Government-appointed chairman of the Better
Regulation Task Force, estimated the cost to business of
over-burdensome regulations&#151;I stand to be corrected, as the
figure seems extraordinarily high, but it is the one that he gave, as
far as I can recollect&#151;as &#163;100 billion. No wonder the
Government are looking for a way to deal with the problem. We can break
down the European element of that, but we should also consider the
percentage of legislation passed through the truncated, unaccountable,
unattractive and undemocratic procedures in the House, which impose
those expensive regulations on British business. Those regulations are
then in concrete, and we can do nothing about them, whatever their
merits. Once such regulations have been passed by a qualified majority
vote, the legislation is imposed on us, and other member states might
have a vested interest in not making changes that may be
required.</p><p><a name="06051513000135">I take
seriously the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight
(Mr. Turner). However, I do not want or intend to over-egg the pudding
on this point. For me, this is essentially a practical question about
the burdens on business and deregulation. It is not a foray into the
abstractions of sovereignty; it is about the way that the system works.
It is a time check on reality. Are we going to allow this legislation
to continue to invade our business community? The House should remember
that I have always said that I am in favour of trade and political
co-operation, and I voted for the Single European Act, notwithstanding
my attempt to preserve the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, for that
reason. I wrote an article in <i>The Times </i>for that purpose at the
time. I foresaw that we might find ourselves saturated in unnecessary
burdens and that we would need to relieve them in the interests of
competition. It was therefore essential to have the mechanism to enable
us to do that. Unfortunately, under the rules of the supremacy of
Community law&#151;the other law, in the parallel universe that
exists in legislation&#151;we are not allowed to have that mechanism,
under the terms of the case law of the European Union. The hon. Member
for Cambridge and I could go through all the case law, and I would
agree with him that the position is clear under Community
law.</p><p><a name="06051513000136">However, all
that case law, every one of those burdens and every aspect of that
European legislation depend on one thing only&#151;the legislative
supremacy of this House in passing the European Communities Act 1972.
As a consequence, it is open to our judiciary&#151;as in the
different context of the Human Rights Act 1998&#151;to interpret and
apply that law. That is solely, exclusively and entirely because of the
European Communities Act 1972 passed by this House. If this House
decides that it wishes to make changes, by whatever procedure, it is
incumbent on the judiciary to give effect to that subsequent
inconsistent law, providing that it is express and unambiguous. That
case law is laid down unequivocally by Lord Denning in the case of
McCarthy&#146;s <i>v.</i> Smith, by Lord Justice Laws in the case of
the metric martyrs and by Lord Steyn himself in a lecture in
1996.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 755</b><br><p><a name="06051513000137">There are so
many misunderstandings about the role of the judiciary in these
matters. So much confusion is created by invoking the principles of
Community law when we are dealing with, and must continue to insist on,
the principles of United Kingdom constitutional law. From the earliest
days of the 17th century, in a constant movement towards the
establishment of the democratic Parliament that we have today, that has
been dependent on the fact that we legislate and the judges obey. I do
not mean that in a derogatory sense; it is what the judges say of their
own
function.</p><p><a name="06051513000139">I mentioned Lord Steyn. He is
well known as a distinguished lawyer, with&#151;I would
say&#151;some influence, and with strong views about the European
Community. We understand that he is enthusiastic about it. In a lecture
that he gave in 1996, however, he made his opinion abundantly clear. He
said</p><a name="06051513000183"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in countless
decisions the courts have declared the unqualified supremacy of
Parliament. There are no
exceptions.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051513000140"><b><a name="06051513000257">Mr.
Heath:</b> It is always worth listening carefully to the hon.
Gentleman. I agree entirely with his point about legislative supremacy
in the context of the European Communities Act 1972, and, as he knows,
I agree largely with what he says about the proper application of
subsidiarity and excessive regulation. However, he has posed a
conundrum to both the Liberal Democrats and his own Front Benchers, who
in Committee supported new clause 7, which excluded the European
Communities Act from consideration of the procedural device that the
Government propose. We agreed that it was not a matter that should
undergo the fast-track procedure. Now the hon. Gentleman is inviting us
to place it squarely and centrally in the fast-track procedure. As I
think he will recognise, that poses a great difficulty both to us and
to the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr.
Heald).</p><p><a name="06051513000141"><b><a name="06051513000258">Mr.
Cash:</b> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but what I am
trying to do is to invoke T.S. Eliot&#146;s famous observation that
humankind finds it very difficult to deal with
reality.</p><p><a name="06051513000142"><b><a name="06051513000259">Mr.
Heald:</b> I think my hon. Friend will agree that using the
order-making power to amend the European Communities Act 1972 might be
a bit strong, even for him. Is not his point that, if a procedure
allows us to change the law in this country and if there is a principle
of sovereignty, it is open to our Parliament to use that procedure to
change laws that affect our European Union treaty obligations? Of
course, whether that is a good idea is a different question, and it is
possible that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and I would not make the same judgment as my
hon. Friend. In terms of the sovereignty of Parliament, though, it must
be right for us to be able to change laws that break EU treaty
obligations. It is just that it is probably not a very good
idea.</p><p><a name="06051513000143"><b><a name="06051513000260">Mr.

of view. Looking at the complexion of this Government, I should not
have thought that there was a cat in hell&#146;s chance of their
using the fast-track procedure in any way to affect the European
legislation, but the case that I have made in respect of the burden on
business is unanswerable, as is my observation that it is not included
in the package. I do 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 756</b><br>not expect the Government to take it up, but my hon. Friend is right to
point out that if we are to be correct and accurate in regard to our
constitutional position in UK law, and in the context of the
legislative supremacy of Parliament, it is incumbent on us to recognise
the issues and to recognise that, through a process of absorption,
osmosis and camouflage, they have been overtaken. People have come to
believe that everything is set in concrete. It is not, and that is part
of the point of my new
clause.</p><p><a name="06051513000144"><b><a name="06051513000261">Mr.
Shepherd:</b> My hon. Friend is right, especially in one
respect. The new clause demonstrates clearly to those who are persuaded
by the reasons given for membership of the European Communities that
they can be changed and irrevocably broken by a statutory instrument.
That is what is wrong with the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06051513000145"><b><a name="06051513000262">Mr.
Cash:</b> Indeed. It is undesirable that fast-track procedures
should be regarded as the best way in which to go about
things&#151;we have been through the argument already, and we may
well vote against that proposal on Third Reading&#151;but it is
important to establish and reassert a principle. We have not had many
opportunities to do that in the context of a substantive Government
Bill to which amendments can be tabled for purposes of
clarity.</p><p><a name="06051513000146">Let me say
this to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe, a
distinguished chairman of the Conservative party&#146;s democracy
commission. It would not be good enough to assert&#151;if he were to
do so&#151;that what I propose is not possible through the
legislative supremacy of the House of Commons. He cannot avoid the fact
that what I am saying is good constitutional law of the United

of section 2, in particular, of the European Communities Act. Surely it
is open to any Government to introduce legislation to repeal that
section, if they so wish. My hon. Friend and I would disagree on the
desirability of such a measure, but a proper way of dealing with the
issue would be to present primary legislation&#151;which, I would
hope, would be debated at the same length as the original
legislation&#151;on the Floor of the House of Commons. My hon. Friend
is a great parliamentarian, and I cannot understand why he of all

to amend or repeal the 1972 Act, but could be used to make explicit
that Parliament can change statutes notwithstanding the provisions of
the Act? That is a rather unexceptional constitutional convention under
which we all live. My hon. Friend&#146;s new clause is thus a modest
measure that 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 757</b><br>will certainly not lead to the vast constitutional revolution posited by

Friend the Member for Rushcliffe, which are primarily political, and
those of the hon. Member for Cambridge, which appear to be primarily
diplomatic, I insist on my point.

of legislative supremacy is that the courts obey Acts of Parliament.
You are right, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to bring me back to that point,
because that is the essential point that must be
understood.</p><a name="06051513000184"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
rule of judicial obedience is in one sense a rule of common
law...it is the ultimate political fact upon which the whole
system of legislation
hangs.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051513000164">Those
are the words of Sir William Wade, one of the great constitutional
authorities. I mentioned the judgments of Mr. Justice Edward Coke,
which, relying on the sovereignty of Parliament, stated that the courts
could void Acts of Parliament. We now have democracy, votes and general
elections but, unfortunately, in the context of the Human Rights Act
1998, which I shall not dwell on, and the European Communities Act
1972, the judiciary have been trying to push the boundaries beyond the
established legislative supremacy of Parliament, by drawing down a
greater degree of supranationalism. They have even been saying that
treaties have a special status. Neither treaties nor convention can
stand in the way of legislation&#151;of Acts of Parliament. All the
judicial decisions given in the past several centuries have reasserted
that main proposition. Ultimately, the judiciary derive their judicial
authority from Parliament and, I should say, from the source of their
payments, salaries and allowances.</p><p><a name="06051513000165">I mentioned the comments of
Lord Steyn, who is by no means a person with whom one would easily
disagree. In the case of Manuel <i>v.</i> Attorney-General, Sir Robert
Megarry stated
unequivocally:</p><a name="06051513000185"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the duty
of the court is to obey and apply every Act of
Parliament&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051513000166">What is
required to deal with the problem facing us of burdens of business is a
clear and unambiguous statement in the Bill, for which the appropriate
form of words
is:</p><a name="06051513000186"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;notwithstanding the
European Communities Act 1972&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051513000167">Even the case of Factortame,
which dealt with the Merchant Shipping Act 1988, ultimately depended on
the passing of the European Communities Act 1972. In the words of Lord
Bridge, Parliament&#146;s surrender of sovereignty in the 1972 Act
was voluntary. What has been given can be taken away; that is the
principle. It does not necessarily follow from my new clause that there
would be a political decision and a vote in the House of Commons to do
that, although I believe that we have gone far too far in European
integration and that we need a substantial and radical retrenchment.
Even the judgment of Lord Hope in the recent case of Jackson and others
<i>v.</i> Attorney-General ultimately depends on the 1972 Act. Mr.
Justice Laws referred to 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 759</b><br>&#147;constitutional statutes&#148;, which were purported to be
given an additional status over and above ordinary Acts of Parliament.
In the context of the European legislation, they themselves would
depend on the fact that Parliament had passed the necessary
legislation.</p><p><a name="06051513000168">The
Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, the hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. McFadden), has it in mind that
some gold-plating can be removed. However, where that gold-plating
ultimately depends on the fundamental and intrinsic nature of the
European directive or regulation on which it is based, merely removing
it and all the Cabinet Office mechanisms that are employed, including
regulatory impact assessments, transposition notes, and so
on&#151;complicated stuff that nobody in the small business community
really knows exists&#151;will be of no value at all if the
fundamental issue is not tackled. In the democracy in which we live,
the United Kingdom Parliament acquires its authority from the voters at
general elections, which decide the Government. The hon. Member for
Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher) is correct: Parliament is first.
The bottom line is that we have the right to be able to decide what
legislation is to be
passed.</p><p><a name="06051513000169">There are
those, such as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Rushcliffe, who&#151;uncritically, I think&#151;are willing to
accept pretty well everything that comes from the European Union and do
not want it to be amended or repealed. He would argue strongly, as he
has today, that the mechanism that I propose is not to his liking. The
reality is that we must stipulate that this House is the sovereign
place where the democratic wishes of the people of this country are
implemented. If it is necessary to override supranational legislation,
whether the Human Rights Act or the European Communities Act, it is our
right and our duty to do so.
</p><p><a name="06051513000170">The legislative
supremacy of this House is what the Bill is all about and it is the
reason why I tabled new clause 17. I believe that, in the context of
the burdens of business and deregulation, this debate has been
necessary. I am extremely glad that my hon. Friends will go into the
Lobby to support the new
clause.</p><p><a name="06051517000001"><b><a name="06051517000032">David
Howarth:</b> In one of the more arcane Committee debates, it
was discovered that the words &#147;local Act&#148; included Acts
of Parliament relating to universities, so as new clause 19 still
includes those words I declare my interest as a fellow of a Cambridge
college and a university
reader.</p><p><a name="06051517000002">The hon.
Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) is right: in the end, it comes down to a
political, diplomatic choice. It is perfectly open to the House to
repeal section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 either in whole
or in part, and to do whatever it wants with our relationship with
Europe. I would not deny any part of his speech when he was making
those remarks, but the question is whether those actions would be wise
and on that matter he and I might
disagree.</p><p><a name="06051517000003">I
agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)
that the best amendment in the group is Government amendment No. 10,
which removes clause 1&#151;a very good thing to remove. It is an
extraordinary provision that allowed the Government to change any
primary legislation at will. The theory that the Government appear to
be following, and which they appeared to be 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 760</b><br>following last Wednesday night when we were discussing House of Lords
reform, is that by their mere existence as the Government they are
entitled to whatever legislation they want. But that is not the
constitutional theory on which this country is based. Parliament
legislates, not the Government.</p><p><a name="06051517000004">Another point that we tried to
make in Committee, and a mistake into which the Minister appeared to be
slipping today, is that it is not the motives of Ministers, or those of
the Government that matter, but what the Bill actually says. In that
regard, new clause 19 is still defective in two ways. The first is that
there is still no control over the subject matter to which the Bill
applies. As the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)
said, under subsection (6) the provision applies, in principle, to all
legislation. In principle, the abolition of jury trial, for example,
can be achieved under the Bill by statutory instrument. If new clause
26, which prevents the use of the Bill for amendments to the measure
itself and to the Human Rights Act 1998, were passed, even that would
not protect jury trial because the Human Rights Act does not in terms,
or by implication, protect jury trial. That aspect of our legal
tradition is not protected by the European convention on human rights
or by our incorporation of it into our
law.</p><p><a name="06051517000005">The right hon.
and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) said that outlandish
possibilities were being discussed, but the erosion of the right to
trial by jury by the Labour Government is far from an outlandish
possibility. Indeed, every time the Prime Minister talks about changing
the balance in the criminal justice system he means measures of that
sort. </p><p><a name="06051517000006">A second reason
why control over subject matter is important is that it would still be
possible under new clause 19 to institute major constitutional change
by statutory instrument as long as a Minister considered that it would
relieve or reduce burdens. That might include abrogation of section 2
of the European Communities Act and would certainly include matters
such as the radical reform of local government, which should, in my
view, be achieved only by primary legislation. Although the new clause
is welcome, it needs to go much further in a number of ways. In a later
group, we shall discuss new clause 16, which deals directly with
subject matter, but there are other problems with the
measure.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051517000030">6.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06051517000007">The second
major problem is the subjective test. The new clause, like the original
provision, leaves the decision about whether use of the Bill is
appropriate in the hands of the Minister&#151;if the Minister
considers that the conditions for its use are fulfilled. The Minister
might consider that jury trial&#151;to take that example
again&#151;constitutes an administrative or financial burden. It is
right that the new clause excludes from the scope of the Bill burdens
on Ministers and Departments, but a Minister could easily consider that
jury trial imposed burdens on employers, by removing employees from
their workplace for the duration of a trial.</p><p><a name="06051517000008">It is important to recognise
the weakness of the subjective test under the new clause. Our amendment
(a) would strengthen that test by inserting the word
&#147;reasonably&#148;, the effect of which would be to heighten 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 761</b><br>the bar over which the Minister must leap to entitle him to use the
Bill. In the longer term, the provision would give the courts clearer
guidance when considering new orders under judicial
review.</p><p><a name="06051517000009"><b><a name="06051517000033">Mr.
Heald:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the provision
would add an element of objectivity to the test? It would be necessary
for a Minister, if pressed, or in judicial review proceedings, to show
that there were reasonable grounds on which the reasonableness could be
based. There would need to be substantial evidence to support
it.</p><p><a name="06051517000010"><b><a name="06051517000034">David
Howarth:</b> That is an important point. If there were a
challenge to ministerial action, it is possible that there would be an
attempt at judicial review but what would be the test applied by the
court? Without the word &#147;reasonably&#148;, the only test that
the court could apply would simply be whether it was true that the
Minister indeed considered that the measure was lifting a burden. It
would be difficult for a court to get behind a ministerial statement to
that effect unless there was clear evidence that what the Minister was
saying was not true, or was unbelievable. It is all too believable that
a Minister might believe that trial by jury imposed an administrative
or financial burden and should be abolished.</p><p><a name="06051517000011">The same
point applies to the insertion of the word &#147;reasonably&#148;
in clause 3. Throughout the debates on the Bill, Ministers have pointed
to the protections in clause 3 as a way of deflecting criticism about
the removal of necessary rights and freedoms. There has been a debate,
or perhaps a lack of understanding, between opposite sides of the House
about what those rights are and which of them are necessary. Labour
Members were concerned lest Ministers remove rights such as those
relating to the minimum wage under the Bill, but Ministers have told
them that under clause 3 those rights are &#147;necessary
protection&#148;. The problem with that is: who says that they are
necessary protection? The answer: the Minister&#151;subjectively.
Were the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) the Minister, he
might have a different view and consider the matter differently from
the present
Minister.</p><p><a name="06051517000012">Conservative
Members were keen to emphasise that a different sort of right was
necessary and the Minister tried to reassure them in the opposite
direction. The Minister&#146;s defence of the Bill has run the risk
of contradiction on a number of
occasions.</p><p><a name="06051517000013"><b><a name="06051517000035">Mr.
Greg Knight: </b>The hon. Gentleman is on to a very good
point. Could not a Government of one complexion use clause 3, for
example, to remove administrative burdens and financial penalties from
company directors, whereas a Government of a different persuasion could
use the same provision to remove administrative burdens and financial
penalties from trade unions? He is therefore absolutely right to say
that there is not adequate protection in clause
3.</p><p><a name="06051517000014"><b><a name="06051517000036">David
Howarth:</b> Yes, I believe that to be the case. In fact,
Ministers from different parties could make opposite decisions on the
same matter but still be within the terms of the Bill, because all that
it requires is that Ministers consider that certain things are the
case.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 762</b><br><p><a name="06051517000015">The Minister
has followed his predecessor in asserting that none of this matters
because tomorrow we will pass the Committee veto and that all our
concerns should fall in at that point. All I say in response is that
the Committee veto is not a veto, because the Government retain the
right to overturn it in the House as a whole. If it were a Committee
veto and there were no appeal against what the Committee decided, the
situation might be more interesting, but even then there is the problem
to which a number of hon. Members have referred that the
Government&#146;s in-built majority on all Committees&#151;indeed,
their ability to change the membership of Committees in advance, as the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster no doubt knows from her previous
job&#151;is enough at least to throw into doubt whether that aspect
of the so-called Committee veto is an adequate
protection.</p><p><a name="06051517000016">I find
another aspect of new clause 19 particularly disturbing, but I will not
refer to it at great length tonight because the best time for that
discussion will be tomorrow in a debate on a new clause. However, two
amendments in this group deal with the point, and I should explain to
the House what they are about. New clause 19, like the old clause 2,
contains a provision that allows, by order, legislative power to be
transferred to any person. It strikes me as an extraordinary power to
grant the Government, and the extent to which the person to whom that
power is transferred will be subject to the restrictions in the Bill is
not clear. It is that matter to which we will return tomorrow, but it
is a major weakness of the Bill that the purpose for which that
provision was proposed&#151;it has been proposed again
tonight&#151;has never been made properly clear. New clause 19 is an
advance on the old clause 1, but it is still deeply defective in many
ways. Unless further amendments and further concessions are made, I
fear that the Bill is still
unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="06051517000017"><b><a name="06051517000037">Mr.
Heathcoat-Amory: </b>I rise in support of new clause
17, and I wish to speak to it quite briefly, but by way of preface, I
should say that I have an interest to declare in that I have a number
of business interests that might conceivably might be beneficiaries of
the Bill if it passes into law. From that perspective, I can confirm to
the House that over-regulation is the modern scourge. As a population,
we are dividing into those who do things and those who stop people
doing things. That is having very severe consequences for business
activity and, indeed, international
competitiveness.</p><p><a name="06051517000018">My
other credential for speaking in the debate is that I am a member of
the European Scrutiny Committee and therefore am able to see that the
regulatory itch has not abated in the European Union. Every now and
then, the European Commission declares war on over-regulation&#151;it
did so again last year&#151;but, again, I can report from my
perspective on that Committee that, so far, over-regulation is winning
that war. It has shifted into new policies, but the overall
volume of legislation has not decreased. That is where new clause 17
becomes relevant.</p><p><a name="06051517000019">I
wish to remind the House of an example of over-regulation that could
become the subject of the Bill. There have been many calls in the
debate for hon. Members to give specific examples of regulatory
overreach that could engage the House&#146;s attention if 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 763</b><br>the Bill is passed. I wish to remind the House that,
earlier this year, we passed regulations implementing the
artist&#146;s resale right, or to give it its French title, the
droite de suite regulations, which give living artists, and will
eventually give to dead artists as well, a right to a percentage of
revenue when their works are resold. The British Government opposed
that EU directive, but it was imposed on this country and the House by
majority voting. The implementing regulations were debated earlier this
year.</p><p><a name="06051517000020">Unfortunately,
those regulations got into the hands of the Department of Trade and
Industry and, specifically, a weak Minister in another place who
spectacularly over-regulated. Instead of implementing that directive to
the letter and sticking to what was strictly required by the
artist&#146;s resale right directive, he ensured that the threshold
was not €3,000, but €1,000 for a work of art, thus
drawing into the net huge numbers of extra businesses and items and
completely contradicting the Prime Minister&#146;s and the
Government&#146;s earlier campaign in Brussels to try to get the
directive rejected.</p><p><a name="06051517000021">The Government understood that
the directive would be intensely bureaucratic. Very small sums would be
collected and possibly redistributed to artists if they could be found.
If a work of art was valuable, it would simply not be sold in London;
the business would go to New York. That was demonstrated beyond doubt.
All those arguments were forgotten by the DTI. I hope that those
regulations will be reconsidered in the course of experience, because
they will undoubtedly damage London&#146;s position as a leading art
market, as well as not in any real way enriching poorer
artists.</p><p><a name="06051517000022">In a year or
two, the Government might wish to amend those regulations, and I hope
that they will do so. Given that they are both EU regulations and
domestically gold-plated, new clause 17 will be relevant. The House may
decide simply to take the regulations back to what is strictly required
by the directive; or the House may wish to go further and trespass on
the terms of the directive in recognition of the campaign fought, as I
have explained, right across the party divide against the directive in
the first place. Therefore, it is important that Parliament is aware
that those regulations could be amended even though certain
requirements are entrenched in a directive. The political judgment at
the time might well argue against that, and we might decide not to
contradict any provision in the artist&#146;s resale right directive,
but we do not know. That is a judgment, and it is important that
Parliament understands and has it written into the Bill that it has
powers to legislate notwithstanding the provisions of the European
Communities Act 1972.</p><p><a name="06051517000023">New clause 17
is entirely unexceptional; it would not direct the House in any way to
touch the 1972 Act. Indeed, it does not mention the 1972 Act as an Act
of Parliament; it simply makes it clear that, in future, Parliament
could legislate notwithstanding the provisions of that Act. We are not
repealing the 1972 Act; we are simply reminding the House and putting
into primary legislation the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty
under which we all operate and have done ever since parliamentary
powers were first discussed.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 764</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06051517000031">7
pm</h5><p><a name="06051517000024">It is sometimes
argued that the 1972 Act is entrenched in some way. Other countries in
Europe and around the world have written constitutions that make it
impossible for Parliament to legislate in conflict with an entrenched
constitution. We do not have that doctrine in this country and if any
hon. Member believes that we do, they need to say so now, because
otherwise we are proceeding on a false assumption. As long as that
doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty endures, I do not find it
objectionable to amend the Bill to make it clear that if Parliament
explicitly and expressly legislates accordingly, it could override
directives that are in pursuance of the 1972 Act.</p><p><a name="06051517000025">That is not a constitutional
revolution&#151;rather the opposite. The measure is very modest. I
hope that the Government&#151;the Minister has given some fairly
unconvincing answers to interventions so far&#151;will address the
issue of parliamentary powers. We are not saying that a future House
will wish to contradict treaty provisions, although the Government are
contemplating doing so at the moment. The Human Rights Act 1998 is now
under question. Following a suggestion from the leader of my party, the
Government are apparently looking seriously at repealing, amending or
replacing certain international provisions of the European convention
on human rights. That is a specific example of where we may wish to
legislate in contradiction to treaty
obligations.</p><p><a name="06051517000026"><b><a name="06051517000038">Mr.

law. It is established beyond doubt in all parts of the House that the
Dicey doctrine, as I have heard it expressed, endures and that no
Parliament can bind a successor. Although the Parliament at the time
passed the 1972 Act, that is not entrenched and cannot bind a future
Parliament. Also, treaty law is not ipso facto binding in domestic law.
Some countries, such as France, have a unitary system. When they sign
international treaties, by that act, the treaties are binding in French
law. We do not have that system.</p><p><a name="06051517000028">In conclusion, new clause 17 is
unexceptional. It clarifies the legal powers of the House and makes
explicit the possibility of overriding international treaties and EU
provisions. I therefore urge the House to accept it and I hope that we
divide on the
issue.</p><p><a name="06051519000002"><b><a name="06051519000049">Pete

large and probably unpalatable portion of humble pie. The
disappointment for all of us involved in the debate is that the hon.
Member for East Renfrewshire (Mr. Murphy) is not here to share in that,
because he would have got a healthy portion of that humble pie. For
months, he suggested that the amendments were not necessary, but today
we are considering something like 50 Government amendments and new
clauses. After telling us that we 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 765</b><br>were simply misunderstanding him and that he had no intention of using

discuss an amended version of the Bill that we can hopefully all
accept.</p><p><a name="06051519000004"><b><a name="06051519000051">Pete

for East Renfrewshire was almost responsible for galvanising the sheer
opposition to the measures that were being suggested. The way in which
he continued to say that there was no problem or issue was totally
disingenuous and we now see the Government scurrying to the Chamber to
suggest these amendments and new clauses.</p><p><a name="06051519000005"><b><a name="06051519000052">Mr.

not the first time that this has happened. Bill after Bill, we have
been told that the particular proposals are innocuous and do not mean
what they seem to mean and that we are getting worried about things
unnecessarily; Bill after Bill, the Government have to come to the
House and taken the stuff out again.</p><p><a name="06051519000006"><b><a name="06051519000053">Pete

has great experience in these matters. His words will be listened to
carefully by the Government. He is entirely right that, when we start
to scrutinise Bills&#151;I credit the Select Committee chaired by the
hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) for providing
that function&#151;we see some of the sinister applications of some
of that legislation. That is exactly the case here, with what we first
presumed was an innocuous Bill. The Government proposed to give
themselves almost unprecedented powers to change almost any law by
order, rather than having it debated on the Floor of the House. While
the Bill was in Committee, the then Minister in charge told us to trust
him and that he would never consider highly controversial legislation,
without even telling us what &#147;controversial&#148; was. When we
asked him to include that in the Bill, he refused. Not having that in
the Bill means that the statement is not worth the paper that it is not
written on.</p><p><a name="06051519000007">The
Public Administration Committee weighed in with its concern. I applaud
it for saying that the
Bill</p><a name="06051519000043"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;gives the
Government powers which are entirely disproportionate to its stated
aims.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051519000008">The
Committee also wanted to place things beyond the Bill&#146;s reach

they were written in the law. I congratulate the Committee on those

there was an announcement that there would be further amendments. That
was the same night that the Government faced a humiliating gubbing at
the hands of the local English electorate. The amendments mean that it
is almost like we are considering the Second Reading of the Bill. The
debate does not feel like the remaining stages; it feels like a Second
Reading.</p><p><a name="06051519000010"><b><a name="06051519000054">Mr.

it.</p><p><a name="06051519000011"><b><a name="06051519000055">Pete
Wishart:</b> The hon. Gentleman is entirely right. The fact
that it feels so much like a Second Reading means that the Bill is
almost calling out for further scrutiny. We have seen a number of the
amendments for the first time in the course of the past week. They need
further debate and consideration and it is unfortunate that this House
will not consider the important new changes; it will be the other
place. We will not have an opportunity to influence that debate,
because we do not have seats in the other place. I hope that when the
Bill returns to this House, we will get a further opportunity to look
at some of the measures. Hopefully, when it returns to us, it will be a
better Bill for us to consider.</p><p><a name="06051519000012">We have a whole new raft of
amendments and new clauses to address. In the main, I concede that most
of the concerns have been addressed, but there are still issues and
outstanding points that have to be looked at. That is why
today&#146;s debate has been so important. There is no doubt
whatsoever that new clause 19 is an improvement on the former clause 1,
but there are still concerns and ambiguities. There are still lots of
questions for the Minister to answer.</p><p><a name="06051519000013">For instance,
in the case of new clause 19, what constitutes a reduction in burdens
remains totally ambiguous. I know that the Government give a list in
subsection (3), but when we start to unravel it, as we have done today,
we can see that there are issues and problems. We have to address what
we should call the Rushcliffe question&#151;after the question that
the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) put to
the Minister today. We could be talking about something that applies to
the climate change levy. We have had no satisfactory response from the
Government about controversial legislation being addressed through
orders under the Bill. The Rushcliffe question deserves an adequate
response from the
Minister.</p><p><a name="06051519000014"><b><a name="06051519000056">David

vagueness and ambiguity in the Bill would be at least partly resolved
if amendment (a) to new clause 19 were agreed to? If the word

question of judicial review would be opened up in a way that would not
be possible as the measure stands.</p><p><a name="06051519000015"><b><a name="06051519000057">Pete

consider subsection 7(c) of new clause 19 because although
the measure includes an attempt to define &#147;legislation&#148;,
there is no definition of &#147;enactment&#148;. Under the
subsection, a ministerial order may provide for the transfer or

not want the Minister to choke on his humble pie because he has moved
some way to improve the Bill, but I hope that we will have the
opportunity to improve it further. I hope that we will have the

that I was not in the Chamber at the beginning of the debate to hear
his speech. I welcome him to his new post and hope that I can
co-operate with him to make the Bill better than it is at the moment
and better even from how it will stand after it has been amended as the
Government propose.</p><p><a name="06051519000030">I
was one of the Labour Members who were deeply concerned about the
original Bill. When I read clause 1, I found it difficult to believe
that the Government were seriously proposing a Bill that would allow
them to legislate by order on almost any sphere of government and to
amend any Act, including, apparently, the Bill itself. However,
improvements have been made, so I am grateful to the Minister&#146;s
predecessor, who wrote to me about the Bill and discussed it with me at
length. My concerns were shared by several Labour Members, and one had
to be worried about such a general
measure.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051519000048">7.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06051519000031">Even in its
amended form, the Bill will be too all-inclusive. I would prefer to
have a Bill that specified positively what was included, instead of
setting out exemptions. Such a Bill would thus specify the areas to
which it related, rather than including a general provision to open the
way to changing any legislation. Such a change of approach would be a
major step towards a Bill that everyone could
support.</p><p><a name="06051519000032">I am worried
about the question of burdens on business. I am one of those who think
that business ought to have some burdens on it. Good regulations exist,
but there is an implication that burdens of any kind are bad on
business and that business should be as free as possible to do whatever
it likes. I do not accept that. Let us consider simple measures, such
as building regulations. Some 20 years ago, a builder did some work on
my house. I thought that it was not right, so I called in the building
inspector and the builder had to do the work again. There was a burden
on that builder, but it meant that my house was safe to live in after
the work had been done, so it was absolutely
right.</p><p><a name="06051519000033"><b><a name="06051519000065">Alison
Seabeck:</b> We have heard a lot of concerns about regulation
from Opposition Members, but people in the City and financial
institutions say that the regulations that exist in the City attract
financial institutions there from other parts of the world because they
know that it will be a safe place to do
business.</p><p><a name="06051519000034"><b><a name="06051519000066">Kelvin
Hopkins:</b> My hon. Friend makes a strong point. Regulations
can be good or bad; beneficial or disadvantageous. I hope that we will
continue to use building
regulations.</p><p><a name="06051519000035">Other
aspects of regulation can be dealt with annually through the general
Bills that come before the House. An obvious example is taxation, which
is addressed in clause 5. Any change to taxation can be achieved
through each year&#146;s Finance Bill. Clause 5
states:</p><a name="06051519000047"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Provision
under section 2(1) may not impose or increase
taxation.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051519000036">I know that
the wording will be amended, but the Government will still be able to
use delegated legislation to change taxation outside a Finance Bill.
There is no reason whatsoever for such a provision. Indeed, I would
prefer the provision to include the 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 769</b><br>word &#147;change&#148; rather than the phrase &#147;impose or
increase&#148; because it implies that imposing or increasing
taxation is bad, but that is not necessarily the truth. There are areas
of life in which I would like taxes to be increased and, perhaps, less
tax in other areas. I would like clause 5 to be taken out of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06051519000037"><b><a name="06051519000067">Mr.
Shepherd:</b> The hon. Gentleman is being disingenuous.
Finance Bills provide every mechanism for increasing taxation and are
subject to proper scrutiny. I hope that he is not suggesting for one
moment that we should enter a realm of taxation by the means of an
instrument?</p><p><a name="06051519000038"><b><a name="06051519000068">Kelvin
Hopkins:</b> Precisely. Provisions on taxation are misplaced
in the Bill. Taxation should be covered by Finance Bills, and as we
have a Finance Bill each year, there is no problem with delay. It is
not as if we can legislate on taxation only every five or 10
years.</p><p><a name="06051519000039">A Bill on
business is going through the other place. Such a generalised Bill
would be a mechanism to make changes that would no doubt help
business to run more smoothly. All sorts of general Bills come through
the House regularly, so they could be used to make such
changes.</p><p><a name="06051519000040">It was
suggested that the Government need such an approach on changing
legislation because of the frustrations of the legislative process, but
I understand that the problems have a lot to do with delays in
Departments of State. The difficulties that civil servants have when
bringing forward changes is much more of a delaying factor for
Government legislation than the House. Short and punchy Bills that make
small changes can go through the House quickly with little debate. Such
simple Bills would be the appropriate way of dealing with problems that
concern the House.</p><p><a name="06051519000041">There are other ways to
approach the problems. A number of detailed changes could be made. I
much appreciated the speech by the hon. Member for Cambridge (David
Howarth). It was thoughtful and well made. I have a great deal of
sympathy with what the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) said. I was
surprised to hear that he voted for the Single European Act, which I
would not have done at the time. Had he not voted for it, and had his
party not voted for it, a lot of grief would have been saved. We would
have had a much more loose-limbed European Union, causing much less
difficulty for us all in all sorts of ways.</p><p><a name="06051519000042">As I came into the debate late,
I do not intend to speak for long. I hope that the Government
amendments and what the other place does to the Bill will make it
something that we can all
support.</p><p><a name="06051524000001"><b><a name="06051524000578">Mr.
Shepherd:</b> The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central
(Mark Fisher) laid bare his soul by suggesting that he had been
defective in not appreciating the burden of what the Bill was about. I
join him in that state of sin inasmuch as the titles of Bills often
deceive us as to their purpose or intent. For example, who could
possibly have objected to the Civil Contingencies Bill? It was an
important measure. Yet part 2 contained the right of Ministers, down to
Whips, by statutory instrument or Order in Council, to change or
suspend 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 770</b><br>all the laws of this land with the exception, and only under pressure,
of the European convention on human rights and therefore the Human
Rights Act 1998. The title of a Bill does not necessarily indicate what
it is about. We owe a debt of thanks to the hon. Member for Cambridge
(David Howarth), as we do to the Select Committee Chairman, the hon.
Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller), in drawing our
attention to what the Bill is and was.</p><p><a name="06051524000002">On new clause 19, I accept
that, following the furore in the press and the wider reaches of our
nation, the Government agreed that the form they had adopted was
inappropriate. I still think that the new clause as it stands, as a
measure of unwinding parliamentary procedure and the authority of the
House, is not satisfactory. It could be satisfactory to some extent if
amendment (a) were agreed to. That is crucial. The point was well made
that &#147;reasonably&#148; constrains and better defines what it
is that the Minister must do, so that he can be challenged in court if
he acts unreasonably. It is a critical amendment.</p><p><a name="06051524000003">My right hon. and learned
Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) well made the point about
whether we can decrease taxation by order. It is unthinkable that one
should do that. I will vote against&#151;confidently&#151;new
clause 19 on the basis that, on such a delicate, essential assertion of
what is the proper process by which we discuss and consider law, it
does not meet the test.</p><p><a name="06051524000004">The only other amendment that I
intend to speak to is new clause 17, which I tabled. There is an
extraordinarily important principle behind it, and it goes both ways. I
made a simple intervention on my right hon. and learned Friend. Is the
Bill the way to alter something that has been so important to the life
of our nation? I wholly disagree with our membership of the European
Community; do not doubt that. I did not stand by and vote for the
Single European Act, unlike my more craven hon. Friend the Member for
Stone (Mr. Cash). I voted against a guillotine, and it was guillotined,
as is this debate. There are sections of the Bill that we cannot, or
are unlikely to, discuss because of the figure of the great guillotine
motion. I have spoken against those things all my political life in the
House, and it bites us in the
end.</p><p><a name="06051524000005">On
the disapplication of the European Communities Act 1972, new clause 17
addresses the elephant in our house. The Modernisation Committee went
to Finland about two years ago. The Finnish committee that judges and
scrutinises European legislation accepted that 80 per cent. of its
legislation came from Europe. In the case of the German
Bundestag&#151;Mrs. Merkel made reference to it&#151;70 per cent.
of its legislation comes from the European Community. Last
week&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Stone was in
attendance&#151;Vaclav Klaus gave a lecture in London to American
business men, saying that 75 to 80 per cent. of the legislation of the
Czech Republic emanates from
Europe.</p><p><a name="06051524000006">Our Cabinet
Office two years ago suggested that, more modestly in Britain, only 40
per cent. of our legislation emanates from the European Community. How
can we have a deregulation Bill without acknowledging that the greater
part of our legislation, including the statutory instruments that
follow it and the regulation that is attendant on it, now emanates from
the European Community? In some instances, it 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 771</b><br>has direct application in our law without even troubling the House. We
have a process, through statutory instruments, by which those laws are
nodded through.</p><p><a name="06051524000007">What
is the purpose of the new clause? First, can we ignore the fact that
that quantum of legislation is not regarded for the purposes of the
Bill? The new clause says no. My second concern, which is more
important, relates to the constitutional affirmation accepted by, I
think, the hon. Member for Cambridge and articulated by my right hon.
and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe. I am a more simple Member
of the House. The long march to our democracy is summed up by
Churchill&#146;s exclamation as to who is sovereign: the people are
sovereign. The new clause is an expression of that sovereignty. The
bypassing of that sovereignty by other means is not
appropriate.</p><p><a name="06051524000008"><b><a name="06051524000579">Mr.
Heald:</b> If my hon. Friend wants new clause 19 to be
amended, it has to be passed. Then we would have the opportunity of
considering amendment (a). Does he agree that not to pass the new
clause would mean that we end up with what was in the Bill originally,
which was appalling&#151;namely, that a Minister, by order, could
pass any law for any purpose in any way? I hope that he is
prepared to accept the logic that the new clause is a bit better,
because then amendment (a) might be
possible.</p><p><a name="06051524000009"><b><a name="06051524000580">Mr.
Shepherd:</b> No. The effort of the House should go into
making a piece of legislation appropriate and correct as we see it. We
cannot have a vote on amendment (a) until we have had a vote on new
clause 19. My vote&#151;let me set out this condition&#151;is
wholly dependent on the Government saying that they accept
&#147;reasonable&#148;. That is how I would do it. If they say,
&#147;No, we will not accept it&#148;, then I will not vote for the
new clause and will look to the other place to rewrite the Bill. I have
no doubt that it will include the reasonable
element.</p><p><a name="06051524000010"><b><a name="06051524000581">Mr.
Chope:</b> Will my hon. Friend extend his comments to
amendment (b)? Does he accept that we will not know until we have voted
on new clause 19 whether amendments (a) and (b) will be called for a
vote?</p><p><a name="06051524000011"><b><a name="06051524000582">Mr.
Shepherd:</b> I absolutely accept the point. Again, that
reinforces why I will not vote for the new clause until the Minister
has conceded, or accepted, the burden of the argument and will accept
those amendments. That is a matter of principle. The House, having
regard to its own dignity, should not just say that because the
previous draft of the Bill was so dreadful and has, properly and
rightly, been improved to some extent&#151;I give credit to the
Government for that&#151;it does not seek the things that qualify the
powers of a Minister. That is the heart of the matter, and why the
argument is about ourselves and the sovereignty of this place, which my
hon. Friend is trying to promote. This issue is incredibly important
for the House, because it is about ourselves, our country and our
authority&#151;the authority that this Bill and a raft of other

are we having to amend or to do away with so much legislation? It is
because the volume of legislation and the sheer weight of statutory

short cut. In the modern age we do not give the proper amount of time
to deliberation on and consideration of matters before the House. That
is what I am arguing for. I hope that the Government will accept

He and I have made that point about Governments of other complexions
who have resisted the concept of reasonableness because the Executive,
advised by draftsmen or by their own self-importance, have felt that it
is an unreasonable constraint to be reasonably
constrained.</p><p><a name="06051524000015"><b><a name="06051524000585">Rob

not being here earlier, although I was present for the opening speech
of my hon. Friend the Minister. I declare an interest as a member of
the Law Society of England and Wales, which is a regulated body and
therefore might be affected by the Bill.</p><p><a name="06051524000016">I heard earlier, and have heard
since returning to the Chamber following meetings, a lot of wounded
outrage from Opposition Members, particularly Conservatives. Having sat
through most of the Second Reading debate, my recollection is that at
its conclusion there was no Division. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Somebody
says that there was a one-line Whip, but I took the trouble to be
present and other hon. Members could have done so. There have been
howls of outrage from the Opposition because they feel that they missed
a trick on Second Reading by not calling a

Friend the Member for East Renfrewshire (Mr. Murphy), the then
Minister, who is present tonight, said that he did not wish the Bill to
be used for controversial measures. Understandably, he was asked what
would be considered a controversial measure, and quite reasonably he
said that that was a difficult definition which he had been discussing
with parliamentary draftsmen and that he would table amendments at a
later stage&#151;and he has done so.</p><p><a name="06051524000020"><b><a name="06051524000588">Mr.

position that I took on Second Reading, but I hope that the hon.

a deregulatory Bill but 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 773</b><br>that part 1 was wholly unsatisfactory and that if it remained
in the Bill I would be advising my hon. Friends to vote

his mind whether to vote for them.</p><p><a name="06051524000022"><b><a name="06051524000590">Sir
Robert Smith:</b> The hon. Gentleman says that the former
Minister came to the House on Second Reading having been unable to work
out how to include in the Bill the safeguards, and on Report they are
finally appearing. Is that not a classic example of why we have so much
bad legislation? It comes to the House too soon, before it is ready.
The Minister should have brought the legislation before the House once
he had worked out how to include the safeguards that he wanted, so that
under our procedures we could have considered them more efficiently,
rather than leaving the issue to be discussed in a shorter debate on
Report.
</p><p><a name="06051524000023"><b><a name="06051524000591">Rob
Marris:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument.
As often happens in this House, we like to have it both ways. The idea
to my mind and for many hon. Members was to have a public debate on
this important Bill. We have had that debate in the intervening period.
The then Minister put forward proposals and serious reservations were
expressed by Opposition Members and by Labour Members, including me,
and the Minister said that he would consider them. He has done so, and
his successor has come forward with quite wide-ranging amendments, on
which I shall remark later.</p><p><a name="06051524000024"><b><a name="06051524000592">Pete

through in its original condition?</p><p><a name="06051524000025"><b><a name="06051524000593">Rob
Marris:</b> I cannot remember whether the hon. Gentleman was
present on Second Reading&#151;I do not think that he was&#151;but
the then Minister made it clear that the Bill was not in the final form
that he envisaged would go to the other place. He was entirely honest
and open with the House. He said that we needed more safeguards and
that he was open to suggestions. He has listened to those suggestions,
yet his successor is being slagged off for
that.</p><p><a name="06051524000026"><b><a name="06051524000594">Mr.

fox? It is because the Minister made it clear that he was willing to
listen to arguments that many of us did not vote against Second
Reading.</p><p><a name="06051524000027"><b><a name="06051524000595">Rob
Marris:</b> The Government have listened to the arguments.
They might not have accepted them all, but they have
listened&#151;hence the fairly fundamental amendments before us. If
amendments that we shall consider today and tomorrow are
accepted&#151;it is up to the House whether they are&#151;fairly
fundamental safeguards will be in the Bill. There are the five locks of

<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 774</b><br>constitutional safeguards. As I said in my intervention on my hon.
Friend the Minister, my parliamentary neighbour, I have concerns that
we will end up with the same kind of Bill this year that we did five
years ago&#151;completely unworkable in the way that most Members
would wish because of those safeguards. He referred to the Game Act
1831, which is the reason why the wonderful Bridgewater&#146;s
butcher that is about 100 m from where I live has a sign outside it. I
am sure that Bob will be happy to dispense with that sign.</p><p><a name="06051524000028">I suspect that most hon.
Members would be happy if such regulation were got rid of. On the other
hand, dealing with major tax increases&#151;or tax cuts, which might
still be allowed under clause 5&#151;would not be appropriate under
the Bill. There are five locks and among other things they involve two
Select Committees&#151;one in this House and one in the other place.
Select Committees, certainly in this House, have traditionally had a
majority who are members of the Government party. That is the way in
which this House has operated since Select Committees were
formed&#151;in 1971 or whenever. Anyone who thinks that a Select
Committee Chairman or his or her members are patsies have not served on
one as I have. I refer not just to my hon. Friend the Member for
Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) or whoever his successor
might be. I have never come across a Select Committee member who is a
patsy. Select Committees will put a block and a lock on a proposal if
it is controversial, as I think amendment No. 56
says.</p><p><a name="06051524000029"><b><a name="06051524000596">Alison
Seabeck:</b> Talking about locks, what seems to be missing in
this debate is what the public think. The public&#146;s expression of
concern over the Bill has had quite a significant impact on the
drafting of amendments. We forget that.</p><p><a name="06051524000030"><b><a name="06051524000597">Rob
Marris:</b> Indeed concern was expressed outside the House. I
suspect that much of it was somewhat uninformed in the sense that many
of those who expressed concern were not aware of the promises and
undertakings given by the then Minister on Second Reading that there
would be more safeguards&#151;and there will be if the amendments are
passed.</p><p><a name="06051524000031">I speak in
favour of the amendments, but I caution my hon. Friend, the present
Minister, to be careful that the pendulum does not swing too far the
other way so that, if I am fortunate enough still to be a Member in
five years&#146; time, I will have to take part in a debate in which
people say that the 2006 Act had got rid of only 21 regulations in
contradistinction to 19 or whatever it was under the 2001 legislation.
Frankly, that will have wasted a whole bunch of the House&#146;s
time.</p><p><a name="06051524000034"><b><a name="06051524000598">Mr.
Chope:</b> I had the privilege of speaking on Second Reading,
when I said:</p><a name="06051524000570"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Bill is the
ultimate guillotine for debate and
discussion.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 9 February 2006;
Vol. 442, c.
1079.]</p></ul><p><a name="06051524000035">My
concerns were not understated, as I cited the Chairman of the
Constitution Committee of the House of Lords, who said that the measure
was the most constitutionally significant Bill for a generation. The
new clause is an incredible improvement, but that does not mean that we
should accept it willy-nilly. Unfortunately, the Government 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 775</b><br>are adept at manipulating the procedures of the
House, so we are in danger of being outmanoeuvred again by the
Executive, as we do not have the power to press amendments to the new
clause until the new clause has been
accepted.</p><p><a name="06051524000036"><b><a name="06051524000599">Mr.
Gummer:</b> For the sake of people outside the House, will my
hon. Friend clarify something? Does he agree that the Government
introduced a Bill that they knew would not complete its passage through
the House with the aim of introducing provisions that ought to have
been included in the Bill in the first place and thus are extremely
difficult to correct? We should not accept that constitutional
extravagance.</p><p><a name="06051524000037"><b><a name="06051524000600">Mr.
Chope:</b> My right hon. Friend is right. Previous
deregulation Bills were subject to pre-legislative scrutiny. The Bill
goes much further and wider, but it was not subject to such scrutiny.
We can only assume that the Government&#146;s motive was to present
us with a fait accompli. They tried to seduce us into accepting the
provision on the ground that it was not as unreasonable as the original
proposal. I very much agree with my hon. Friend the Member for
Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd): in the absence of ministerial
assurances on amendments (a) and (b), I am not minded to vote in
support of new clause 19 and, indeed, shall register my opposition. If,
however, it is accepted and the amendments are put to the vote, we have
the chance to make it less odious. At least we will have had the chance
to put our concern on the record in the event that the amendments are
not tested.</p><p><a name="06051524000038">My
amendment (b) is an important and necessary measure. I appreciate the
support that it has received from Members on both sides of the House,
including my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly),
Liberal Democrat Members and, by implication, the hon. Member for
Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher). The Minister appeared to suggest
that it was a good amendment, but went on to say that he would not
support it. Indeed, he said that he would seek to oppose it.
Unfortunately, we could not establish what he thought was wrong with
it.</p><p><a name="06051524000039"><b><a name="06051524000601">Sir
Robert Smith:</b> The Minister said that we would return to
amendment (b), but his words definitely suggested that the new clause
should be constrained by the amendment.</p><p><a name="06051524000040"><b><a name="06051524000602">Mr.
Chope:</b> If that is what the Minister thought, he was right.
New clause 19(2) describes the purpose that the Minister would have to
establish as one
of</p><a name="06051524000571"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;removing or reducing
any burden, or the overall burdens, resulting directly or indirectly
for any person from any
legislation&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06051524000041">In my
reading, provided that the Minister can establish that the purpose is
to remove a burden from one person, even though that would increase the
overall burden for 1 million others, there is no reason why he should
not use the truncated procedures in the Bill with the limited
safeguards that we have debated.</p><p><a name="06051524000042">The title of
the new clause&#151;&#147;Power to remove or reduce
burdens&#148;&#151;is disingenuous, and we should add the words,
&#147;or increase overall burdens&#148;. The Government say that
they wish to reduce the overall burden, but if that is the case and
they do not have a sinister purpose in the Bill, they should accept my
amendment (b).</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 776</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06051524000574">7.45

Greg Knight:</b> Can my hon. Friend make his position clear on
the amendment? Does he hope that the Chair will allow the House to
divide on it, or is he merely alluding to
it?</p><p><a name="06051524000044"><b><a name="06051524000604">Mr.
Chope:</b> I hope that the House will have the chance to
divide on it, but I cannot guarantee that, so I am obliged to vote
against new clause 19 unless the Minister gives an undertaking at the
Dispatch Box to accept amendments (a) and (b). That is the only way in
which we can proceed because, following the initiative that the
Government have taken, humble Back Benchers cannot vote on the
amendments before we vote on the new clause. As Chairman of the
Procedure Committee, my right hon. Friend deserves a great deal of
credit for the fact that we have two days of debate. Originally, the
Government intended that we should have only one day of debate, as they
knew that they wanted to make substantial amendments to the Bill. That
would have squeezed even more the opportunity for Back Benchers to
comment.</p><p><a name="06051524000045">This is an
important Bill. I had the privilege of speaking against it on Second
Reading, and I served on the Standing Committee. As a result of our
efforts in Committee, the Government have begun to see sense, but they
still have a long way to go. I look forward to the Minister accepting
amendments (a) and (b). As for amendment (c), which proposes that the
new clause apply only to public general Acts, it is regrettable that he
still insists that it should apply much more widely to local acts,
Orders in Council, orders, rules, regulations and so on, as set out in
subsection (6). The Bill would be better if the provision were confined
to public general Acts. The only local Act that the Government have
been able to cite is the Covent Garden Market Act 1961. If they used a
truncated provision to change the legislation governing the Covent
Garden Market Authority, it could have a severe impact on people who
use the authority, businesses that rely on it, landowners and so on.
Why should such local legislation not be subject to the full rigour of
scrutiny and debate? People may believe that local Acts are less
significant, but they are often supremely significant to people who
live in the locality that is affected. Under procedures in this
Parliament, they may not receive notice of proposed changes until it is
too late and the measure has been considered by the Regulatory Reform
Committee. The Bill should extend only to public general Acts, not to
local Acts.</p><p><a name="06051524000046"><b><a name="06051524000605">Mr.
Gummer:</b> Has my right hon. Friend noticed that there is
nothing in the Bill to stop the Government changing Acts of Parliament
passed by the House but prepared by the General Synod of the Church of
England? Under the new clause, they could change without question
something decided by that forum, which underlines the fact that the
provision is nonsense.</p><p><a name="06051524000047"><b><a name="06051524000606">Mr.
Chope:</b> My right hon. Friend makes an excellent point that
I hope will be reflected in amendments tabled in another place. It is a
pity that we have not had a chance to consider amendments along those
lines on Report.</p><p><a name="06051524000048">The
Government have a secret agenda in relation to the Bill. It has been
exposed to an extent and they have had to pull back from the high
watermark of what they 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 777</b><br>were trying to achieve by way of suppressing parliamentary debate and
scrutiny. They have fallen back to an intermediate line, which is still
too high in terms of what we are giving up as scrutineers of
legislation in Parliament. I hope that the Minister will give us
assurances that he will go further and provide more safeguards than new
clause 19
contains.</p><p><a name="06051524000049"><b><a name="06051524000607">Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I declare my interests as they appear in the
Register of Members&#146;
Interests.</p><p><a name="06051524000050">This has
been a complicated debate, not helped by the Government&#146;s
ineptitude over recent months in taking the Bill through the House. The
Government new clauses, including new clause 19, were tabled very late,
which has not been satisfactory or productive. Here we are, on Report,
debating the main clause, which was tabled only a few days
ago.</p><p><a name="06051524000051">The process of
the Bill has been bizarre. I have never seen anything like it. On
Second Reading, the Government were saying that the Bill was purely a
tool for delivering their better regulation agenda. My hon. Friend the
Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) and I
rebutted that on Second Reading. We said that it was a gross
understatement of the purpose of what became the &#147;abolition of
Parliament Bill&#148;. We argued that, as a constitutional Bill, it
should have had its Committee stage on the Floor of the House. The
Government chose not to listen to us, but in retrospect they probably
wish they
had.</p><p><a name="06051524000052">The
hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) rightly
mentioned the lack of preparation. By the time of the Procedure
Committee on 7 February, the then Minister said that he would be able
to respond to the Regulatory Reform Committee&#146;s recommendations
in good time, in advance of the Standing Committee, but when the
Standing Committee started on 28 February, the Government had given
their response to Committee members only the day before and no
Government amendments had been tabled, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Christchurch (Mr. Chope) correctly pointed out in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06051524000053">The
timing of the proceedings has been unsatisfactory throughout. My right
hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) mentioned that
in his intervention and noted that that is becoming increasingly common
on the Government&#146;s part, although it is particularly the case
in relation to the Bill. Not least for these reasons, my noble Friends
in another place may well want to review carefully the implications of
the clause, which has been impossible for us, because of the lack of
time and the fact that the Government ripped out the main clauses of
the Bill. Even now, they are tabling amendments to change the title of
the Bill.</p><p><a name="06051524000054">Government
new clause 19, which was tabled only a few days ago, has, along with
new clauses 20 and 21, the effect of replacing clauses 1 and 2. These
changes, or perhaps I should say climbdowns, will refocus orders that
are to be introduced under the Bill towards deregulation, as advocated
by the Conservative party since Second Reading. Since the Bill&#146;s
publication in January, we have consistently expressed grave concerns
that the powers granted to the Government were too widely drawn and
would result in a severe weakening of 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 778</b><br>parliamentary power, the sidelining of legislative
scrutiny and the possibility of a move towards ministerial
authoritarian rule.</p><p><a name="06051524000055">As
my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire noted, we were
happy with the Government&#146;s announcement on 12 April that they
had effectively agreed with the framework arguments advanced over the
past few months from the Conservative Benches. We therefore welcome the
new clause, which aims to focus the Bill on genuine deregulatory
matters, although it would have been helpful to see the new clauses
sooner, not least because of the widespread interest in the subject and
our belief that other, later amendments should go further than the
Government are prepared to
accept.</p><p><a name="06051524000056">The
Conservative party has always supported measures that would result in
the provision of a swift tool for delivering regulatory reform.
However, we wanted to ensure that such a tool would not pose a serious
challenge to the concept of parliamentary supremacy, which is a central
element of the United Kingdom&#146;s unwritten constitution. Our
policy is aimed at reducing the harm caused to the country by
over-regulation introduced by the Government since 1997. The cost of
regulation during that period is estimated to have surpassed &#163;50
billion a year, despite the Labour party&#146;s manifestos for the
1997, 2001 and 2005 general elections promising to regulate only where
necessary and to deregulate where
desirable.</p><p><a name="06051524000057">The
over-regulation of business is a massive drain on the economy, leads to
an inefficient bureaucracy, strangles small businesses and wastes the
valuable time of thousands of police officers, nurses, teachers and
people in the private sector on filling in
forms.</p><p><a name="06051524000058"><b><a name="06051524000608">Rob
Marris:</b> The hon. Gentleman mentioned the sum of &#163;50
billion. Quite a large part of that calculation, which I think was made
by the British Chambers of Commerce, refers to the national minimum
wage. Is he saying that he opposes the national minimum wage as a
regulatory
burden?</p><p><a name="06051524000059"><b><a name="06051524000609">Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The figure does not refer to the national
minimum wage. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire
dealt with that point
earlier.</p><p><a name="06051524000060">Over-regulation
is severely damaging Britain&#146;s international economic
competitiveness. As my hon. Friend reminded us, according to the World
Economic Forum, between 1997 and 2005, the UK slipped from fourth to
13th in the list of the most competitive countries. The London School
of Economics has cited over-regulation as one of the main causes of
that decline. Small companies have been disproportionately hit, which
is why in new clause 9 we propose that any Minister making an order
under part 1 powers must ensure that it is deregulatory as it relates
to small business.</p><p><a name="06051524000061">That is also why, in new clause
17, my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) seeks to ensure
that, where a fast-track deregulation order is made in connection with
a provision concerning our EU obligations, it should be legally binding
and effective. The Minister responded that that was an attempt to
change policy, but my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment deserves a more
considered approach. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s
views.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 779</b><br><p><a name="06051524000062"><b><a name="06051524000610">Mr.
Cash:</b> In the context of legislative supremacy and the role
of the judiciary, and in the context of the Constitutional Reform Act
2005, will my hon. Friend confirm that, irrespective of the rule of
law, which insists that they should be independent, it is the
duty of judges to give effect to Acts of Parliament, as has
been historically, legally and constitutionally the case for
generations?</p><p><a name="06051524000063"><b><a name="06051524000611">Mr.

will, of course, tell me if he thinks
otherwise.</p><p><a name="06051524000064">My
hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) and the hon.
Members for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher) and for Cambridge
(David Howarth) expressed concern that the Bill could be used for a
wider purpose than striking out business regulations. An example given
was the abolition of jury trials. The Minister, fairly, showed the lack
of clarity in the 2001 Act and how clauses 5 and 6 answered the
important points made, but he did not go far enough. There is more to
come out in that respect, probably in the other place. Following an
intervention from my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), it turned out that the restrictions relating
to tax relate only to increases in
tax.</p><p><a name="06051524000065">The right hon.
Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller)&#151;I
congratulate him on being appointed a Privy
Councillor&#151;</p><p><a name="06051524000066"><b><a name="06051524000612">Andrew

joke.</p><p><a name="06051524000067"><b><a name="06051524000613">Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. We have not
had many jokes during the
debate.</p><p><a name="06051524000068">The hon.
Gentleman properly noted that Standing Orders of the House will need to
be reviewed in the context of the Bill. I enjoyed hearing his
views on the sugar beet order, or rather, the problems in
getting rid of it.</p><p><a name="06051524000069">The hon.
Members for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) and for Cambridge
made many valuable points in the debate, not least identifying the
posing threat of the laws forcing the Government to review the scope of
the Bill in the first place, and also in reducing the scope of the
Executive to interpret the provisions of the Bill. Their explanation of
why amendment (a) should introduce the word &#147;reasonably&#148;
to create objectivity rather than ministerial subjectivity was
persuasive.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051524000575">8
pm</h5><p><a name="06051524000070">I
agreed with many of the sentiments about the growth of the power of the
Executive and the serious consequences that could follow from that, not
least in relation to the Bill, expressed by the hon. Member for
Stoke-on-Trent, Central, but he should have a quick read of the debate
on Second Reading, including my remarks.</p><p><a name="06051524000071">My right hon. and learned
Friend the Member for Rushcliffe noticed the irony in what he called
the minor miracle that turned what should have been a positive desire
to reduce regulation into the messy Bill that is before us. He stated
his position that new clause 19 is still too lax in its wording. I am
sure that his arguments on the new clause will be carefully reviewed by
colleagues, not least in another place. Many of his comments, not only
in relation to veto rights, will be addressed later in our proceedings.
We benefited from 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 780</b><br>his experience in his summary of how Government have been nibbling away,
as he called it, at parliamentary freedoms over the past 50 years. His
comments were strongly supported by the remarks of my hon. Friend the
Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), who also spoke up for
amendment (a) and new clause 17, and gave a general
call&#151;</p><p><a name="06051524000072"><b><a name="06051524000614">Andrew
Miller:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the right hon.
and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), who is not
prone to over-exaggeration, slightly got things wrong? The hon.
Gentleman will recall that the legislation enacted by his right hon.
and learned Friend, in section 2(2) of the Value Added Tax
Act 1994, means that a statutory instrument to change VAT could have
effect only for a short period. That is notwithstanding all the
restraints of the sixth directive. I think that the hon. Gentleman is
slightly exaggerating the case.</p><p><a name="06051524000073"><b><a name="06051524000615">Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made his point in his own
way.</p><p><a name="06051524000074">My hon.
Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills made a general call for
proper time to be given to the important changes that are proposed. I
think that he was making a general point about legislation being rushed
through the House. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr.
Redwood) loaned us the significant benefit of his large experience of
deregulation. He questioned whether the provisions in the Bill were the
best way to achieve the initial objective. He thought not, and I shall
return to that key issue. I like the idea of having an annual
deregulation Bill and the implied requirement to tutor civil servants
in the merits of deregulation, that being key to the cultural
change.</p><p><a name="06051524000075">My right hon.
Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) gave a good
example of the dreadful droit de suite law as a showpiece of
gold-plating of EU regulations and demonstrated the importance of
keeping the 1972 legislation in the context of parliamentary
sovereignty.</p><p><a name="06051524000076">The
hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) made a thoughtful speech.
I liked his idea of short Bills. My hon. Friend the Member for
Christchurch has closely followed consideration of the Bill, and was
active in Committee. He put a good case for amendment (b). He argued
that the reduction of the burden for one should not be justified by
increasing burdens for others. On that, my hon. Friend has our
support.</p><p><a name="06051524000077">Will the
Government amendments work? Will deregulation be improved as a result
of the new formula that is proposed? The expectations of businesses are
high. The Government have talked the talk. In May of last year, the
<i>Financial Times</i> reported that the Bill would be an attempt to
slash the estimated &#163;100 billion of the cost of regulation on
business. In January, the Minister then responsible was quoted as
saying that the Bill is the</p><a name="06051524000572"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;cornerstone in achieving
essential and long-promised reductions in unnecessary red
tape.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051524000078">It is part of a
plan to achieve one of the most radical regulatory reform agendas in
the world. The then Minister&#146;s press release in January spoke of
savings through reducing bureaucracy of &#163;10 billion, equivalent
to 1 per cent. of gross domestic product.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 781</b><br><p><a name="06051524000079">The fact remains that
regulations on business have continued to soar. We know that, since
2001, only about 20 regulatory reform orders have been made, although
the target was 60 by 2005. On average, with 3,887 new regulations a
year, let us say that the Government get really ambitious and raise the
target of scrapping regulations from 60 every four years to 60 a year,
or even 100 a year. Is that not like putting in a barrier the size of a
road hump to stop a tidal wave? Are 60 fewer regulations worth the
destruction of parliamentary sovereignty? That is what we were
considering in the early stages of the Bill. We came to the conclusion
that the answer was
no.</p><p><a name="06051524000080">We appreciate that
the Government have gone some way towards understanding the issues and
addressing the concerns of the House, not least with the amendments.
However, in the new atmosphere of realism, will the Minister please
care in his remarks to reassess the impact that he thinks that the Bill
will have on
regulation?</p><p><a name="06051524000081"><b><a name="06051524000616">Mr.
McFadden:</b> I feel that in some senses the ghost of St.
Augustine has been with us in this debate. There have been many
speeches from all quarters of the House about how much people want to
see regulation cut, but not in the way that is proposed, and perhaps
not yet. I think, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West (Rob Marris) said, that that is perhaps a danger for us as
we come to debate the amendments. However, I welcome the comments that
have been made about new clause 19, especially by the Opposition
Front-Bench spokespersons. I do not pretend that they embraced the
clause with open arms but they at least recognised that the Government
had attempted to respond to some of the fears and concerns that have
been expressed about the Bill. The Government did not accept that those
fears and concerns would necessarily have been
realised.</p><p><a name="06051524000082">I shall try
to stay out of some of the private battles that we heard this afternoon
between my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark
Fisher) and some Opposition Members. There were battles also between
some Opposition Members about our membership of the European
Union.</p><p><a name="06051524000083">I turn to
amendment (b) to the new clause, which concerns burdens and whether
they can be reduced overall. New clause 19 permits the &#147;removing
or reducing&#148; of a &#147;burden&#148;. &#147;Removing or
reducing&#148; a burden from one person may possibly increase burdens
on another, even if the overall effect is downward in terms of
deregulation. The example has been used of perhaps increasing the
burden on a million but reducing the burden on one. That is not likely.
However we could increase the burden on one and reduce the burden on a
million. That is what we mean by saying that the overall effect should
be downward. It is the same as the 2001 legislation that would allow
the introduction of more targeted or more proportionate burdens in the
context of an overall downward trend. New clause 19 also permits the
removal or reduction of overall burdens. It could permit the
introduction of new burdens if it is done in the context of reducing
the burdens overall. For that reason, we may not be able to say yes to
the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr.
Chope).</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 782</b><br><p><a name="06051524000084"><b><a name="06051524000617">Mr.

as drafted, does not give permission for an overall increase in
burdens?</p>

<p><a name="06051524000085"><b><a name="06051524000618">Mr.
McFadden:</b> The Bill provides that under part 2 the purpose
is to remove or reduce any burden&#151;including the overall
burdens&#151;that result either directly or indirectly for any person
under the
legislation.</p><p><a name="06051524000086"><b><a name="06051524000619">Sir
Robert Smith:</b> The clause includes the word
&#147;or&#148;. The amendment seeks to replace that with
&#147;and&#148;. With the &#147;or&#148; still in place we can
remove any burden but we do not have to remove overall burdens. The
overall burden can increase. As I have said, there is an
&#147;or&#148;. The Minister can say that he is removing a burden
even though there is an increase in overall burdens. There is still
compliance as things
stand.</p><p><a name="06051524000087"><b><a name="06051524000620">Mr.
McFadden:</b> No, the overall burden would be reduced. We
cannot accept amendment (b) because if we did, in the context of
reducing the overall burden, a burden could be increased on one
person.</p><p><a name="06051524000088">I anticipate
that there will be future examples where legislation covering an entire
area could be rationalised to benefit those regulated. However,
amendment (b) would narrow the order-making power so much that many of
the reforms that were possible under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001
would no longer be possible.</p><p><a name="06051524000089">I turn to the
reasonableness test in amendment (a). The Minister is already under a
public duty to reach a reasonable view. We discussed who could object
to a reasonableness test, and although the views expressed are on one
level true, the amendment would add nothing to the duty that the
Minister is already under to act reasonably. Case law has established
that if a Minister&#146;s decision is not reasonable, it can be
struck down by the courts, so the existing subjective test is a real
one.</p><p><a name="06051524000090"><b><a name="06051524000621">David
Howarth:</b> The Minister seems to be confused. The point is
that under the subjective test in the Bill as it stands, all that the
judicial review will study is whether the Minister considered a
particular thing to be the case. If the word &#147;reasonably&#148;
is included, deciding whether the Minister acted reasonably in that
context becomes a more objective test. The Minister has a dilemma:
either the word &#147;reasonably&#148; makes no difference, in
which case, he should accept it; or it makes a very big difference and
on a ground that he does not want to accept, in which case, he should
resist it on that ground.</p><p><a name="06051524000091"><b><a name="06051524000622">Mr.
McFadden:</b> We are of the view that the amendment would not
make a difference. We will reflect on it, but we cannot accept it
tonight.</p><p><a name="06051524000092">A number of
safeguards will ensure that orders that are beyond the scope of the
Bill will not be delivered. Before an order is laid, the Minister will
be required to consult widely with the relevant stakeholders. In
addition, the Government have undertaken not to use the order-making
powers in the Bill to create highly controversial measures, or to force
through orders in opposition to the Committees. We will of course hear
more about that issue
tomorrow.</p><p><a name="06051524000093"><b><a name="06051524000623">Mr.
Heath:</b> The Minister said that he would reflect on
amendment (a), and I find it difficult to understand what he will be
reflecting on. But&#151;this is the big 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 783</b><br>&#147;but&#148;&#151;this is the only opportunity that this House
has to express an opinion on it. He can reflect as long as he likes,
but this House will not have the opportunity to express its opinion
unless it does so tonight. So can he reflect a little more quickly, and
perhaps accept
it?</p><p><a name="06051524000094"><b><a name="06051524000624">Mr.
McFadden:</b> That is a good try but as I have said, I cannot
say on the Government&#146;s behalf that we will accept the amendment
tonight.</p><p><a name="06051524000095"><b><a name="06051524000625">Mr.
Heathcoat-Amory:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</p><p><a name="06051524000096"><b><a name="06051524000626">Mr.
McFadden:</b> I want to make some progress, if I
may.</p><p><a name="06051524000097">My hon. Friend
the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) said that the
inertia in the process since 2001 was not necessarily the fault of the
Select Committees or of the degree of parliamentary scrutiny. He has a
strong point; we have to look at the system in the round. There is an
argument that Departments will be more reluctant to come forward with
regulatory reform orders if they think that the process is so
cumbersome that it will be difficult to use. So there is an argument
about incentives and how the process works as a whole. But the Chairman
of the Procedure Committee, who has been a voice of common sense
throughout this process, and who has come up with positive and
constructive proposals, made a strong point about there being not just
a duty on this House to agree the proper scrutiny procedure, but a duty
on Departments to pursue this agenda with vigour and
enthusiasm.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051524000576">8.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06051524000098"><b><a name="06051524000627">Mr.
Chope:</b> Does the Minister therefore accept, on his own
interpretation of new clause 19, that it may well result in this
procedure being used in circumstances where overall burdens will be
increased, rather than
decreased?</p><p><a name="06051524000099"><b><a name="06051524000628">Mr.
McFadden:</b> No, I do not accept that, but it is possible for
the burden on some to go up as a new deregulatory process comes into
being.</p><p><a name="06051524000100">We had a
lengthy debate on new clause 17, mostly between Opposition Members. I
tried to follow it, and I hope that I have understood the intention of
the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) accurately. If I am right, the
purpose of his new clause is that orders made under this procedure
would not be binding on our Community obligations. He said, I think, to
my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband) that
if his new clause were accepted, infraction procedures would occur and
various consequences would
follow.</p><p><a name="06051524000101"><b><a name="06051524000629">Mr.
Cash:</b> I did not predicate my argument on the basis that
there would be infraction proceedings; rather, I said that they could
be a consequence. The stability and growth pact is an example of the
rule of law in Europe being destroyed by the attitudes of individual
member states. What I am saying is that, where there is an Act of
Parliament that is express and unambiguous, even if it is inconsistent
with the European Communities Act 1972, and where the words
&#147;notwithstanding the 1972 Act&#148; are included in such 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 784</b><br>legislation, the legislative supremacy of this House requires the
judiciary to give effect to that legislation. That is the simple point
that I am making, and it is
unchallengeable.</p><p><a name="06051524000102"><b><a name="06051524000630">Mr.
McFadden:</b> It is unchallengeable in the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s subjective judgment. The interesting point about new
clause 17 is that it is supported by his Front-Bench colleagues, with
all the inferences that will be drawn from that. The Conservative party
has been re-packaged in recent months, but the point, which might be
noticed beyond this debate, is that they are backing this new clause in
the knowledge of what the consequences might
be.</p><p><a name="06051524000103"><b><a name="06051524000631">Mr.
Heald:</b> I made it clear that I should be very interested to
hear the Minister&#146;s views on the new clause. Is he saying that
it would change the law, or that it would simply clarify existing law?
Is it not just a statement of existing
law?</p><p><a name="06051524000104"><b><a name="06051524000632">Mr.
McFadden:</b> It seeks to go further than our proposals on the
European aspects of the Bill, which deal with gold-plating rather than
trying to challenge our obligations as members of the European Union,
which are a matter of fact.</p><p><a name="06051524000105"><b><a name="06051524000633">Mr.
Cash:</b> As with the arguments&#151;on which at last the
Prime Minister has given way&#151;on the Human Rights Act 1998 in the
context of the sovereignty of Parliament and the role of the judiciary,
so, in different circumstances but on the same principle, the
legislative supremacy of Parliament applies in the context of the
European Community. Does the Minister agree with that or
not?</p><p><a name="06051524000106"><b><a name="06051524000634">Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman proves my point.</p><p><a name="06051524000107">I should like to turn to some
of the other comments made towards the end of our debate. The hon.
Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) mentioned the
Scotland Act 1998. The Bill would have the same relationship to that
Act as to the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, in the sense that
consequential provisions could be made, as set out in clause
8.</p><p><a name="06051524000108">The right hon. and
learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) asked about tax. The answer
is that orders could be used to reduce tax if that met the purpose of
removing burdens and other provisions in the Bill. In reality, however,
there is a Budget and a Finance Bill every year, and that is how we
deal with tax measures in this House. I hope that that makes the matter
clear.</p><p><a name="06051524000109"><b><a name="06051524000635">Kelvin
Hopkins:</b> As I said, all taxation issues can be dealt with
in the Finance Bill every year, and there is no real necessity to
include them in this
Bill.</p><p><a name="06051524000110"><b><a name="06051524000636">Mr.
McFadden:</b> Here we come to the question of what regulatory
reform orders are likely to be used for. My hon. Friend is
right&#151;there is a Budget and a Finance Bill every year precisely
for the purposes of making changes to
taxation.</p><p><a name="06051524000111">Several hon.
Members asked for examples of what the Bill will allow us to do. One
example is that of the 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 785</b><br>Charity Commission deregulation, which was undertaken to review the
financial thresholds at which certain registration requirements are
asked for. Others may include simplifying some transactions with
Government, consolidating areas of overlapping legislation, Hampton
mergers of regulatory bodies, and streamlining overlapping consent
regimes. For instance, the Department of Health wishes to remove a
consent regime introduced in the Health Act 1999 because it has proved
ineffective, and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister undertook to
consider proposals for reviewing, repealing and modifying numerous
consent regimes with a view to removing burdens on the NHS, local
authorities and others.</p><p><a name="06051524000112"><b><a name="06051524000637">Mr.
Heathcoat-Amory:</b> Since this regulatory reform Bill has
itself undergone considerable regulatory reform so far, will it, if it
becomes an Act, be a candidate for regulatory reform under its own
provisions, so that it is another example of a future Act that needs to
be
reformed?</p><p><a name="06051524000113"><b><a name="06051524000638">Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman anticipates amendments that
we will reach later in the debate. I shall resist outlining those
provisions now, as we have that joy to
come.</p><p><a name="06051524000114">In the end, we
have to make a judgment as to whether we want a deregulatory system
that can do the job. New clause 19, with its associated amendments, was
our response to fears that the Government were introducing too wide a
power. Equally, there is a warning on the other side of the debate. If
we legislate on the basis of every scenario in our wildest imaginings
about what this legislation may be used for, we will end up with a
repeat of the process that we have had twice before, which has achieved
a consensus in Parliament but not the purpose that we wished.</p><p><a name="06051524000115">I shall end by reflecting on
what my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, the
Chairman of the Regulatory Reform Committee said. It has been suggested
in the debate that the Bill is about relieving the burdens on
Ministers. That is not the intention of the legislation. Those who feel
the burdens are the people and bodies outside the House, including
charities, businesses, and voluntary and public sector organisations.
They have to deal with the regulation and legislation that we
introduce. It is they who feel the effects, and it is to them that we
have a duty to regulate in such a way that the power can be used
effectively.</p><p><a name="06051524000116"><b><a name="06051524000639">Mr.
Heald:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. During the
debate, several hon. Members on both sides of the House have said that
their view of new clause 19, on which we are about to vote, could be
affected by knowing whether a Division was likely to be available on
either amendment (a) or amendment (b). Are you in a position to give
the House any guidance on whether such a Division might be

up, and read the First
time.</i></p><p><a name="06051527000465"><b><a name="06051527000950">Mr.
McFadden:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</p><p><a name="06051527000466">New clause 20,
together with new clause 19, will amend the order-making power in part
1 to focus on better regulation objectives. New clause 20 will provide
a power for a Minister, by order, to make provision that he considers
will ensure that regulatory functions are exercised so as to comply
with the Better Regulation Task Force&#146;s five principles of good
regulation, which state that regulatory activities must be carried on
in a way that is transparent, accountable, proportionate, consistent
and should be targeted only at cases in which action is
needed.</p><p><a name="06051527000467"><b><a name="06051527000951">Mr.
Heald:</b> The Minister may find it helpful if I indicate that
we are supportive of new clause 20, and do not feel that he need
outline such a sensible measure at huge
length.</p><p><a name="06051527000468"><b><a name="06051527000952">Mr.
McFadden:</b> Having sat through what we have sat through this
afternoon, I quite appreciate what the hon. Gentleman is
saying.</p><p><a name="06051527000469">Making
regulatory functions more consistent with those principles is in line
with the recommendations in Philip Hampton&#146;s 2005 report that
regulators should conduct their business in ways that are risk-based.
The Hampton report proposed that the principle of risk assessment
should be entrenched in regulators so that the burden of enforcement
falls on the highest risk businesses and least on those with the best
record of compliance.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060515/debtext/60515-0077.htm"/>


<p><a name="06051527000470">Although the
Hampton report found that there is much good practice in UK regulation,
the proposed order-making power in new clause 20 could be used to
effect real further improvement. For example, the report found that
fewer than half of the regulators in the Hampton review used risk
assessment to reduce enforcement activity on high performing
businesses. By 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 794</b><br>being able to make provision modifying the way in which regulatory
functions are exercised, the Government could begin to propose
improvements that would ensure that more inspection is proportionate to
risk and consistent. That would have a real effect on those regulated,
because the burden of inspection would be reduced on the vast majority
of the regulated and would be focused on the cases in which there was a
real problem. New clause 20 would allow a Minister by order to modify
the way in which a regulatory function is exercised, to secure that
regulatory functions are carried out in accordance with the five
principles.</p><p><a name="06051527000471"><b><a name="06051527000953">Rob
Marris:</b> Would new clause 20 enable a Minister of the
Crown, with the safeguards that we hope will be in the Bill, to get rid
of some of the many
quangos?</p><p><a name="06051527000472"><b><a name="06051527000954">Mr.
McFadden:</b> Certainly the merger of regulators is an element
of the Bill and is possible under the Bill.</p><p><a name="06051527000473">One example may be that a
regulator could have regard to the views of a body that represented
consumers in that area&#151;such as the Gas and Electricity Consumer
Council&#151;so that the regulator&#146;s activities are carried
out in a way that is more accountable to
consumers.</p><p><a name="06051527000474">New clause
20 would also allow a Minister by order to amend the constitution of a
body exercising regulatory functions under an enactment if doing so
would make it more transparent and accountable. An example could be
amending the statute governing a regulator to provide that it has a
board structure, with perhaps a proportion of the board being comprised
of non-executive directors, to improve accountability and transparency.
It would also be possible by order to transfer the regulatory functions
of one regulator to another. That power could be used where two
regulators exercise oversight of related areas. For instance, where two
regulators are operating in closely related areas, to make their work
more transparent to the regulated and more proportionate to risk, it
may be appropriate to transfer the functions of two regulators to a
single
regulator.</p><p><a name="06051527000475"><b><a name="06051527000955">Mr.
Heath:</b> Will the Minister explain to me, because I am not
absolutely clear about this point, how new clause 20 relates to clause
23, which excludes some regulators from provisions? I mention that only
because he mentioned gas and electricity consumer groups and, of
course, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority is one of those
specifically excluded from the principles underlying the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06051527000476"><b><a name="06051527000956">Mr.
McFadden:</b> If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I will come
back to that at the end of my remarks.</p><p><a name="06051527000477">New clause 20 would also permit
the creation of a new body to carry out the functions of existing
regulators if the Minister considered that that would be for the
purpose of securing that regulatory functions were exercised so as to
comply with the five
principles.</p><p><a name="06051527000478">Finally,
if as a consequence of the creation of a new body or the transferral of
a function, another regulatory body becomes obsolete, it may be
necessary to abolish it. That, too, would be possible under the
order-making power of new clause 20, if the Minister considers that it
will ensure that regulatory functions 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 795</b><br>are exercised so as to comply with the five principles of good
regulation. It is important that I make it clear at this point that,
under new clause 20, an order may propose changes to a body carrying
out regulatory functions only if those functions continue to be
exercised. Any modification by order of the functions themselves would
have to be dealt with under new clause 19, or by way of primary
legislation. I assure hon. Members that it is not in any way our
intention to erode the independence from Government of those regulators
set up by statute. Our aim with this new clause is to have an
order-making power that can be used to ensure that all regulators
conduct their business in a way that is consistent with the five better
regulation
principles.</p><p><a name="06051527000479">An order
made under new clause 20 will of course be subject to the
same checks and balances as any other. Such an order must meet the
preconditions in clause 3, and a Minister must consult widely on any
proposed
order.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051527000495">9
pm</h5><p><a name="06051527000480">A full
explanatory document will be submitted to relevant parliamentary
Committees. The Government have also given an undertaking that they
will not do anything highly controversial using an order and that an
order will not be forced through despite opposition from the relevant
parliamentary Committees. As we will discuss tomorrow, the Government
have placed on a statutory footing a veto for relevant Committees of
either House. That will provide further assurance for those concerned
that an order will proceed only if the informed view of the House and
another place is satisfied that its outcome is
desirable.</p><p><a name="06051527000481">Let me turn
to the question asked by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr.
Heath). Clause 23 excludes certain economic regulators from being
specified by order for the purposes of clauses 20 and 21, which relate
to the principles and the code. Those regulators are not excluded from
new clause 20. I hope that that clarifies the situation, and I ask hon.
Members to accept the new
clause.</p><p><a name="06051527000482"><b><a name="06051527000957">Mr.
Heald:</b> We welcome new clause 20, which, as the Minister
said, is designed to promote the regulatory principles that derive from
the Hampton review and the five principles of better regulation. There
is clearly a role for merging regulators, and there is a proposal to
merge 35 national regulators into seven. However, if changes to the
role of a major regulator might impact on the public or have a great
effect on business, it should be possible for full parliamentary
scrutiny to take place. When the former Minister addressed that matter
in Committee, I understood that he gave an assurance that that would
happen. However, subject to that point, we welcome the new clause as a
step in the right
direction.</p><p><a name="06051527000483"><b><a name="06051527000958">Mr.
Heath:</b> I hope that I can also be relatively brief because
I support new clause 20. I had intended to be even briefer, but after
hearing the Minister&#146;s reply to my intervention, I am struggling
to reconcile what the new clause says with the provisions of clauses 20
and 21. The Minister must correct me if I have misunderstood him, but
he told us that although clause 23 excludes 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 796</b><br>certain regulators from the provisions of clauses 20 and 21, those
regulators are not excluded from the provisions of new clause
20.</p><p><a name="06051527000484">We said in
Committee that it was an anomaly that the specified regulators were
excluded from clause 20, which
says:</p><a name="06051527000493"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Any
person exercising a regulatory function to which this section applies
must have regard to the principles in subsection (2) in the exercise of
the function ... Those principles are that ... (a) regulatory
activities should be carried in a way which is transparent,
accountable, proportionate and consistent; ... (b) regulatory
activities should be targeted only at cases in which action is
needed.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051527000485">Sharp-witted
Members will have realised that those words also appear in new clause
20. That measure will require a Minister to secure that regulatory
functions are exercised by bodies in such as way as to comply with
those precise principles, although certain regulators are excluded from
those requirements as the Bill presently stands. There is thus a group
of regulators that apparently does not need to comply with those
principles by virtue of clause 23, but is required to do so by virtue
of new clause 20, which the Minister will be able to use to ensure that
regulatory functions are exercised in such a way that they comply with
those principles. That seems to be an anomaly, albeit not an unwelcome
one because at least the principles are there somewhere. Nevertheless,
the anomaly might need to be sorted out at a later
stage.</p><p><a name="06051527000486"><b><a name="06051527000959">Mr.
Heald:</b> Clause 20(3) says that the duty to follow the
principles</p><a name="06051527000494"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;is subject to
any other requirement affecting the exercise of the regulatory
function.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051527000487">As we said in
Committee, that would exclude the Financial Services Authority to some
extent and other financial regulators if confidentiality is important.
However, it may still apply to them subject to that modification. I
wonder whether that is what the Minister is
saying.</p><p><a name="06051527000488"><b><a name="06051527000960">Mr.
Heath:</b> The hon. Gentleman rightly draws attention to
subsection (3), but it only complicates matters further. We are not
clear, because of the way in which procedure works, where the new
clause will sit in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell
us because it is a basic question. I am assuming that it forms part of
part 1, but it may be part of part 2. I think the Minister nods to say
that it would be in part 1, in which case we have one provision in part
1 and something that could be construed as a different provision in
part 2.</p><p><a name="06051527000489">I do not
think that that matters so long as everyone understands exactly what
applies to them. I fear that there will be confusion unless an
explanatory note is produced, so that we all understand how the measure
works before it gets to another place. Otherwise, I can foresee at
least a day&#146;s debate on the misapplication of the new clause and
existing clause
23.</p><p><a name="06051527000490"><b><a name="06051527000961">Mr.

necessary because of changes to the Bill, but why is it necessary at
all in the light of Standing Order No. 59, which makes special
provision for an accelerated procedure to take place in the House for
Law Commission
Bills?</p><p><a name="06051537000016"><b><a name="06051537000540">Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for
his comments. As Chair of the Procedure Committee, I know that he has
taken a detailed look at the Bill. I am interested in his remarks and
would be prepared to reflect on them. However, it is not always
appropriate to do everything by Standing Order. It is better to put
some things in a
Bill.</p><p><a name="06051537000017">It has sometimes
taken too long for Governments to implement some of the proposals
recommended by the Law Commission. Indeed, its report last year was
fairly typical. It revealed that there were 16 accepted but
unimplemented reports, with an average waiting time of more than seven
years from publication to enactment. Clearly, that is not
satisfactory.</p><p><a name="06051537000018"><b><a name="06051537000541">Mr.
Heath:</b> Why does the hon. Lady feel that there is this long
delay in implementation of Law Commission reports? Is it a lack of
Bills from the Home Office or the Department for Constitutional
Affairs, or is there some other reason?</p><p><a name="06051537000019"><b><a name="06051537000542">Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am amazed that the hon. Gentleman was able to
say that with a straight face. As he knows very well, parliamentary
time for Bills from a variety of Departments is likely to be precious
and it is difficult for space to be made for them. That is one reason
why it is important that the Bill allows for the opportunity for Law
Commission recommendations to 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 799</b><br>be brought before Parliament in a speedier fashion. That is the very
purpose of new clause 21. After all, Law Commissions are by their
nature generally apolitical, so it is not that easy to win
parliamentary time. That is one reason why proposals might otherwise
not be enacted for very many years. That is not good, because people
and businesses are not able to benefit from the considered proposals
that the Law Commissions have made. For those reasons, I recommend the
new clause to the
House.</p><p><a name="06051537000020">If
I may, I shall refer to the amendments to the new clause and explain to
the House why I must ask it to resist them. The problem with amendment
(a), which is intended to restrict the scope of the order-making power
to implement Law Commission recommendations by ensuring that Ministers
cannot change those recommendations in any way if they wish to use the
order-making power, is that it is too restrictive. It would not allow
any changes to the recommendations. The words &#147;with or without
changes&#148; introduce a degree of flexibility into new clause 21.
The new clause would therefore avoid the loss of good measures by
reason of quibbling arguments that a change is beyond a particular
technical parameter, while still preserving the overall rule that the
order in question must implement a Law Commission recommendation and
not something different from that.</p><p><a name="06051537000021"><b><a name="06051537000543">Mr.
David Gauke (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> I wish to
draw the Minister&#146;s attention to subsection (5), which
states:</p><a name="06051537000532"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;An
order under this section may contain such consequential, supplementary,
incidental or transitional provision (including provision made by
amending or repealing any enactment or other provision) as the Minister
making it considers
appropriate.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051537000022">She
said that omitting &#147;with or without changes&#148; would permit
dealing with quibbling matters, but subsection (5) deals with the very
issue to which she refers.</p><p><a name="06051537000023"><b><a name="06051537000544">Bridget
Prentice:</b> Subsection (5) does indeed go a long way to
achieving what we want to achieve, but it is important that we include
in the Bill the fact that amendments to Law Commission recommendations
may need to be made. The most obvious example of when that might be
necessary, which my hon. Friend the Member for East Renfrewshire gave
in Committee, is following a time lapse such as that we have discussed,
during which other things may have taken place that mean that a
recommendation no longer fits the purpose for which it was intended. In
that case, changes would have to be made. Amendment (a) would stifle
that use.</p><p><a name="06051537000024">My hon.
Friend also said in Committee that the words &#147;with or without
changes&#148; are not intended to allow Ministers to make proposals
that would turn recommendations into something completely different. If
proposals are so far removed from the recommendations that they would
not, in fact, implement them, under new clause 21 the proposal should
not be proceeded with. I would imagine that the Scrutiny Committee
would be quick to ensure that that were brought to the House&#146;s
attention under the new veto provisions to be introduced in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06051537000025">The
2001 Act included numerous technical restrictions that created
arbitrary limits on what could be delivered 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 800</b><br>by order. The order-making powers created by the Bill should be flexible
enough to achieve the effective delivery of beneficial Law Commission
recommendations, which are an important part of the better regulation
agenda. The correct approach is not to rule out changes but to allow
proposals to be considered by the Committees. If they do not agree that
the proposals implement Law Commission recommendations or satisfy the
pre-conditions in clause 3 that provide important protection for
people&#146;s rights, they can veto the order. We may, for example,
need a power to make changes before the Law Commission recommendations
become legislation. There may be scope for drafting or structural
changes if the Government decide to adopt only some of the proposals in
a Bill drafted by the commission. It is often necessary to make
amendments to reflect changes in the law after a Committee reports. It
may be desirable, too, to make material changes to the detail after
further consideration or a suggestion from a scrutiny Committee. In
response to the question from the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke), subsection (5) would not cover all those
possibilities. In summary, amendment (a) is unduly restrictive, as it
would introduce sterile and time wasting arguments about form and
language. We want a procedure that delivers better regulation, not one
that absorbs resources in arid legal arguments over technicalities. I
therefore cannot support amendment (a), so I hope that the right hon.
Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) will withdraw
it.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051537000533">9.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06051537000026">Amendment (b)
is slightly more generous than amendment (a), and is substantially the
same as amendment No. 3. It would allow Ministers to change
recommendations if it is necessary to take into account any development
in the law since the recommendations were made, as I said earlier. It
builds the case for such a change&#151;the longer the delay between
the publication of the Law Commission recommendations and the delivery
of the order, the more likely it is that the law will have to be
changed. In such cases, it is no longer sensible to implement the
recommendations without changes, because in certain respects they may
be out of date. It is important to be able to implement the
recommendations with the changes necessary to reflect changes in the
law.</p><p><a name="06051537000027">To that
extent, I welcome the policy underlying amendment (b). However, it,
too, is excessively restrictive. There may be other reasons why changes
are necessary or desirable. It may be possible to improve the drafting
of the draft legislation proposed by the Law Commission, not least when
part of a group of recommendations is to be implemented or several sets
of recommendations are drawn together in a single
instrument.</p><p><a name="06051537000028"><b><a name="06051537000545">David
Howarth:</b> I do not want to cast aspersions on the abilities
of parliamentary counsel, but I doubt whether they can draft better
than the Law Commission. Any conceivable circumstance in which changes
need to be made is surely covered by amendment (b) or new clause 21(5).
I cannot see that there is room for anything beyond those two measures.
</p><p><a name="06051537000029"><b><a name="06051537000546">Bridget
Prentice:</b> I have no intention of refereeing between
parliamentary counsel and the Law Commission to decide who employs the
better draftspeople. Any 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 801</b><br>drafting changes made by the commission to draft legislation would be
subject to consultation, and it could reflect on the
responses.</p><p><a name="06051537000030">A Minister
may wish to make a material change. Provided that the order remains an
order to implement Law Commission recommendations, they should be able
to do so. The change proposed might be as a result of consultation
after the publication of the report. It might be that a change is
proposed to make the recommendations of the commission more generally
accepted. Indeed, as I said earlier, the scrutiny Committees themselves
might wish some changes to be made. The correct approach is not to rule
out changes, but to allow the proposals to come forward and be
considered by the Committees. For that reason, I ask the House to
resist amendment (b) to new clause
21.</p><p><a name="06051537000031"><b><a name="06051537000547">Pete
Wishart:</b> Can the Minister confirm that in new clause 21,
the reference to the Scottish Law Commission relates only to issues
that are reserved to the Westminster Parliament under the Scotland Act
1998? That is suggested in new clause 21 and in clause 8, but nowhere
in the Bill is it specifically
stated.</p><p><a name="06051537000032"><b><a name="06051537000548">Bridget
Prentice:</b> I will reflect on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

UK Law Commissions. They would all be subject to this part of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06051537000033"><b><a name="06051537000549">Rob
Marris:</b> On my hon. Friend&#146;s answer to the hon.
Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart), it is not clear
to me, particularly since new clause 22 has not been selected, whether
new clause 21 would apply to the Northern Ireland Law Commission, which
is specifically not mentioned in subsection (3), although it was
mentioned in clause 1 of the original
Bill.</p><p><a name="06051537000034"><b><a name="06051537000550">Bridget

the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)and the
hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete
Wishart).</p><p><a name="06051537000035">New clause
10 would rule out the creation of certain new offences and the
authorisation of forcible entry, search and seizure. These were
possible under clauses 6 and 7. However, Government amendments Nos. 23
and 27 will achieve the same result, so that orders implementing Law
Commission recommendations will not have any special treatment in this
respect, and the limits in clauses 6 and 7 will apply to these orders,
as well as to others. To that extent new clause 10 has been overtaken
by events.</p><p><a name="06051537000036"><b><a name="06051537000551">Mr.

Scotland.</p><p><a name="06051537000039"><b><a name="06051537000553">Mr.
Heald:</b> With reference to Scotland, the Minister may be
aware that the Law Society of Scotland has pointed out that there is an
implied assumption in new clause 21 that all Law Commission and
Scottish Law Commission reports and recommendations are
non-controversial and may be enacted using the procedure under the
Bill. It goes on to state that that is &#147;not necessarily
so&#148;. Does she accept that some of the measures that the Law
Commissions examine are quite
controversial?</p><p><a name="06051537000040"><b><a name="06051537000554">Bridget
Prentice:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. Many of the issues
that the Law Commission deals with are controversial. That is one of
the reasons why, as an independent apolitical body, it is particularly
useful to us in the House for examining those very issues. I have no
quibble at all with the idea that some of the issues are controversial.
To reassure the Law Society of Scotland, I point out that where issues
are controversial, as has been said in earlier debates today and as was
said in Committee by my hon. Friend the Member for East Renfrewshire,
it would not be the Government&#146;s intention to put through this
system any measure that was particularly controversial. I hope that
gives the House some
reassurance.</p><p><a name="06051537000041">Secondly,
new clause 10 would prevent any order from implementing Law Commission
recommendations in the area of family law and rights of occupation or
landlord and tenant law in that it relates to the rights of tenants.
The Government feel that this is too restrictive because not every
proposal is unsuitable for implementation by order. Such blanket
prohibitions would create new boundaries. We would need to define
family law and the other topics that have been mentioned. We would
create, once again, technical limits that have little to do
with the merits of the proposal or its suitability for the
procedure.</p><p><a name="06051537000042">Some
family law and landlord and tenant law proposals would be far too
contentious to proceed with other than by primary legislation. The
Government have made it clear&#151;I make it clear again this
evening&#151;that we will not use the procedure for highly
controversial measures. The correct approach is not to rule out reform
but to allow proposals to come forward to be considered by the scrutiny
Committees. New clause 10 would unnecessarily limit our power and, on
that basis, I cannot support it.</p><p><a name="06051537000043"><b><a name="06051537000555">Mr.
Greg Knight:</b> Is there not a weakness in the argument that
it is the Government who will determine whether something is highly
controversial, in which case the procedure would not be used, or
whether something is just controversial, in which case the procedure
may be used?</p><p><a name="06051537000044"><b><a name="06051537000556">Bridget
Prentice:</b> I do not intend to dance on a pin on the
difference between highly controversial and controversial. I do not
think that controversial issues, as in those terms, would proceed under
this system. 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 803</b><br>The scrutiny Committees would have reached a strong
decision if they felt that something was controversial and should not

account.</p><p><a name="06051537000045"><b><a name="06051537000557">John

Prentice:</b> There is no criteria to define
&#147;controversial&#148; other than according to what we
understand in our everyday lives and the usage of the word. I am sure
that my hon. Friend was involved in issues in the past that were judged
to be highly controversial which are now accepted as being relatively
mainstream. My hon. Friend may not appreciate my describing anything
that he has done as being mainstream, but he will understand my point
that things change. On that basis, we have to be able to define what is
controversial now and what might be controversial tomorrow. That is
quite difficult.</p><p><a name="06051537000047"><b><a name="06051537000559">Mr.

Gale:</b> I am grateful to the Minister.</p><p><a name="06051537000050">Hitherto in these arguments the
Government have discarded arguments about reasonableness because
reasonableness is difficult to define. That has been the
Government&#146;s stance. Why should we not apply the same yardstick
to the issue before us? Why should it be left to the Government and the
Law Commission to decide what is controversial and what is
not?</p><p><a name="06051537000051"><b><a name="06051537000562">Bridget
Prentice:</b> The argument is not left purely to the
Government. The scrutiny Committees will have a view. It is not the
Government who decide what is controversial. I do not think that it
would be possible to find a satisfactory legislative definition of
controversial, unlike reasonableness. The reasonableness test is well
known in law. Judicial review is an opportunity for people to test the
reasonableness of a Minister&#146;s
decision.</p><p><a name="06051537000052">I will give
an example. A 1990s report on divorce and the current project on
homicide are plainly unsuitable for implementation by order because
people have strong feelings about the principles that they address.
Therefore, it would not be appropriate to take them through the
proposed system. Equally obviously, other reforms are uncontroversial,
often technical &#147;lawyers&#146; law&#148; reforms; very
important, but politically unexciting. Those are the ones that often
struggle to find parliamentary time.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051537000534">9.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06051537000053">Amendment No. 3
builds on one possible reason why a change may be necessary. Indeed,
the longer the delay 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 804</b><br>between publication of the Law Commission&#146;s
recommendations and the order being delivered, the more likely, as I
said earlier, that the law will have to be changed. So it is important
to be able to implement the recommendations with the changes necessary
to reflect changes in the law. I will not go over the arguments again,
because I explained in respect of earlier amendments the reasons why
such an approach would be too restrictive.</p>

<p><a name="06051537000054">I hope that
the House welcomes Government amendment No. 23, which relates to the
limits, already contained in clause 6, on the criminal penalties that
can be imposed by order. Currently, these restrictions do not apply to
orders implementing Law Commission recommendations. The amendment will
make orders implementing such recommendations subject to the same
limits on maximum criminal penalties to which all other orders are
subject. In Committee, the Government agreed to reflect on amendments
that proposed deleting the exception relating to criminal penalties
imposed by orders implementing Law Commission recommendations. That
exception was created to allow orders implementing Law Commission
recommendations, notwithstanding the level of penalties proposed. That
caused some concern in Committee, even though it seemed likely that the
exception would be little used. We have therefore given careful
consideration to that concern during the Bill&#146;s
passage.</p><p><a name="06051537000055">The
Government have always intended that the order-making power should work
as an effective vehicle for delivering regulatory reform measures,
while maintaining necessary protections and safeguards. I hope that
Government amendment No. 23 reassures Members that the Bill&#146;s
order-making power will be used to implement only appropriate measures
by order, and that, on that basis, they will be willing to accept
it.</p><p><a name="06051537000056">Government
amendment No. 27 relates to the limits already in clause 7 prohibiting
the authorisation by order of forcible entry, search, seizure or the
compelling of the giving of evidence. Currently, those restrictions do
not apply to orders implementing Law Commission recommendations. The
amendment will make orders implementing such recommendations subject to
the general prohibition on authorising by order forcible entry, search,
seizure or the compelling of the giving of evidence. We agreed in
Committee to reflect on amendments that proposed deleting the exception
for orders implementing Law Commission recommendations, and I hope that
Government amendment No. 27 offers the same level of reassurance that
the Bill&#146;s order-making power will be used to implement only
appropriate measures by order.</p><p><a name="06051537000057">Government amendments Nos. 33,
34, 40 and 59 are consequential drafting amendments, so I do not
propose to discuss them in detail. Suffice it to say that Government
amendment No. 33 is made necessary by the amendments to clauses 1 and
2, but it does not change the effect of clause 11(1)(d). Government
amendment No. 34 is also made necessary by amendments to clauses 1 and
2, and does not change the effect of clause 11(2). Government
amendment No. 40, also made necessary by amendments to
clauses 1 and 2, does not change the effect of clause 12(4). Finally,
Government amendment No. 59 replaces the now obsolete reference to
&#147;section 1(4)&#148; with a reference to subsection (3) of new

is not the Minister&#146;s motives, about which I have not the
slightest doubt&#151;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I heard
something sotto voce which I will not repeat. Bearing in mind the
ability of Ministers to change recommendations, if a Minister did not
agree with the full Law Commission proposal, expanded it and wished to

the various stages in our normal way, including a proper Committee
stage and Report.</p><p><a name="06051531000006">I

had suggested, which would be a good thing. If it reached the point
where the Minister had had a bit of delay and it was necessary to make
some change to what the Law Commission had recommended, I am sure that
Sir Roger Toulson and his committee would be only too happy to be
speedy about it and to turn it round, because I know how frustrated

does not mean that a Committee can look at a piece of legislation and

enough. If we believe in Select Committees and want to empower them, we

less controversial issues. Clearly, we have to reflect carefully on how
we deal with the more controversial ones. I fully endorse the
Opposition spokesman&#146;s view that this leads us to reflect on
what kind of veto the House has, where it can be exercised and by whom.
There is a very important point that I invite my hon. Friends on the
Front Bench to reflect on before we reach the section on the veto.
While I am minded fully to support the principles set out in the new
clauses that we are dealing with, I am predicating my remarks on a veto
of similar power to that which existed in respect of the 2001
legislation, but on the face of the Bill. The ministerial understanding
was one that the House would not tolerate being broken; I think that
hon. Members on both sides of the House would agree with that. The hon.
Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) is right to say that
the Government have proposed a veto, but the qualifications that are
being proposed create problems for us.</p><p><a name="06051531000011">I want to make a few quick
observations on the important contribution made by my hon. Friend the
Minister. First, her remarks need to be looked at in the context of the
commitment given to the Chairman of the Procedure Committee and me by
the previous Minister in the Cabinet Office, my hon. Friend the Member
for East Renfrewshire (Mr. Murphy), that there would be significant
changes to the Standing Orders available to the House.</p><p><a name="06051531000012">I hope that my second
observation will take some of the sting out of hon. Members&#146;
concerns. Clause 16 contains provisions that will enable the House to
require the Minister to have regard to representations from the
outside, as well as any resolution of either House or any
recommendations by a Committee of either House charged with dealing
with a draft order. On that basis, I believe that new clause 21 makes
eminent sense, because the protections are there. However, amendment
(b), tabled by the Liberal Democrats, also makes sense. Some of the
issues that the Law Commission deals with have gathered dust over a
number of years, for the reasons that the Chairman of the Procedure
Committee outlined, as well as for many other complex reasons. It might
be 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 807</b><br>sensible to make provision for such eventualities, as proposed in
amendment (b), although I do not think that amendment (a) is necessary,
because of provisions contained elsewhere in the
legislation.</p><p><a name="06051531000013"><b><a name="06051531000515">Rob
Marris:</b> Would not amendment (b) result in our ending up
having endless debates on what &#147;necessary&#148;
meant?</p><p><a name="06051531000014"><b><a name="06051531000516">Andrew
Miller:</b> In his previous occupation, my hon. Friend spent
many a long hour arguing about the meaning of words such as
&#147;necessary&#148; and &#147;reasonable&#148; in front of
learned courts, and no doubt getting paid considerably more than he is
now. Such arguments are among the regular problems that Parliament has
to face.</p><p><a name="06051531000015">Without
getting into a tirade about lawyers and their earnings, my final point
is that the Bill will contain a veto. As I said at the beginning of my
remarks, the nature of the veto is mission-critical to ensuring that
the spirit of my hon. Friend&#146;s remarks can be adhered to
throughout the passage of an order. Assuming that the assurances given
are delivered on, and with the caveat expressed about the second part
of the Liberal Democrat amendment, the new clause ought to be
accepted.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051531000509">9.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06051531000016"><b><a name="06051531000517">Mr.
Heath:</b> The intervention from the hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) drew attention to the words
&#147;necessary&#148; and &#147;reasonable&#148;. I have always
felt that I am necessary and reasonable and that what I want to put
into a Bill is necessary and reasonable, although I understand that
that might engender debate. In this instance, we need not be very
concerned.</p><p><a name="06051531000017">There
should be a mechanism for getting Law Commission proposals into law
expeditiously and effectively. The first difficulty is ensuring that it
is not abused to bring forward matters that are not non-controversial
in any way, but that have important impacts with which many would
disagree. The second difficulty is avoiding a Government either
amending or cherry-picking those proposals along the way, so that what
is enacted is different from what the Law Commission proposed. The
third is ensuring that, wherever possible, a primary legislative route
is used in preference to an order of this kind. I take seriously the
point made by the Chairman of the Procedure Committee about the
application, or lack of application, of Standing Orders. It seems
preposterous that the Government say that they have had no opportunity
to enact the long queue of Law Commission proposals when they have not
used the mechanisms available in the House to do that.</p><p><a name="06051531000018">It beggars belief to say that
there is a lack of legislative opportunity to introduce Law Commission
proposals, especially with regard to criminal law, but even with regard
to civil law. There is a criminal justice Bill every single year, as I
know to my cost because I have served on the Standing Committees on
most of them. There is an immigration and asylum Bill every year,
without fail. Sometimes, a couple of terrorism Bills are introduced in
a single year. There is a queue of legislation coming from the Home
Office and the 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 808</b><br>Department for Constitutional Affairs, and it does
not take a great deal of ingenuity to attach Law Commission proposals
to those Bills. Everything else is attached&#151;criminal justice
Bills often look like Christmas trees with the number of baubles
attached because they are thought worthy of a few column inches in one
of the papers.</p><p><a name="06051531000019">There
are other difficulties. When is a Law Commission recommendation a Law
Commission recommendation? I never had that satisfactorily explained by
the Minister in Committee. Is it the original recommendations, the
draft Bill that the Law Commission will produce, or either one? If it
is the recommendations, the point made by the Under-Secretary of State
for Constitutional Affairs, the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget
Prentice) about a difference in drafting between parliamentary counsel
and the Law Commission is of no importance whatever, as the
recommendations are what matter. We need clarity on that.</p><p><a name="06051531000020">With regard to amendments (a)
and (b) to the new clause, we are still wary about giving Ministers the
capacity to introduce changes to Law Commission proposals. We asked
time after time in Committee why the Minister needed that power. He
repeated five times&#151;I have looked at <i>Hansard </i>to confirm
it&#151;that he needed the power for one reason only: to deal with a
situation in which a Law Commission proposal had been hanging around
for some time, a substantive development in the law had taken place
since the time that the recommendation was made, and there was a need
to reflect that. That is why we formulated our amendment (b) exactly as
the Minister had said at the time that he wanted it to be formulated.
We formulated it in that way to meet his requirements: we had no other
reason to do so.</p><p><a name="06051531000021">Some
Governments are very hard to please. They tell us exactly what they
want, we table an amendment to that effect, and then they want
something completely different. There are other reasons for which they
want to be able to change recommendations, and it is those other
reasons that give us cause for alarm in this instance. If the intention
is to implement some recommendations and not others, that may
completely change the complexion of what the Law Commission proposes.
Is the Minister proposing to cherry-pick certain proposals? Are
proposals going to be tweaked to make them more acceptable to Ministers
or, indeed, Select Committees? I have worries about that as well. The
issue should be put before the House so that everyone has a choice to
take part in the discussion, not just a select few.</p><p><a name="06051531000022">If the Bill is to contain the
mechanism described by the Minister for the fast-tracking of Law
Commission proposals&#151;there are new caveats that I welcome, given
their applicability to later amendments&#151;it must also incorporate
amendment (b), which limits the ability to change the recommendations
in a way that the Minister specifically identified in Committee as a
necessary prerequisite for effective working of the
legislation.</p><p><a name="06051531000023">If the
Chairman of the Procedure Committee, the right hon. Member for East
Yorkshire (Mr. Knight), presses his amendment, we will support him. I
merely ask him to reflect on whether our amendment would not only do
the same as his, but allow a small 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 809</b><br>concession to Ministers in the context of what they sought in Committee.
In the light of that, he may prefer to support our amendment. In any
event, the House should divide on one of the amendments. I must add
that if the Procedure Committee, a Select Committee of the House, is to
be ignored by Ministers, it sets a poor precedent for the working of
the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06051531000024"><b><a name="06051531000518">Mr.
Knight:</b> This is not a party-political issue. It is really
a matter of judgment. I have reached the conclusion that new clause 21
is not the answer, and I hope that the Minister will reflect on what
has been said this evening and will withdraw it. If she is not prepared
to do so, the new clause will be rendered less offensive if the House
accepts amendment (a), which incidentally has cross-party support. I
hope, Mr. Speaker, that you will allow a Division on the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06051531000025">As has
been said, new clause 21 seeks to facilitate the implementation of Law
Commission recommendations by using a fast-track procedure under the
Bill &#147;with or without changes&#148;. The Minister objects to
the removal of those four words. According to the Minister for the
Cabinet Office, the right hon. Member for North-West Durham (Hilary
Armstrong), if time had elapsed and some of the measures had been
implemented because they were deemed urgent, without the words
&#147;with or without changes&#148; Ministers would not be able to
implement the balance.</p><p><a name="06051531000026">I do not buy that argument, for
reasons identified by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West
Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) and the hon. Member for Cambridge (David
Howarth). Subsection (5) of the new clause
states:</p><a name="06051531000508"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;An
order under this section may contain such consequential, supplementary,
incidental or transitional provision (including provision made by
amending or repealing any enactment or other
provision)&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06051531000027">I think
that the power is there.</p><p><a name="06051531000028">One of the duties of the Law
Commission&#151;some would argue that it is one of its main
tasks&#151;is to codify and bring together legislation on the same
subject. Why would we want to split one of its proposals between
different pieces of legislation? My reading of subsection (5) is that
Ministers could implement proposals that were necessary and repeal any
law changes made in the interim, and codify it all under the
order-making power. That seems to me to be the right way to
proceed.</p><p><a name="06051531000029">As my hon.
Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) said, it is
incorrect to assume that a Law Commission recommendation will be
uncontroversial. When my Committee took evidence, the Minister&#146;s
predecessor, the hon. Member for East Renfrewshire (Mr. Murphy),
insisted on using the term &#147;highly controversial&#148; to
describe measures to which the provision would not apply. Not just
controversial, but highly controversial was the description given in
each case. If the Minister is saying that she has reflected on that and
is willing to lower the threshold, I would be reassured.</p><p><a name="06051531000030">I see no need
for the provision to be in the Bill. We have two Standing Orders that
could relate to the type of legislation that we have been discussing.
Standing 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 810</b><br>Order No. 58, which deals with consolidation measures, states that
Second Readings and Third Readings of such measures will be taken
forthwith; it therefore provides a much accelerated procedure. Standing
Order No. 59, which the Conservatives introduced, with consent, when we
were in government, specifically refers to Law Commission Bills and
states that they should be referred to a Second Reading Committee. We
made those changes with consent&#151;that was how we did business
then when we amended Standing Orders, and I regret that that is not
what happens now. That Standing Order, which was introduced in 1995,
has, I believe&#151;I stand to be corrected by the
Minister&#151;not been used by the Government since 1999. One has to
ask them why. Why have they not at least tried to use that provision to
put Law Commission proposals on to the statute book?</p><p><a name="06051531000031">I am not saying that those two
Standing Orders are perfect, but I noted what I regard as a point of
good will made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Hertfordshire. He said that he was prepared to engage in constructive
dialogue with the Minister, perhaps on ways of changing the Standing
Orders to deal with such matters. The Modernisation Committee is
already examining our processes, and I know that the Procedure
Committee would be prepared to consider that very point. I hope that
the Minister will reflect on that with a view to not going down the
proposed route and to ensuring that the House always has the
opportunity, through primary legislation, to consider Law Commission
proposals, albeit by an accelerated
procedure.</p><p><a name="06051531000032"><b><a name="06051531000519">Bridget
Prentice:</b> I, too, welcome the comments made by the hon.
Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald). I am always happy to
enter into dialogue with him, and happy to restate that if it helps
this evening&#146;s debate. However, that does not mean that I have
any intention of withdrawing new clause 21. There are times when the
accelerated procedures that the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire
(Mr. Knight) has clearly outlined are not appropriate for substantive
changes to the law, as opposed to consolidating Bills. I ask him to
reflect on that point.</p><p><a name="06051531000033"><b><a name="06051531000520">Mr.
Knight:</b> I am disappointed to hear that. In the light of
what the hon. Lady has just said, I shall be one of those seeking to
divide the House on the new
clause.</p><p><a name="06051531000034"><b><a name="06051531000521">David
Howarth:</b> In view of the time I shall be brief and add only
one point. The importance of the debate is that the Law Commission
route is the only one under the Bill whereby Ministers can change the
common law, otherwise their powers are restricted to changing statutes.
The common law basis of our constitution is well-known; the rules of
natural justice, for example, exist only in common law, not in
statute.</p><p><a name="06051531000035">The
Government have a history of changing Law Commission recommendations.
On bad character evidence, for example, the Criminal Justice
Act 2003 did exactly the opposite of what the Law Commission
recommended, so these are serious matters. If the Government cannot
bring their desires within either subsection (5) of the new clause or
the second part of 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 811</b><br>amendment (b), to take advantage of the power to make changes consequent
on the delay in implementing the recommendations, the only proper route
is not to make use of the fast-track procedure but to go back to the
Law Commission and try to persuade it to take the matter
forward.</p><p><a name="06051531000036"><i>It being

Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b> I am grateful
for the opportunity to raise an issue of particular concern to my
constituent&#151;I shall shortly explain his
circumstances&#151;that extends to a much wider constituency of
opinion. Many people both inside and outside the House think that the
time to take action to try to remedy some of the difficulties in the
case is overdue.</p><p><a name="0605163000020">I am
grateful to the Minister for Local Government for agreeing to replying
to our debate on the model code of conduct for councillors. I accept
that it would be inappropriate for him to refer to the specific case of
Councillor Alex Riley, but I am grateful that he will deal with the
wider issues. It might be helpful if I describe the circumstances of
Councillor Riley&#146;s case. For some time, he has chaired the
parish council in the village of Longstanton, which is several miles
north-west of Cambridge.</p><p><a name="0605163000021">As a result of the last regional
structure plan and the subsequent county structure plan, a large new
town is to be built to the north of Longstanton and Oakington
comprising 8,000 to 10,000 homes&#151;subsequently, the local
development framework settled on 8,000 homes. That large development is
very close to Longstanton, and it will envelop parts of the village. It
extends to the north, west and east of the village, and in the original
plans, it was no more than the distance of a football field from some
points of the village.</p><p><a name="0605163000022">As chairman of the parish
council, Alex Riley was closely and actively involved in the debate
about the structure plans. When it became clear that active planning on
the local development framework would begin, he decided to stand for
election to represent Longstanton on those issues. In June 2004, he was
elected with 70 per cent. of the vote in Longstanton as an independent
councillor&#151;the House will observe that this is not a party
political matter. From June 2004, he sought to represent the
village&#146;s views on a range of issues in the local development
framework before an outline planning application was made. However, the
ethical standards officer alleged that 15 breaches of the code of
conduct took place in the space of just five months. I accept that the
Minister will not want to comment, but the hearing of that case took
place today. It concluded that Councillor Riley was responsible for
breaches of the code of conduct but a penalty was not imposed, apart
from the fact that he was instructed to receive training in the code.
That is ironic, given that he has become insufferably familiar with it
to the point of contempt. None the less, in my view&#151;I do not
propose to speak for anyone else&#151;those were technical breaches
of the code. That is one of the main reasons why no penalty has been
applied.</p><p><a name="0605163000023">The issue is
the extent to which councillors legitimately sent to their council
chamber by constituents are able to represent those constituents. The
Local Government Act 2000 set out an ethical framework for councillors,
including in section 30 a model code of conduct, which South
Cambridgeshire district council adopted in 2002. The code identifies 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 822</b><br>two interests&#151;first, personal interests, which can be defined as
anything that might be held to affect a councillor&#146;s well-being
or financial position, or that of their relatives or friends, to a
greater extent than it would affect the local population generally.
Secondly, there are prejudicial interests&#151;interests that are so
significant that a member of the public with knowledge of the relevant
facts would reasonably regard those interests as likely to prejudice
the councillor&#146;s judgment of the public
interest.</p><p><a name="0605163000024">Those
definitions are not at issue. Individually, Councillor Riley and all
the other residents of Longstanton have personal and, in almost all
cases, a prejudicial interest in relation to these matters. Planning
decisions must, of course, be made in the public interest, but local
residents have a legitimate expectation that that public interest
includes and fully takes account of their views as the people most
affected by a planning decision. We must ensure that that interest is
properly and accurately
reflected.</p><p><a name="0605163000025">There is
confusion in South Cambridge district council about how the code of
conduct should be applied. Without going into detail, it was clear in
2004 that Councillor Riley received conflicting advice about what his
personal and prejudicial interests should mean in relation to his
participation in the council&#146;s discussions. In October 2005
South Cambridgeshire district council took counsel&#146;s opinion.
That was necessitated by the fact that the council was coming on to
examine the local development framework and an outline planning
application from Gallagher, which is the promoter of the large scheme.
The Minister need not declare an interest, but English Partnerships,
which is part of the Department, owns much of the land on which the
town is to be
built.</p><p><a name="0605163000026">Counsel&#146;s
opinion pointed out how the district council should, in accordance with
the current law, deal with the councillor. First, a councillor with a
prejudicial interest would be required to withdraw whenever a meeting
was held. A meeting, for these purposes, included any meeting of the
authority&#151;not just meetings that formed part of any
decision-making process, but informal meetings, briefing meetings or
any meeting whatsoever. Secondly, the further requirement that under
the code councillors should not seek improperly to influence a matter
should be interpreted to include lobbying or making any written
representations to
members.</p><p><a name="0605163000027">The code
allows dispensations, but counsel&#146;s advice to the district
council was clear. The standards committee of the council could not use
those dispensations to avoid adherence to the code. Counsel instanced
some of the very limited circumstances to which dispensations might be
applied.</p><p><a name="0605163000028">When counsel
was advising the planning authority about what Councillor Riley could
do, he came up with three options. The first was that Councillor Riley
should no longer be regarded as the route through which representations
could be made by villagers, so representations could be made direct to
the planning director. The second was that villagers should use another
councillor who had no disqualifying interest. The third option was that
Councillor Riley should resign. He would then be able to make
representations as chairman of the parish council or as a private
citizen.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 823</b><br><p><a name="0605163000029">It is curious that the use of
another councillor has been the route through which the district
council has proceeded. The necessity for Councillor Riley not to apply
improper influence has even extended to the point where he is not
allowed to discuss matters in his village with the councillor who has
been nominated to be the route through which such representations are
to be made. Another councillor on the parish council has been so
nominated and the deadening hand of the code seems almost to be
extending to the point where Councillor Riley cannot even talk to
Councillor Grace, who subsequently talks to Councillor Kindersley, who
is the councillor through whom their representations might come. Such
is the effect of the model code in the way in which it has been
interpreted.</p><p><a name="0605163000030">You
will not be surprised, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that I have raised the issue
with the Standards Board for England. It responded helpfully in
November by
saying:</p><a name="0605163000073"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Board shares your view that the current rules can be
over-restrictive...and may exclude members from discussing certain
matters which their community would expect them to be addressing or
even, in certain cases, where they have been elected to represent
specific views. Given the changing role of most councillors, the code
needs to be seen to be supporting such local advocacy and the
democratic right of a community to be represented when key matters
which affect that community are under discussion.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0605163000031">David Prince, the chief
executive, went on to
say:</p><a name="0605163000074"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Board
has also further recommended that the Government should also give local
authorities broader powers to grant exemptions to members with
prejudicial interests who nevertheless are speaking on behalf of their
constituents.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0605163000032">The board
went on to make recommendations to Ministers that flowed from exactly
the same points that were made in their letter to me. The Committee on
Standards in Public Life separately has made its own recommendations to
Government, and I shall quote one of them. It
said:</p><a name="0605163000075"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In
planning decisions the ability of elected members to represent
constituents&#146; interests where they have personal and prejudicial
interests has been unnecessarily diminished. This should be changed to
give any elected member the right to speak (but not vote) for their
constituents at a planning committee meeting or any other
quasi-regulatory
meeting.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0605163000033">In that sense,
we are clear about the direction in which both the board and the
committee see we need to
go.</p><p><a name="0605163000034">I wrote, of course,
to the Minister. He responded helpfully in January to me, making it
clear that the Standards Boards had made these recommendations that he
was minded to accept. I suppose that I could have rested on that and
not exposed the issue to further gaze in the House, but I wanted to use
this opportunity to say that I think that the current situation is
untenable. In the case of South Cambridgeshire district council, there
has been the benefit of counsel&#146;s opinion. It is not an
arbitrary opinion. We have arrived at the point where, not seeking
improper influence, where Councillor Riley can barely speak to any of
his fellow councillors without it being thought to be an improper
influence. He cannot even go to informal meetings, briefing meetings or
information meetings in the same way as members of the public attend to
ascertain what is happening. He cannot ask questions and he cannot make
representations.</p><p><a name="0605163000035">Across
the country, I have no doubt that this is not the only example. The
hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) raised an instance not
dissimilar to it on 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 824</b><br>8 November last year. Throughout the country either councillors are
unknowingly breaching the code, as Councillor Riley did in 2004, by
speaking on matters where they have an interest, even if they know that
they do not have to vote. In many cases they have not concept of the
extent to which the moral code of conduct can be interpreted as
constraining them. Alternatively, we have councillors throughout the
country who are being excluded from discussion of the very issues that
they know best and about which they have been elected to represent
their
constituents.</p><p><a name="0605163000036">Councillor
Riley and I do not expect that he should be able to vote on issues
where he has a personal or prejudicial interest. He does expect to make
a full declaration of interests. He expects also that his
representations should be made only openly and transparently. He does
not expect to undertake private lobbying or to participate in
discussions after he has made his representations. He does however
expect to have access to briefings, and to be able to ask questions and
make representations in cases where his council colleagues will be
making decisions. He said to me plainly that if he cannot persuade them
of the merits of the argument, he will understand and accept that he
has failed in his task. It is his responsibility to make the
arguments.</p><p><a name="0605163000037">The issue
is not settled; Ministers need to make progress. The outline
application for the Northstowe development, which encompasses
Longstanton, has yet to be considered and determined. Circumstances
such as Councillor Riley&#146;s will arise elsewhere in the country.
It is important that changes to the code be made as a matter of
urgency. If the code is not changed under the secondary legislation
that local government legislation permits, this negation of democracy
will carry on and, far from inspiring confidence in local
government, the code of conduct&#146;s application will bring local
government into
disrepute.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0605163000079">10.45
pm</h5><p><a name="0605163000038"><b><a name="0605163000084">The
Minister for Local Government (Mr. Phil Woolas):</b>
Congratulations are due to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire
(Mr. Lansley) on bringing to the House&#146;s attention the case of
his constituent, whose views have been represented. This case also
raises wider issues of relevance to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s other
constituents. I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for explaining
my responsibilities in this regard; it is always helpful when that
happens. I am conscious that whenever we debate parish matters,
newspaper headlines reporting our deliberations do not scream off the
presses. However, there are some 80,000 parish councils in the country,
and in my experience it is wise to take these debates very seriously,
because many councils rightly take a close interest in these
proceedings. The issues that the hon. Gentleman has raised concerning
the code of conduct apply not just to parish councillors, but to
councillors across the
board.</p><p><a name="0605163000039">I am also
grateful for the opportunity to discuss the rules of conduct for
councillors in the context of the planning regime. These rules are set
out in model codes of conduct for local authority
members&#151;including, of course, members of parish
councils&#151;with the aim of maintaining the highest standards of
the public conduct of local authority members. We consider it 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 825</b><br>important to promote such standards for parish councils, as for other
tiers of local
government.</p><p><a name="0605163000040">As has been
said, it is difficult for me to comment on individual circumstances,
but where allegations impinge on an individual planning application,
that application could be referred to the Secretary of State or to one
of her inspectors on appeal. In those circumstances, I would not wish
to say anything that might subsequently prejudice the quasi-judicial
appeal process.</p><p><a name="0605163000041">Actively promoting high
standards of behaviour among local authority members is of course an
important objective for any Government. Many men and women devote their
time and energy to the service of their communities, and the
overwhelming majority of people elected to serve as local authority
members already observe the highest standards of conduct. But it is
also important to get the balance right&#151;an issue that I will
discuss in a moment.</p><p><a name="0605163000042">We cannot disguise&#151;nobody
wishes to&#151;the fact that failings occur from time to time, and
given that tens of thousands of people are involved, that is going to
be so. However, it is worth noting that instances of elected members
falling short of the conduct expected of them are very rare indeed.
Such misconduct not only harms the community that members are elected
to serve; it can damage the wider reputation of local government and
undermine the public&#146;s trust in, and confidence in, the system
as a whole. I noted carefully the hon. Gentleman&#146;s reference to
the pendulum perhaps swinging too far, as some might see it, and to
that itself bringing the regime into disrepute. The need to maintain
public trust is just as true for parish councils as it is for other
tiers of
government.</p><p><a name="0605163000043">The
planning system involves a considerable amount of discretion, and
councillors on a planning committee may arrive at a decision based on a
variety of considerations. However, the law defines that
decision-making duty. Failure to act within the confines of these
provisions may render the council open to legal challenge by means of
judicial review. The role of an elected member on a local authority
planning committee involves balancing the need to represent the
interests of individual constituents and the community with the need to
maintain an ethic of impartial decision making on what can be, and
often are, highly controversial
proposals.</p><p><a name="0605163000044">In 1997, the
Government committed themselves to reinvigorating local democracy,
focusing on enabling councils to provide the local leadership that
their communities need and to deliver the services they want. In order
to tackle the need for a higher degree of public trust, we introduced a
new framework under the Local Government Act 2000 to promote standards
of ethical behaviour. We felt that the new framework must help to
dispel public criticism about those in public life by demonstrating
clearly that unethical behaviour is just as unacceptable to those who
have been elected as it is to the communities that they
represent.</p><p><a name="0605163000045">The
framework indicates the high standards that are expected and requires
an explicit commitment to them. Let me remind the House that the most
significant provisions of the ethical regime were: the introduction of
new statutory codes of conduct; the establishment in 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 826</b><br>each authority of a standards committee to provide support and guidance
to members on the requirements of their local code; and the creation of
what was then a new body, the Standards Board for England, to promote
high standards nationally and to investigate alleged breaches of the
code in an independent and consistent manner.</p><p><a name="0605163000046">The codes of conduct set out the
conduct that is expected of members and provide a sensible framework
for handling personal interests which should ensure that, providing
that they have no prejudicial interests, councillors can take part in
discussions and decisions and so represent their electors to the best
of their ability. From May 2002, the provisions of the codes have
applied to all councillors, and any allegations that the code has been
breached can be reported to the Standards Board, which can then decide
whether to investigate.</p><p><a name="0605163000047">The model codes provide that
members have a prejudicial interest in a matter if, as the hon.
Gentleman said, the interest is one that a member of the public would
reasonably regard as so significant as to be likely to prejudice the
member&#146;s judgment of the public interest. A member with a
prejudicial interest is required to withdraw from the meeting at which
the matter is discussed.</p><p><a name="0605163000048">The codes also provide that
members should not use their position to confer an advantage for
themselves or any other person. Various further guidance documents have
been issued to assist members in carrying out their roles in respect of
the planning regime and the need to have regard to their own personal
and prejudicial interests. Chapter 8 of the document, &#147;Probity
in Planning&#148;, which is issued by the Local Government
Association, makes it clear that councillors who have openly declared a
view on an application should not use their position to lobby other
councillors or organise a caucus to support their position. Elsewhere
in chapter 8, it is made clear that other political meetings should not
be used to reach a decision in advance of the committee which will make
the decision.</p><p><a name="0605163000049">A
document prepared by the LGA, &#147;Member engagement in planning
matters&#148;, gives similar advice. The purpose of that document is
to explain to members how they can become more engaged in discussions
without fettering their discretion. However, if they do, the guidance
is clear. It
states:</p><a name="0605163000076"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Members
who do take an active stand in support or assistance to an application
should withdraw from the planning committee deliberations. Responding
to lobbying is fully legitimate where a councillor openly admits an
interest in the outcome of deliberations and withdraws from the
discussions on which they have a particularly strong view and stands
down for the period while the item is under
discussion.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0605163000050">We
wish to make the planning system fairer and more transparent.
Accordingly, my Department continues to work with its partner bodies,
such as the Local Government Association, to produce advice and
guidance for elected members on propriety issues in planning. Indeed,
the Planning Advisory Service, which is an arm of the Improvement and
Development Agency, is financed by the Government. Its creation was one
of the benefits of the &#163;600 million in planning delivery grant
allocation made available to improve the system.</p><p><a name="0605163000051">When they were initially issued
in 2002, the model codes were generally welcomed. There were certainly 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 827</b><br>some complaints from the smaller parish and town councils, particularly
about the requirements to register interests. It was feared that a
sledgehammer was being used to crack a nut. However, many of the
concerns have been eased as councillors have grown familiar with the
conduct regime, and it now has broad support. This has been assisted by
the Standards Board&#146;s own provision of support, guidance and
training to parishes on the operation of the
system.</p><p><a name="0605163000052">It is sometimes
suggested that the introduction of the code of conduct for parishes has
caused parish councillors to resign. I took those fears very seriously,
because it is obviously important to get the balance right. However, I
am pleased to be able to tell the House that there is little or no
evidence to suggest that significant numbers of councillors have
resigned as a result of the
code.</p><p><a name="0605163000053">That
brings me to the subject of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s debate. The
recent reports of the Graham Committee and the Office of the Deputy
Prime Minister Select Committee&#151;which was so ably chaired by my
hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Chris Mole)&#151; considered the
future of the local government ethical regime. They supported the
continuing inclusion of parish councillors within that
regime.</p><p><a name="0605163000054">The conduct
regime has now been in operation for four years. We have recently
reviewed it, and our proposals for change were set out in our
discussion paper of 15 December 2005. They included proposals to make
decision making under the regime more locally based, to make the
Standards Board a more strategic regulatory body, and to make the code
of conduct simpler, clearer and more proportionate. We are hoping to
make changes to ensure that the framework meets the objectives that it
was created to achieve, and that the lessons deriving from practical
experience in operating the rules are
learned.</p><p><a name="0605163000055">As part of our
follow-up to the discussion paper, our review of the code of conduct
will take into account the recommendations on changes to the code made
by the Standards Board. These include proposals for a reduction in the
number of interests that members need to declare, and for a relaxation
of the rules relating to prejudicial interests to support the advocacy
role played by members, particularly in respect of dual-hatted
members&#151;that is, those who are members of more than one public
body.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>15 May 2006 : Column 828</b><br><p><a name="0605163000056">However, there is a continuing
need to ensure that measures are in place to provide confidence that
decisions are being made in the public interest, and that clear
conflicts of interest&#151;for example, where members stand to gain
personally from a decision over and above the gain to others in the
community&#151;will continue to be proscribed by the code of
conduct.</p><p><a name="0605163000057">We believe
that the vast majority of local councillors are honest and committed to
the service of their communities. We wish to demonstrate to local
communities that their councillors are signed up to the highest
standards of
conduct.</p><p><a name="0605163000058"><b><a name="0605163000085">Mr.
Lansley:</b> It is now some six months since the
Minister&#146;s colleague replied to a similar debate, and five
months since the Government published their discussion paper. When are
Ministers going to turn what appear&#151;in principle, at
least&#151;to be the good recommendations of the Committee on
Standards in Public Life and the Standards Board into practical
changes, by means of a statutory instrument on the model codes of
conduct?</p><p><a name="0605163000059"><b><a name="0605163000086">Mr.
Woolas:</b> That is the crux of the matter. I am as keen as
the hon. Gentleman is to get on with this. Local authorities are
looking to us to make announcements on this issue. I am also conscious
that there are other cases&#151;which I am extremely grateful that he
has not mentioned tonight&#151;that have thrown up some lessons to be
learned about the way in which we deal with these matters. I cannot
give him a specific timetable, but I will, as soon as I am in a
position to do so.</p><p><a name="0605163000060">We
need to provide assurance that standards are being maintained. That is
why the ethical regime is vital, and why it is important that all tiers
of local government, including parishes, should follow the codes of
conduct. We should also learn the lessons of the past four years and do
the best we can to ensure that there is consensus across the three
tiers of local government in regard to the changes that we are seeking
to
introduce.</p><p><a name="06051613000001"><i>Question
