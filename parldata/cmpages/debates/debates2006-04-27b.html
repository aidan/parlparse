<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60427-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Ruth Kelly): </b> 
 All children can, and should, benefit from increasingly personalised learning. We have announced a total of &#163;990&nbsp;million of additional funding by 2007&#150;08&nbsp;for that purpose. All schools will receive extra funding, but we will target those facing the greatest challenges&#151;schools with pupils from deprived backgrounds or with low prior attainment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60427-01_spnew0"><b> Jim Dobbin: </b> 
 In Heywood and Middleton, the local education authority intends to spend some of that money developing new technologies to help and support children at home, because some children have struggled in the transition from primary to secondary school. Is that the kind of project that the Secretary of State is willing to support?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60427-01_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Yes, indeed. The project in Heywood and Middleton is innovative, and my hon. Friend is right to point to the difficulties that some children face in making the transition from primary school to secondary school. Alongside the funding for personalised learning, we have recently set out plans to invest &#163;40&nbsp;million in parent support advisers, specifically to enable secondary schools quickly to identify those children who face the greatest challenges and to work with them and their 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>families in order to support them in secondary school. The scheme outlined by my hon. Friend is another interesting way to try to address those issues.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="60427-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Peter Bone  (Wellingborough)</b> 
 (Con): Will the Secretary of State help my constituents? A number of pupils have been left without any education for months on end, and I recently found out about a case in which a pupil was left for a year without any education. What measures will the Secretary of State take to improve the situation?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60427-01_spnew3"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman knows, local authorities will have a duty, which is set out in the Education and Inspections Bill, to identify all those children who are missing education and to provide them with an appropriate education and their families with a choice of education. He has made a very serious point; we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must tackle truancy, which may lead to children becoming completely disaffected. We must also provide opportunities for those children who have been excluded from school to have a decent and appropriate education, which is why our investment in pupil referral units is so important. We must continue to raise the quality of education provided in those units, so that pupils who are being educated in them achieve good results.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60427-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Barry Sheerman  (Huddersfield)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): Will my right hon. Friend take particular note of the research by the Institute for Public Policy Research on personalised learning and its effect on social mobility? Yesterday, we celebrated in the House of Commons the second anniversary of the launch of volunteer reading schemes. Both the research and the volunteer reading schemes indicate the importance of training intermediaries and we must ensure that we have the best qualified people in this country, whether they are volunteers or teachers, to make personalised learning work.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60427-01_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. He must have read the speech that I made yesterday to the IPPR on social mobility, in which I drew attention to the fact that if we have catch-up lessons for those children who start to fall behind and push to their maximum potential those children who demonstrate real ability in the classroom through genuine personalised learning, we can make a significant difference to not only the number of children who obtain five good GCSEs, but the progress that children make later in life, which relates to social mobility. He is also right to draw attention to the potential of reading schemes in primary school and later. The research conducted on reading recovery is powerful, but so is the evidence on synthetic phonics, which is why we have emphasised that children should be taught synthetic phonics first and fast, which will not only improve the quality of reading, but help to close the class gap.

 Hosting the world skills championship in London will offer world skills a global stage, and it will also bring economic and social rewards to the UK. The brochure links world skills 2011&nbsp;with the 2012&nbsp;Olympics. That link between excellence in sport and excellence in skills forms a unique offer to world skills, and it will help us to change public attitudes in this country about skills. I should add that the Government are match funding and underwriting the whole event.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60427-01_spnew6"><b> Ms Smith: </b> 
 I am sure that the whole House will join the Minister in hoping that the UK bid triumphs in Melbourne in May. Will my hon. Friend tell the House what role he thinks that world skills 2011&nbsp;could play in meeting the distinctive skills needs of each region of the UK?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60427-01_spnew7"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 I attended the world skills championship in Finland last year. It was genuinely inspiring as we saw young people competing to demonstrate their skills at the highest level, benchmarking themselves against the rest of the world. I hope that we have full support across this House for our bid to host the championship. Whatever the result in Melbourne on 10&nbsp;May, we intend to re-energise skills competitions over the next five years so that we really celebrate success. We are going to create a new framework at local, regional, national and international levels to ensure that we raise the profile of skills, raise aspirations and improve supply. In Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and all the English regions, we can target skills competitions around skills needs in the different regions and nations of this country.

<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60427-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. John Hayes  (South Holland and The Deepings)</b> 
 (Con): We welcome the bid to stage the world skills championship. However, the Minister knows that, as the leaked report has shown, Britain faces a skills crisis, particularly a language skills crisis. A Secondary Heads Association survey reveals that the number of post-14&nbsp;pupils studying languages is plummeting and only a fifth of 15-year-olds now study a foreign language. A Government-sponsored report shows that Britain is bottom of the class in Europe for language skills&#151;28th out of 28&nbsp;countries. In Olympic terms, the Minister is the Eddie the Eagle of language skills. Given that failure, in what specific ways did the Government take account of language skills when designing the new vocational diplomas?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60427-01_spnew9"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The Education and Inspections Bill, which the hon. Gentleman and I are currently discussing as we take it through Parliament, will give us the opportunity to discuss the future of the national curriculum, including the importance that the Government place on encouraging young people to take up language opportunities, not least in primary schools as well as secondary schools, and to make modern foreign languages attractive and interesting for young people across the piece.
</p>

 (Lab): What progress she is making with her proposals for extended schools; and if she will make a statement. [66206]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60427-02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Children and Families  (Beverley Hughes): </b> 
 More than 6,000&nbsp;schools are engaged with the extended schools development programme. The strong engagement of schools and local authorities means that we are making good progress towards our target of all schools offering access to extended services by 2010. The early evaluation that we have carried out demonstrates that extended services can have a positive impact on the attendance and motivation of pupils, enhance children&#039;s and families&#039; access to services and, if well managed, relieve pressure on teachers&#039; workloads.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60427-02_spnew0"><b> Helen Goodman: </b> 
 I am most grateful to the Minister for that report on the excellent progress that is being made on the extended schools programme. Every day, children need the opportunity to play and to relax. Is she aware of the work being done by the National Association of Toy and Leisure Libraries to encourage games clubs in schools, with lots of ideas for outdoor games, card games and board games&#151;every kind of possibility&#151;and what is she doing to support such activities?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60427-02_spnew1"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend that particularly, but not exclusively, for young children, play is a very important part of the concept of extended activities in schools. Indeed, the prospectus that we published made it clear that we want play to be an important aspect. Children should not just have study support and curriculum-focused activities at the end of the day; we want them to relax and unwind in a secure and stimulating environment. Schools will be talking to parents and children as they plan what is required for their extended activities, and I am sure that parents will want that to happen. Because extended schools activities are about working in partnership with other organisations, and not schools doing it themselves, I am sure that the National Association of Toy and Leisure Libraries will have a big part to play in ensuring that extended activities can include play.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60427-02_spnew2"><b> Sarah Teather  (Brent, East)</b> 
 (LD): The Minister will be aware of the Headspace survey that suggested that 37&nbsp;per cent. of head teachers had no intention of offering the extended schools scheme. Does she think that that might be because the money provided by the Government is enough only to pay for one extra teacher per school?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60427-02_spnew3"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 No, I do not. We are on a journey with extended schools. As I said, more than 6,000&nbsp;schools are working with us directly to provide extended services. The baseline survey that we conducted at the outset showed that approximately 95&nbsp;per cent. of secondary schools and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 695</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>87&nbsp;per cent. of primary schools already offered extended activities after school to some extent. There is therefore a great deal of interest and commitment. Extended activities help schools to maximise the attainment of their children and support parents in doing that. Schools that have provided extended activities for some time are convinced of the benefits. I am sure that, as we develop the programme, that will be the case for all schools. The money provided&#151;&#163;840&nbsp;million so far&#151;is for start-up costs. Schools need to ensure that they sustain activities and we will support them with a charging regime to ensure that they do.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60427-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering)</b> 
 (Con): What assurance can the Minister give that the &#163;840&nbsp;million will go to schools and not be tied up in local education authorities? What assessment has been made of the extra burdens on head teachers, teachers and school governors of implementing the project?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60427-02_spnew5"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 A significant proportion of the &#163;840&nbsp;million goes directly to schools, with the remainder going through local authorities. Schools will receive a substantial amount of money directly from the Department to support the development. The money is not for supporting activities in the long-term, but for the development of such activities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_o1">We commissioned research from Manchester university on the impact on schools, and there has been an interim report. One finding is that if the project is managed in the right way, it reduces the burden on teachers. By that I mean that provided that head teachers do not take the view that they have to do everything themselves&#151;we do not want them to take that view&#151;but garner the support and opportunities offered by other organisations in the locality, including voluntary organisations and child care providers who want to work with them, the impact on schools can be beneficial in releasing teachers for their core job, which is teaching.

 I thank the Secretary of State for that reply. She knows that I am an enthusiastic supporter of academies and trust schools.

<a name="stpa_o2">The allegations that the hon. Gentleman just made in the House have never been brought to my attention. I am happy to consider them. If he writes to me, I shall do that and give him a full response.

<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60427-02_spnew8"><b> Sir Peter Soulsby  (Leicester, South)</b> 
 (Lab): Is the Secretary of State aware of the likely disastrous effects on existing schools and the education of their pupils of establishing an academy on the site of the former Mary Linwood school in Leicester? Will she ensure a full and open review of such effects on other schools before any further academies are set up?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="60427-02_spnew9"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 We have looked at the evidence closely. Only yesterday, I published evidence that showed that the value added&#151;the progress made by pupils in academy schools between the ages of 14&nbsp;and 15&#151;was greater than that in comparable schools. That has happened in the first two years of their operation, and our initial evidence suggests that, while academies have been improving pupils&#039; results, the results in neighbouring schools have been improving at the same time. I therefore assure my hon. Friend that academies will start to tackle ingrained educational disadvantage while other local schools start to improve their results, too.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="60427-02_spnew10"><b> Sammy Wilson  (East Antrim)</b> 
 (DUP): Is the Secretary of State disappointed by the negative attitude of teachers&#039; unions to the proposal to build more academies, given that it has brought more private and public money into the school system, especially for some schools that are experiencing problems? Will she give an assurance that the negative attitude of the teachers&#039; unions will not lead to a Government retreat on the initiative?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="60427-02_spnew11"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I can certainly give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. We are completely committed to our goal of establishing 200&nbsp;academies, and we are moving faster than we would have anticipated at this stage, with more than 100&nbsp;already up and running or in the pipeline. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the evidence, he will see that the staff who work in the academies are completely convinced of the difference that they are making to the achievements of young people, and that the sponsors of the academies are contributing to educational attainment. About 84&nbsp;per cent. of the teaching staff in those schools say that the sponsor has made a positive difference to the values, the ethos and the achievement of the young people in them. I can give the hon. Gentleman a definite assurance on that.

 (Lab): If the full programme of 200&nbsp;academies is implemented, will they all be built on the basis of &#163;20&nbsp;million coming from the state and &#163;2&nbsp;million coming from the sponsor, or are other funding models being considered?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="60427-02_spnew13"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Of course, all these questions are kept under review. At the moment, we have a system in which 10&nbsp;per cent. or thereabouts of the capital cost of an academy is contributed by a sponsor. However, the important aspect of the academies project is not the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;financial contribution of the sponsor. It is the time, the energy and the commitment that the sponsor gives 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 697</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to the project that can make such a big difference. Indeed, in taking the trust school programme forward, we are trying to bring the commitment of other external partners to the education of state school pupils in the most disadvantaged schools in our inner cities and most deprived areas, so that they can benefit from that commitment too.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="60427-02_spnew15"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I do not, and there is no evidence whatever that that is happening. That allegation is most frequently made against the Emmanuel schools run by Sir Peter Vardy. Ofsted has inspected those schools on numerous occasions and one of them was yesterday given its third outstanding report. Ofsted has looked specifically at their science curriculum and at whether creationism was being taught in those schools, and it has concluded that it is not.

One of the many freedoms that academies enjoy is the freedom to employ their own staff. To do that, however, they depend on the Government to give them full information about the staff that they wish to employ. Among the 1,000&nbsp;foreign convicted criminals released by the Home Office, there were drug dealers, violent offenders and 21&nbsp;sex offenders, some of whom had been accused of offences against children.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o55"><a name="60427-04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Phil Hope): </b> 
 We believe that non-vocational adult learning increases motivation to learn and self-confidence and improves family and community relationships. It also brings wider benefits such as improved health, greater tolerance and reduced crime. That is why the Government have committed some &#163;210&nbsp;million to personal and community development learning in 2006&#150;07&nbsp;and 2007&#150;08.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o56"><a name="60427-04_spnew0"><b> Dr. Cable: </b> 
 Do Ministers have memories? Do they not remember that 15&nbsp;years ago they campaigned alongside women&#039;s institutes against what they described as the mindless philistinism of the then Conservative Government, who sought to introduce the policy that this Government have now adopted: channelling resources much more into narrow vocational skills&#151;which employers are often happy to pay for themselves&#151;and away from the popular, broad-based non-vocational courses greatly favoured by many people, particularly older adult learners?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o57"><a name="60427-04_spnew1"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 Yes, I do remember the philistinism of the Conservatives when they were in power; I was a county councillor at the time and I had to deal with some of the implications of the appalling cuts that they inflicted on our education system. Broadly speaking, we are focusing our adult learning priorities on level 2&nbsp;qualifications&#151;for which, as we heard earlier, there is a great need in this country&#151;skills for life, and 16&nbsp;to 18-year-olds. That is not to say, however, that we are not investing in adult learning. In 1996&nbsp;some 78,000&nbsp;older learners were taking adult learning classes; by 2005&nbsp;that figure had doubled to approximately 147,000, so there 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

If people, including the Liberal Democrats, value short courses in stand-up comedy&#151;they are available&#151;and tarot card reading, they should be able to do them.

 Yes.

On the wider roll-out of our priorities, we see evidence of colleges&#151;City college Brighton and Hove is an example&#151;that are able to increase both fees and participation rates. We are asking colleges about this issue and we signalled the direction of travel in successive White Papers, including the recently published further education White Paper on raising skills and improving life chances. I expect local colleges to take the opportunity provided by the roll-out of the train to gain programme, in particular, to increase fees and participation rates, and start providing much better delivery of the skills training that our employers require.

 (Con): The Government&#039;s policy of focusing further education funding on skills for life and level 2&nbsp;qualifications has meant that courses in FE colleges suitable for adults with severe learning disabilities, which are often non-vocational, are being cut, because they do not neatly tick the boxes for the Government&#039;s national priorities. I recently met a group of young men with learning difficulties who attend many different colleges, including those in Reading, Newbury and Alton. This year, all their courses have been cut. Does the Minister feel that it is right to take away these men&#039;s opportunities for more independent living&#151;and perhaps even employment&#151;or will he join me in looking for ways to change what he will doubtless agree is an unintended consequence of the current policy?

<p><a name="st_o61"><a name="60427-04_spnew5"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 It is not an unintended consequence of Government policy&#151;nor, indeed, an intended one&#151;to cut such training and courses for the client group to which the hon. Lady referred. Adults with learning difficulties and disabilities are a priority for the Government, as we have made clear to the Learning and Skills Council. Indeed, we spent &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion in 2004&#150;05&nbsp;on meeting the needs of some 641,000&nbsp;learners with learning difficulties and disabilities. This issue is a priority for the Government and will remain so.

<p><a name="st_o64"><a name="60427-04_spnew7"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 Yes, I can. The pay and conditions of support staff are determined at local level so that they can fit local circumstances. First, many local authorities are reviewing the pay of, and undertaking job evaluations for, support staff in the light of the single status agreement. Secondly, the Government are working directly with social partners to determine how best to ensure fair play and rewards for staff. Thirdly, we have also extended the remit of the Training and Development Agency for Schools to encompass some of the issues around career pathways and career escalators. Finally, we have developed new vocational qualifications and opportunities for support staff to improve their qualifications and their career development while they are employed.

 As I just said, decisions about employing classroom assistants and the way in which they are deployed are matters for local determination, but we are receiving increasing evidence from schools and local authorities that this is an important source of support for teachers, not least as we move towards personalised learning, which schools will have to adopt if they are to maximise the attainment of all children and, in particular, reduce inequalities for low achievers. However, as I have just said, the Training and Development Agency for Schools now has an extended remit and is beginning to undertake a much more systematic survey of evidence on the impact that classroom assistants have on the important agenda of children&#039;s levels of attainment.

Those include courses such as forensics and music, forensics and drama, and forensics and a foreign language, but apparently those courses do not provide the sort of qualification needed to have a career in forensics. Similarly, a degree in media studies is less likely than a degree in chemistry or history to get someone a job in the BBC.

 That is the old chestnut about media studies again. In terms of employability, media studies has one of the best track records for degree qualifications. The hon.

Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that cautioning is not an appropriate sentence in rape cases? Can he give an example of such cases where a caution has been given? Will he reassess the sentences applied at present&#151;such as cautioning, which in many instances does not fit the crime&#151;with a view to reviewing the minimum sentences given, so that those involved in such rape cases can feel that justice has been done?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o82"><a name="60427-05_spmin3"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 A caution is certainly not an appropriate disposal for most rape cases. The proper sentence is a substantial term of imprisonment. Indeed, the average term of imprisonment in rape cases is seven and a half years. The use of a caution is rare and very exceptional. I have asked for some examples of where it has been used and have been given the following examples. A man had been secretly tape-recorded claiming to have raped his sister some years earlier and his sister denied it; a 14-year-old with learning difficulties was alleged to have had sex with a boy and the victim did not want to go to court; a 12-year-old boy encouraged a younger boy to give him oral sex while playing a game of truth or dare with a wider group of boys present; and one offender was a 17-year-old with a mental age of nine. Those are indeed rare and very exceptional cases. A caution can appear on a criminal record in certain cases, and a person may be put on the sex offenders register. However, in most rape cases a prison sentence is the appropriate disposal.

<p><a name="st_o85"><a name="60427-05_spmin5"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 Following work with the Crown Prosecution Service, I issued on 29&nbsp;March a consultation paper entitled &quot;Convicting Rapists and Protecting Victims&quot;, which sets out four proposals that aim to deliver more successful prosecutions by further strengthening the legal framework and improving our care for the victims of rape.

 I thank my hon. and learned Friend for that response. Is he aware of the Amnesty International survey carried out last year?

<p><a name="st_o87"><a name="60427-05_spmin6"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 I have indeed seen the Amnesty survey, and it makes disturbing reading. There is a Home Office campaign that seeks to challenge those attitudes. In particular, it highlights the potential penalties and people&#039;s absolute right to say no to sex. The proposals that I am currently consulting on will reduce the barriers to prosecution and improve the care of victims. They seek to strengthen the law on consent, enable expert evidence to be called, bring first reports of rape before a jury and allow the greater use of videoed evidence by victims. Securing convictions in rape cases is always difficult, but these proposals will assist the prosecution and, indeed, victims.

The <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> has launched a major campaign to ensure that serious sex offenders serve their full sentences in such cases. The perpetrator of that crime struck against Attracta Harron after being released early after a horrific rape. Will the Solicitor-General ensure that this matter is taken very seriously?

<p><a name="st_o89"><a name="60427-05_spmin7"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 I am aware of the case to which the hon. Gentleman refers, and it is indeed a very serious, difficult and regrettable one. It is a fact that the average sentence for rape convictions is seven and a half years&#039; imprisonment. Many offenders receive substantially more than that for the most serious offences. It is important that we get the balance right in dealing with these cases and ensure that people who are a danger to the public are properly dealt with. I know that my right hon.

If individuals are affected adversely by its application&#151;no doubt like those involved with the 488&nbsp;payments he mentions&#151;they have to beg a faceless official to give them relief.

<p><a name="st_o92"><a name="60427-06_spmin1"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 Although the Treasury Solicitors administer bona vacantia, the policy in relation to it is a matter for the Department for Constitutional Affairs. The current arrangements for making discretionary payments are flexible and, by and large, seem to work relatively well. They were recently revised and updated, and are kept under constant review to make sure that they reflect changes in society and enable people to get what they are entitled to more easily. Of the 488&nbsp;cases, 238&nbsp;involved people claiming estates to which they were legally entitled, after the Treasury Solicitor had administered them. The decisions were not entirely discretionary. The rules are rather old, but by and large they work because they have been updated over time.

 On comparable arrangements, requests to the United States take an average of approximately five months to conclude and those to the UK take about seven months, so we take slightly longer. The standard for extradition in the United States under the Bill of Rights is one probable cause; that is part of the constitution, so we have to respect it. We think that our standard of requesting information is appropriate. The systems are slightly different, but very similar. There was an unfairness before 2003&nbsp;in that the UK required a prima facie case, which was a much higher standard, but we have rebalanced the situation and it is much fairer than it ever was.

<p><a name="st_o97"><a name="60427-06_spmin4"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 As for reciprocity, it is always difficult to balance the different ways in which decisions are made under different legal systems.

Yesterday, the usually calm and cautious members of the Royal College of Nursing barracked and heckled the Health Secretary, raising their opposition to job cuts among nurses. When we have raised job cuts among nurses and doctors in the Chamber, the Leader of the House has consistently refused our calls for a statement by the Health Secretary or a debate on the NHS.

<a name="60427-11_time0"><h5>12.17&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_62"><a name="60427-11_spmin1"><b>The Solicitor-General  (Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien): </b> 
 With the leave of the House, I wish repeat a statement made in another place by my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General. I wish to inform the House of decisions taken by the Crown Prosecution Service and the Army Prosecuting Authority in a case that has attracted a great deal of media attention. The case concerns an incident in Iraq on 24&nbsp;March 2003&nbsp;that resulted in the fatal shootings of Sergeant Steven Roberts, formerly of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, and Mr Zaher Zabti Zaher, an Iraqi.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_34">The Crown Prosecution Service has now informed me that, after a full investigation of the case and a careful review of the evidence, there is insufficient evidence to institute criminal proceedings in this case. The Army Prosecuting Authority has also had the opportunity to examine the evidence in this case, including that obtained by the Metropolitan police, and has decided that there is insufficient evidence to charge any of the servicemen with military offences.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_35">The CPS has produced a review note explaining its decision, which has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. As appears from that note, on the evidence available when the Attorney-General asked the CPS to consider the case, it might have been perceived that British soldiers had shot an unarmed Iraqi civilian, Mr.&nbsp;Zaher, a number of times, even after he had been severely injured and was in no position to pose a threat to anyone. In the course of firing at Mr. Zaher, two bullets had struck Sergeant Roberts, who was killed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_36">At the request of the CPS, the Metropolitan police carried out further inquiries, which resulted in the interview of five US soldiers who had witnessed part of the incident, a detailed statement from an Iraqi witness, and an autopsy on the body of the deceased Iraqi citizen. As its review note states, the CPS believes that it now has the fullest account of what occurred, although the passage of time has undoubtedly adversely affected the quality of some of that evidence. As it also explained, there are some differences in the accounts given.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_37">I will now set out the essence of the account on which the CPS, having considered the totality of the evidence, has proceeded. I quote:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;On Sunday 24&nbsp;March 2003&nbsp;a troop of three Challenger battle tanks, part of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, were involved in a road block on the outskirts of Az Zubayr, Iraq, to stop and search vehicles for weapons.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">Shortly after 6.00&nbsp;am, Mr Zaher approached the tanks throwing rocks, firstly at the tanks and then at Sergeant Roberts who was standing alone outside his tank. Sergeant Roberts put out his hand, apparently as a signal for Mr Zaher to stop, but he did not do so. Sergeant Roberts drew his pistol and aimed it at Mr Zaher but although it appears that he fired one shot, the pistol malfunctioned and Mr Zaher continued to approach him, throwing more rocks. Sergeant Roberts apparently tried to clear the jam as Mr Zaher advanced.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">A soldier in one of the tanks opened fire, apparently as warning shots, but Mr Zaher did not stop. Soldiers from two of the tanks then fired a number of shots at Mr Zaher. One of those weapons was set to fire at targets a considerable distance away and was not accurate at close range. Although Mr Zaher was hit and severely injured in the arm, two of the bullets struck Sergeant Roberts in the torso and he fell to the floor, fatally wounded. As soldiers dismounted from the tanks to give assistance to Sergeant Roberts, 

<br>&nbsp;<br></ul>



<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 726</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br><ul>Mr Zaher got up holding a rock and started towards him again. One soldier, who had gone to assist Sergeant Roberts, said he feared that Mr Zaher was about to attack again so he fired his pistol several times and Mr Zaher again fell to the floor. According to some of the soldiers, despite his injuries, Mr Zaher again got up to advance on Sergeant Roberts, and holding a rock. The soldier who was attending to Sergeant Roberts, perceived that Mr Zaher still posed a threat and directed another soldier to shoot Mr Zaher. On this occasion he did not get up. British medical staff attended and Sergeant Roberts and Mr Zaher were declared dead at the scene.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_38">I now want to turn to the circumstances of the investigation of this case. Shortly after the incident, the special investigations branch of the Royal Military Police&#151;the SIB&#151;undertook an early sudden death criminal investigation and produced a short report. It said that the SIB was unable to examine the scene or gather forensic evidence, although photos of the location were taken five days later. The incident was also investigated by the Army accident prevention and investigation team to determine whether any immediate steps could be taken to improve systems and procedures. On 4&nbsp;July 2003, the commanding officer of the soldiers involved in the incident decided that no further investigation of the incident was necessary. That decision followed advice from an Army Legal Services officer who had read the first SIB report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_39">However, subsequently, on 18&nbsp;July 2003, the head of the SIB concluded that the case had not been fully investigated. He was concerned about gaps in the evidence and, after discussion with the Army Prosecuting Authority, decided to reopen the investigation and seek a second legal opinion on the case. Attempts by the head of the SIB to reopen the&nbsp;investigation were resisted by the 1 (UK) Armoured Division chain of command on the basis of the original legal advice. One issue that loomed large was whether the prosecution would have to establish conclusively at the onset of the trial that Mr. Zaher was not a combatant. It was also said that, were a case to proceed, soldiers could rely on the defence that they were acting in self-defence under the rules of engagement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_40">In fact, as article 50&nbsp;of protocol 1&nbsp;to the Geneva convention 1977&nbsp;makes clear, if there is doubt about whether a person is a civilian, that person should be considered to be a civilian. On 7&nbsp;August 2003, a more senior officer of the Army Legal Services unequivocally advised the chain of command that the investigation should be reopened. A further investigation was required because: the British soldiers who had fired shots during the incident had not been interviewed under caution; witness statements had not been taken from the American soldiers or the Iraqi witness; a further ballistics investigation was required to ascertain which soldiers had fired shots; and there had been no post-mortem of Mr. Zaher&#039;s body.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_41">The chain of command continued to receive conflicting advice from the Army Legal Services, but on 11&nbsp;September 2003&nbsp;the chain of command agreed with the head of the SIB that there should be a further criminal investigation, on the understanding that the British soldiers involved in the incident would not be interviewed under caution at that stage. In February 2004, the chain of command received additional advice from the senior Army Legal Services lawyer on whether Mr. Zaher was to be regarded as a civilian or a combatant. Also, in February 2004, the chain of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 727</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>command agreed that the SIB should continue its investigation in the most appropriate way according to its professional judgement. Soldiers who had been at the incident were then interviewed under caution by the SIB.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_42">On 3&nbsp;August 2004, the head of the Army Prosecuting Authority wrote to the Attorney-General, as the superintending Minister of both the APA and the CPS, advising that this case should be dealt with in the civil jurisdiction. The military and UK civilian courts have concurrent jurisdiction over a whole range of serious offences allegedly committed by UK nationals overseas. He was concerned about the considerable time that had elapsed between the incident and the chain of command permitting a full investigation by the SIB.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para9">
<a name="stpa_43">The Attorney-General agreed with the head of the APA, after consulting the Director of Public Prosecutions, that the case should be transferred to the civilian jurisdiction. The Attorney-General was concerned that the intervention by the chain of command, and the delays in the case, could have led to the defence lawyers raising abuse of process arguments had the soldiers been charged with criminal offences. An acquittal by a military court, following a successful abuse of process argument by the defence, might have been perceived by some as a final act of the military to cover up any possible wrongdoing by the British soldiers involved in the incident. Such perceptions would not have been in the interest of the soldiers and might have damaged the reputation of the military justice system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para10">
<a name="stpa_44">Once the case had been transferred to the civilian jurisdiction in October 2004, the CPS concluded that further investigations were essential and the Metropolitan police took over the investigation. The Metropolitan police had to carry out its investigation in the difficult circumstances that prevailed in Iraq. During that time, the body of Mr. Zaher was exhumed and an autopsy was undertaken. The American soldiers were interviewed, a further ballistics report was obtained, and efforts began in earnest to discover whether the local population could help the police with their inquiries. After the Metropolitan police had completed its investigation in February 2006, all the available evidence was reviewed by the CPS, following advice from Treasury counsel in March 2006.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para11">
<a name="stpa_45">The CPS, having been satisfied that the Metropolitan police had completed all inquiries that could be undertaken, concluded that there was insufficient evidence to convict any of the British soldiers of the deaths of Mr. Zaher and Sergeant Roberts. The reason for that was that the evidence of those soldiers involved in the shooting was that Mr. Zaher was attacking Sergeant Roberts and that they acted to defend him. The conclusion of investigations shows that, while there were inconsistencies in accounts provided by them, British soldiers at the scene who witnessed the incident broadly support that version. The statements provided by the American witnesses and the forensic evidence did not in substance undermine the accounts of the British servicemen. Mr. Miz El Subaiyih, the single Iraqi witness, gave a different account of the incident, making no reference to Sergeant Roberts being shot and referred only to the shooting of Mr. Zaher.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para12">
<a name="stpa_46">The Attorney-General is wholly satisfied that the decision to transfer this exceptional case to the civilian system was the right action to take in the particular 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 728</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>circumstances of the case. He also believes that it would have been better if there had been an earlier full investigation, as the head of the SIB and the senior advisory lawyer unequivocally recommended. Only after a full investigation had been completed were the prosecutors in a position to make informed decisions. However, I wish to make it abundantly clear that there is no suggestion that the chain of command acted unlawfully.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para13">
<a name="stpa_47">The difficulties associated with the initial stages of this case should not detract from the fact that the case has now been fully investigated. The full investigation has established that there is no realistic prospect of conviction. I very much regret the stress that any delay must have caused Mrs. Roberts, Mr. Zaher&#039;s relatives and the soldiers and their families. This case has taken a significant period to conclude but further measures have been put in place to ensure that service cases are better handled in future. I am assured by my ministerial colleagues that the Ministry of Defence has provided additional resources for investigations in Iraq, including more trained investigators to deal with the most serious cases, and additional clerical support and equipment.


</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para14">
<a name="stpa_48">In addition, Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate of constabulary will soon begin a thematic inspection of the SIB, and will report later this year. The Attorney-General has encouraged the service prosecuting authorities to work closely with service investigators to improve the quality of investigations and to reduce delay. The Attorney-General has also discussed these issues with the Judge Advocate-General, who has introduced new directions hearings and which are reducing delay.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para15">
<a name="stpa_49">I am pleased to inform the House that the military police and the APA prosecutors are now, as a matter of standard practice, working closely together from the outset of investigations in serious cases. One advantage of that approach is that the investigators now receive early legal advice from independent APA prosecutors on the weight of evidence and on what further inquiries need to be undertaken before a decision is reached on whether there is sufficient evidence to charge a suspect. That approach, together with a provision in the Armed Forces Bill, will help to avoid the delays that took place in this case. The Bill makes it clear that when the military police consider that there is sufficient evidence to charge a suspect with a serious criminal offence, the case must be referred to the director of service prosecutions for an independent legal decision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-11_para16">
<a name="stpa_50">Some 100,000&nbsp;servicemen and women have served on Operation Telic. Only a very small number have been accused of incidents involving the alleged ill-treatment of Iraqi civilians. Where there is an allegation of wrongdoing and there is supporting evidence following investigation, charges will be brought. Our troops in Iraq continue to perform outstandingly, but they are not above the law.
</p>

<a name="stpa_51">Today, our sympathies must of course go to all the families involved, but particularly to the family of Sergeant Roberts.

 Let me begin by echoing the Solicitor-General&#039;s expressions of sympathy for the family of Sergeant Roberts, and indeed for that of Mr. Zaher, in this tragic series of

<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 729</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>events. I thank the Solicitor-General for early sight of his statement&#151;all the more because the first indication I had that the statement would be made was in an e-mail timed at 1.14&nbsp;this morning, which rather suggests that the Attorney-General and his Department were left a little in the dark by the Government&#039;s business managers on how today&#039;s business would be conducted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_52">The Solicitor-General&#039;s statement, and the CPS report that accompanied it, were extremely thorough, illuminating and helpful in explaining what happened. I am entirely satisfied that the Attorney-General has acted completely properly in this matter. In the light of that, I hope that the Solicitor-General will take in good part the points that I think need to be raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_53">Does the Solicitor-General agree that what emerges most clearly from the CPS report, after two lengthy investigations of the matter&#151;one through Army Legal Services and the SIB between 2003&nbsp;and 2004, and the second by the police and the CPS&#151;is that the original conclusion and assessment by the first SIB report and the commanding officer was, in fact, entirely correct? This was an incident in which soldiers acted to protect a comrade, Sergeant Roberts, who was under attack from Mr. Zaher. The incident took place in difficult circumstances and with tragic consequences, but no one could possibly say that there was any imputation of criminality. In that context, it is perhaps a little unfortunate that as lawyers we must resort to the expression &quot;insufficient evidence to prosecute&quot;. As the Solicitor-General may agree, on the facts given it is difficult to see that this was anything other than a tragic series of events initiated by Mr. Zaher&#039;s behaviour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_54">I am glad that the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General have acknowledged concern about the length of time that this matter has taken. Part of it&#151;a longer period&#151;was during the time in which the Attorney-General was seized of the matter, but I accept that it was an investigation in difficult circumstances. I hope that the Solicitor-General can provide some reassurance that he is satisfied that the police investigation was conducted as expeditiously as possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_55">Does the Solicitor-General agree that what we should strive for in cases such as this is prompt and thorough investigation by the SIB, through the APA, when the specialist nature of its skills can properly reflect the extremely challenging environment in which soldiers are operating, in what in this instance was a combat zone during the initial stages of hostilities in Iraq? May we be reassured that the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General are satisfied that the new structures that they have established will work to enable the SIB and the APA to provide an efficient and effective service?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_56">The Solicitor-General may agree with me that it is clear that there were inconsistencies in the approach initially, which left the Army chain of command in considerable difficulty over what line to adopt. What we ought, and hope, to see in future is a fairly seamless process whereby such matters can be dealt with in the military sphere, and intervention by the Attorney-General and the police is very rarely needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_57">I realise that this may fall a little outside the Solicitor-General&#039;s province, but it is pretty plain from the CPS report that the disquiet that has been expressed about 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 730</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the circumstances in which the troops found themselves at the time must remain in question. The use of tank crews in a semi-infantry role to carry out what amounted to a form of crowd control, at a time when they were engaged in intense hostilities&#151;and had been so very recently&#151;and with some equipment that was described in the CPS report as totally unsuitable for the circumstances in which they found themselves&#151;we also know that body armour was deficient in the case of Sergeant Roberts&#151;must give rise to anxieties. I very much hope that the Solicitor-General will be able to communicate those anxieties to his colleagues in the Ministry of Defence and that we may be able to hear more from them about that aspect of the matter in due course.
</p>








<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60427-12_spmin0"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for the way in which he has responded, and particularly for his comments about the &quot;thorough, illuminating and helpful&quot; CPS report and his comment that the Attorney-General had acted properly throughout. He has indeed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_58">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that this was a tragic series of events. He asked whether the original conclusion was correct. That is so, in the sense that the conclusion has been the same from the start, but conclusions should be reached on the basis of a full and proper investigation of the evidence. That is the way in which we should do it in this country, and that is the way in which our armed forces seek to operate. That is why, when questions were raised about the way in which this case had proceeded, it was necessary for the matter to be dealt with by the CPS and the Metropolitan police. Now, no one can argue that there was not a full and proper investigation, as indeed there was. It is in the interests of everyone, including the military, that such incidents are fairly and properly investigated and that our armed forces are clearly seen to be subject to the rule of law. Nothing could be more damaging to the reputation of our armed forces, and more likely to provoke hostility towards them, than the suggestion that they can get away with criminal acts of violence against civilians with impunity and without full and proper investigations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_59">The hon. Gentleman asked about the thoroughness of SIB investigations and whether the Attorney-General and I were satisfied that the procedures now being introduced were adequate to ensure proper investigation. The key change is that in future the prosecutors in serious cases will be involved from an early stage. That will enable them to give advice and guidance to the SIB about what evidence needs to be collected and what procedures are necessary, so that&#151;we hope&#151;investigations will proceed much more effectively in future. We are satisfied that those improvements are very important. In addition, the report on the SIB by Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate of constabulary, which is due later this year, will provide important guidance on what improvement the SIB needs to make internally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_60">The hon. Gentleman asked about the delays. They are indeed regrettable. There were clearly differences of view in Army Legal Services: our lawyers, quite honestly, had formed different opinions. The Army chain of command was therefore subject to a degree of different advice, which is regrettable.

<a name="stpa_61">The Metropolitan police investigation was obviously hampered by the circumstances in Iraq. A particular difficulty was that the Metropolitan police had to secure the confidence of Mr. Zaher&#039;s family in order to have access to his body and conduct an autopsy. That took some time. We did not get the autopsy results&#151;in final form, at least&#151;until February.

As we all know, it has taken the three years and a month that has passed since those tragic deaths&#151;it is almost three years to the day since Sergeant Roberts&#039; funeral&#151;to resolve this issue. However, I welcome the fact that a clear conclusion has now been reached.

<a name="stpa_63">I, too, recognise that in investigating these events and the possibility of bringing criminal proceedings in the complicated and difficult circumstances that surrounded the outset of this conflict, it would have been very unfair to judge that these soldiers, in doing what they thought they were duty bound to do&#151;to support their colleagues&#151;should be prosecuted in the criminal courts. They will be hugely relieved, as will their colleagues serving in Iraq and elsewhere. We pay tribute to the work that they do, usually without fear for themselves, and their willingness to take risks.

That must be the major lesson for all concerned to learn. Secondly, like the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, I was slightly concerned by the Attorney-General&#039;s use of the phrase &quot;insufficient evidence to prosecute&quot;. Were the same two tests that would normally be applied in any civilian case&#151;whether there was a more than 50&nbsp;per cent. chance of conviction, and whether it was in the public interest to proceed&#151;applied in this case?

<a name="stpa_66">My final point links to one mentioned by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. On the responsibilities of the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, are they seized of issues relating to a duty on the British Army and its management to ensure that service personnel go into the front line properly equipped? Is there such a duty of care, and will it always be fulfilled by ensuring that personnel have the kit, equipment, clothing and other materiel to allow them to do their duty safely and properly?

 I join the hon. Gentleman in paying tribute to our armed forces. We ask a lot of them in very difficult circumstances, particularly in Iraq; throughout their period there, they have done Britain proud. As I have said, there are very few cases where an investigation has been necessary because our forces&#039; behaviour has been outstanding. However, it is right that these investigations take place expeditiously. On the delays about which the hon. Gentleman asked, we believe that the new procedures will speed up the process. The Judge Advocate-General has instituted new court procedures, which are already paying dividends by ensuring that courts martial are heard more quickly. Moreover, as a result of this and other cases, the SIB has improved its procedures. I hope that the HMIC report, which we should receive in due course, will provide the advice that the SIB needs to enable it further to improve its carrying out of such investigations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_67">The hon. Gentleman asked whether the same tests are applied in considering whether to prosecute, and the answer is yes. In this case, there was no realistic prospect of a conviction, so in a sense the public interest test did not need to be applied. The evidence did not substantiate initiating proceedings. On the link between Army and civilian courts, this Parliament has created circumstances in which it is appropriate for cases to be transferred from one jurisdiction to another. We firmly believe that the military courts system is very good. It has delivered justice very fairly across a range of issues, and we continue to have substantial faith in it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_68">The hon. Gentleman asked about the duties of the Ministry of Defence, which is of course obliged to ensure that it provides soldiers serving in Iraq and elsewhere with proper equipment. The question of kevlar plates and the wearing of the appropriate protective jacket played no part in the legal decisions. Although the pathologist&#039;s evidence is not conclusive, it does suggest that, because Sergeant Roberts was shot in the torso, a protective jacket might have made a difference and might have saved his life. My colleagues in the MOD are taking account of that issue. I should point out that the MOD is not a body corporate, of course, and has Crown immunity in relation to such matters. That, in a sense, deals with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about legal duties.

 As the Solicitor-General will know, Mrs. Roberts is a constituent of mine. All our thoughts go out to her and her family at what has obviously been an incredibly distressing time. I welcome the Solicitor-General&#039;s statement, particularly his saying that there will be no prosecution of the soldiers involved. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said, this was clearly a tragic series of events, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 733</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>involving soldiers working in incredibly difficult circumstances. I also welcome the concern expressed about the length of time taken to resolve this situation, which can only have added to the distress experienced by Mrs. Roberts and the rest of Sergeant Roberts&#039; family.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_70">The fact is that the main cause of Sergeant Roberts&#039; death was the Government&#039;s insufficient preparation for the war in Iraq and the inadequacy of the kit. Tragically, Sergeant Roberts raised this issue himself in Iraq before he died. His wife has campaigned bravely on it, and I pay tribute to the courage that she has shown in that regard since her husband&#039;s death. She has acted with great dignity and she should be commended for that. I hope that, as a fitting tribute to Sergeant Roberts and the campaign fought by Mrs. Roberts, the Ministry of Defence will take note of the lessons to be learned and ensure that no other soldier dies, as Sergeant Roberts tragically died, because of inadequate kit.
</p>








<p><a name="st_68"><a name="60427-13_spmin1"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 Of course, every death of a member of British service personnel is felt profoundly in the military family. All our thoughts are with Mrs. Roberts during these very difficult circumstances. She has been very concerned about the question of the protective equipment that her husband might have worn, and I am assured that the MOD has learned the lessons, is well aware of the circumstances of this case and is seeking to do all that it can to discharge its responsibilities to our soldiers in Iraq and elsewhere.
</p>








<p><a name="st_69"><a name="60427-13_spnew1"><b> Mr. Dan Rogerson  (North Cornwall) (LD):</b> 
 I share the expressions of sympathy to Mrs. Roberts and the other members of Sergeant Roberts&#039; family. I welcome the fact that the Solicitor-General said that investigations into incidents such as this will be conducted much more speedily in the future, and I am sure that we are all glad to hear that. The Solicitor-General will no doubt be aware that my predecessor, Lord Tyler, worked with the Roberts family in seeking to bring the matters surrounding the tragic death of Sergeant Roberts to the attention of the wider world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_71">The issue of the lack of equipment that may have saved Sergeant Roberts&#039; life is a matter of concern across Cornwall and the rest of the country. I welcome the Solicitor-General&#039;s assurances that his colleagues in the Ministry of Defence are investigating it and ensuring that such factors will not cause further deaths in future. However, can he tell us a little more about how investigations into that aspect of Sergeant Roberts&#039; death impacted on the decision on whether to bring charges and the results of that consideration?
</p>








<p><a name="st_70"><a name="60427-13_spmin2"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The presence or otherwise of the protective jacket is a matter for the Ministry of Defence and others, and it did not have any substantial bearing on the legal decisions. In terms of the lawyers&#039; examination of the evidence, the issue was whether the soldiers had acted appropriately and whether Mr. Zaher was posing a threat to them at the time. Those matters were looked at and conclusions were reached based on a full investigation and consideration of the evidence. The straight answer to his question is that the presence or absence of kevlar plates and a protective jacket was not, in legal terms at least, an issue that had a substantial bearing on the outcome of the case.

 I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for his meticulous care in warning us of the statement that he has made today, and for its tone and content. He is right to say that our soldiers are not, and should never be, immune from prosecution. They are subject to the rule of law and that is what they are fighting for. The statement gives us a lot of information that we can look at now with the benefit of hindsight. I suppose the value of hindsight is that we can learn from it for the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_72">There are two aspects on which I hope that the Solicitor-General can comment. First, the maxim that justice delayed is justice denied is one to which insufficient attention has perhaps been given. Secondly, the Solicitor-General referred to differences of view in the Army Legal Services. Given the fact that our soldiers are fighting on behalf of all us&#151;and doing a fantastic job in very difficult circumstances&#151;does he agree that more benefit of the doubt could be given to our soldiers in relation to prosecutions such as this?

</p>








<p><a name="st_72"><a name="60427-13_spmin3"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 It is important that whenever we look at a case involving our soldiers engaged in active service areas, such as Iraq, we take into account the precise circumstances in which they are operating. When making a decision, we need to take into account the threat that soldiers may feel under and the background circumstances that they face. In looking at the evidence, those who make decisions on prosecution&#151;be it the APA or the Crown Prosecution Service, as in this case&#151;will consider those circumstances. Therefore, I do not think that we need to change the test.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_73">The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the maxim that justice delayed is justice denied. Delays such as those in this case are regrettable, but it is also important that we have a full and thorough investigation. What we cannot have is a situation in which people make allegations that there has been some kind of cover up. They cannot do so here, because the case has been fully and properly investigated on several occasions. No criticism can now attach to the thoroughness of the investigation. If we demand that other countries comply with international law and basic standards, we must show that we do to. This case shows that. We have conducted a full investigation and reached a conclusion based on the evidence. That is what we ask other countries to do and that is what we must continue to do ourselves.

 I am afraid that I will not be so charitable towards the statement, but that is perhaps because, as a former soldier, I know too well the effects that delay and such investigations have on the morale of soldiers, their families and units&#151;especially those in the front line.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_74">The Solicitor-General said that the case was started because it might have been perceived that British soldiers shot an unarmed civilian. However, at the end of his statement he said that if there is an allegation of wrongdoing and supporting evidence following an investigation, charges will be brought. Is it not the case that there was not actually an allegation of wrongdoing in this case, but that yet again commanding officers and units in the front line&#151;who know the environment, as did the local Army Legal Services staff&#151;were overruled for reasons of perception, not reasons of correct justice?

<p><a name="st_74"><a name="60427-14_spmin0"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 There was, regrettably, an allegation of improper behaviour. The independent Iraqi civilian who made some allegations put forward a version of events that did not include the shooting of Sergeant Roberts, but did suggest that the behaviour of the troopers involved had not been appropriate. That was discovered at a later stage, but it is clear that perceptions might have arisen after an unarmed civilian had been shot. It is right that when that occurs, the British Army should protect itself by having a proper, full and thorough investigation so that it can say that it acted lawfully and properly, that it is not above the law and that it does things the right way. To suggest that there should not have been a full investigation is just plain wrong and it would undermine the very basis on which our Army claims to act. It is right and appropriate that there should have been a full investigation. It was carried out, and those soldiers can now say that it was done and they were cleared.

</p>








<p><a name="st_75"><a name="60427-14_spnew0"><b> Mr. Brian Jenkins  (Tamworth) (Lab):</b> 
 In my hon. and learned Friend&#039;s statement he said that there were &quot;inconsistencies&quot; in the accounts provided by the soldiers. Does he recognise that there are always inconsistencies in statements given by witnesses? If there are no inconsistencies, the witnesses are deemed to have colluded before giving their evidence. It also rankles with some of us that after an extensive inquiry the statement concludes that there is &quot;insufficient evidence&quot; to institute criminal proceedings in this case. We have the evidence&#151;surely it shows that there is no case to answer.
</p>








<p><a name="st_76"><a name="60427-14_spmin1"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 It is the case that there is insufficient evidence and therefore there is no case to answer. I am afraid that lawyers tend to use legal terminology, and the public have a right to know that the conclusion is that there is not a case to be answered in the criminal courts. My hon. Friend mentioned inconsistencies. The incident took place in the early stages of the armed conflict in Iraq and soldiers were clearly under a great deal of stress. The circumstances were confusing, including the fact that the machine gun was set to fire at a greater distance than events required. There were a series of factors that led to an element of confusion and, therefore, it is not unlikely that accounts should display inconsistencies. Anyone who has experience of hearing witnesses give evidence in court will know that there are often honest inconsistencies.

<br>&nbsp;<br>tragic circumstances? Some people have said that the reason for the delay and for allowing the argument about enhanced body armour to run in the media was to cover up the fact that it was a case of friendly fire. There are many lessons to be learned about improving communications to stop rumours spreading, especially in the British press, which do not help the morale of the troops and do not help us in communicating exactly what happened.
</p>








<p><a name="st_78"><a name="60427-14_spmin2"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 It is important that families are given as much information as is reasonable as early as possible and that the information is accurate, which means that there must be some degree of investigation of it. We have already heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins) that sometimes there are inconsistencies in statements and all sorts of issues arise, especially in a conflict zone. There were difficulties in returning to the site to gather forensic evidence. I am sorry that Mrs. Roberts had to wait so long for a description of what had happened to her husband. That is obviously distressing, but it is important that when a description is given it is as accurate as possible, which requires investigation and that requires time. It would have been even worse, however, if Mrs. Roberts had been given one explanation and then over time, as new evidence emerged, it was changed time and again. I suspect that that would lead to even greater distress.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_77">The media do not have to be accurate when they report things. The Government and the Ministry of Defence at least try to be as accurate as we reasonably can in the information we give. It is important that time is taken.

 I had the privilege of visiting Iraq in June 2003&nbsp;as part of the armed forces parliamentary scheme. During our time there, I spent nearly 24&nbsp;hours with the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment. I ate with the soldiers, talked to them and went on patrol with them in a Challenger tank. The point they made about Sergeant Roberts&#039; death was that he did not have kevlar; I understand that he had in fact been given kevlar but asked to give it to another soldier. They clearly believe that the lack of that protection led to his death. Should not the Government look into whether the forces should have a duty of care to ensure that the basic safety equipment required for front-line duties is actually provided? The family of Sergeant Roberts could then have taken a case against the services for their failure to protect his life. He gave his life for his country.

<p><a name="st_80"><a name="60427-14_spmin3"><b>The Solicitor-General</b> 
: The Ministry of Defence always has to be risk-aware and, where it can, provide the appropriate equipment, but there is no such thing as a risk-free environment, and certainly not in Iraq; our soldiers and other service persons run risks when they are on active service. My earlier comment that the MOD has looked at the case and sought to learn lessons is appropriate. The MOD will seek to provide appropriate equipment and to ensure that soldiers have whatever protection can reasonably be given, but no circumstances, not least in Iraq, are without some degree of risk.

 We covered many matters yesterday on Second Reading. We have tabled amendments Nos.&nbsp;7, 8&nbsp;and 6&nbsp;to clause 1. The clause provides that the Secretary of State may refer certain matters to the Assembly that is to be set up under the Bill, namely, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;election of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, the operation of d&#039;Hondt and such other matters as the Secretary of State sees fit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_78">The clause makes it clear that suspension does not end with the creation of the Assembly. It provides that the Assembly is to be composed of people who were elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly, so there is a clear legal distinction between the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Assembly. So far, the Secretary of State has not coloured in exactly which other matters he might see fit to refer to the Assembly. There were various exchanges between Governments and parties in the run-up to the statement made by the two premiers in Armagh, which preceded the Secretary of State&#039;s announcement of the Bill last week. The purpose of amendment No. 7&nbsp;is to try to probe further into which other matters the Assembly might consider.

<a name="60427-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_79">Elsewhere in the measure, it is made clear what will happen if restoration does not occur by 25&nbsp;November. The Assembly set up by the legislation will be wound up and the Secretary of State has made it clear that Assembly Members will lose their jobs. We accept that, as we have been told, the Assembly is not a shadow Assembly&#151;so it is not even a shadow of its former self. It should not continue indefinitely. We do not want an endless talking shop of any kind, but the Government are making a mistake if they think that the deadline will worry those who may not be in a hurry to form an inclusive Executive by that date. Talk of closing the book on devolution and talk, such as we heard yesterday, of bringing the curtain down on the process that has been in operation since 1998&nbsp;could appeal to a party such as the Democratic Unionist party, which still says that its aim is to remove and replace the Belfast agreement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_80">The proposals that may or may not exist on joint stewardship in the event of the Assembly being wound up if there is failure by 25&nbsp;November do not extend to anything that might look like joint authority&#151;the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has been at pains to state that here last week and this week&#151;so it would seem that perhaps we are talking about some sort of direct rule with knobs on at best. Again, I am not sure whether that will particularly appeal to anyone to whom the deadline is meant to appeal, and I am not sure whether it will scare or frighten anyone whom the deadline is supposed to worry in that sense.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_81">It would suit those in the DUP in many ways for everything to be wound up at that stage and for attempts to be made in the direction of joint authority, to which they can then galvanise opposition and claim success in those attempts and, indeed, in burying the agreement, as they would see it. There is a danger that parties could have an incentive to play it out to failure on 25&nbsp;November. Indeed, that incentive could also extend not just to the DUP, but to those in Sinn Fein who, for their own reasons, might be quite happy for us to reach a situation where the onus is on the two Governments to produce an alternative after 25&nbsp;November. Of course, they can then galvanise and criticise when that is not good enough from their perspective either. Of course, they would be happy to blame the collapse by 25&nbsp;November on the DUP.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_82">The danger is that, after 25&nbsp;November, the Northern Ireland Assembly might not be a given, the Assembly created by the Bill might be gone and a worthwhile alternative from the two Governments might not be a given and not be available. It might well be that the only given that we will have then is the outcome of the review of public administration&#151;the seven super-councils, the repartition in waiting and the deep Balkanisation of our society&#151;and in those circumstances, parties might well start to turn their attentions to how they build up their powers and bases in those new local government institutions, rather than concentrating on how we deliver the vision for devolution that the people of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northern Ireland endorsed when they voted overwhelmingly for the agreement.

<p><a name="st_113"><a name="60427-16_spnew0"><b> Mark Durkan: </b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman looks at amendment No. 7, he will see that it would allow people to consider and argue about other such proposals, to test one another and to press one another on them. However, the fact is that we could face a dangerous situation after 25&nbsp;November if we have failed by that stage and if the language used is that of closing the book on devolution and therefore closing the book on the agreement for the foreseeable future. We could end up in circumstances that no one has advocated, no one has argued for and certainly no one has voted for in voting for any party. That is why I believe that, in the period that we have, if it looks as though we are not making progress to form the inclusive Executive and getting the First Minister and Deputy First Minister elected in the due way, it might well be appropriate, if the parties agree, to look at some options that still allow us to make progress that is consistent with the Good Friday agreement and that allows suspension to end&#151;not to continue and prolong this kind of half-baked, twilight zone Assembly, but to create one that allows us to end direct rule and to restore the Assembly with its powers, the North/South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-16_para0">
<a name="stpa_83">The hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) refers to our proposals in the past. Our proposals were made more than two years ago. They did not require IRA decommissioning or anything else&#151;it would have been restoration there and then, or restoration here and now&#151;and if the Assembly were to discuss options such as ours, other parties would be free to propose other options. I urge the Secretary of State to make it clear that the Assembly will have the potential to maximise the agreement&#039;s implementation. That is made clear in amendment No. 7, and we would like to hear that the Government will consider that, rather than pushing to a position that would simply allow others to declare the agreement dead.

<a name="60427-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_84">We recognise in that context not only that we will be trying to test others with alternatives and better ways to find a more definite approach to implementing the agreement, but that other parties will be testing us with their proposals, some of which, of course, would involve departing from the agreement. However, if the purpose of the Assembly is, as we have been told over the past few weeks, to provide a forum where all the parties can discuss things and where side deals are not going on and if the Assembly is the locus for political discussions, it seems to me that, given such political discussions as the Government know they will have with the parties, the parties should be able to have discussions with one another in public view in the context of the Assembly created by the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_85">I will not speak to the amendments tabled by other hon. Members. We have also tabled amendments Nos. 8&nbsp;and 6&nbsp;in this group. The purpose of amendment No. 8&nbsp;is simple: to make it clear that the purpose of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 741</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Assembly created by the Bill is to give effect to the Good Friday agreement. The House should have no problem with that because, after all, section 1&nbsp;of the Northern Ireland (Elections) Act 1998, which set up the original shadow Assembly, contained similar wording, and the Secretary of State has told us that much of the Bill has been drawn from that original 1998&nbsp;Act. If it was okay then, and the purpose of the Bill is to get us to implement the agreement, we see no reason why that cannot be made clear upfront in the legislation now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_86">I will now address amendment No. 6&#151;and as I said yesterday, the key to our approach is whether the Bill offers a path to restoration or whether it offers the sort of talking shop that the DUP have advocated. We recognise from what we have seen to date that the Bill may offer both. It could be a path to restoration in that, if we elect a First Minister and Deputy First Minister and run the d&#039;Hondt system and everyone takes the pledge of office, the Secretary of State will restore the institutions. Certainly, we would welcome that&#151;we want to see those things happen&#151;and we will be there, taking our place in the Assembly, to try to make them happen.
</p>








<p><a name="st_114"><a name="60427-16_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gregory Campbell  (East Londonderry) (DUP):</b> 
 Again, the hon. Gentleman alludes to two distinct things: either a talking shop, which he appears to believe, wrongly, is an option that the DUP wants, or a restitution of the institutions, which is obviously what he wants. Can he open his mind to the fact that this may in fact evolve into something that is neither of those?
</p>








<p><a name="st_115"><a name="60427-16_spnew2"><b> Mark Durkan: </b> 
 I look forward to hearing more from the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues about some of what they have in mind, but so long as we are in the Assembly created by the Bill and not a restored one, I certainly want to ensure that the elected representatives in that Assembly can use their time as productively as possible. I do not want the considerations that its Members then have to be meaningless and weightless.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_87">The fact is that the Secretary of State is given the power in clause 1(1) to refer to &quot;such other matters as&quot; he &quot;thinks fit&quot; to the Assembly created by the Bill. Obviously, that refers back to the statement by the two Governments on 6&nbsp;April. We are told that the Secretary of State and Ministers would take account of motions passed with cross-community support on matters such as water rates and the review of public administration. It is hard for people to put much weight on such verbal indications from the Government in circumstances where the Government have consistently failed to respect the will of parties, as clearly expressed on a cross-community basis outside the Assembly during suspension.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_88">How are we to believe that the Government will respect the views of Assembly Members in that Assembly? Will &quot;take account of&quot; extend to &quot;abide by the will of&quot;? That is what amendment No. 6&nbsp;tests. It would give the temporary Assembly created by the Bill a temporary power for the life of that Assembly, by cross-community vote, to veto Orders in Council. That would not be a veto in the hands of one party or another party, or one community interest or another community 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 742</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>interest, but a veto, for the life of the temporary Assembly, in the hands of a cross-community majority in that Assembly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_89">If the Secretary of State cannot accept amendment No. 6, I will have to ask what reason he can offer to Members of the Legislative Assembly for attending work in the Assembly to deal with such other matters as he might refer to it. If the clear and overwhelming views of the Assembly on matters such as industrial de-rating, water charges and the review of public administration will have no binding impact on what the Government do, it is hard to see how people will be well motivated in that work. It is also hard to see how the variety of policy communities and sectoral interests will take the Assembly seriously in that context. If the Secretary of State, who is creating and will control the Assembly, does not take it seriously, it is hard to expect or rely on all its Members, and certainly the wider public, to take it seriously.
</p>








<p><a name="st_116"><a name="60427-16_spnew3"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown  (Cotswold) (Con):</b> 
 Having read amendment No. 6, it seems that the hon. Gentleman seeks a negative power for the Assembly to veto Orders in Council. How does he consider that the Assembly will work in terms of positive powers? What positive powers does he think the Assembly should have and how much budgetary control does he think it should have?
</p>








<p><a name="st_117"><a name="60427-16_spnew4"><b> Mark Durkan: </b> 
 To give the Assembly positive powers on a cross-community basis would, in effect, give one community or another, or one party or another, a veto on positive proposals and that would not be constructive in this situation. We do not want to give life to any sort of diversionary, half-baked Assembly. In so far as we are faced with this Assembly, which would not have been our choice&#151;we wanted to go for full restoration&#151;we will make the most of what is put in front of us, but we are not going to give life to something that diverges significantly from the agreement.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_90">This is a temporary Assembly. If the idea of the 25&nbsp;November deadline is to concentrate minds and to say to parties, &quot;You will face serious consequences if you let all this fizzle out and the prospect of devolution turn to dust,&quot; giving that temporary Assembly the temporary power of political estoppel on matters that are clearly unpopular in the Northern Ireland community, would at least let people know that, if there is failure by 25&nbsp;November, the effect of that power of estoppel will go. People will know that the community will pay a price and hopefully then parties will pay a price in front of the community for having allowed their success in stopping and preventing some of these&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;measures to evaporate, because obviously the Government are then free to return to implement those measures under direct rule.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-16_para8">
<a name="stpa_91">Concentrating and galvanising the power of that incentive makes the deadline count for far more. It will give people in the wider community&#151;the various policy communities and sectoral interests&#151;some mission and purpose in looking to the temporary Assembly to send a signal of a real prospect of better policy outcomes for them. They will be pressing parties to make the most of the situation and to make sure that we have success before 25&nbsp;November, not failure. That is the purpose of amendment No. 6.

Would it be possible that the measure would put the leader of the Assembly in an invidious position? The leader might become involved in court proceedings to rule on whether something was said with malice.

<p><a name="st_132"><a name="60427-18_spnew2"><b> Lady Hermon: </b> 
 The Secretary of State has already chosen an individual to be the Presiding Officer, although I do not think that he had the authority&#151;certainly not under the 1998&nbsp;Act&#151;to appoint any individual as a Presiding Officer. I assume that he has discussed the new law on defamation and privilege with the nominated Presiding Officer.

I understand why the hon. Lady is worried about the measure. Although I could have waited until my reply to make this point, it is important that I do so now. The arrangements are exactly the same&#151;I think that the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) was alluding to this point&#151;as those that applied in 1998&nbsp;before we had a fully-fledged Assembly and restoration.

 Does not the Secretary of State&#039;s intervention underline the fact that the hon.

<a name="stpa_136">The hon.

The Government have some form on this issue. The Secretary of State is also the Secretary of State for Wales, so he will remember a recent debate on the Government of Wales Bill. I tabled an amendment proposing that we call the Welsh Assembly &quot;the Welsh Senedd&quot;, but the Government rejected it, because they argued that the building in which the Assembly operates is a Senedd, so it would be confusing to call the Assembly the same thing. They appear to have taken exactly the opposite view in the Northern Ireland Bill, and have decided to use one word for two things that are clearly not the same.

 That was not the reason that we refused the hon. Gentleman&#039;s amendment. The translation of the Welsh word, &quot;Senedd&quot;, is &quot;Parliament&quot;, but Westminster is the Parliament. There is no Parliament in Wales&#151;there is the Assembly.

 The right hon. Gentleman was not present for the entire debate, but one of the arguments against calling the Assembly &quot;the Senedd&quot; was that people would be confused. That is on the record for everyone to see. There is no question but that the use of the word &quot;Assembly&quot; in the Bill will cause confusion, as that has already happened in the press. The Government should take a long, hard look at the problem.

 I am delighted. However, how do I know what anybody else thinks? How do I know what motivates people? I have to trust people. Just as I would trust the Secretary of State, I ask him not to shackle the privilege of those who meet in forum or conclave and what they can say to and about each other.

<a name="stpa_170">I said yesterday that the task in Northern Ireland&#151;it is a joint task&#151;is to make hatred history. We have spoken much about making poverty history recently, and that is good. To make hatred history, we have to work together. That requires a great deal of sacrifice, especially by those who have suffered. The communities represented by Northern Ireland Members on the other side of the House have suffered; those represented by Northern Ireland Members on my left have suffered enormously. Those who are not here but could be present to argue their cause have inflicted much of that suffering. They have not expressed remorse for doing so. We are going to have to draw a line without that expression of remorse, and that is quite a task.

If we are to begin to create the climate for a new era of trust, it is incumbent on the Secretary of State to be cautious about what he pushes through Westminster in the next six months. He should devote his time almost exclusively to Northern Ireland. I am sure that the people of Wales will not mind. He knows that I do not like the dual mandate that he holds, although that is not his fault.

 I want to comment on one or two amendments in the group. I agree with the comments of the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) about amendment No. 6. In the Democratic Unionist party document, &quot;Facing Reality&quot;, which preceded the Government&#039;s initiative, we stated clearly that we wanted an Assembly that would exercise the maximum power and responsibility that was consistent with the circumstances. We never advocated a talking shop. Indeed, we put forward in the document a number of options to be considered by the political parties in Northern Ireland, one of which was legislative devolution. That option would still have allowed the executive functions to be performed by the direct-rule Ministers, while allowing legislative rule by the Assembly. The proposal by the SDLP is a small gesture in that direction, but it is none the less a helpful suggestion, and my party colleagues and I are quite happy to support it. Indeed, the Secretary of State and Her Majesty&#039;s Government will start to lose credibility if they turn down a reasonable proposal that is supported by all those who are prepared to speak in this House on behalf of the electorate in Northern Ireland.

<a name="stpa_173">What is the Government&#039;s purpose? I had assumed that it was to establish cross-community support in Northern Ireland and to encourage the political parties

<br>&nbsp;<br>to reach agreements. Here we have an agreement, however small it might be, yet the Secretary of State has not, as yet, indicated his willingness to accept this small step forward. He must relinquish some of his control and power, because the tendency, as illustrated by the Bill, is that he is seeking to draw more and more power to himself. That is not a good example for the politicians of Northern Ireland to be set by a Government who say that they want to devolve and cast off their powers. Here we have an all-party agreement among all the members from Northern Ireland in this House, yet the Secretary of State still appears to want to resist it. I hope that he will reconsider his position on these matters. As the hon. Member for South Staffordshire has suggested, the Secretary of State could review the situation when we reach 24&nbsp;November. It need not be set in stone for all time.

<a name="60427-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_174">The purpose of this Assembly is that it will be a transitional Assembly that will move towards full executive devolution. This measure seems to be a very adequate way of performing that task.

 Given the filters in amendment No. 6&#151;including the requirement for cross-community support, and the provision that the Secretary of State would still have powers to make urgent orders without reference to the Assembly&#151;does my hon.

<a name="stpa_175">A number of issues were raised during this short debate that bring two words to mind: &quot;mountains&quot; and &quot;molehills&quot;. We are at times inclined to get into the minutiae to such an extent that we lose track of the key issues.

<a name="60427-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_176">Let me deal with the issue of the Assembly and the Northern Ireland Assembly. This is not a new issue; we faced it in 1998. We are talking about a transitional Assembly that will move from its present structures and powers towards a creation that we hope will eventually have full executive authority. The Ulster Unionist party did not oppose such a metamorphosis in 1998, and I am surprised that it is opposing it today. The words used to describe the body&#151;be it &quot;assembly&quot; or &quot;forum&quot;&#151;are pretty meaningless in reality. It is the Assembly. It is not the Northern Ireland Assembly as set up under the 1998&nbsp;legislation. It has a specific role that would take it seamlessly from its existence under this Bill to an existence that we hope it will have under an amended version of the 1998&nbsp;Act, given that that legislation will have to be amended.

<br>&nbsp;<br>relation to the Presiding Officer&#039;s position, the enrolment process for Assembly Members and their designation, and decisions taken in relation to the First and Deputy First Minister and other Executive positions. By being taken by this body, those powers will automatically get taken by the new Northern Ireland Assembly under, I hope, an amended 1998&nbsp;Act. We are talking about a transitional Assembly, and I suppose that putting the word &quot;transitional&quot; in the title might have made its intention and purpose clearer.

<a name="stpa_178">I do not think that the terms used in the Bill do great violence to the overall position and future of Northern Ireland. Certainly, I am not greatly exercised about what the body is called. We all know what it is intended to do, and what its purpose is to be. I simply hope that the public will be more concerned with what the Assembly does than with what it is called. If the Members of that Assembly do a job that gets the favour of the community in Northern Ireland, they will worry little whether it might be confused with some other body that has been in suspension for a long period.

 Will the hon. Gentleman outline for the benefit of us all exactly what he anticipates this new Assembly doing that will charm and impress the people of Northern Ireland?

<p><a name="st_189"><a name="60427-23_spnew1"><b> Mr. Robinson: </b> 
 Members of the Democratic Unionist party are certainly committed to using every platform that that Assembly will provide to speak on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland, and to test the Secretary of State in terms of agreements that we can reach with others on key matters relating to education, the review of public administration, rating and the economy in general. We will speak on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland, and the people of Northern Ireland want us to have that voice. More than that, they want the Government to heed that voice. For that reason, the Secretary of State could go a long way to add to the importance and vitality of that Assembly were he willing to accept the amendment tabled by the SDLP.

 Does the hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_191"><a name="60427-23_spnew3"><b> Mr. Robinson: </b> 
 I will leave it to the hon. Gentleman to speak on behalf of Sinn Fein. I will certainly not attempt to do so. I simply know that the people of Northern Ireland want to have real decisions taken within that Assembly. They want it to have as much power as is possible. If it is not possible immediately to have an Executive set up, the Members of that Assembly should press the Secretary of State to divest himself of some of the powers that this legislation gives him, and to devolve some of those powers in whatever way is possible, whether through a corporate Assembly, legislative devolution or administration devolution, to the elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland.

<a name="60427-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_179">On privilege, again, I have difficulty with the position of the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon). First, the terms are almost identical to those in 1998. Far

<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 763</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>from opposing the position in 1998, her party supported it. Therefore, what the Government are doing in relation to the privilege of the Assembly has consistency. Having discovered that, I think that she decided to see whether she could find some more secure ground, and became a defender of the media and the press&#151;not always a popular position among politicians, but then she cannot be accused of always taking popular positions. I do not think, however, that the press have anything to fear. The Secretary of State may tell the hon. Lady and me whether this is indeed the case, but according to my reading of the legislation the statement, not the Member, is covered by privilege. If the statement is reported, it is covered by privilege, and the media are therefore entitled to publish it. The media will be covered in exactly the same way as the Member, because it is the statement that enjoys the privilege.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_180">As the hon. Lady said, the privilege is not the full privilege enjoyed by the House of Commons and the Northern Ireland Assembly created under the 1998&nbsp;Act, but I do not believe that the distinction will have any real implications for Assembly Members or for the press. I agree with those who have said that it will be very difficult for anyone to prove malice in the courts. Indeed, I am not entirely sure whether it is right, if a Member uses&#151;or abuses&#151;privilege and attempts, with malice, to damage and defame individuals, for even this House to confer such a degree of privilege.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_181">I have used the privilege of this House on many occasions. I have named individuals, and made clear what information I have had about the activities of those individuals. However, I have never done that with malice. I have done it because I have believed it to be in the public interest, and have believed my facts to be accurate. If any Member stands up in the Northern Ireland Assembly and, with malice, determines to &quot;out&quot; or defame someone, I am not sure that that Member should enjoy the privilege of the Assembly&#151;but I repeat yet again that it will not be the full-blown Assembly in which, normally, robust exchanges would take place that might require the exercise of that privilege.

 I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman ought to give some credence to what has been said by the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon). Section 50(1) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998&nbsp;is very clear about the position that obtained before that date. It states:

<p><a name="st_197">I am not sure whether schedule 1&nbsp;would cover publication, and I think that we need clarification from the Secretary of State. Furthermore, the hon.

As drafted, this provision could lead to considerable arguments and put the leader of the Assembly in a difficult position.</p>

 Therefore, under it, both the publication and the person to whom the remarks are attributed are covered by full privilege; however, the Bill establishes that they will not be so covered.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_185">There are two further issues on which I want to comment, the first of which is the powers of the Secretary of State. I said to the hon. Member for North Down in the House yesterday that I concurred with many of her misgivings about the storing up of more and more power&#151;indeed, unfettered power&#151;in the Secretary of State. Effectively, in many instances he can do what he thinks fit, which is clearly a cause for concern. However, the difficulty is that although the hon. Lady has taken away such responsibilities from the Secretary of State through her amendment, she has given them to no one else.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_186">That takes us back to the question of why the Secretary of State is setting up &quot;the Assembly&quot;, rather than &quot;the Northern Ireland Assembly&quot;. Had he detailed all such responsibilities and designated them to various individuals, or groups of individuals, in effect he would have been amending the entire 1998&nbsp;Act. I would not have worried greatly about amending the 1998&nbsp;Act, but I suspect that there are some people sitting behind the Minister who would not be too keen on doing so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_187">Of course, the reality is that the jobs that the Secretary of State has been given the power to perform under the Bill have to be performed. If we are to remove his 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 765</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>responsibility for performing them, we must also amend the Bill to give that responsibility to the Assembly or someone else. That is the deficiency in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for North Down, but I concur with her view that the Secretary of State is taking far too much on to himself. It would show greater faith in the elected representatives of Northern Ireland if he vested some of that responsibility in the Assembly itself.

<p>
<a name="60427-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_188">I turn finally to the election of the Presiding Officer. The wording in paragraph 2(6) of schedule 2&nbsp;is clumsy and unusual, even if it is not such that I would oppose it outright. I do not like the idea of somebody appointed by a Secretary of State being

I hope that it does not become an issue, but I do not like the idea that the Secretary of State can be deemed to have elected a Presiding Officer for the Assembly. In reality, the person concerned will be the Secretary of State&#039;s appointee and, with due respect to the Secretary of State, will have less authority as an appointee than if elected by the Assembly as its Speaker.

Where did that start? The decision came from the Assembly. With the greatest respect, Ministers&#151;I have many arguments with them&#151;are simply carrying forward decisions that Barbara Brown took and they are putting them into action. How did she decide that? Did she decide it by the will of the Assembly? No. She acted contrary to the will of the Assembly. Why did she do that? She did it according to her political affiliation and therefore she felt at the time that she wanted to do it because she wanted to ensure that the Fermanagh and South Tyrone seat would be secured in the Westminster elections. She and her party played with the lives of the people. They played with the health of the people. They knew that West Tyrone was safe for Sinn Fein and therefore they wanted to secure Fermanagh and South Tyrone. Therefore, they established the hospital in Fermanagh and they closed Omagh hospital.

Therefore, they did not care about the health of the people or about the will of the people. In fact, on that occasion, a previous Member for Belfast, West&#151;Dr. Joe Hendron&#151;was the chairman of the health committee. He and other Members of the SDLP disagreed with that decision simply on health grounds, and it was referred twice to the court.

There is a little confusion about what the Bill does and it has sometimes been difficult to explain that to people, who have responded by saying, &quot;Oh, so you&#039;re setting up a shadow Assembly,&quot; and I have replied that it is not quite like that.

If the Assembly were not fully restored, and I said that it could vote without responsibilities for its decisions, it would vote on water charges in an oppositionalist mode&#151;I hope that that is not an unfair characterisation&#151;if it decided that it did not want water charges. That decision would knock a great big hole in the budget from April next year, when it is proposed that the first tranche of water charges should be phased in. If the Assembly, acting irresponsibly, in the sense that it does not have responsibility for the consequences of its decisions, did not want water charges&#151;I accept that no one likes to pay more money&#151;that would knock a great big hole in the budget for health, education, children&#039;s services and agriculture. Decisions that are made therefore have consequences. The Assembly is not yet fully restored, but when we reach a point where it has responsibility, because it has an Executive who can make recommendations, and the parties in the Executive vote accordingly because they know that their decisions have consequences, I am happy for decisions on water charges, the RPA&#151;the review of public administration&#151;education reform and so on to be made by the Assembly.

After all, Parliament can always re-examine a matter and reach a different decision about it, and he can always table further Orders. If the Assembly perpetuates the apparent alliance that exists, he should respond to the questions about the seven authorities.

 Parliament has decided on the boundary commissioner&#039;s remit, and I have explained how the Assembly will be able to influence the subsequent pattern and delivery of local government.

<a name="stpa_232">I do not want to go too far into the matter, but it has been raised and deserves a proper response. The pattern of seven councils was chosen because the local government structure in Northern Ireland needs a strong revenue base that is more or less equal between authorities. There will be no need for cross-subsidy between them, but there will be coterminosity in respect of policing and health. Various other factors apply, and I repeat that the proposal for seven authorities was not made to satisfy one particular party.

Ministers would have been selected by the d&#039;Hondt procedure, but it is far from guaranteed that all parties would have put forward Ministers in the present circumstances&#151;in fact, we all know that they would not have done. Consequently, we would have risked having a serious community imbalance. At the very first opportunity for more than three and a half years, we would have marched ourselves straight into a crisis.

I make no apology for our having brought the Assembly back without its formal powers so that it can discuss in a calmer and more focused atmosphere the way forward to selecting an Executive, and people who will not have worked together for nearly four years can begin to experience it again and to build the necessary trust.

She asked why the proceedings in the Assembly in the form envisaged to 24&nbsp;November&#151;or to restoration, if that takes place before then&#151;were to be given a lesser degree of privilege in regard to defamation than those of the devolved Assembly. The proceedings of the old, fully fledged&#151;as it were&#151;Assembly enjoyed absolute privilege. In this Assembly, privilege is qualified, in a similar way to that in which it was qualified at the preliminary stage last time. That privilege will not protect the maker of defamatory statements if there is proof of malice on his or her part. The Bill gives the same degree of privilege as that accorded to the transitional Assembly in 1998&#151;it follows exactly the same formula. That was our precedent.

 In respect of amendments Nos. 7&nbsp;and 8, the Secretary of State has indicated that the Government&#039;s purpose in the Bill, and the whole point of the exercise, is to give effect to re-establishing the institutions of the Good Friday agreement. On that basis, he feels that the amendments add nothing. In introducing them, I said that they were probing amendments to register that point, which was certainly made to us in meetings with the British and Irish Governments and registered strongly by the Taoiseach, not only in his joint statement with the Prime Minister on 2&nbsp;March but on several other occasions. I am glad that our amendments have brought such an explicit statement from the Secretary of State. The Minister with responsibility for political development, the hon.

Drawing down the curtain, as the Secretary of State said yesterday, on the process since 1998&#151;those were the Secretary of State&#039;s words&#151;can quickly be converted by the DUP to drawing down the curtain on the Good Friday agreement. As Governments search for an alternative that they do not yet have, the DUP will say, &quot;We always advocated an alternative. The Governments are proposing an alternative that is not agreed; we want an alternative that is agreed.&quot; A lot of people in Northern Ireland, including some nationalists, naively believe that the DUP is somehow under the cosh in respect of 25&nbsp;November and some other alternative, but I do not believe that the DUP appears particularly frightened by that prospect.

After all, if the suspension had never happened in the first place and if the DUP, with the mandate that it secured, had entered unsuspended institutions, the DUP would have taken office in those institutions. It would then have used its strength in those institutions, and in the context of a formal review of the agreement, to oversee some of the changes that it seeks. It would find that&#151;as, in fact, its members know&#151;many of us have proposed changes in the workings of the agreement to improve it, at a number of levels and a number of ways. We have even proposed changes in the 1998&nbsp;Act, because many changes could be made to the Act without denting the agreement.

It is not a veto in the pocket of any one party or community, so it could not be abused. The Secretary of State doubted whether there would be cross-party support for providing such a power. I agree that there would not have been cross-party support for a power of affirmative resolution, which would have given a veto to one party or community, but I cannot see what objection even Sinn Fein would have to proving the power of negative resolution on a cross-community basis. If we are meant to participate in this Assembly in anticipation of taking on powers and doing good things, surely we want the ability stop some of the bad proposals coming through via Orders in Council. As we look toward achieving restoration, what is wrong with our being given the power, on a cross-community basis, to put a stop to the gallop of direct rule via Orders in Council?

Given that it is perfectly obvious that every party represented here&#151;apart from Government Front Benchers&#151;agrees with such a proposal, the Secretary of State&#039;s argument falls. Is the hon. Gentleman, like me, a bit suspicious of the fact that the Secretary of State then moved on to a different set of justifications for not providing such powers?

 Perhaps the Secretary of State could explain to us at some point the difference between a shadow Assembly and what we have, because it seems to be a shady, shadowy sort of affair anyway. Given that most of the legislation is recycled from the original Northern Ireland Act 1998, which did give us a shadow Assembly, it is hard to see the difference. Our concern was having an Assembly that had powers that people would become comfortable with, such as powers of affirmative resolution and a greater degree of legislative initiative than at present.

We need some ongoing justification of purpose and, in particular, people in the community who want to see their elected representatives doing things for them in their mandated institutions. There would be some point in looking to the Assembly if it at least had the power of political estoppel or temporary injunction on Orders in Council for its lifetime. At least then people from business could come not to give us bland talks, but to advise us on decisions that we could take to affect the fate of an Order in Council. I do not see how the Secretary of State can argue against putting business, trade unions and community interests in such positive and purposeful engagement with the Assembly, as opposed to the talking-shop style exchange that he seems to envisage.

 We had a wide debate on the previous group of amendments and we now come to a group of amendments tabled mostly by my party. The purpose of the amendments is to allow the selection of a First Minister, Deputy First Minister and other Ministers, under the arrangements set out in schedule 2, if necessary after the deadline of 24&nbsp;November 2006. As the legislation is currently drafted, the procedure can no longer be used after the deadline. That is because of the provisions of clause 2(1)(b) and schedule 3(4). Under the Bill as it stands, the only way to elect a First Minister and Deputy First Minister, and to select other Ministers, will be under the arrangements in the 1998&nbsp;Act, or as it may be amended in the autumn.

The amendments simply give the Secretary of State options, rather than closing them down or forcing him to come to the House at another stage with new legislation. We have had enough experience recently of new legislation dealing with Northern Ireland and Members would not be terribly pleased if we had to go through the whole process again.

In that event, no Speaker would be elected&#151;the role would have to be re-signed and those in power in 2003&nbsp;would return to office on restoration. If the Assembly was restored and a First Minister and Deputy First Minister could not be elected, the countdown to an election would begin, despite the Secretary of State&#039;s saying that there would be no new elections to the institutions.

Indeed, if amendment No. 6&nbsp;is pushed to a Division, we shall go into the Lobby to support it.

Given the findings of the Independent Monitoring Commission report and the current circumstances, it will require a major step change in the provisionals&#039; current attitude to criminality and other things that disqualify them from office to enable them to meet that deadline&#151;although who knows what might happen? My party leader has already told us that he believes in miracles. Given his theological position, no one should be surprised at that statement.

It also has a considerable way to go on policing, as we all know. In the Secretary of State&#039;s comments in this place and outside over the past few days, he has referred to policing only in the context of the devolution of policing and justice powers. However, as I said in my contribution to the British-Irish interparliamentary body in Killarney, it is essential to recognise that for members of any party to exercise power as Ministers in any part of the United Kingdom it is extremely important not only that they support the police but that they urge their supporters and the community at large to give information to the police. They should not be half-hearted or equivocal about that matter. That extremely important issue cannot be ducked, set aside or ignored. So those in the provisional movement must deal with lots of issues. They are the ones who are holding up progress and who apparently stand in the way of the restoration of the Executive&#151;not the DUP or the Unionist population.

 I rise to speak to amendment No. 1, in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid), which is essentially a probing amendment. We are concerned whether there will be enough time for Parliament to legislate to bring into effect any change to the workings of the Assembly that might be needed before a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister can be elected. We would like the Government to assure us that there will be proper time for Parliament to consider the implications of any change to the workings of the Assembly. That is particularly important, as it is the duty of the two Governments&#151;the one here and the one in Dublin&#151;in conjunction with the Assembly, to review and report on the operation of the Assembly. Colleagues will remember that section 11&nbsp;of the Good Friday agreement spelt that out very specifically under the heading of &quot;Validation, Implementation and Review&quot;. I quote paragraph 8, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52">&quot;Notwithstanding the above, each institution will publish an annual report on its operations.

There was enormous obfuscation and delay, prior to the appointment of the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson). In the end, the work that has taken place has not really addressed some of the core issues&#151;for example, the question of political designation.

 I would like to contribute briefly to the debate on amendments Nos. 10&nbsp;and 14, in particular. I can see the benefit of having an end-date in place. It does tend to concentrate the mind. However, as the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) said yesterday, quite correctly, we have seen so many deadlines come and go in Northern Ireland. I suppose I have to question whether there can be any confidence in the idea that this is a real deadline.

Although I can see the point of a deadline, I think that, on balance, the argument put forward by the hon.

 The hon. Gentleman has made it clear that his vote is negotiable, so perhaps I can persuade him to swing back towards the case for deadlines.

Is he really saying that the antidote to flexible deadlines is no deadline at all?

It does no one on the Unionist side, including me, any good to pretend that there was no

<br>&nbsp;<br>good news in yesterday&#039;s report&#151;no one has suggested that&#151;but it does the Government no good to pretend that the whole report represented a clean bill of health. I quoted at length yesterday the parts of the report that said that senior members of the IRA were still involved in criminality and cited specific expulsions that were still being carried out by the IRA. That was all in the report as well as the good news, so if we are to accept the IMC report, we must accept the whole report. I thus have a lot of sympathy with amendment No. 14, too.

<a name="60427-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_286">Clause 2&nbsp;provides that if three conditions are met the Secretary of State will make an order of restoration. The conditions are that a First Minister and Deputy First Minister are elected, that persons are nominated as Ministers, and that each of them takes a pledge of office. I am deeply worried about amendment No. 10, because it would make the Assembly open-ended. The Assembly should not be open-ended because that would undermine the concentrated effort that is required to get devolution back in place.

We all have mandates and we can all count numbers, but the place to exercise the mandate and count the numbers is on the Floor of the Assembly when it is reconvened.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_288">We oppose any aspect or concept of a shadow, powerless Assembly, because that could last for ever. The deadline is an essential backstop position, which concentrates minds and gets things done.

<a name="stpa_289">I fear that amendment No. 1&nbsp;would set the precondition for restoration whereby Westminster has to legislate for changes to get the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister elected and an Executive formed. There is nothing wrong with the terms and the details that we worked out in 1998; nor was there anything wrong with the agreement reached in 1998. What was wrong was that a number of the parties failed to honour and implement their responsibilities in 1998&nbsp;and subsequently. I shall not point fingers. Everyone knows who the wrecking parties were, and it was not the SDLP or the Ulster Unionists. Frankly, the problem had nothing to do with the institutions, the regulations, the Standing Orders and the concepts. Rather, it was the outright refusal by the provos to destroy their weapons. To some extent, that was supplemented, aided and abetted by the refusal by some Unionist politicians to share power.

<a name="60427-31_para10">

Of course, improvements can be made to the working institutions. Improvements can always be made and development can always take place.

The terms will not have been met if we are depending on the IMC. We do not need to hang ourselves on the amendment. I outlined the terms for electing a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister, and for each of them taking the pledge. It appears that the DUP cannot trust itself and will not participate, but we cannot meet the primary conditions of clause 2&nbsp;without its support. So why do we need an amendment, as a belt-and-braces operation, to ensure that if one of them strays a wee bit, he is pulled back? It is a sort of choke lead.

If it has issues with which it wants to deal, let us do that face on, eyeball to eyeball, and, in a gentlemanly fashion, sort them out. We do not need the amendment. Again, the substance of it should be dealt with on the Floor of the Assembly. The amendment makes unreasonable demands and tries to remove the independence of the IMC, an independent body, and suck it in as a partisan political player. We are the political players.

I do not wish to delay the Committee further. My colleagues and I are opposed to the amendments for the reasons that I have outlined.

I can tell him that he is held in high esteem in Northern Ireland. He is right about the deadline. The history of the process is littered with the wreckage of deadlines that were passed. Even the Belfast agreement set deadlines for decommissioning and other things, and we saw the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries drive a coach and horses through those deadlines.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_297">The hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) is right. They would be pulling the plug on the Belfast agreement and all that goes with it. He argued that that would be welcomed by Democratic Unionists. We have proposed changes to the institutions. We tabled the amendment to bring about changes to the Northern Ireland Act 1998&nbsp;to ensure the effective and efficient operation of the institutions, and especially to ensure proper lines of accountability.

<p>
<a name="60427-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_298">Let us be clear. Our motivation is to ensure that we get it absolutely right. We do not want, as has been suggested by some Members, to delay the establishment of devolution in Northern Ireland indefinitely. Our party is a devolutionist party, and it believes in a local Government in Northern Ireland. As I said earlier, we would gladly form an Executive today with the democratic parties in the Assembly, including the Social Democratic and Labour party. We have clearly stated that, but we have a difficulty with Sinn Fein&#151;a potential member of a future Executive&#151;given its links with the IRA and ongoing IRA criminality. That is a major problem for us, together with the fact that Sinn Fein does not support the police and the rule of law. Those issues must be resolved.
</p>

<a name="60427-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_299">Let me make it clear that indefinite direct rule is not in our interests or the interests of the people whom we represent. Nor are we interested in being part of an assembly that merely discusses issues and does not ever reach the point of forming an Executive. In amendment No. 10, we do not seek an open-ended scenario in which we simply delay, procrastinate and spin things out for years to come. We are realistic: we know that that will not be allowed to happen. However, the amendment gives us a little more flexibility in the process if progress is made by 24&nbsp;November, enabling the Secretary of State to keep things going for a further period. The basic concept of the Assembly in the format proposed by the Government is to engage people in issues to help to build trust. That is important, but the exchanges across the

<p>
<a name="60427-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_300">Without doubt, there are many issues at the moment, and Unionists have very little trust in Sinn Fein&#039;s position. It is clear from the comments of SDLP Members that they do not trust the DUP&#039;s bona fides or our position. We are equally disappointed by their approach to the political process in recent years. At times, they try to out-Sinn Fein Sinn Fein; at times, they take a position that is so hard-line and tough that it makes Gerry Adams look like a poodle. That is unhelpful, and they have refused to contemplate sharing power with Unionists unless their big brothers in Sinn Fein are at their side. I wish that the SDLP would learn to stand on its own two feet. Instead of hiding behind the Irish Government and Sinn Fein, it should rely on its own strength and consider serving in government with Unionists. However, I have said enough about the issue.

<p><a name="st_265"><a name="60427-32_spnew4"><b> Mr. Donaldson: </b> 
 I accept that, and I applaud the position that the SDLP took after many years of refusing to support the police and refusing to take up seats on the Police Authority. Finally, after 30&nbsp;years, it pressed its agenda and was able to wring out substantial changes to policing in Northern Ireland. It decided that it was going to support the police, which we welcome. However, I am not talking about policing but about the formation of an Executive or a Government for the people of Northern Ireland. I regret very much the fact that the SDLP has not had the courage to step out and do with an Executive what it was prepared to do with the Policing Board.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_301">I do not accept the distinction between the operation of the Policing Board and the operation of an Executive in Northern Ireland. If the SDLP is prepared to serve with Unionists on a Policing Board and take responsibility for one of the most important issues in Northern Ireland, why on earth can it not do that with us on education, health, roads, housing, planning and all the matters that affect the people whom we represent? I would like that to happen, and I await the day when there is genuine power sharing in Down council, so that the DUP can finally get a look-in and secure a senior appointment. It would be nice to see the SDLP exercising real power sharing in places such as Down district, but we are patient and will wait for that day. Perhaps Down district will be able to match what happens in neighbouring Lisburn, the city that I represent, in terms of the parity that we give to the SDLP. Of the 30&nbsp;councillors on Lisburn council, only three&#151;or 10&nbsp;per cent.&#151;belong to the SDLP.

<a name="stpa_304">From my perspective, I do not think it appropriate for the people of Northern Ireland to expect that the process will remain open-ended for ever. We have to set a deadline, for a variety of reasons. First, it puts on the parties involved the pressure that must be applied if we are to resolve the question of the Assembly. Secondly, the Assembly elections in May next year are rushing towards us. These things tend to go quickly, and even the hon. Members for Belfast, North, for Lagan Valley and for Tewkesbury must recognise that it is impractical and impossible to ask the people of Northern Ireland to vote again for an Assembly that does not sit, and for Members who do not participate in their legislative functions, even though they maintain their strong constituency roles.

When we debated the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, we discussed the way in which we can, I hope, devolve policing and criminal justice in due course. I understand where hon.

 I am grateful to the Minister for giving the answer for which I was looking. The amendment was merely a probing amendment. Can he confirm that he will be willing to have such meetings with parties that are willing to make that contribution within, say, the next eight weeks? I ask for that because it has taken us a very long time to get from the original correspondence to a situation where the Government are expressly accepting that some things may need to change.

<p><a name="st_278"><a name="60427-34_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I am happy to have discussions with the parties. I would not wish, for my benefit, to put a time scale on them at this stage&#151;contradictory as that may seem. The hon. Gentleman knows that as well as dealing with legislation and other matters, we are running Departments in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office therefore has a heavy work load. I will consider the issues and we will hold discussions. However, on the basis of those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment No. 1&nbsp;to a Division.

<a name="60427-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_317">I am grateful for the debate, which was helpful, but I hope that the hon. Member for Belfast, North will withdraw his amendment.

<p><a name="st_279"><a name="60427-34_spnew2"><b> Mr. Dodds: </b> 
 I have listened carefully to the Minister&#039;s response. I am grateful for his recognition that the IMC report shows work in progress by the IRA. When we listened to some press reports and comments before it was released, it appeared to some of us that there was an attempt to spin it to suggest that no Unionist could now use the IRA as an excuse in the context of restoring devolved Government. The hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) was right to say that it is essential to examine the IMC report carefully in the round.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_318">It is clear that progress has been made. As we said yesterday, we believe that the Democratic Unionist party can claim much credit for that. Before our position 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 799</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>became the dominant one in Unionism, there was a view that the way to get the IRA away from violence was to bring it in and let the violence, drug dealing, intimidation and racketeering continue because being in government and having access to power would gradually wean it from all that. In fact, it had power and continued with its violence, racketeering and so on. We have made it clear that there must be an end to all that before the IRA can access power or authority. That strategy is working. Let us continue to keep up the pressure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_319">The Minister signally failed to answer the question of what was so magical about the deadline of 24&nbsp;November. He did not provide one reason or argument to persuade people that the process would be complete by 24&nbsp;November. No one can say when it will be completed. We all hope and pray, for the good of the people of Northern Ireland, that it will be completed sooner rather than later, but how have the Government arrived at the date of 24&nbsp;November? No one can say that the IRA will have completed the transformation by that date. We therefore believe that it is wrong to pull down the curtain on the prospects of restoring devolution simply because the IRA may not have fulfilled the necessary conditions to allow Sinn Fein to be part of an Executive in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_320">The debate has been useful and we shall not press amendment No. 14&nbsp;to a Division. Although we believe that it would be useful to include such a provision in the Bill, and we will take account of it along with several other issues when those matters are decided, we will not press it today. However, we shall press amendment No. 10, which covers the deadline, to a Division, for the reasons that I have enunciated. I am grateful for the support of the hon. Member for Tewkesbury and his colleagues. We hope that as many hon. Members as possible can join us in the Lobby.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="st_283"><a name="60427-35_spnew0"><b> Mr. Alan Reid: </b> 
 I have serious worries about the sweeping dictatorial powers that the clause seems to give the Secretary of State. I want to know why he believes the powers are necessary, and I should like him to give examples of occasions on which he would need to use them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_324">The clause provides for the Secretary of State to make, by order,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59">&quot;any supplementary, incidental or consequential provision&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_326">that he considers expedient. Clause 4&nbsp;states that the powers in clause 3&nbsp;are exercisable by affirmative resolution unless the Secretary of State considers it expedient to pass the orders by negative resolution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_327">In other words, if the Secretary of State considers it expedient, he can do anything that he likes. He can amend Acts of Parliament without Parliament having to vote. Before we give the Secretary of State those broad powers, we expect an explanation and some examples of the occasions on which he intends to use them.
</p>








<p><a name="st_284"><a name="60427-35_spnew1"><b> Mr. David Lidington  (Aylesbury) (Con):</b> 
 I hope that the Minister can give us a few assurances. I listened carefully to what was said by the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) and, when I first read the clause, I shared some of his concerns. I hope the Minister will be able to say that the enabling powers given to the Secretary of State are circumscribed by reference to the purposes of the Bill, and also that they would lapse in any case in line with the time limit in the Bill.
</p>








<p><a name="st_285"><a name="60427-35_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 As the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) said, clause 3&nbsp;allows the Secretary of State to make orders in relation to matters arising as a result of things done under the Bill. It is intended to be used to sweep up any consequential or unforeseen matters relating to, particularly, the recall of the Assembly, the repeal of the 2000&nbsp;Act, the postponement of elections or the dissolution of the Assembly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_328">For reasons that I hope are understood by both the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) and the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute, the Bill was put together in some haste following the decision of the Prime Minister and the Government to adopt this route. Changes may well be needed that would require primary legislation unless we gave the Secretary of State this power. The power is focused and not meant to have a widespread application. The Bill is short and concise and, in any event, the level of detail required in an order made under clause 3&nbsp;is not suitable for inclusion in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;primary legislation. In case there is any misunderstanding, I can assure Members that clause 3&nbsp;cannot be used to effect changes to, for example, the operation of the institutions as envisaged under the comprehensive agreement of December 2004.
</p>








<p><a name="st_286"><a name="60427-35_spnew3"><b> Mr. Dodds: </b> 
 Are any of the changes that the Minister might introduce under clause 3&nbsp;subject to a resolution of either House, or can they be made simply by Executive order?
</p>








<p><a name="st_287"><a name="60427-35_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 In this instance, these are delegated orders for the Secretary of State. As I said, the power applies to particular matters relating to the Bill; it does not have a wider application.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 803</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_288"><a name="60427-35_spnew5"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 To save time, can the Minister assure me now that our understanding that the Assembly will be entitled to amend and repeal legislation passed during the period of the Assembly&#039;s suspension is correct? It would be useful if he could put that on the record.
</p>








<p><a name="st_289"><a name="60427-35_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 To return first to the point made by the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds), such changes will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure of the House; I hope that that is helpful. On the point raised by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), the Assembly can deal with any relevant related matters once it is up and running and has Executive functions, because such functions will relate to matters pertaining to the Assembly&#039;s areas of responsibility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_329">I point out to all four Members who raised issues relating to clause 3&nbsp;that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of another place has examined it. As the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute knows, the Committee takes a keen interest in these matters, so if we tried to pull a fast one&#151;as the colloquial phrase has it&#151;it would notice. The Committee&#039;s report, available today, points out that the powers in the clause are acceptable, and that another place accepts the principle behind it and the degree of parliamentary scrutiny provided for in clause 4, in accordance with the Committee&#039;s views on such powers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_330">I hope that, in the light of those points, I have reassured the hon. Members for Aylesbury, for Argyll and Bute and for Belfast, North. I look forward to their support for the clause.

 The point still stands, despite the sneaky Tory trick to get me confused. I want the Minister to clarify one important point. In fairness, thanks to the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington), who did some considerable research into the matter, our understanding is that that the reconstituted Assembly would be entitled to modify or repeal any legislation that has been passed, including during suspension. I raise that matter because of a previous suggestion that the Assembly could not alter, modify or repeal legislation that has been passed by Order in Council during suspension. Our understanding&#151;I believe that it is that of the hon. Member for Aylesbury&#151;is that the Assembly is not fettered in that way. It is free to modify any of that legislation. That is important because it is extremely clear to me that we need clarity in the debate and on the record in <i>Hansard</i>, so that there can be no dispute about this matter when the Assembly seeks to modify legislation.

<p><a name="st_321"><a name="60427-37_spnew2"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 What has been striking about the debate has been the clear readiness on the part of all three of the Northern Ireland parties that take their seats in this House to put the dreadful events of the past behind them, however difficult that step may be, and to look to the future. I hope that, with the passage of this Bill, the remaining major party that has, as yet, refused to take its seats in this House will now accept that it must come and take part and accept the same democratic, peaceful nature of politics that is accepted by all other parties here from Northern Ireland constituencies.

<p><a name="st_322"><a name="60427-37_spnew3"><b> Mr. Alan Reid: </b> 
 The Liberal Democrats, too, support the Bill and we are pleased that we have reached Third Reading. The only disappointment is that the Government rejected amendment No. 6. Given that all the Northern Ireland parties that are represented in the House supported it, I hope that the Government will think again and, in another place, will table that amendment or something similar. That was the shared will of the Northern Ireland parties and we hope that the Government will give effect to that. The Government have set a deadline of 24&nbsp;November, which we support. There must be no moving away from that deadline. I hope that the Government will emphasise that that definitely is a deadline.

 I welcome the introduction of the Bill and the fact that we are completing its Third Reading. I hope that the tenor of the Bill and of the debate in the Chamber today and yesterday, which showed what happens when there is a willingness to work forward together, sometimes with a sense of humour&#151;perhaps that was absent in the past&#151;will continue. If we bring that to the round-table conferences that we will be having over the next few months, I sincerely hope, on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland, that we can have a new future and a new beginning based on that total trust that we can have in one another. If we fail, it will be because some parties have put party interests before people. I hope that, in this case, the people win and that we carve out the new beginning in Northern Ireland for which we have striven for nearly 40&nbsp;years. It would be a wonderful achievement if we could do that, not by 24&nbsp;November, but before the summer recess, because I think that that is possible.

<p><a name="st_327"><a name="60427-37_spnew6"><b> Mr. Graham Stuart  (Beverley and Holderness) (Con):</b> 
 It is a great pleasure to stand in the Chamber and talk about an issue that is of great importance to the people of Beverley: the Freemen of Beverley and the Beverley pasture masters. I plan to speak first about the considerable history of the Beverley pasture masters, move on to the threat to their existence and conclude by discussing how we can ensure that the ancient tradition can be preserved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_347">As hon. Members may be aware, the town of Beverley is fortunate enough to have some beautiful common land. It is a source of great pride to Beverley residents, and people travel great distances to enjoy it. There are three common pastures in the town: Beverley Westwood, Figham and Swinemoor. Of those, Beverley Westwood is the largest, at more than 600&nbsp;acres. It was granted to the Beverley freemen in 1380&nbsp;by the Archbishop of York, Alexander Neville, for the sum of &#163;5. Most people who have visited it would consider that to be money well spent. It is a magnificent landmark for the town and has some interesting history.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_348">As the name suggests, there was once a substantial number of trees on the Westwood. They were frequently felled to provide money for the town and to increase the acreage available for grazing stock. In 1584, the corporation sold more than 1,000&nbsp;trees, primarily oak and ash. However, new plantations have been established and the replanting of trees is an integral part of the management of the pasture. The Westwood also has a surviving 19th century mill. In 1853, a look at the ordnance survey map would have shown that five corn windmills were in use at that time, and three still exist in part. The tower of one of them, Black Mill, which was built in 1803, is a prominent local landmark.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_349">The Beverley pasture masters are responsible for managing the three common pastures in Beverley. That has been the case since 1836, when the Beverley freemen, concerned that the recently established local council would not look after the pastures properly, petitioned MPs in the hope of establishing a new law that would guarantee independence for the pastures from local government control. They and other freemen from throughout the country were successful. An Act of Parliament, the pasture Act, which made provision for the annual election of pasture masters by the pasture freemen was duly passed. The election is held on 1&nbsp;March each year and allows for a body of 12&nbsp;pasture masters to be voted in from among the pasture freemen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_350">The pasture Act ensured that the common pastures had total independence from local government decision making. No part of the common land can be disposed of for building or any other purposes. The pasture masters also have the power to pass byelaws to ensure better management of the land. As a result, the unique character of the landscape has not been lost.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_351">However, the pasture masters are under threat. To be admitted as a freeman, one must either be born as the son of an existing freeman, or qualify by servitude. If 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 811</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>one serves as an apprentice under a freeman, one can apply to be admitted as a freeman. However, the number of apprenticeships has declined rapidly in recent years and the craftsmen offering them frequently now tend not to be freemen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-37_para13">
<a name="stpa_352">We are thus left with qualification by birth. To become a freeman of Beverley in that way, one must be born as the son of an existing freeman. Daughters are excluded. One must also be born in the town of Beverley itself. That is fast becoming a problem. In the 19th century, when the tradition of the pasture masters began, people remained in the same town or village for a lifetime. Generations of one family could be found in one place, which meant that the son of a freeman was almost always born in Beverley itself. Today, however, there is greater mobility. Freemen have left Beverley and their children have been born outside the town, so the chain has been broken. The dilemma was compounded nine years ago when the town&#039;s maternity hospital was closed. The only people born in Beverley are those who are born at home.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-37_para14">
<a name="stpa_353">There are now just 100&nbsp;freemen left in the town. Of those, more than half are in their 50s and 60s, and many are in no shape to begin childrearing again. The situation has become so serious that last year, Neil Walker, a Beverley freeman, and his wife decided that they would have a home birth for their unborn baby. That was a conscious decision, made in order to ensure that a son was born in the town. Luckily, the newborn child was indeed a boy. However, even now there is no guarantee that the son will want to remain in Beverley for the rest of his life. There is certainly no guarantee that he will want to be a pasture master. There is, therefore, the very real danger that this ancient body will literally die out unless action is taken. That would be devastating for the town of Beverley.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-37_para15">
<a name="stpa_354">What can be done? Essentially, the problem is down to discrimination against daughters and the requirement that freemen are born in the town itself. The dilemma is not exclusive to Beverley. Many towns and villages up and down the country are affected by that ancient anomaly. What steps have been taken to reverse the injustice? The Minister may be aware that a private Member&#039;s Bill, the Borough Freedom (Family Succession) Bill, is before the House. It would give the daughters of people made freemen of a town the same rights of succession as their male siblings. It would also remove any requirement limiting admission to the freedom of persons born within a borough&#039;s boundaries, meaning that if a freeman moves away from a relevant borough, his son or daughter could still claim succession even though they were born outside the boundaries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-37_para16">
<a name="stpa_355">The Bill has had a tumultuous time in both Houses. It was introduced by Lord Mustill in the other place, first appearing in the 2000&#150;01&nbsp;Session. It did not progress beyond First Reading. Lord Mustill tried again the following year. This time, the Bill did progress through the House of Lords, and was taken up by the then right hon. Member for South-West Surrey, Virginia Bottomley. However, it did not survive the end of the Session. Fast forward a couple of years to the 2004&#150;05&nbsp;Session and a new version was taken up in the other place by Lord Graham of Edmonton. It progressed safely through the House of Lords, and was sponsored in this House by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins).


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-37_para17">
<a name="stpa_356">However, the Bill has now reached a crossroad. Despite sailing through its First Reading, it has stalled at Second Reading, which it has been due to receive on three separate occasions, most recently on 17&nbsp;March. Each time it has been a long way down the list of Bills to be read, and there has not been enough time for full parliamentary debate. Second Reading has been deferred to 20&nbsp;October, when again it is likely to be delayed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-37_para18">
<a name="stpa_357">We therefore have to accept that in all likelihood the Bill will fail. That would be desperately disappointing to the people of Beverley, and to the pasture masters and freemen themselves. They have pinned their hopes on its success. Chris Thompson, chairman of the Beverley pasture masters, said recently:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61">&quot;We are running out of freemen. We are down to about 100, which includes 12&nbsp;pasture masters. We are relying on the Bill to change that situation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-37_para19">
<a name="stpa_358">The Beverley freemen have been trying for five years now to let women, as well as those born outside the town, join their ranks, but to do so requires a change in legislation. I want to pay tribute to the region&#039;s media&#151;the <i>Beverley Guardian</i>, the <i>East Riding Mail</i> and the local BBC, all of which have kept a strong focus on the issue and kept it high on the local agenda.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-37_para20">
<a name="stpa_359">I do not want to test your patience, Madam Deputy Speaker, but I should like the Minister to bear in mind that the issue is not contentious. A change in legislation has wide cross-party support, both in this House and in the other place. Government support would be gratefully received, not just in Beverley, but in the constituency of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central and across the country. I am aware that Members are not supposed to use an Adjournment debate to call for Government legislation on a particular subject, so I shall hesitate from doing so, but if Ministers were able to find a way of rectifying the problem&#151;perhaps by thinking of a creative way to append it to a major Government Bill at some point&#151;they would be doing a great service to that ancient institution of freemen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-37_para21">
<a name="stpa_360">As Lord Graham of Edmonton articulated in the other place in July last year, the freemen are of great sentimental importance to a town. That is certainly the case in Beverley. They are identified with the local community in a way that is much more intimate, continuous and long standing than the exercise of local government franchise or election to local councils. It is a joy in this age to find people who have such a strong allegiance to their community. However, the significance of the freemen is not just ceremonial or sentimental. In Beverley&#039;s case, they are responsible for preserving over 1,000&nbsp;acres of common landscape. It would be a devastating blow to the town if they were to die out. They have been part of Beverley life for hundreds of years. I hope&#151;indeed, I know&#151;that the Minister will bear that in mind when summing up.

<p><a name="st_328"><a name="60427-38_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Jim Fitzpatrick): </b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) on securing this afternoon&#039;s Adjournment debate and on raising an issue of importance not only to the Freemen of Beverley, but to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 813</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>other Guilds of Freemen who similarly want to change their rules of admission. I have read the press releases that the hon. Gentleman issued in advance of the debate. The matter is clearly of concern to him and his constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_361">I shall keep my response to the debate very short. I hope, however, that the hon. Gentleman will take comfort from my remarks and not regard their brevity as in any way lessening the significance of his contribution or of the issue raised by him and by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins).
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_362">As the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness said, my hon. Friend, whom I am pleased to see in his place, is sponsoring a Bill&#151;the Borough Freedom (Family Succession) Bill&#151;which would allow the title to pass to daughters of freemen. Like the hon. Gentleman, I recognise that the procedures for private Members&#039; Bills are such that there is some uncertainty, to say the least, about whether the Bill will make it to the statute book. Having been a Government Whip with some responsibility for private Members&#039; business over a number of years, I know how delicate private Members&#039; Bills can be.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_363">I must say, in honesty and fairness, that having asked my officials to examine the Bill, the Government have grave doubts about whether, as drafted, it would achieve its purpose. As the hon. Gentleman noted, private Members&#039; Bills must overcome considerable obstacles to become legislation, and Government opposition, whether on principle, political or technical, will always prove to be a major hurdle. Nevertheless, we have considerable sympathy with the Bill&#039;s objective. I can therefore assure the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend that, if and when a suitable legislative opportunity presents itself, we will consider providing for Guilds of Freemen to amend their rights of admission locally.
</p>








<p><a name="st_329"><a name="60427-38_spnew0"><b> Mr. Stuart: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister. Will he agree to meet me and the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central to discuss such opportunities?
</p>








<p><a name="st_330"><a name="60427-38_spnew1"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 I am happy to accede to that request. Were the hon. Gentleman to seek a discussion, we could 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Apr 2006 : Column 814</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>explore the technical deficiencies in the Bill, as we see them, and the possibility of moving the matter forward in due course.
</p>








<p><a name="st_331"><a name="60427-38_spnew2"><b> Jim Cousins  (Newcastle upon Tyne, Central) (Lab):</b> 
 Will my hon. Friend consider whether, if an appropriate amendment could be drafted, the Commons Bill before the House as Government legislation might provide an opportunity to consider these matters?
</p>








<p><a name="st_332"><a name="60427-38_spnew3"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 I am not in a position to give an affirmative response to my hon. Friend. I will take the matter back to the Department and ask officials to examine whether the Commons Bill might be an appropriate vehicle. I do not have that information to hand. Were he and the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness to seek a meeting, we could clarify the matter.
</p>








<p><a name="st_333"><a name="60427-38_spnew4"><b> Jim Cousins: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Given the timetable of the Commons Bill, that obviously means that for any meeting with him, time would be pressing.
</p>








<p><a name="st_334"><a name="60427-38_spnew5"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 I do not want to build up hopes among colleagues that there may a way of delivering their ambitions by short-circuiting the legislative process. I do not want to give any false hope that we could expedite the inclusion of relevant provisions in the Commons Bill. I said that the Government were sympathetic to the objective and that we would look for a suitable vehicle. However, such an opportunity may not be forthcoming. I am happy to look at the issue and explore it with colleagues because, as I said, we are sympathetic to their objective of enabling the Freemen of Beverley and others like them to change their rights of succession if they wish to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60427-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_364">With that assurance, I again congratulate the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness on raising an issue of great importance to Guilds of Freemen around the country. In doing so, he has provided the House with a flavour of the history and traditions of one of our oldest institutions. I sincerely hope that progress can be made. I am sure that the hon. Gentlemen who have pressed the issue, both in this debate and in a private Member&#039;s Bill, will do all that they can to ensure that their endeavours are successful.
