The minimal disruption that can be caused in all-through schools is certainly a good thing for local authorities to consider. There are only 25 of them, as I said in my original answer, and it is too early to decide whether they can be rolled out across the country, but they certainly have some benefits and challenges and are something that we are considering.</p>

 Since I became Secretary of State, I have approved 136 new academies, precisely because they show that they can raise standards, including for white boys, in the most disadvantaged areas. Of course, it is disappointing that we have not seen faster progress for white boys, but, as I said, the exam results for pupils from the most deprived backgrounds have increased faster in the past 10 years. That is true for primary and secondary schools and for English and maths.

 My hon. Friend makes an important and interesting point, which I would be happy to debate with him and the Minister for Schools and Learners in due course.

 We have already responded by setting out the way in which we will enhance information, advice and guidance. As the hon. Gentleman knows, a review of the pupil premium is going on at the moment. To be honest, as we have debated previously, a pupil premium could accompany an increase or a reduction in the amount of money that goes to the most disadvantaged. That would depend on whether the budgets were increasing or decreasing, but if we genuinely want to make progress, we have to guarantee that any pupil in years 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 who falls behind will get one-to-one, catch-up tuition to get them back on track. That is in our pupil guarantee and our legislation. Rather than criticising and refusing to back our guarantees, the hon. Gentleman should match and support them.

 My hon. Friend may be interested to know that the largest independent boys' boarding school at present is Eton, with 1,311 pupils, and the largest girls' boarding school is Cheltenham Ladies' College, with 640 pupils. The figure of 5,000 for the number of pupils at a boarding school would, therefore, be unprecedented, and we would obviously have to give very careful consideration to a proposal for a school of that size.</p>

 Significant improvements have been made in primary school standards over the past 12 years, and this year's results are 17 per cent. higher than those of 1997. However, we recognise that there is still more to do to ensure that all children receive a world-class education. Our recent White Paper signalled a new approach to primary school improvement, which will include a comprehensive package of support for schools. We will be announcing detailed plans on that later in the week.</p>

 In seeking to raise primary school standards further, will the Minister look specifically at the teaching of British history, beginning right at the beginning of the curriculum and going through to secondary education, because nothing dismays me more than discovering while taking school parties around the Palace of Westminster that great chunks of British life and history are not known by them. Will the Minister take a serious look at this matter?</p>

 Of course we must recognise that added value is very important, but we should celebrate the fact that our young people are leaving primary school better able to read, write and do their sums. Whereas in 1997 only 43 per cent. of our children could read, write and do their maths, the figure is now 61 per cent., and that is very good. Obviously, we need to improve further, but we have made vast improvements in the past 12 years.</p>

 We estimate that 38 per cent. of current head teachers will have retired by 2015. Dealing with the loss of their skills and experience will be not only a challenge, but an opportunity. We have invested £30 million, through the National College for Leadership of Schools and Children's Services succession planning strategy, to ensure that this demographic challenge is managed effectively.

One of the ways that we can get more head teachers is to keep reminding ourselves and everyone of the excellent job that our head teachers do, of the need for proper leadership in our schools and of the way in which, if we get that effective leadership, we can turn around any sort of school.

 May I say to the hon. Gentleman that the number of young people being excluded from our schools with permanent exclusions has reduced? One of the most effective ways of dealing with behavioural problems in schools is what many schools do across the country-they have a firm code of conduct that is properly enforced with the support of the parents, alongside proper measures within the school to deal with those young people who cause a problem. One of the most effective ways of doing that, which I would encourage-in fact, I did it when I was a deputy head teacher-was to have internal methods of exclusion that keep young people in school and prevent them from having problems outside school while preventing them from undermining the educational entitlement of the other pupils in the class.</p>

Earlier this year, the Schools Minister and I invited local authorities to bid for £200 million of extra investment to meet that demand. Following extensive discussions with the Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Children's Services, I can tell the House that we have further increased this funding and we are today allocating £300 million to create an additional 15,000 primary places for four and five-year-olds across 34 local authorities.</p>

 I was very grateful for the Secretary of State's answer to the first topical question and for the letter that I received from the Minister for Schools and Learners at lunch time about spending in Croydon, because half our emergency primary school places have ended up in temporary classrooms. Why did the Government allow that problem to come into existence? Looking forward to 2011-12 and beyond, will there be money to ensure that primary school places are in permanent buildings?</p>

 Of course, the planning for primary school places is a matter for the local authority, and we have sought to deal with the problems that have emerged in some local authorities with those authorities. As  the hon. Gentleman will know, we have announced £12.8 million for Croydon to deal with the problem that he mentioned. As he pointed out, Kingston and Croydon, as part of the BSF, will have a further £100 million between them to take these issues forward. As for 2011 onwards, that will be a matter for the next spending review, but I know which party I would rather have in power to take that decision.</p>

 I hope that I can avoid detention and set a good example with this question. Will the Secretary of State help me with a reply to the chair of the governors of one of my local schools? On hearing about the Government's proposal for a legal right to a good education, they wrote that schools are heartily sick of receiving one missive after another missive after another, that such a legal right would add to costs and additional time commitment, and that that kind of thinking was out of touch and completely counter to what was needed.

 With permission, let me begin this statement on Afghanistan by once more paying tribute to our armed forces. Since 2001, our forces have been fighting in Afghanistan one of the longest military campaigns of recent times-longer, indeed, than the world wars of the last century-as part of our century's fight against global terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para0"><a name="09113012000178">At all times our armed forces have shown the highest professionalism, dedication and courage, which make them the best and most admired in the world. They have endured heavy and tragic casualties. They deserve our utmost gratitude. Let me acknowledge the presence today, as visitors to the House, of members of 19 Light Brigade who have served with distinction in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para1"><a name="09113012000179">Decisions to extend military action are as critical as those that commence military action. There are two prior questions that people ask of our mission with our American and coalition allies in Afghanistan: one about the present, one about the future. Rightly, both questions have to be answered. The first is why today our armed forces are in Afghanistan, and the second is how and when Afghanistan can take responsibility for its own security so that our troops can come home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para2"><a name="09113012000180">The origins of our intervention in Afghanistan and the scale of the terrorist threat are known to us all. Around the world thousands of men and women of all religions, including thousands of the Muslim faith, have been murdered in al-Qaeda outrages. The London 7 July bombings cost 52 lives and injured more than  750 people. More recently in Britain, we have seen the 2006 Heathrow liquid bombs plot, the 2007 London and Glasgow bombings, and then this year an al-Qaeda-inspired conspiracy to target shopping centres. There are now over 120 convicted terrorists serving sentences in British prisons, and the security services report to me weekly on the hundreds of would-be terrorists who seek to operate within and target our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para3"><a name="09113012000181">To counter that terrorist threat, we have, since 2001, trebled the resources available to our intelligence services and more than doubled the number of operatives. Today, almost twice as many regular police officers are engaged in full-time work to counter the terrorist threat. Suspect travellers are now checked at the border in real time against watch lists; an increasing number of people are excluded on national security grounds from Britain; and, because this is a fight for hearts and minds against violent extremism and those ideologies that would pervert the true Islamic faith, we have stepped up our work with our allies both to expose the damage that murderous and extremist ideologies do and to support those working across all faiths to uphold the common ground of dignity tolerance and respect for all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para4"><a name="09113012000182">So, our security in the United Kingdom and our effort to counteract terrorist propaganda have been, and continue to be, strengthened at all levels. Faced with the terrorist threat, some have argued that the most effective strategy is simply to defend Britain within our own borders-a fortress Britain; and some ask why British troops are in Afghanistan at all, if al-Qaeda can organise in Britain, in Somalia, in Yemen, in other places and, even, in internet chat rooms in every part of the world. But, as long as the Afghan-Pakistani border  <br>

<notus-date day="30" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>30 Nov 2009 : Column 832</b><br>
areas are the location of choice for al-Qaeda and the epicentre of global terrorism, it is the Government's judgment that we must address the terrorist threat at its source. Indeed, as long as three quarters of the most serious terrorist plots against Britain have links to those Pakistani-Afghan border areas, we would be failing in our duty if we did not work with our allies to deal with the problem where it starts. A more stable and secure Afghanistan and Pakistan will help to ensure a safer Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09113012000183">Since 2001, progress has been made in driving al-Qaeda into the mountains of Waziristan. Today, for the first time since 2001, tens of thousands of Pakistani troops are in Waziristan, and, with President Obama, I have been urging Pakistan's leadership, most recently in a conversation with President Zardari on Saturday, to step up its efforts not just against the Pakistani Taliban in that region but against al-Qaeda. So, as an international community, we must intensify our support for the action of the Pakistani authorities, improve co-operation with Pakistan in the months ahead and press ahead with a development programme, amounting to two thirds of a billion pounds over four years, which is focused increasingly on the border areas and on encouraging the development of schools to counter the propaganda of the madrassahs. It is essential that progress in driving al-Qaeda from Afghanistan be matched by actions not simply to isolate but to defeat al-Qaeda within Pakistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09113012000184">Success in driving al-Qaeda into Waziristan has led some to propose that it is now sufficient simply to target al-Qaeda there. To explain why that is an inadequate response, we must understand the al-Qaeda network, its long-standing links with the Afghan Taliban and the extent to which al-Qaeda continues to seek, as in the past, a Taliban-controlled, permissive Afghanistan that would allow it unfettered opportunities to plan and launch with impunity its attacks on Britain and other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09113012000185">So, our task is to prevent the Taliban from giving al-Qaeda that safe haven. Stabilising Afghanistan will not solve all our challenges in Pakistan and elsewhere, but instability in Afghanistan can only increase the risk of conflagration where the rest of the world can least afford it. That is why the safety of people on the streets of Britain requires us to deny al-Qaeda the space to operate across Pakistan and the option of returning  to operate in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09113012000186">That is the considered view of the 43-nation coalition, a unique force of NATO and non-NATO members led by the United States of America and supported by clear United Nations resolutions. Today our purpose is the same as in 2001: to deny al-Qaeda space to operate. But our approach to achieving that has now to be different. In December 2007, our Government became one of the first to suggest that Afghanistan must be prepared to take far greater control of its own security. Since then, we have consistently argued that to weaken the Taliban we have to strengthen the Afghan Government nationally and locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para9"><a name="09113012000187">This approach is built on our knowledge that the Taliban have only minority support among the Afghan people and our judgment that the long-term security of Afghanistan is best secured by training the Afghan army and police, by building up civilian government at a local as well as national level, and through economic development giving Afghans a stake in their future.  <br>

<notus-date day="30" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>30 Nov 2009 : Column 833</b><br>
This has to be supported, as we propose, by stronger international civilian leadership to work alongside General McChrystal to deliver the civilian aspects of this strategy. It is an outline programme for the transfer of lead security responsibilities to the Afghans-district by district, province by province-with the first districts and provinces potentially being handed over during next year. Let us be clear that this process will depend on the Afghans being ready to take responsibility and control: first, through more trained Afghan troops; secondly, through better policing; thirdly, through effective local and national Government; and fourthly, by giving Afghans, as I said, a stronger stake in their economic future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09113012000188">I can also say that over time our objective is to work for and to encourage a new set of relationships between Afghanistan and its neighbours based on their guarantee of non-interference in Afghanistan's future affairs and on a commitment to fostering not only its long-term economic and cultural links with other powers in the region but immediate confidence-building security measures from which all can benefit. So I want the London conference on Afghanistan to be held on 28 January, which President Karzai and the Secretary-General of the United Nations have confirmed they will attend, to unite the international community behind a programme now and for the longer term to help the Afghans to secure and govern their own country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para11"><a name="09113012000189">Against this background, our coalition military strategy is essentially to create the space for an effective political strategy to work, weakening the Taliban by strengthening Afghanistan itself: a military surge, yes, but complemented by a political surge that is, most of all, an Afghan surge. Today I want to set out the benchmarks for this approach and then, and in that context, to give details of the numbers and deployments of our armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para12"><a name="09113012000190">First, over the coming year, the coalition seeks a major expansion of the Afghan army from 90,000 to 134,000. We expect this surge in recruitment to allow an extra 10,000 troops to be deployed in Helmand, of which 5,000 will be trained and partnered by British forces. And we can start now. Six hundred Afghan soldiers are arriving in Helmand this month-an extra company for each Afghan battalion there. A further 10 Afghan companies-1,000 more troops-will soon reinforce the Afghan army's 205 Corps across southern Afghanistan. Increasingly, therefore, it will be Afghan forces that clear and hold ground as they prepare for the time when they can assume responsibility for their own security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para13"><a name="09113012000191">Secondly, within the next six months, the international community will agree with President Karzai's Government a police reform plan. We have agreed that, in Helmand, Afghan police numbers will increase immediately to 4,100, with further increases to follow. By mid-2010, the capacity of the Helmand police training centre that we have established in Lashkar Gar will be doubled, and we will double the numbers of police trainers provided by the Royal Military Police from 100 this year to 200 next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para14"><a name="09113012000192">Thirdly, there needs to be an effective and accountable local administration. Over the next nine months, President Karzai will be expected to implement, with our support and that of our international partners, far-reaching reforms to ensure that from now on all 400 provinces and districts have a governor appointed on merit, free from corruption with clearly defined roles, skills and  <br>

resources. District community shuras have been formed in Nad Ali, in Garmsir, in Gereshk and in Nawa, with more to come. Nationwide, the number of community development councils will increase within two years from 22,000 to 31,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para15"><a name="09113012000193">Fourthly, there should be a clean, effective and inclusive national Government in Kabul-one that reaches out to political leaders and citizens from all strands of Afghan society. While President Karzai has agreed with us on the priority of tackling corruption with a new anti-corruption taskforce-and last week the arrest of 12 leading officials took place-we recognise that the test is not initiatives but delivery on the ground, and we will monitor carefully what President Karzai's Administration are doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para16"><a name="09113012000194">We support President Karzai's call for a Loya Jirga and for reconciliation. It is the task of military forces-international and Afghan-to weaken and pressurise the insurgency, but it is right and essential that this work is combined with the offer of a way forward for those prepared to renounce violence and to choose to join the political process. Reintegration can only be led, and must be led, by Afghans themselves at both national and local levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para17"><a name="09113012000195">For Afghanistan to enjoy stability in the future, farmers and working people in towns and villages must have a greater stake in that economic future: a major Afghan-led programme backed by significant funding to identify the likely growth areas in the Afghan economy, and to provide Afghans with credible economic alternatives  to the poppy and the insurgency. With 20 per cent. more land growing wheat, this year's wheat harvest is expected to be the highest in 30 years. Programmes funded by our development Department will this year create 20,000 jobs in this area, and by 2013 will be able to raise the incomes of 200,000 people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para18"><a name="09113012000196">I turn now to the details of our force levels and  our deployments. In my statement to the House on 14 October, I said that to support our strategy of Afghanisation-and particularly to train more Afghan soldiers and police, while at the same time maintaining the security of our forces-the Government had agreed in principle a new force level of 9,500, to be implemented once three conditions were met. I can report on each of these conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="91130-0004.htm_para19"><a name="09113012000197">First, I made it clear that we would increase the number of British personnel in Afghanistan only if we were assured that it would continue to be the case that every soldier and unit deployed is fully equipped for the operations they are asked to undertake. At this morning's meeting of our Afghanistan and Pakistan national security committee, the Chief of the Defence Staff gave that assurance-that this condition has been met both for the existing force and the additional 500 troops. Indeed, the chiefs report to me the continuing delivery of new equipment. Newly arrived Merlin helicopters have today been given the "green light" for operations in Afghanistan, a month ahead of schedule. Compared with three years ago, we have doubled helicopter flying hours; in the coming months, these will increase by a further 20 per cent.</p>

The number of Ridgback-a smaller, more agile version of the Mastiff-will have increased by over 75 per cent. By spring next year, they will be joined by more Mastiffs adapted for explosive  <br>

disposal work and new Warthog tracked vehicles, showing the results of our investment over the last three years of more than £1 billion from the Treasury reserve in vehicles for Afghanistan. By the end of this year also, the build-up of a 200-strong counter-improvised explosive device task force, along with the dedicated equipment necessary, will be complete. In addition, aerial surveillance hours available to commanders have increased by over 40 per cent., and a further 200 specialist troops will be deployed against IEDs by spring 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para1"><a name="09113012000199">Three years ago, equipment and support for our forces deployed to Afghanistan, funded from the Treasury reserve, was estimated at around £190,000 supporting each individual there. This year it is more than double that-around £400,000 and still rising-and the best possible support and equipment is what we owe those who are fighting for our country in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para2"><a name="09113012000200">I said, secondly, that our contribution of 9,500 must be part of an agreed approach across the international coalition, with all countries bearing their share-a coalition whose principal member and largest troop contributor is of course the United States of America, and we continue regular discussions with the President and his team about the coalition's evolving strategy. America, as everyone knows, will make an announcement tomorrow, and the Secretary-General of NATO-I pay tribute to his work-reports that, in addition to the UK and the USA, eight countries have already made offers of additional troops and that other countries are likely to follow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para3"><a name="09113012000201">It is often said that America and Britain are fighting alone. This is wrong: excluding America and Britain, the numbers of international coalition troops will have risen from 16,000 troops in January 2007 to around 30,000 soon, and I believe that over the coming months even more countries will respond. Our effort in Helmand will benefit. Last year, total international force levels in the province were around 7,000; now they will be above 20,000-three times what they were.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para4"><a name="09113012000202">Our third condition for deploying additional British troops was that the military effort of the international coalition must be matched by Afghan effort. President Karzai and his Defence Minister have assured us not only that 5,000 members of the new Afghan national army corps will be deployed to Helmand to be partnered by British troops during 2010, but that additional recruits will arrive for training in the next few weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para5"><a name="09113012000203">So with the three conditions now met, I can confirm that we will move to a new force level of 9,500; that the extra troops will deploy in early December to thicken the UK troop presence in central Helmand; and that from late January they will make the transition to the partnering role that we envisage for them. For understandable reasons of operational security, we shall continue to withhold information about their deployment and the nature of activities of our special forces, but at this time of increasing international effort, it is right to give a more comprehensive account of our total military commitment to the Afghanistan campaign. I believe that the British people have a right to know, and deserve the assurance, that our highly professional, widely respected and extraordinarily brave special forces are playing their full role not only in force protection but in taking the fight directly to the Taliban, working in theatre alongside our regular forces. I want the whole country to pay tribute to their work.</p>

That force level enables us to deliver our military strategy of bringing security to the population. It will support our political strategy of strengthening the Afghan Government at national and local level, as they in return take steps to govern in a clearer, more effective and more inclusive way. It will accelerate the development of the Afghan army and police, so that in time they can take over responsibility for security and thus ensure that our troops can come home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para7"><a name="09113012000205">We are ensuring as best we can the safety of our forces, and we are today setting benchmarks for Afghanistan to meet. In the past few months, we have worked hard to achieve a stronger military presence across the coalition, with a more equal sharing of the burden, and in all we do we will never forget this fundamental truth of the military campaign: that keeping the streets of our country free from terrorism is our utmost responsibility, and that for a safe Britain, we need a stable Afghanistan. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o117"><a name="09113012000206"><a name="91130-0005.htm_spnew0"><a name="09113012000578"><b>Mr. David Cameron (Witney) (Con):</b>
 I thank the Prime Minister for his statement, but before turning to Afghanistan, may I start by putting right something I got wrong last week? Although the two Islamic schools I mentioned got Government money while being run by people linked to the extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, and although they did receive that money under a pathfinder scheme, it was not the pathfinder scheme concerned with combating extremism. I am sorry for the error-I believe that when one gets a fact wrong, one should put it right-but I continue to believe that it is wrong that taxpayers' money goes to schools run by extremists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para8"><a name="09113012000207">In Afghanistan, 235 British service personnel and Ministry of Defence staff have lost their lives and many more have been injured. That is a high price to pay, so first I endorse absolutely what the Prime Minister said about our forces. They are doing an extraordinary job, and they have the admiration and support of our whole country. We also back the reason for being in Afghanistan-that is, to enable Afghans to look after their own security without presenting a danger to the rest of the world. The sooner that happens, the sooner our forces can come home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para9"><a name="09113012000208">I want to ask the Prime Minister today about three matters: first, the political and military surge; secondly, the conference that is planned for January; and thirdly, the timetable that he has set out for handing over provinces and districts to Afghan control. On the 500 additional British troops, this is the same further deployment that the Prime Minister announced on 14 October, as he said, subject to the three conditions being met. Let me ask a little more about the three conditions. The first was burden sharing among NATO allies. He told the House on 18 November that he was in touch with eight allies about increasing their contribution, and he repeated the figure of eight allies today. Can he tell us which countries have pledged more troops, how many troops there will be in total, when they will be deployed and how many of them will go to Helmand?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para10"><a name="09113012000209">The second condition was to ensure the forces had the necessary equipment. The Prime Minister today tells us that they will have that equipment. I have to say  <br>

that that is a test set by the Government and then judged by the Government. Although what he said about helicopters is welcome, is it not the case that in pro rata support, the US forces in Helmand have far more helicopters available to them? Is it not also the case that the Merlins, which the Prime Minister mentioned, are unconnected to the 500 troops that we will deploy because the Merlins were ordered a long time previously? It is worth making the point that if the Prime Minister had not personally cut £1.4 billion off the helicopter programme, we would not be in the situation that we are in today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para11"><a name="09113012000210">The third condition was that additional Afghan forces would deploy to Helmand. The Prime Minister helpfully gave us the figures today. Will he assure us that they will remain in Helmand once deployed? Is it still the case, as was reported to me, that fewer than 10 per cent. of Afghan forces are in Helmand province, even though almost half the fighting in Afghanistan takes place there?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para12"><a name="09113012000211">The Prime Minister has set out some clear benchmarks for the Karzai Government. Why are we setting out such conditions only now, three and a half years after our forces arrived in Helmand? On the detail, is it really credible to deal with corruption in the police in the Prime Minister's six-month timetable when we have not managed it in the past three and a half years?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para13"><a name="09113012000212">On what the Prime Minister said about appointing provincial governors, since my understanding is that most are already in place, what exactly does he mean by that pledge? Does he mean that some current governors must be replaced?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para14"><a name="09113012000213">Let us consider the London conference. The Prime Minister also mentioned the Loya Jirga. Does he now believe that the Bonn settlement got it wrong and that the constitution in Afghanistan is too centralised? We have been pressing for some time for the appointment of a senior international figure to help drive forward the political strategy. Does the Prime Minister believe that that will now happen? Will he take up our suggestion of creating a permanent contact group of Afghanistan's neighbours to help deliver stability?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para15"><a name="09113012000214">On Pakistan, some of Prime Minister's remarks at the weekend, reported in the press, seem rather different from what he has said in the Chamber in recent weeks. When I asked him in October about Pakistan, he went out of his way to defend the way in which Pakistan was planning to take on al-Qaeda. As he put it, the Pakistan Government were</p>
<a name="91130-0005.htm_brev0"><a name="09113012000426"><ul><p class="tabletext">"planning how to deal with not only the Pakistan Taliban but the Afghan Taliban and al-Qaeda itself."-[<i> Official Report, </i>14 October 2009; Vol. 497, c. 305.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para16"><a name="09113012000215">He described that as "encouraging". However, he has now gone out of his way to criticise Pakistan for failing to deal with al-Qaeda. Will he tell us a little more about what has changed in his thinking about the approach?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para17"><a name="09113012000216">There has also been much speculation, following what the Prime Minister said in Trinidad, about timetables for handover. The statement to the House is slightly different from the briefing given to the press at the weekend. He says that he wants the London conference to determine the conditions for transferring provinces and districts to Afghan control. Yet he also said, not to the House, but in Trinidad, that he wants to see at least five provinces transferred to Afghan "security lead" by  <br>

the end of 2010, and that he believed that that would be possible for "one or two" districts in Helmand. How can the Prime Minister be confident of that timetable before the London conference has even met and set the benchmarks? Naturally we all want our troops to come home as soon as possible-as soon as their job is done. However, does the Prime Minister agree that we must never say or do anything that gives the impression to the Taliban that we will not see this through? Nor should we raise any false hope or expectation among the families of British forces that may later be dashed. Can he therefore assure the country and our forces, as we approach the general election, that any suggestion about timetables for handover will be based on a hard-headed assessment of the situation on the ground? Is not it the case that the British public want us to do what is right-not speculate and risk the danger of raising  false hopes?</p>

 First, I want to thank the Leader of the Opposition for his continuing support for the work of our forces in Afghanistan. In spite of the detailed comments that he made on some issues, we should get this in proper perspective. We are fighting terrorism and fighting al-Qaeda in Pakistan, but to do that successfully we must prevent them from having space in Afghanistan. Our plan for Afghanistan is not simply a military strategy-although that is central and fundamental to what we are doing-but a political strategy that, over time, the Afghan people can take more responsibility and more control over their own affairs. I do not think that I could have been clearer in saying that our objectives are not limited by date, but by achievement. The achievement of Afghan control and the ability of the Afghan people to take responsibility for their security is the determining issue in all that. We are making not a time-specific, but a task-specific commitment about what we need to do.</p>

I said-he probably picked me up wrongly-that eight countries had pledged more troops in Afghanistan and that I expected more countries to do so in the run up to the conference on 28 January next year.</p>

 I also said that President Karzai had promised that 5,000 Afghan forces would be transferred to Helmand to partner with British forces over the coming year. I also said that those recruits were starting to come now into Helmand and would be deployed with British forces in holding ground in the area in the months to come. I have said previously that the imbalance between the numbers of Afghan forces in Helmand and elsewhere has had to be addressed, and this is one way of doing that. In total, 10,000 of the Afghan forces will be trained in Helmand over the next few months.</p>

Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) suggested that I should name all the countries concerned, but it is for them to make their own announcements.

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para21"><a name="09113012000223">As for our own troops and their equipment, the Chief of the Defence Staff talked this morning about the increase in ground forces in Helmand. He said:</p>
<a name="91130-0005.htm_brev1"><a name="09113012000427"><ul><p class="tabletext">"We have a third more protective patrol vehicles and helicopters have gone up by a third too.

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para22"><a name="09113012000224">The Leader of the Opposition also asked about the conference on 28 January. It is designed to bring the international community together. I said in my statement-again, he cannot have picked this up-that we wanted a new international co-ordinator to deal with the problems of civilian and military co-operation that have arisen in Afghanistan. I hope that when the UN appointee Mr. Eide is replaced, we will be able to consider in more detail the overall co-ordination of that effort. At the conference in January, we will also want to discuss how the neighbours of Afghanistan can come together to give guarantees about Afghanistan's security and its freedom from interference in the future, and at the same time how to support the economic and social development of the country. That was covered in my statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para23"><a name="09113012000225">Other countries may wish to make announcements about troops and force generation in connection with the conference. The issue of constitutional reform, and the possibility of a constitutional reform commission for Afghanistan, may be the subject of remarks that President Karzai may want to make. We also want further agreement on how we can transfer lead security responsibility to the Afghan people. The conference, which all countries involved in Afghanistan will want to consider attending and which will be attended by President Karzai, will be an important milestone in the development of the policy of the international community in co-operation with Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para24"><a name="09113012000226">The Leader of the Opposition also raised issues in connection with Pakistan. It is right that 30,000 Pakistan troops are now in Waziristan and are taking on the Pakistan Taliban, as well as isolating and cornering al-Qaeda. This is an important development. Over the last few months, perhaps the most significant thing that has happened in the region is that the Pakistan Government and all Pakistan authorities, including the opposition parties, have recognised that if they do not take action against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, they themselves will fall victim to terrorism within their own country, as well as allow international terrorism to flourish in Pakistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para25"><a name="09113012000227">As I have said in the House on several occasions, it is an important development that Pakistan is now taking action in those areas. It is also necessary, however-as has been made clear by President Obama to the Pakistan authorities, and as I made clear to President Zardari on Saturday-for more action to be taken if al-Qaeda is operating within Pakistan and seeking further space to operate there. It is the duty of the Pakistan authorities to work with all international partners to attempt to isolate and destroy al-Qaeda in Pakistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para26"><a name="09113012000228">I do not think that there is any contradiction in what I have said. It is important to recognise what Pakistan has done, but it is important also to recognise that for the past eight years, al-Qaeda has been able to send instructions from Pakistan to the rest of the world and to organise, from Pakistan, terrorist attacks that have affected every continent. That is why we want the Pakistan authorities to act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para28"><a name="09113012000231">It has finally become mainstream to talk about the need for a big shift in our strategy in Afghanistan. When I first questioned the effectiveness of our action there six months ago and called for precisely such a step change, I was told that it was unpatriotic to do so. The Prime Minister's change of tone since then has been dramatic and welcome. Our approach to our mission in Afghanistan has always been simple: we should do it properly or not do it at all. So does the Prime Minister agree that success is not just about troop numbers, and that focusing on troop numbers, as he has done today, to the exclusion of other things is putting the cart before the horse?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para29"><a name="09113012000232">There is no point in sending a single extra soldier unless the strategy that our troops need to succeed in their mission is in place. So why is the Prime Minister making any announcements about troop numbers today, when we will not know until President Obama's announcement tomorrow what the new strategy is and what chances it has of success? I have in the past criticised the Prime Minister for keeping quiet over Afghanistan and failing to speak out in support of our troops and their mission. Has he not now swung a little too far in the opposite direction, seeking to make an announcement on troop numbers before we know whether the things are in place that would allow them to succeed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="91130-0005.htm_para30"><a name="09113012000233">We know from previous successful peacekeeping missions, such as those in the Balkans, that we cannot succeed unless we have the support of all the big regional powers. In Afghanistan that does not mean just Pakistan, China and Russia; it also means Iran, which is now at loggerheads with the west over its unacceptable announcement of 10 new nuclear facilities. Can the Prime Minister tell us how he will find a way to take a tough stance with Iran while seeking to keep it engaged in securing peace in Afghanistan?</p>

What happens if President Karzai does not achieve those benchmarks? What efforts are the Prime Minister and others in the alliance making to develop a plan B of bypassing Karzai's Government in Kabul and instead dealing directly with local and regional government? I am sure that the Prime Minister agrees with me that, given Karzai's record on corruption, we should not hold our breath for him to change, but work on finding ways to succeed without him if he does not.</p>

We agree that that will require the extra military numbers that we are putting in theatre, but so too are other countries. We agree that that has to be complemented by a political strategy which, as I have argued for quite a long time, has to involve building up the Afghan army and police, strengthening local and national government by freeing it from corruption while at the same time giving people an economic stake in the future. I believe that on all these things, we are agreed.</p>

What we have to insist upon is that the promises they have made about cleaning up the corruption that is obvious in Afghanistan, and their promises about delivering troops that can be trained in theatre with Britain and other coalition allies, are upheld. The test, of course, is not the words that are in addresses and statements; the test is in actual delivery. That is why I have put more force on what has been done in the last few days since President Karzai started his second term than on the statements made before these early days. It is important to recognise that troops are being provided, that an anti-corruption task force is being set up and that people have been arrested. More, of course, has to be done, but we have seen a start to delivery on a number of key issues that we put to President Karzai and demanded he made commitments to.</p>

Gentleman that we must ensure that all our troops have the best equipment possible. The truth is, as he knows, that we have had to move from a situation of face-to-face conflict with the Taliban to a guerrilla war conducted by Taliban members through the use of explosive devices to damage our morale and also to damage and kill our troops.</p>

There is contact between these al-Qaeda operatives and people in the United Kingdom.

As for naming the countries that have offered troops, it is possible for me to refer to statements made by different leaders in different countries, but I think that the announcements should be made by those leaders themselves. No doubt the Secretary-General of NATO will want to make a comprehensive announcement soon.

We also need military intelligence and engineers in the theatre who are enabled to dismantle these weapons, which have caused so much destruction.</p>

 Having campaigned over the last four years for more protected vehicles with v-shaped hulls, I welcome the increased numbers of Mastiffs and Ridgbacks being delivered to theatre. Is the Prime Minister confident that the extra troops being sent to Afghanistan will not have the opposite effect to that which is intended-to exacerbate the situation, as has happened in the past? Could this not be history repeating itself?</p>

 No, I do not believe so. As I have said, we have had to adjust to a change in tactics by the Taliban. They are fighting what is in effect a guerrilla war and we have to change the techniques we use to deal with them. By having properly protected vehicles, surveillance of IEDs and intelligence backing up the military work of our troops in the field, I believe we are doing the right thing. The necessary surge in numbers in the parts of Afghanistan that have been subject to the greatest violence will be complemented by a political strategy, whereby if we take ground, it will increasingly be Afghan forces who hold the ground. Therefore, far from being seen as an occupying force, by partnering with Afghan forces we shall enable them over time to take security responsibility for their country.</p>

 Does the Prime Minister accept that a different analysis could be put on this? The vast increase in American troops due tomorrow-apparently-the increase of British troops to more than 10,000 and the demands on other countries look more and more like a colonial occupation, with all the demands that have been placed on the civilian administration in Afghanistan and apparently virtual control of it. Will that not just increase opposition there, in Pakistan and in neighbouring countries? Will it not actually make the situation worse, so that British troops may be there not just for another year, but for another eight years?</p>

 The question my hon. Friend has to ask himself is whether he believes that the Afghan Taliban, who are responsible for the denial of human rights, particularly to women, have the political support of the people of Afghanistan or not. All the recent evidence we have seen is that only a small minority of the population of Afghanistan support the Taliban. Even part of the insurgency includes people who are mercenaries, who are paid for their work and have no ideological commitment to what the Taliban say. In some cases, nationalists fighting with the Taliban can be detached from them by an effective Afghan Government and the process of reconciliation. If my hon. Friend starts from the proposition that the insurgency has massive support in Afghanistan, he may of course reach the conclusion that it is a mistake for us to work with the elected Afghan Government and the Afghan people to defeat that insurgency, but I start from the proposition that the Taliban have limited support in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para1"><a name="09113012000320">Last week, the two regulatory bodies took action in respect of two NHS foundation trusts, Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust, and I wish to update the House on that. Separately, questions have been raised about safety standards at other NHS and foundation trusts. I wish to answer those directly and inform the House of the further steps that the Government are taking to improve regulation and safety standards in the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para2"><a name="09113012000321">First, let me set out some important points of context. In 1999, the Government established an independent regulator for the NHS. In tandem, the Department of Health has sought to shine a spotlight on patient safety in the NHS over the past decade by encouraging the systematic publication, analysis and comparison of a range of clinical data. That followed the Kennedy inquiry into events at Bristol. That drive has brought more transparency and a greater focus on safety standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para3"><a name="09113012000322">At all times, patient safety is our overriding concern, and there are signs of significant progress in the NHS as a whole. Overall, there was a 7 per cent. reduction in the hospital mortality rate in England last year. However, there is never any room for complacency, and patient safety must be the subject of a continuous process of improvement. There is still considerable variation in standards throughout the NHS, from one hospital to another, and in some cases the variation is unacceptably wide. That is the case in respect of Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para4"><a name="09113012000323">A year ago, surveillance of data by regulators identified a high hospital standardised mortality ratio at the trust. Since then, the regulators have worked with the trust on a detailed improvement plan. That focus had brought improvements, and over the course of this year the HSMR has fallen. However, following unannounced inspections, the Care Quality Commission has raised further concerns with the foundation trust regulator, Monitor, about care standards and the rate of improvement. They agreed that progress was not sufficient, and it was felt that the trust was unable to deliver the improvements necessary within an acceptable time scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para5"><a name="09113012000324">A decision was therefore taken to intervene and use formal powers by installing new clinical leadership at the trust. Two senior professionals from high-performing trusts will provide experienced medical and nursing support to ensure the early implementation of agreed clinical and nursing changes. A programme delivery office has also been established to oversee delivery. I can assure the House that, as a result of this action, I expect to see immediate improvements and will provide regular updates on progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para6"><a name="09113012000325">Monitor has also taken action in recent days in respect of Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust. Last Friday, the regulator used its statutory powers to remove the chairman of the trust. Monitor had, over a period of time, raised a series of concerns with the trust in relation to performance and governance. It has   <br>

concluded that those have not been adequately addressed and decided that new leadership is necessary to bring the improvements that patients have a right to expect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para7"><a name="09113012000326">I wish to make it clear to the House that the CQC has informed me that no similar action is necessary at any other trust at this stage. As part of regular monitoring, however, it has identified a small number of other trusts where action is needed to address concerns, and over the weekend there has been further analysis of safety in the NHS. Twelve NHS and foundation trusts have been claimed to be "significantly under-performing" in relation to safety, and a number have a high hospital standardised mortality ratio. While I welcome the shining of a spotlight on to safety standards, it is important to place this finding in context. Given that deaths in hospital have reduced overall-by 7 per cent.-it is possible that the trusts with a high rate are not showing the same level of improvement as the rest. That said, it is vital that these questions are investigated and answered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para8"><a name="09113012000327">It is also important to point out that the report by  Dr. Foster analysed a more limited set of clinical and quality data than the CQC. The CQC therefore provides the authoritative voice on these issues, and takes a wider view. The report highlights a number of trusts where there have been issues, but many had already identified them and have action in hand. I can assure the House, however, that where legitimate concerns have been identified, they will be followed up. Again, I will provide updates as and where necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para9"><a name="09113012000328">Patient safety must at all times be the highest priority for my Department, the national health service and every single hospital in the country. I expect every trust in England to investigate all serious incidents and unexpected deaths and report them to the national reporting and learning system. This will be mandatory as part of new registration requirements. Following events at Mid-Staffordshire hospital, hospital standardised mortality ratios for all hospitals in England have been published on NHS Choices since April 2009. From next April, the CQC will introduce a stronger inspection regime that provides an in-depth analysis of trust performance in real time. This will also be available online for the public to inspect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para10"><a name="09113012000329">However, as a result of concerns expressed, I have asked the Department to speed up the implementation of this new system and will bring it in from January. Already, 90 per cent. of CQC inspections are unannounced. I wish to see this at least maintained in any new system, with more unannounced visits at trusts giving cause for concern. All trusts will soon be required to screen for MRSA when admitting patients through accident and emergency. Many already do, but I am asking the Department to speed up 100 per cent. adoption. I will also shortly bring forward plans to link hospital payment more closely to safety and quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para11"><a name="09113012000330">Lord Darzi's next stage review made it the mission of the NHS to focus relentlessly on safety and quality. All trusts must constantly review performance and, where necessary, raise their game. Progress has been made, but where it is not quick or good enough we will always  say so and act swiftly. I commend the statement to the House.</p>

at NHS foundation trusts, notwithstanding the fact that he is not directly responsible for what happens in those trusts. However, if he is going to take some responsibility, can he explain what he did on or after 4 November, when the inspection report into the prevention and control of infections at Basildon and Thurrock was published on the CQC website, including many of the findings that have subsequently caused so much distress to the patients and public around Basildon and Thurrock? Was Thursday's press release about the intervention  by Monitor merely a sacrificial lamb ahead of the Dr. Foster report?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para12"><a name="09113012000332">Now that the taskforce has gone into the Basildon and Thurrock trust, does the Secretary of State agree that it is vital that, within days, it advises Monitor on whether the trust has, or does not have, the necessary leadership, clinical and otherwise, to take it forward for the future?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para13"><a name="09113012000333">Earlier this month, Monitor made it clear that it was considering intervention at Colchester because the trust appeared to have breached the terms of its authorisation. Did the Secretary of State have any correspondence with Monitor about that, and did he have a view about it at the time?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para14"><a name="09113012000334">In his statement today, the Secretary of State seems to have been talking almost interchangeably about the CQC and Monitor, but it will be evident to many, as it was to me, that they were not speaking from the same page in relation to Basildon last Thursday and Friday. Will the Secretary of State, like me, make it clear to the CQC and Monitor that the relationship between those two regulators will have to be closer and more harmonious than it has been in the past if it is to work effectively?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para15"><a name="09113012000335">The Secretary of State's statement centred on two individual trusts, but the repercussions will be felt across the country, not least because of the worrying data in the Dr. Foster report, none of which should come as any surprise to the Secretary of State. However, instead of listening to the messages in the report, the Government set out over the weekend to shoot the messengers. They are quite wrong to do so, and that will not restore public confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para16"><a name="09113012000336">What is required, I am afraid, is evidence that the Government learn from the lessons of these serial failings. Why do I literally have to stand at this Dispatch Box again responding to issues very similar to those we saw at Maidstone and Stafford? Ministers each time call it an isolated case; each time they say, "We mustn't be complacent and it must never again happen"; but each time they fail to tackle the heart of the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para17"><a name="09113012000337">We know that the NHS is capable of delivering some of the best health care in the world; we know that some hospitals-such as my own, Addenbrooke's, in Cambridge-are among the best in the country and do remarkably well. However, to understand why some hospitals do not deliver acceptable standards, we just have to look at the lessons of the recent past: Stoke Mandeville, 2006; Maidstone, 2007; Mid Staffs, March this year; today, Basildon and Thurrock trust. Recurrent themes have occurred in each of those hospitals: waiting time targets prioritised over patient care; clinical priorities distorted by Government targets; a focus on financial issues at the expense of patient care; senior management at board and strategic health authority level prioritising national targets and policy objectives over the delivery of quality care for patients; primary care trusts focused  <br>

on the cost and volume of treatments, rather than performance management of the quality of care for their public; and a lack of leadership and accountability, with front-line staff finding that the concerns they have raised are not being listened to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para18"><a name="09113012000338">When will the Secretary of State acknowledge that the Government must do something about this, and in particular scrap the top-down process targets that divert attention away from patient care towards tick-box questionnaires? It is clear that, where the regulatory system is concerned, the Government will have to abandon the health check published by the CQC last month. Will the Secretary of State agree that he should do so and instead have a rating system that actually relates to what patients experience in hospital and the results of the treatment they receive; that is based on outcomes, not processes; that has more on-the-spot inspections; that is based on patient experience and their reports of their outcomes; and that follows up unresolved complaints?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para19"><a name="09113012000339">Another reform is to give patients and the public the power to influence how care is provided in the NHS. The Government scrapped community health councils and have never since allowed there to be an effective patient voice in the local community. Will the Secretary of State ensure legal protection for staff who blow the whistle on failings in their trusts, and that the NHS adopts, as it must, a "no-blame" culture in which the penalty is for the cover-up, not the error?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para20"><a name="09113012000340">The public need to be assured that the Government are doing all that can be done to ensure the safety of patients in our hospitals, but today, how can they be? We have conflicting analyses from Dr. Foster and the CQC. We have Ministers out of their depth and in denial. We have an NHS that has the capacity to deliver the best, but with neither the incentives nor the leadership in place to make it happen. What did we get from the Secretary of State? We got processes, rather than purpose, and another statement that "this must never happen again". It is just not good enough.</p>

 I will deal with the hon. Gentleman's questions in turn, but let me deal first with his last point. I think he was accusing us of complacency, or of failing to address directly the issues that matter to patients. Ever since coming into this job, I have said that I do not want to over-claim for the NHS. Where it is good we should say so, but where there needs to be improvement, we will not flinch from taking the action necessary to get it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para21"><a name="09113012000342">It is important for the hon. Gentleman to acknowledge that the data on which the judgments in question are being made have been encouraged by this Government, following some of the events that he mentioned. The culture of challenge and analysis of clinical data has been at the heart of our plans for improving the NHS, which is why what he said was unfair and misdirected. It was this Government who asked the regulators to use the HSMR data to ensure that there was challenge. Because the Healthcare Commission, the predecessor to the CQC, was looking at those data, it was able to take the action that it did in relation to Mid Staffordshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para22"><a name="09113012000343">I will always accept hearing from the hon. Gentleman that we can do more and should not be complacent, but I point out to him that there is no complacency. We have made changes, and thinking back to what was in place   <br>

before, I do not believe that it was possible to make judgments about the clinical standard and safety of care across the NHS, as it is today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para23"><a name="09113012000344">I shall deal with some of the hon. Gentleman's specific points. He particularly asked me about 4 November, when the report was submitted by the CQC. He has to accept that, as I said in my statement, the matter goes back further than that. Because of the system of regulation that we have, and because there is routine monitoring of data, action had been taken much earlier and the two regulators had been in contact about Basildon and Thurrock NHS foundation trust. Action was in hand and a plan had been developed, and it was because the regulators felt that progress against that plan had not been sufficiently swift that they decided to escalate their involvement. It is not fair of the hon. Gentleman to say that there was a knee-jerk response, because there had been a long process in place that had failed to produce the necessary improvements, and an unannounced visit by the CQC in October highlighted some of the concerns that then required the escalation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para24"><a name="09113012000345">On Colchester, the hon. Gentleman will know that Monitor has been expressing concerns about standards for some time and has been in dialogue with the trust. I support the regulator, in this case Monitor, in taking the action that it believes is necessary to improve standards for patients quickly. I shall make no apology for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para25"><a name="09113012000346">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the relationship between the CQC and Monitor, and I agree that there needs to be close co-operation between the two regulators. I accept that there were lessons to be learned following the events at Mid Staffordshire about how that relationship could be improved, and I accept that he is right to say so, but there has been close co-operation on Basildon and Thurrock, and that has led to the action that I have described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para26"><a name="09113012000347">On Dr. Foster, the hon. Gentleman asked, "Why shoot the messenger?", but I do not believe that the Government did that. As I said, we have encouraged the publication of the relevant data across the NHS. He needs to take a step back, if he does not mind my saying so, because the patient safety rating in this case is disputed by some of the trusts in question. He will have seen yesterday that some of them issued a pretty strong rebuttal to the concerns raised, and that is all part of the process of challenge. We did not dismiss the Dr. Foster findings; indeed, it was on the back of those concerns that I asked to be assured that no action similar to that taken at Basildon and Colchester needed to be taken against any other NHS trust. I received that assurance from the chair of the CQC over the weekend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="91130-0008.htm_para27"><a name="09113012000348">As he always does, the hon. Gentleman made a big criticism of Government targets and suggested that they run counter to improving patient safety in the NHS. The best hospitals are both meeting performance standards targets that matter to patients and financial targets, and providing high-quality, safe care.</p>

I am not sure that he wants to make that claim. I remind him-it almost seems to have slipped his memory and that of his colleagues-that the patients charter circa 1995 included a four-hour A and E standard, and a proposal to reduce that target to two  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="91130-0009.htm_para1"><a name="09113012000350">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the need for patient feedback and I agree that there is a need for better feedback from patients about the standards of care that they receive. That is why we introduced NHS Choices, with the ability for patients to put their comments online. However, I agree about the need for better patient satisfaction data, service by service, throughout the NHS. I have said that I want that published systematically, and a new link to payment for hospital services.</p>

Indeed, there will be many fine clinicians doing important work in the hospitals that we are discussing, so it is important not to tar everyone with the same brush.</p>

For example, a taskforce has been sent into Basildon, but will we get to the bottom of how the failures occurred in both hospitals so that we understand who was responsible? What about the clinicians? Each has a duty to their patients. Will they be held to account for any failures? What about the people on the board who have responsibility for patient safety? Will they be held to account?</p>

Yet that is precisely what we were told in the aftermath of Mid Staffordshire-that it was an isolated incident. How can we have faith in the CQC's standards given what happened with Mid Staffordshire?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="91130-0009.htm_para6"><a name="09113012000356">Are Dr. Foster's concerns being thoroughly investigated, particularly the extraordinary statistic that 39 per cent. of hospitals have failed to investigate all unexpected deaths or cases of serious harm?

The CQC is investigating a few hospitals. Dr. Foster has concerns about 12 hospitals. Are they all the same hospitals? Are the different bodies talking to each other? Have the local primary care trusts been informed in every case? Do not the public have a right to know which those hospitals are?</p>

It is important to say that the hospital standardised mortality ratio is a trigger for investigation, but I would caution him against thinking that in and of itself it gives a verdict on hospital performance. It is very important-and only fair to people working in the national health service-that we think of it in those terms. The ratio can raise questions and concerns that need to be addressed, but we should not treat it as a verdict on performance, because it is not that.</p>

There are 14 million hospital admissions every year and, as we have said many times, patient satisfaction with the NHS is running at historically high levels. He asked me how failures occur. Obviously, in respect of Basildon and Thurrock, that is now the subject of detailed work, and I will update the House as and when I have more information to give.</p>

After the creation of a culture of challenge and benchmarking and the use of data across the system, it is inevitable that there will be many voices in this debate, but the Care Quality Commission is the authoritative voice that this House should listen to. It was set up by Parliament to provide authoritative advice on such matters.</p>

That will be the bedrock of any regulatory system, but he will know that the CQC overlays that with a range of other measures and data that it receives from a range of sources. It is that 360° analysis of what is happening at any particular hospital trust that triggers its decision on intervention.</p>

I acknowledge the concerns that people have about excessively high pay across the public sector, but particularly in the national health service. I know that he speaks for many people in voicing those concerns. Of course the boards of foundation trusts are independent of Government, but we wrote to them some months ago to remind them that they should set pay in accordance with wider pay trends in the public sector and, at a time such as this, they should at all times show restraint in setting awards.</p>

There is a question of public confidence in Basildon and Thurrock. Basically, Monitor and the Secretary of State need to address it with some urgency.

That is what matters, I would say, to his constituents and those patients served by the hospital. The judgment is: how can the trust get improvements as quickly as possible? In this case, Monitor's judgment was that action was needed to strengthen the clinical leadership in the trust-both the medical and nursing leadership-but that standards were likely to improve more quickly by keeping the action plan that had been developed under the leadership at the trust. Monitor assured me that the action plan that had been developed was a good one, but said that it did not believe that progress on it had been sufficient to date, hence the need for the escalation of its activities.</p>

I will give him the figures that indicate that the plan that had been developed, which I referred to in my answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay), is having some effect. Nevertheless, I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about whether that improvement has been speedy enough. That was why a decision was taken to escalate the action.

 The hon. Gentleman is right to refer to the strong words from South Manchester NHS trust. I do not think that there is any debate about the data that has been used, although there is some debate about the methodology that has then been applied to that data and the resulting scores. For instance, if we look at the Basildon and Thurrock trust, it scored within expected limits on nine out of the 13 measures looked at by Dr. Foster, and it scored 98 out of 100 on one of them. I do not draw attention to that in order to dismiss the work that has been done, but it is nevertheless a complicated picture and it is not entirely clear why a score of 0 out  of 100 was merited.

that there is a process of challenge about safety in the NHS because there always should be an ongoing dialogue about improving safety, but some trusts are, I think, justified in raising concerns about this methodology if they do not believe that it fairly reflects the standards at their trusts, especially if that portrayal gives rise to undue concern among the local community. The hon. Gentleman is right that there should be a process of interrogation of this methodology, but I am sure that that will happen in the coming days and weeks.</p>

The hospitals had provided Dr. Foster with amended data a month ago to conform with the new arrangements that were being sought, but the Dr. Foster organisation had chosen not to take any notice of those data or to include them in its findings.

On a specific point, may we empower patients and families by routinely providing them with personal antimicrobial products, so that they can actively participate in preventing the spread of health-care-associated infections in Basildon, as well as in all UK hospitals?</p>

 I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. I have not visited that hospital recently, but I am confident that, as happens in many other hospital trusts now, alcohol gels and other products will be freely available in the hospital environment for people to use to bear down on rates of infection. It is also important to say that rates of infection have decreased significantly right across the national health service, in respect of not only MRSA, but clostridium difficile. He is right to say, again, that there can be no complacency on this issue, and I am sure that the leadership at the trust will have heard his comments today.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has a short memory about the state that the national health service was in during in the 1990s, when people routinely waited hours on end in accident and emergency departments up and down the country. I was looking last week at the patients charter, which, in the mid-'90s, set an 18-month maximum wait for treatment and a year's maximum wait for heart bypass operations. Will he tell us how many people waiting for those heart bypasses never got to have the final operation, such was the state of the national health service in those days? Improvement has taken place in the NHS, but I say again that I do not over-claim for the NHS. When it needs to be better, I will say so and we will take the necessary action to make it happen.</p>

 Having met the management of Basildon hospital on Friday and toured a number of the wards, including the accident and emergency wards, I have been assured by the management and clinical staff that the hygiene recommendations of the CQC report have been implemented in full, with the help of a nursing taskforce. The key concern for my constituents is safety for patients in the hospital and for those about to go into it.

 May I say to the hon. Gentleman that this ratio was developed by Professor Brian Jarman, and we very much encourage its use. However, it is not of itself a verdict on a trust's performance? It is simply a trigger that then gives cause for more investigation and inquiry. In many cases, trusts that have had a high mortality rate have been able to bring it down. There may be a number of reasons why a particular trust has a high standardised mortality ratio and the circumstances need to be investigated. I assure the hon.

It takes a broader view of safety and quality in the NHS, looking across a much broader range of indicators than those used by Dr. Foster. However, I do not dismiss the work that has been done by Dr. Foster. In the case of a number of trusts that have been identified as a result of this work, there needs to be a further process of inquiry to establish whether the concerns are justified. The methodology used is new, and it needs to be questioned so that the hon. Gentleman can give clear advice to his constituents. I say again that the CQC is the leading and authoritative body set up by Parliament to do that job.</p>

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="91130-0010.htm_para3"><a name="09113039000006">As the House well knows, the whole world economy has been hit by a severe financial crisis, resulting in the worst global downturn for well over 60 years. Fundamentally, the crisis was caused by the failure of people operating in the market around the world fully to understand and keep up with the consequences of financial innovation and globalised markets: quite simply, people took on too much risk and became too exposed in relation to some products. There are clearly lessons to be learned by Governments, regulators and central banks, who in too many cases underestimated the threats posed by system-wide risks and did not fully appreciate the implications of financial activity outside the regulatory scope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="91130-0010.htm_para4"><a name="09113039000007">It has been necessary to make some major changes, including in the way firms are managed, which as I have said on many occasions is the first line of defence, and in relation to the quantity and quality of capital the banks hold, and in the way regulators monitor firms. Over the last year or so, we have already taken action to ensure that the UK authorities have powers to deal with failing banks, as well as to protect consumers and taxpayers. The Banking Act 2009 established a new permanent special resolution regime that has allowed the authorities to deal with failing banks and building societies. As the House knows, we have already used that measure in respect of the Dunfermline building society earlier this year. Similar powers in the emergency legislation that allowed us to nationalise Northern Rock also allowed us to deal with Bradford &amp; Bingley when it got into difficulties. The House saw the problems we had before we had those powers, so the Act has provided us with a useful way to resolve things if banks get into difficulty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="91130-0010.htm_para5"><a name="09113039000008">In addition, the Financial Services Authority is implementing the conclusions from Lord Turner's recommendations on how to strengthen the regulatory regime. We have also seen the proposals on reform of corporate governance recommended by Sir David Walker in his report last week. Although those reforms may not have received as much attention as his proposed reforms of bankers' pay, they are all important and they all need to be implemented.</p>

The origins of the problem may have been in only one part of the world, but within a matter of weeks it affected just about every part of the world.

 I shall come to the Bill's proposals on consumer protection, which we need to do more about. I am very much aware of the campaign being urged on us about pre-payment. We had some experience of that with the Farepak problems a couple of years ago. The provisions are not in the Bill because at this stage of this Parliament I wanted to keep the measure sufficiently small and manageable to ensure that, as I hope, it will complete all its stages before the end of the Session., That is not to say, however, that legislation on further consumer protection will not be necessary. I shall turn shortly to the measures that I propose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="91130-0011.htm_para2"><a name="09113039000013">The purposes of the Bill are to build on the action that we took over the past year. We want to strengthen and reform financial regulation, as well as support better corporate governance and give more rights to consumers. The Bill ensures that prudential regulation and supervision of firms is more effective. It will place far greater emphasis on monitoring and managing system-wide risks and will tighten the powers available to the FSA on the remuneration of banks, which is important for financial stability, as well as providing consumers of financial products with better support and protection. Our central objective must be to ensure that as we come through these problems, we reform and strengthen the financial system and rebuild it for the future.</p>

 Is there not another set of players who could put pressure for good governance on the financial institutions? I mean the credit rating agencies. If they were to take adverse conclusions from short-termism, as evidenced by excessive pay or bonuses or by over-complex financial products, it could have a strong effect on the various financial institutions. Can the Chancellor encourage the agencies to do that, and if they will not-because they are paid for by those same businesses-is there any way of bringing them within a regulation process?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises a very real issue. He will recall that in 2007 there was a great deal of concern about the role of credit rating agencies, especially in rating the products that had managed to get the system into so much difficulty. I shall shortly be touching on EU proposals to make sure that credit rating agencies are supervised on a Europe-wide basis, because by their nature such agencies operate across several countries, so regulation by one country alone would not be sufficient. That is a major step forward, but America has to do the same thing, because credit rating agencies are based  <br>

there too-indeed, sub-prime products and certain other products emerged from that side of the Atlantic. The hon. Gentleman makes a strong point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="91130-0011.htm_para3"><a name="09113039000016">I want to say a few words about the UK regulatory architecture, which is one of the areas on which there is a difference between the two sides of the House. I may be able to anticipate one of the arguments that will be advanced from the Conservative Benches about the architecture of our present system of regulation. To attempt to blame what has happened in the UK on our system of regulation, or the architecture or set-up we have in this country, does not hold water. If we look around the world, we see that just about every country has been affected by the problem, and whereas in this country we have two bodies responsible for regulation-principally the FSA, but also the Bank of England-most countries have rather more. In the United States, for example, several different organisations are all involved in the business of regulation. As I said when we discussed the matter briefly in the Queen's Speech debates last week, the US is trying to address that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="91130-0011.htm_para4"><a name="09113039000017">Every country's system has encountered problems, but what matters-certainly in my experience-is what the regulators actually do, and the judgments that they exercise. I strongly believe that any changes to the system need to build on experience and to address areas in which there have been deficiencies. The changes need to be practical and workable, which is why I am not persuaded about upheaval in the regulatory regime, or that bringing everything together in terms of monetary and regulatory policy for institutions large and very small makes any sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="91130-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09113039000018">Obviously, the functions of institutions-the central bank, the financial regulator, and finance and economics Ministries, which in our case means the Treasury-are central to the maintenance of financial stability in just about every country. The organisational relationship we now have in the UK-involving the FSA and the Bank, which is responsible for financial stability too-is much simplified compared with what we had, and we can build on it.</p>

 The House is less heated than it often is when we have these exchanges, which is a good thing, so may I ask the Chancellor in all seriousness whether he agrees that there seems to be a trend in many countries to try to put the central bank back in charge of prudential supervision-where it is not already in charge? I am sure the Chancellor has met Stan Fischer, the Governor of the central Bank of Israel and also former chief economist at the World Bank. He says:</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman that this is not a case where there is a definite right answer, although there are plenty of definite wrong answers. This is not a case where I am saying "Absolutely" from the start, so I think he is mistaken-I am not saying that  <br>

at all. What I am saying is that we have made a distinction regarding the functions of the central bank, which essentially involve monetary policy-obviously-and macro-prudential issues, where the bank needs to take an overview of what is going on in the economy in terms of its monetary duties and financial stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="91130-0011.htm_para8"><a name="09113039000023">A single organisation that deals with monetary policy and with some of the bigger macro issues, and which is responsible for the individual regulation of banks large and small, as well as of financial advisers, some of which are very small indeed, makes no sense. There are frequently times when it would be very tempting to tell one person, "You're in charge of the lot-sort it out. If you don't, everything will be your fault and you'll have to make way for someone else." However, we have to remember that when the Bank of England was responsible for the larger banks years ago, there were far fewer of them. They were also all very British, in the sense that they were based here and the people we had to deal with were here, not spread throughout the world. However, the Bank of England never dealt with the insurance companies, it could not deal with what happened in the '80s, when we saw the growth of bank assurance, and it could not and never did deal with some of the other financial institutions that can affect financial stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="91130-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09113039000024">We can argue where we should draw the line, and wherever we draw it there will be anomalies. However, the system that we have-we should remember that the FSA took over from about nine different self-regulatory organisations 12 years ago-represents a sensible way to proceed. It is easy for the FSA and the Bank to work together, and the Treasury will always be at the table in times of crisis, for the perfectly obvious reason that any rescue will have financial implications. However, I honestly do not believe that bringing everybody under the same roof-it would be a very large roof indeed-makes  any sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="91130-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09113039000025">The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) mentioned Jacques de Larosière, who was asked to produce a report for the European Union, and I wanted to touch on that earlier, because the House will be interested to know where we have got to. In Europe we will not, of course, have a single regulator. De Larosière suggested, first, that there should be a council for financial stability, which is advisory, and that is fine. The European Central Bank clearly has a view as to what is going on in Europe, but of course, its relationship is not the same with every country, for perfectly obvious reasons. De Larosière is also setting up three agencies to look at different aspects of the financial sector. All that sits together with the individual national regulators, and that in itself-the hon.

 I am glad that the meeting with Jacques de Larosière was so convivial. As he was discussing the Conservative party's proposals, I was not there and I am in no position to comment on what he said. All that I would say is that having seen his report, I think that there are still issues that need to be resolved in terms of what can be regulated at a European level and what is regulated here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="91130-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09113039000029">In the United Kingdom we have a very complex financial services industry. Many of the banks operating in this country are regulated in different parts of the world even though they have major presences here. We have the banks and we have the insurance companies-we have a wide range of institutions. On the basis of my own observations and my experience over the last two and a half years, I would think long and hard about putting all those bodies under an organisation that was regulated ultimately, I suppose, by the Governor of the Bank of England, no matter who that happened to be. I would also worry-this is not just my worry; it has been repeated outside the House-that if we made the changes that the hon. Gentleman proposes, there is the risk that someone may take their eye off what they are supposed to be doing, and we get into difficulties, although I know that the hon.

We are not going to agree on that, and there will always be an argument as to where we draw the line. However, I draw it on a purely practical basis, because the most important thing that we need to keep in mind is not so much the architecture. At the end of the day, we can make any organogram work, but what matters is whether we know what is going on in the first place, and when we find out what is going on, whether we make the right calls and see the process through. If we get that wrong, it really does not matter how we have brigaded all the regulators. The most important thing is making the right calls.</p>

 Will my right hon. Friend comment on an issue that has been of some concern to me? If we return all the supervision to the Bank of England at a time when quantitative easing is going on as well, the Bank would be trying to do two things: it would be trying to reflate the economy at the same time as it was trying to supervise the institutions involved. There could be a real conflict of interest over what the Bank was doing.</p>

 I agreed with the Chancellor when he said that the difficulty was not the structure but whether someone takes their eye off the ball-but I hope that he can explain something.

Of course, many reports were acted upon, and many of them picked up in one way or another, but one of the things that I want to achieve through the Council for Financial Stability, which I shall come to in a moment, is a more formal process, so that when the Bank of England publishes its six-monthly reports, the council-the FSA, the Bank of England and the Treasury-must consider them and decide what to do about them.

 The Chancellor emphasised the importance of international co-operation and the associated complexity. Under the Bill, the FSA will have discretion to work in that area. Obviously, this aspect of regulation is of fundamental national interest, given the impact on the City's earning capacity. Under the Bill, how will Parliament be able to scrutinise and have some control over the FSA-to the extent that important interests might have to be given away in such negotiations with European regulators?</p>

 I will come to that shortly, but I should like to do so in what I think is a logical order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="91130-0011.htm_para19"><a name="09113039000048">Following on from the exchanges over the past five or ten minutes or so, I have to say that it is important to formalise the relationship between, especially, the Bank and the FSA as well as the Treasury, so that we can ensure effective co-ordination. The council's draft terms of reference, which we have published today, set out the roles for each member institution. Under the Banking Act 2009, we formalised and strengthened the role of the Bank of England in protecting financial stability. We provided the Bank with a statutory objective of financial stability-it did not have that statutory objective until this year-and a lead role in dealing with failing banks under a special resolution regime. Alongside the Bank's responsibilities for monetary policy, liquidity, the oversight of inter-bank payment systems and its role in monitoring the financial system as a whole, that will give the Bank an enhanced supervisory role, as well as a role in assessing a firm's resolution plans-living wills, as they are commonly known-because it should also have that responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="91130-0011.htm_para20"><a name="09113039000049">The FSA, which is the single regulator, brings into one place the work of up to nine different regulatory agencies that were in place 12 years ago. As I told the hon. Member for Tatton, other countries have multiple regulators. For example, Hong Kong, China and India have separate regulators for banking, insurance and securities. The US Administration are trying to rationalise a highly fragmented regulatory model. Indeed, they are proposing a council that sits on top of the regulators because, for various reasons, they think that it will take too long to try to bring together the other regulators, even if they had congressional agreement to do so. Of course, in America many of those responsibilities are devolved to individual states, thus making the regulatory regime very complex indeed.</p>

That new macro-prudential element will enhance its ability to monitor, assess and mitigate risks to the country's financial stability. Of course, that sits alongside its new duties in relation to remuneration and living wills, to which I will return shortly.</p>

I do not think that that is sufficient;  it should formal, based on statute, transparent and accountable. The authorities can then be held to account, and we can have greater parliamentary scrutiny in the House and the other place, as we set out in clause 3. Even though I suspect that the Bill will be going through the House for some weeks yet, we will ensure that the council is established beforehand, so that we can see that it is working and publish its minutes, as proposed.</p>

Clause 8 will formalise the FSA's responsibility to work internationally and to promote effective international regulation. It has been doing that already, particularly in relation to the colleges of regulators, which have been established over the past couple of years, to ensure that some of the larger institutions that span several countries are monitored by individual regulators, so that they can see what is going on and understand the risks to which they might be exposed.</p>

I believe that that is right and entirely sensible, and we will support it.

important that we recognise that some things need to be done at a Europe-wide level. That makes a lot of sense to us. For example, some of our problems with Icelandic authorities would have been more easily resolved if they had come within a regime that allowed us to get hold of the situation before it reached a critical stage. There is a lot to be said for that, but it is important that certain things remain with us because, at the end of the day in any crisis, only national Governments have the resources if a rescue needs to be mounted. That is why one of our red lines is that we cannot have a situation where any of those new authorities can impinge in any way on the fiscal responsibility of member states. It is important not only that that is clearly stated-I believe that it will be-but that the mechanisms in place ensure in reality that the responsibility for any fiscal action lies with member states.

 My answer is that in a world where many financial institutions operate in this country and in other European states, as well as in other parts of the world, there has to be greater co-operation. Look, for example, at what has been happening over the past couple of years or so between us, the Swiss authorities, the American authorities and the European Union. It is not in our interest to create a situation where an institution can escape the attention that it needs by going to a place where there is not sufficient supervision, but at the same time operate in countries where it can cause substantial damage. There must be increased co-operation.</p>

 I am clear that we should accept those areas where it is in our interest to co-operate, but there may be other areas where that is not the case.

creep from regulators in Europe? The combination of a dirigiste approach to regulation and the past history of the FSA of putting through a lot of irrelevant regulation which, in the end, did not save us from the crisis, could mean that we have a tremendous burden of more micro-level issues than the rather grander macro issues which, as the right hon.

 I agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman says. There is always a risk that we end up with national regulators and international regulators, with one set of regulations on top of another, and no clarity about who is responsible for what. There is sometimes a belief that if enough regulations are passed, the problem will be solved. Far from it-that might even create a few problems. That is why it is important to be clear about what needs to be done internationally.</p>

We do not want a situation to arise where only one regulator has a partial view of what is going on in one particular institution. If it comes a cropper, all of us will have to pick up the pieces. It is important to bear in mind what the hon. Gentleman says, but this country has argued for constructive co-operation for a considerable time, although when my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister first raised it in the early 1990s, there were not many takers because people did not think there was a problem. As we have seen in the past couple of years, there most certainly is a problem which needs to be sorted. That case is made.</p>

 Does the Chancellor see a problem with vesting regulation in the European level, rather than co-operating on regulation at the European level, when, as he rightly says, the financial costs of any failure of regulation will fall wholly on the nation state?</p>

 I would put it this way: there is much to be said for co-operation. Many of the financial institutions in this country would say that it would be very useful to have a common rule book. Then they would not have to have a different regime for Britain, France, Germany and so on. In such a case, co-operation is essential, and I would like to see that. The problem probably arises not in normal times, but when there is a crisis. Then we must be clear about who and what triggers that emergency and who decides what needs to be done. At that point, particularly when it comes to fiscal consequences, which is essentially a matter for national Governments, they must be clear that it is they who make the decision.</p>

in another part of the European Union to do something about one of its banks. That could have a knock-on effect on us. The point is that co-operation is needed, but we must be clear who is responsible for what.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="91130-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09113039000076">I shall deal briefly with other parts of the Bill, which may or may not be of interest to the House. Clauses 14 to 17 give the FSA greater disciplinary powers to suspend individuals and firms for misconduct. In clause 13 we are introducing a power to give the FSA power to ban short selling. The ban that was imposed in September 2008 was based on the market abuse directive. It is better that it should be based on the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which is what we are doing.</p>

<p><a name="st_o275"><a name="09113039000077"><a name="91130-0012.htm_spnew12"><a name="09113039000223"><b>Stephen Hammond (Wimbledon) (Con):</b>
 The Chancellor is right that that is being done through the FSMA, but the powers on short selling are being vested in the general market abuse rules in that Act, implying that any short selling is a market abuse.</p>

 The Bill does not say that, and that is not my view. When the ban on short selling was introduced last year, I made the point that we were not saying that short selling was bad per se. However, in the particular circumstances and at that time, when financial stability was a big problem, action needed to be taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="91130-0012.htm_para15"><a name="09113039000079">Clause 30 gives the FSA greater powers to gather information, and clause 11 allows the FSA to take powers on remuneration and, if necessary, to prohibit certain remuneration practices. They are based on the important principle that we should avoid the situation whereby the remuneration practices of firms lead to people being rewarded for doing things that eventually bring down the institutions in which they work. That is something that we and, certainly, the institutions should not forget. If too many people in a bank engage in what is, frankly, speculative trading, they run the risk of bringing down their institution. There is a clear public interest in that situation, because there would be consequences for the public purse if such practice were not properly regulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="91130-0012.htm_para16"><a name="09113039000080">That part of the Bill is very important. It includes powers to implement the agreements that we reached in the G20 and those that we finally reached in Pittsburgh a few weeks ago, and it gives the FSA the powers that it needs not just to prevent such irresponsible pay, which has proved so damaging, but to implement Sir David Walker's proposals on disclosure. On that point, I can tell the House that we will table regulations on disclosure to go with the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="91130-0012.htm_para17"><a name="09113039000081">Sir David made a number of recommendations, but I think that we go further than he suggested.

We will consult on that idea, but most people are convinced that far more disclosure is important, because they will then be able to see precise remuneration practices.</p>

 I understand that the commission would certainly be able to look at that issue, and I am sure that no one in this House wants to see discrimination. People should be judged and rewarded on their merit, and that is precisely the point, because rather too many people were not judged and rewarded on their merit. Indeed, some rewarding structures seem to have had completely the opposite effect, and I am sure that there would be no difficulty with the commission doing what my hon. Friend suggests, should it wish to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="91130-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09113039000084">Clause 12 gives the FSA powers to ensure that there are resolution procedures for the larger banks and some building societies-procedures commonly referred to as living wills. It is very important that larger institutions have plans so that, if they get into difficulty, people are clear, before that difficulty arises, about what the institutions would do. That measure will help the regulators better understand what are, in some cases, complex structures-structures that have been put together for tax reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="91130-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09113039000085">The regulators will also know the resolution options that might be applied, and they will be able to consider the obstacles to such resolutions, including, for example, complexity. If large institutions get into trouble, it will be clear which regulators will take responsibility, which countries will take responsibility and how the firms will be disengaged, so that those parts that are important for financial stability are stabilised, investors' and depositors' interests are maintained and credible measures are taken to deal with any difficulties that might be encountered. That is a very important part of the Bill. The clauses may be small in number, but they will have a very real effect, I hope, on the future. We have to reduce not only the probability of a firm's failure, but the impact of that failure, should it occur.</p>

 The Chancellor is absolutely right: that is a very important part of the Bill. However, will he explain why the Bank and the Treasury have the power to make recommendations, and to recommend action, on those plans to prevent such a crisis from occurring, yet the SFA does not have to undertake to implement the actions proposed by either the Bank or the Treasury?</p>

 I think that the hon. Gentleman meant to say the FSA; the SFA is the Scottish Football Association. At the end of the day, the FSA would have responsibility in those circumstances, but it would obviously consider what the Bank and the Treasury had to say. Unless the FSA had very good reasons, it would be very difficult for it to turn down any helpful suggestions from either body, not least from the Treasury, as the Treasury, if the worst came to the worst, would have to provide the funds. However, it would not be quite the problem that the hon. Gentleman makes out. None the less, the introduction of resolution regimes is very important. The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) will no doubt again advance the cause of breaking up such banks from the start, but, as I have said before, I do not think that that is right. There is a far better way of dealing with the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="91130-0013.htm_para0"><a name="09113039000088">The second part of the Bill that I want to deal with relates to supporting consumers. I shall do so fairly briefly, although it is important. It is important that we encourage people to know more about financial services and to understand the benefits and risks. Clause 6 gives the FSA the power to establish an independent consumer financial education body, which will deliver the implementation of the money guidance service from spring next year, as recommended by the Thoresen review a couple of years ago. The service has already been tried out in the north-west, and I understand that it is working. However, it is important that we can encourage people to know more about and understand the financial system, especially as it is in our interest to ensure that people save more and take advantage of financial products. That requires a certain amount of knowledge, however.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="91130-0013.htm_para1"><a name="09113039000089">Clause 26 includes an important provision that addresses a problem that we have had for several years. There have been several instances in recent years of a large group of consumers having suffered detrimentally at the hands of regulated firms. The clause will give the FSA the power to obtain redress and compensation more easily. Basically, it allows the FSA, if it thinks that there is a problem, to implement an investigation. If the investigation uncovers a problem, that will then be remedied and a solution will be imposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="91130-0013.htm_para2"><a name="09113039000090">I can think of two instances in which that provision would have been helpful: the mis-selling of personal pensions in the late 1980s and, more recently, bank charges. The FSA will have the power to do something without having to wait for court action. In addition, clauses 18 to 25 establish a new form of collective proceeding to allow for a new form of class action. I do not want to see the widespread development of such action, as there has been in the United States, so the provision is more tightly drawn. However, it means that, if there is a remedy, a class action can take place and, I hope, the matter can be resolved. That is a new development in UK law and the first example of our allowing group action in the courts for people with similar claims, but it is an important thing to do.</p>

 We will give the courts the discretion to allow both. I know that there is a lobby outside the House on that point, but people have the right to say, "I don't want to come into this, because it might compromise my rights elsewhere," so it is best to let the courts have the discretion to look at the individual merits of the case. No doubt that point can be argued in Committee, however.</p>

We amend the Financial Services Compensation Scheme to allow it to act as an agent for a foreign scheme so that people do not have to go abroad to get their remedy but can go through the UK organisation. There is also a technical change to the recovery of funds when the Banking Act 2009 is used in relation to a failing bank.</p>

It is vital that those responsible for running financial institutions understand what we are doing.

 I am not claiming that anyone in the House fully understood what was going to happen. However, I did warn in 2006-I do not remember a single member of the Government saying this-that an economy built on debt is an economy built on borrowed time. The hon. Gentleman might remember-he probably put them in his election address-all those claims about having abolished boom and bust and the economic cycle: about how Britain was better prepared and how this was a new age of stability. If he does not remember, let me reassure him that over the next few months we will be reminding him and his constituents of all the things that were said.</p>

Although it is true, as of course the Chancellor said, that other countries have experienced some very severe problems with their banking sectors-the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium and so on-there are also examples of banking regulatory regimes that got it right. The Spanish banks are in much better shape than the British banks because the Spanish central bank banned some of the off-balance-sheet vehicles that became prolific in this country. The Canadian central bank imposed a leverage backstop, which was never considered here. The Australians, whose central bank pursued a "twin peaks" model of regulation, still have four double-A rated banks. There are examples of banking systems that got it right, while it is generally accepted that Britain's was the most exposed. Indeed, this morning we heard that Canada has come out of recession, which means that Britain is the last country in the G20 still in recession. That shows how exposed we have been.</p>

After everything that we have been through, it is pretty remarkable that the Government are not asking some big fundamental questions about the structure of regulation that they set up. Almost every other country in the world is proposing considerable changes to its regulatory structure. As far as I am aware, only in this country, of all the major economies that had a banking crisis, are the Government content to stick with the existing system. Of course, we know exactly why that is. Everyone knows that if Labour Members were in opposition or were not currently led by the man who was Chancellor when the system was introduced, they too would be looking at changes to the structure of regulation. They are wedded to defending the current system because it happened to be introduced by the man who leads them. The proposal was developed, completely in secret, in opposition. It was, I believe, kept in a safe in the hotel bedroom of the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), and deployed, without any warning, two or three days after the general election. The then Governor of the Bank of England, the late Eddie George, almost resigned as a result. There was then a hasty consultation and the measure was introduced. We are now stuck with the Government defending this system for the simple reason that the Prime Minister thinks that there will some reputational damage to him if he admits that it has not worked very well. I have to tell him that the reputational damage has already been done.</p>

 May I just deal with the point about the late Eddie George's attitude? I was in on most of the meetings at that time-of course, the then Chancellor was in on more of them-but when the issue of the Bank of England's overall responsibility for systemic integrity was discussed, the then Governor's principal concern was that he would have enough money to deal with that, and to inject liquidity where necessary. He had in mind a ridiculously small amount of money at the time, and we gave it to him. On that basis, so long as he was left with that responsibility and had the money he thought necessary, he went along with the proposal and indeed welcomed it in subsequent speeches.</p>

happened. My conversation with him seems to have been somewhat different from the one the hon. Gentleman had. The Bank of England was not consulted, and this fundamental proposal was made on the future supervision of banking. Given that we are discussing, 12 years later, the biggest failure of banking supervision, it is worth going back to that moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="91130-0013.htm_para12"><a name="09113039000113">One of the reasons why I-as the current shadow Chancellor, who hopes to be in the Chancellor's job in a few months' time-have decided to publish our proposals and make a big effort to consult on them and talk to as many people as possible, including the three different parts of the tripartite regime, is precisely so that I can get my thinking right in opposition, rather than just deploying the whole thing two days after a general election, which I could of course do, following the previous model. I will come to the structure of our proposal, but also to why we think it is necessary. I will deal later with the content of regulation because I completely agree with the Chancellor that that is very important as well, but we have to look at the structure of the regulator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="91130-0013.htm_para13"><a name="09113039000114">We have a tripartite regime under which no one knows who is in charge and who is giving official policy. We have a Governor of the Bank of England who regularly gives interesting speeches-at Mansion House, and in Edinburgh recently; he also gave evidence to the Treasury Committee last week-on how he thinks banks should be regulated. His views are very interesting but they bear absolutely no resemblance to official Government policy as just stated at the Dispatch Box. We have a chairman of the FSA, a man of great integrity and intelligence, who says that quite a lot of the activities of the banking sector are "socially useless". I do not know whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Prime Minister share that view, but it has certainly been noticed not just in the City but around the world. And we have a Prime Minister who turns up at the fag end of the G20 Finance Ministers meeting and announces to a completely stunned audience-no doubt including the Chancellor-that he is in favour, suddenly, of a Tobin tax. The United States Treasury Secretary then has to give an immediate reaction to that view, and of course rubbishes it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="91130-0013.htm_para14"><a name="09113039000115">So those who would ask "What's the view on financial services from the UK authorities?" would get three or four completely different views; that is how dysfunctional the current relationship is. The Chancellor deals with it much more than I do, but even my own dealings with the different legs of the tripartite regime-one group of people told me something completely different from the previous group who came to my office-suggest to me that this relationship is not working particularly well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="91130-0013.htm_para15"><a name="09113039000116">The answer to all this is apparently contained in clause 1, which I remind the House says:</p>
<a name="91130-0013.htm_brev2"><a name="09113039000173"><ul><p class="tabletext">"There is to be a Council for Financial Stability, consisting of...the Chancellor of the Exchequer...the chair of the FSA, and...the Governor of the Bank of England."</p>

and the memorandum of understanding that originally created the tripartite regime created a standing committee-not a council-on financial stability, which</p>
<a name="91130-0013.htm_brev4"><a name="09113039000175"><ul><p class="tabletext">"is chaired by the Treasury and comprises representatives of the Treasury, the Bank and the FSA. It is an important channel for exchanging information on threats to UK financial stability".</p>

Indeed, the only difference I can spot is that, according to the memorandum of understanding, at least the standing committee was required to meet once a month. According to the Bill, the Council for Financial Stability will be required to meet only four times a year, so the number of required statutory meetings has actually been reduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="91130-0013.htm_para19"><a name="09113039000120">Nor is the Chancellor required to turn up to the council. Perhaps the Chancellor can confirm this for me, but I think that in the entire period when his predecessor was Chancellor-10 years: the longest time that anyone had been Chancellor for a century-he never once physically attended the tripartite committee. There was one joint telephone conversation with the US authorities and the US Treasury Secretary; that was the only time the then Chancellor took part in the meetings of the tripartite committee-on the telephone. So it is not exactly clear how this proposal will fundamentally change things.</p>

 We do not want this Second Reading debate to become a Committee stage debate, but will the shadow Chancellor kindly explain to the House precisely how his new arrangement is going to work, involving as it does, as I understand it, a block transfer of the FSA and its head into the Treasury? Therefore, the chair of the FSA and all its huge responsibilities will be subject to the Governor of the Bank of England, and the FSA will have no chance to make its own representations separately or "legitly" to the Treasury, with whom ultimately the real responsibility in a crisis would reside.

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="91130-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09113039000128">It is for these reasons that we have decided that we will need new legislation to bring in a new structure of financial regulation. I have to be absolutely honest with this House: it is not something we particularly wanted to do. There are quite a few economic issues that we are likely to confront if we form a Government, and revisiting financial services regulation was not at the top of our list. However, we honestly came to the view that we would have to do it, because we have to create a system that gives a clearer idea of who is in charge, and that ends these dysfunctional squabbles between the three institutions; a system under which the people in charge can exercise judgment and discretion, and through which the connection is made between the broader risks across the economy and the individual risks to individual firms. As I have said, we have spoken to many market participants and at length to the different legs of the tripartite arrangements, and we believe that that can best be done by putting the Bank of England in charge of the prudential supervision of banks, building societies and other significant institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="91130-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09113039000129">Surely we have now learned the hard way that we cannot take central banking out of bank regulation, and we cannot judge systemic risk without understanding institutional risk and vice versa. Of course the changes will require new, more collegiate arrangements for the Bank of England, but that, too, is a good thing. There is currently a rather unbalanced Bank of England that is collegiate on monetary policy and quite imperial on financial policy, of which the Chancellor no doubt bears the scars. We therefore propose a more collegiate approach. The whole point is to ensure that monetary policy, the supervision of financial stability and the regulation of individual institutions are better co-ordinated.</p>

That is not a problem of co-ordination or integration. I saw the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) nodding vigorously at the idea that information flows more easily within an organisation than between two organisations, but the logic of that is that we should merge the whole of government so that we could get information more freely. In reality, it simply is not true. There are some natural divisions where it is better to have the inevitable squabbles between organisations out in the open, so that we can all take a view on them. The Treasury should have access to two different sources: one handling monetary policy, a huge responsibility, and the other with the massive responsibility of prudential regulation.

However, the US Government are proposing-and already facing quite a battle in Congress-to give the Federal Reserve prudential supervision powers over the largest and most systemically important banks. In the United States, of course, there are many thousands of banks, whereas in the United Kingdom there are many fewer than that.

 The hon. Gentleman refers to changes in the structures. There was always a financial stability power or function, though one could say that it was not used. There has been much discussion of the holy grail of the macro-prudential tool to go with the financial stability function. Has he identified such a tool, other than capital ratios? Who would operate it? That seems to be the missing bit, about which the Governor of the Bank of England has been talking.</p>

<p><a name="st_o301"><a name="09113039000154"><a name="91130-0014.htm_spnew5"><a name="09113039000249"><b>Mr. Osborne:</b>
 I happen to believe that the main tools are capital ratios, which operate as far as possible counter-cyclically-or at least not pro-cyclically, as they seem to do at the moment-and that the standards should be set internationally through Basel, the Financial Stability Board and so on. If that can be achieved internationally in the next few months, we should get on and do it. A bit of a risk is emerging-we are applying capital rules in a pro-cyclical way and risking a second credit crunch in the next few months. That deserves closer observation. The most useful thing that could emerge from the G20 process is some sort of international agreement on capital rules. We should want London, Edinburgh and so on to be homes of globally successful financial businesses. We want Britain to be the home of wholesale financial services in Europe, but we also want to protect the British taxpayer. The best way in which we can do that through macro-prudential tools and capital rules is by trying to achieve some international standards. I therefore agree with some of the public comments that the Chancellor made about what we want to achieve through the forums I mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="91130-0014.htm_para22"><a name="09113039000155">However, there are some worrying developments. The Chancellor talked about some of the European proposals. It is not clear that the alternative investment fund managers directive as drafted is in the UK's national interest. It will drive the hedge fund industry-at least, significant parts of it-to Zurich. I think that the Government have finally woken up to that and are fighting a bit of a rearguard action. The Chancellor raised national sovereignty or the right of a national Government to have their say about whether there should be financial support, and I completely agree with him. However, the conclusions of ECOFIN do not seem to be replicated in the documents that have been produced. Those matters require the Government to be extremely active and aggressive in fighting for the UK's interests and trying to get an international or European playing field that is in this country's national interest. I think that the Treasury could present its arguments more aggressively.</p>

 I am sure that my hon. Friend will not in any way give in on my point, but I hope that he will at least take serious account of it-I have raised it with him many times. It comes back to what I put to the Chancellor: in a situation in which majority voting prevails, if the architecture and the final decision-in other words, the control rather than who is in charge-turns on the European structure, does my hon. Friend agree that we must show today and in our debate in a couple  <br>

of days that we will not fall for the argument that we do better through the City of London being in the European architecture? Majority voting means that we will be consistently outvoted. That is where the power lies and I hope that my hon. Friend accepts that that is a serious matter, which needs to be considered.</p>

<p><a name="st_o305"><a name="09113039000159"><a name="91130-0014.htm_spnew9"><a name="09113039000253"><b>Mr. Osborne:</b>
 I agree that, having established the red lines, we need to make their existence clear in the directives and new institutional arrangements. I want the Chancellor to insist-because the issue may arise before the election-on his view that national Governments must have the final say, with the right of veto, over the decision to commit national taxpayers' resources to supporting a bank.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="91130-0014.htm_para23"><a name="09113039000160">I must also note that allowing the French to take the Commission job on financial services, for which they were clearly bidding from the beginning and was doubtless part of the horse-trading that ended in some of the other Commission arrangements, may turn out to be a serious diplomatic mistake. One goes only on the briefings in newspapers, but as far as I understand it, the Prime Minister and Lord Mandelson were against the appointment, we were told that it would not happen and that the President of the Commission would split the jobs. Then, lo and behold, Monsieur Barnier emerges as the person in the Commission responsible for financial services. There is an understandable French objective to get some wholesale financial services to France and away from Britain. I am not sure that that is the UK's national interest. Perhaps one day, in the Chancellor's memoirs-the bits that are not in the Bill; let us hope that there are more interesting bits-he will explain exactly how it all came about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="91130-0014.htm_para24"><a name="09113039000161">Let me draw my remarks to a close with a final observation. Of course, the route to protecting the British taxpayer will never be some new banking Bill or a new European directive. What we need to deal with are the root causes of the credit crunch, and those are the huge macro-imbalances in our economy. We were not the only country in the world with those imbalances, but they were worse here than anywhere else. Lord Turner put well it in his report when he said that</p>
<a name="91130-0014.htm_brev8"><a name="09113039000187"><ul><p class="tabletext">"rapid credit expansion was underpinned by major and continued macro-imbalances, with the UK-like the US-running a large current account deficit".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="91130-0014.htm_para25"><a name="09113039000162">The truth is our households were more indebted, our banks were more leveraged, our housing boom was greater and our Government budget deficit was larger than almost any other country in the world. The extraordinary thing is that the then Chancellor thought that this period was one of stability and an end to boom and bust. We are living with the consequences of that hubris today. It is why Britain is the last country in the G20 to still be in recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="91130-0014.htm_para26"><a name="09113039000163">So this Financial Services Bill is tinkering at the edges. We need to end the dysfunctional tripartite regime; we need a new system of regulation that puts the Bank of England in charge; we need to address the issues that the Governor of the Bank has raised; and we need an international regime better to protect taxpayers while ensuring that Britain remains competitive. Above all, we need to move from an economy built on debt and highly dependent on the success of financial services to an economy built on savings that is home to successful financial services and to other successful industries.  <br>

<p><a name="st_o306"><a name="09113043000001"><a name="91130-0015.htm_spnew0"><a name="09113043000052"><b>Dr. Vincent Cable (Twickenham) (LD):</b>
 The legislation before us today is substantial, unlike some of the other legislation listed in the Queen's Speech, and it deserves detailed attention. There is much in it with which I would agree, but we need to examine the question of whether it is all necessary, and what is omitted from it.  I will probably devote more of my remarks to the latter part of the Chancellor's speech, in which he properly addressed consumer protection issues; although I agreed with much of what the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) said, I noted that in his 40-minute speech he did not refer once to the consumer issues, which are actually rather important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para0"><a name="09113043000002">The Chancellor started with the big picture, and I have several broad points to make about that. We now have relative stability in the banking system after its collapse and its rescue by the taxpayers. I do not wish to repeat the history lesson that we have already had, but if people wish to read my version of it, the paperback edition will appear in the new year. It is a long story and many people were to blame, as were the leverage, the excessive complexity, the failures of regulation and so on. Although the situation has stabilised as a result of Government intervention, there is still serious risk in the system, and we have been reminded in the last few days of the potential risks for some major banks that can arise from one operator-in this case, Dubai World-going bust. There could be others out there. If there is a double-dip recession in our own economy or elsewhere-that is possible, but I am not predicting it-it will produce another round of bad debts. There are almost certainly problems with the overvaluation of the UK housing market and other asset bubbles which will appear, in turn, in the bad debts within the banking system. Many of those problems are not only historical problems, but potential future problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09113043000003">Secondly, the big failure-as I have told the Chancellor many times-is not primarily a legislative issue but the reluctance of the Government to follow through on their ownership and control of leading banks in terms of influencing their lending policy. We had a good reminder of that last week when RBS, a nationalised bank, was able to mobilise hundreds of millions of pounds in support of an aggressive takeover of Cadbury by Kraft-as it happens, the world has moved on-while having to acknowledge publicly that it would not, by a very long way, meet its net lending obligations to small and medium companies. There has been a failure of governance by UKFI, the state directors-a failure to ensure that RBS and other state institutions meet the test of national interest. They are clearly not meeting that test.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para2"><a name="09113043000004">The third general issue, which was touched on by  the Chancellor and the shadow Chancellor, concerns the structural problems. I do not want to reopen the argument about whether the banks should be broken up or not-I will leave the Chancellor to debate that with the Governor of the Bank of England, who happens to share my views on that point. Several pragmatic steps are being taken, such as the living wills proposals, the build-up of revised capital adequacy rules, which take  <br>

account of very large institutions that are too big to fail and too big to save, and trying to put over-the-counter transactions on to traded markets. All those things would reduce the risk of a "too big to fail" collapse and they are all very sensible. However, most of them depend on international agreement, which could take years to happen and may well never happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para3"><a name="09113043000005">Perhaps I could invite the Chancellor to say whether he agrees with an alternative proposal. He may not wish to break up the banks, but as long as they remain dependent on the taxpayer guarantee, would it not be right and sensible to ask them to pay for it? I think that that is what the Prime Minister was trying to suggest to the G20 meeting until he got fixated on a slightly more populist line on the Tobin tax. I think that he shares our view that the banks need to pay some kind of fee for this continuing guarantee, until the "too big to fail" problem has been resolved-however that happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para4"><a name="09113043000006">On the specifics of the legislation, I turn first to the tripartite structure. It is worth quoting the Treasury Committee, which agreed on an all-party basis when it first looked into this problem. It said:</p>
<a name="91130-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="09113043000046"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Although we have concerns about the operation of the tripartite system, we do not believe that the financial system in the United Kingdom would be well served by a dismantling of the tripartite system. Instead, we wish to see it reformed with clearer leadership and stronger powers."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para5"><a name="09113043000007">There are stronger powers in this Bill; the hon. Member for Tatton spoke on this point at length. I sense that there is confusion between two different issues here. One is the need for clear leadership-about which the hon. Gentleman is right-and, in relation to systemic stability, that leadership should be with the Bank of England. It is not clear that such leadership exists in the current council, because powers remain evenly distributed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para6"><a name="09113043000008">There is a difference between the issue of leadership and that of the structuring of the bureaucracy; that is the point that the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) raised earlier. I cannot believe that the hon. Member for Tatton can talk to people in the City-as he does a lot, and as I do-and not know that they are deeply uncomfortable with what he is proposing. I have met many deep-dyed Conservatives-who are smacking their lips at the prospect of an incoming Conservative Government cutting their taxes-who are horrified by the proposals to change the arrangements for the FSA and the Bank of England. They advance several arguments against those changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para7"><a name="09113043000009">First, those people say that the proposals are causing enormous uncertainty. Staff at the FSA do not know whether they will have a job in six months or a year, they have taken their eye off the ball and are not concentrating on issues of regulation and supervision at a particularly delicate stage. I do not know where the hon. Gentleman has got the idea that the Governor of the Bank of England wants to be the supervisor of the Loughborough building society and many other institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09113043000010">If the hon. Member for Tatton has ever had a meeting with the Governor, he must surely have realised that that is the last thing that he wants to do, and that it would be a complete distraction from his primary responsibilities. It would also lead to duplication. The moment that integrated teams of people started working on the insurance industry-not a controversial area at the moment-some of the people would be hived off to the Bank of England and the others would be hived off  <br>

into another institution and, presumably, there would be two sets of insurance regulators instead of one. That is potentially very disruptive and confusing, and it is clear to me that people in the City do not want that reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para9"><a name="09113043000011">I think that I am the only person in the House, with the possible exception of the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), who took part in the agonising process of legislating for the original Financial Services and Markets Bill back in 1999-2000. It was a terrible process, and I would hate to think that an incoming Government, if one were formed by the Conservatives, would inflict on us a similar piece of legislation. It is not necessary. There is one specific issue on which they are right, which is the need for clear unambiguous responsibility for systemic stability to be given to the Governor of the Bank of England. That needs to be there and it needs to be clear, but it does not require a vast moving around of the whole apparatus of the various quangos and all the people in them, which is completely unnecessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para10"><a name="09113043000012">The second big issue in the Bill concerns remuneration. My question is whether such legislation is necessary. Some of the things suggested seem perfectly sensible, but do we need legislation to bring them about? As I understand it, the basic principles are set out in the FSA code of practice, which was quite a weak document, introducing guidance rather than principles and removing a lot of companies from its arrangements. I would simply ask the Chancellor whether it is possible to ensure that remuneration practices are tightened up by issuing a fresh code of conduct through the FSA or through secondary or devolved legislation. Why enact primary legislation to deal with the matter, given that the FSA already has considerable powers?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para11"><a name="09113043000013">Why do the Government not use the direct powers that they already have, through the semi-nationalised industries? There was an embarrassing episode a few weeks ago when it was announced that the Royal Bank of Scotland would remunerate its highly paid staff in deferred stock, and that they would not be paid for three years. It then emerged-that is, RBS admitted-that the bank would pay its staff in cash next year, which means that there was a straightforward failure of direction by the Government's directors in the banks. We do not need legislation to sort out those problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para12"><a name="09113043000014">The other issue under the heading of remuneration-the Chancellor indicated that he would deal with this through a separate order-is the implementation of the Walker review. It has to be said-I am sure that this is true even among his departmental colleagues-that there was incredible embarrassment, in the Government and elsewhere, at the whitewash that Sir David Walker has produced on disclosure. The idea that what he calls high-end staff who are highly paid should not be individually identified is a very strange one, because we already have explicit exposure in several cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09113043000015">All the pay, bonus payments and pension arrangements of directors of public companies are declared in an annual report. Even with unquoted companies, any director paid more than £200,000 a year has to be publicly declared. We have a situation, which the Government seem to have accepted, whereby if someone is paid £250,000 as, say, the finance director of a middle-sized metal-bashing company, all their details have to  <br>

be publicly declared. However, if they are in a bank, not only do their individual details not have to be declared, but their existence does not have to be acknowledged. That is an extraordinary state of affairs, given that banks are underwritten by the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="st_o307"><a name="09113043000016"><a name="91130-0015.htm_spnew1"><a name="09113043000053"><b>Mr. Charles Walker (Broxbourne) (Con):</b>
 Surely the difference is that there can be high earners in banks who do not hold any executive position, whereas the example to which the hon. Gentleman referred is of someone on the board of a private company.</p>

<p><a name="st_o308"><a name="09113043000017"><a name="91130-0015.htm_spnew2"><a name="09113043000054"><b>Dr. Cable:</b>
 That, indeed, is the point. Why should people who have highly paid positions in private banks, but who do not sit in either an executive or a non-executive role on a board, not be declared? Why should such disclosure be limited to directors alone, whether executive or non-executive? The principle of disclosure has already been accepted, and the kind of arguments that I have heard from some people in the investment banks-"We don't want to be identified because there's a security issue"-apply just as much to the directors of those other companies. Sir David Walker has produced an embarrassing mouse of a report that has clearly embarrassed the City Minister. I hope that when the Chancellor produces his revised direction-I am not sure what status that document has-he will take that fully into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para14"><a name="09113043000018">Thirdly, it seemed to me that what the Chancellor said about short selling was right and appropriate, and that the changes to the legislation are exactly as they should be. We should not have a completely dogmatic, fundamentalist opposition to short selling. Short selling-dealing in stock that one does not own-may have a perfectly legitimate role in certain markets. However, there is a particular problem with banks, because banks' reserve capital-their regulatory capital-depends on share capital, which depends on the share price, and if the share price is manipulated as a result of short selling, that brings the taxpayer directly into the frame. That means that people are, in effect, gambling against the taxpayer, which is not right. It is also dangerous, and it is quite right that there should be strong regulatory powers to govern it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para15"><a name="09113043000019">Fourthly and finally, the consumer issues are important. Several of the consumer provisions in the Bill are sensible and helpful. There is the class action to avoid large numbers of people having to go to the Financial Ombudsman Service. The Chancellor cited the case of pension mis-selling, and I would guess that the same applies to payment protection insurance. There are many examples of how the procedure could be simplified, and it is good that there are to be stronger disciplinary powers for the FSA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para16"><a name="09113043000020">The idea of having a centre for financial education is also helpful, in bringing together the different strands of activity in financial education. It is not yet clear where the money will come from, whether the centre will be independent or what the governance structure will be, but no doubt that will emerge in Committee. It is also useful to have proposed action on credit card cheques, which have been the subject of some abuse in the past. I am not quite sure what future such cheques have, because my understanding is that banks will stop using and transacting cheques. Indeed, I am not sure whether such cheques will exist in future, so perhaps we need some clarification there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para17"><a name="09113043000021">There have been some helpful submissions in the past few days from the citizens advice bureaux and the Consumers Association, listing a whole lot of other provisions. They make the point that if the Bill is to be a round-up of useful consumer actions, why are those other things not being considered as well? There are about a dozen suggestions, but I will list only what seem to be the most important. First, there is the issue of contingent charges. Since the court ruling last week that legitimised what the banks have been doing in imposing what many regard as unfair charges on overdrafts and other things, is it not now necessary to straighten out the law? It would appear that the court ruling was based on a narrow point of law rather than an issue of principle. Should not this Bill be used to sort out that problem? There are hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions, who have lost money as a result of those unfair charges and who feel a strong grievance about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para18"><a name="09113043000022">There is also the issue of set-offs. People are finding that if they put money into a deposit, that money is directly deducted from their outstanding loans. In effect, the banks are appointing themselves as preferred creditors, which is fundamentally wrong and unfair to the consumer. There are also issues such as unauthorised and unsolicited overdraft limits being raised unilaterally, without any consultation with consumers. Then there is the issue of the repossession of the properties of landlords-a matter in which the Government have been actively involved in the past. I had understood that the Bill would be a vehicle for strengthening legal protection for victims of repossession in such cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="91130-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09113043000023">There is also the unilateral re-pricing of debt by many banks in respect of their outstanding loans, and the changing of minimum payments on credit charges at the discretion of the banks. There are many such practices, although I do not know-I am not a parliamentary draftsman-whether new laws are necessary to deal with them. What would be helpful-I make this as a practical suggestion-is if the Government could indicate which of the many proposals being made by the various consumer protection bodies are covered by the FSA, by the Office of Fair Trading or by both, which can be dealt with through secondary or devolved legislation, and which require primary legislation, so that we can understand how consumer protection in banking and finance can be brought up to date and up to scratch.</p>

 In the context of the various tiers and hierarchies of legal intervention that exist, the hon. Gentleman's pursuit of the simplicity that he set out at the beginning of his remarks, and his desire not to have too much duplication, would he concede that it would be far better if the matters to which he has referred did not end up being adjudicated in, for example, the European Court of Justice? The decisions to which he has referred would then all be adjudicated under a series of directives that would ultimately take control away from our courts and hand it over to the ECJ. Does he not see the inconsistency in his argument?</p>

 In common with the shadow Chancellor, I would like to apologise for being unable to attend for the concluding speeches. It is a great pleasure, as always, to follow the hon.

On that, I agree with my right hon. Friend. However, today he seemed to be emollience personified and there was nobody in the world more reasonable than the shadow Chancellor.

He referred to the sensible action by some of the people he spoke to, in their giving some kind words to his thoughts, in the possible prospect of the hon.

Those in the FSA in particular may well be considering carefully how to position themselves in relation to the Opposition party and may at least be putting forward some words of insurance because of the circumstances that might develop next year, although my hon.

 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. The one consoling factor is the fact that the shadow Chancellor will not have any prospect of implementing his proposals and causing the ructions that he clearly wants to. When he prays in aid people like Jacques de Larosière and Mr. Fisher, I wonder what supernatural financial wisdom he chooses to invest in them. I would have thought, and I put this to the Minister in his place on the Front Bench, that the House, the country and particularly the City of London should be much more concerned about another French person, namely Michel Barnier-I hope I have pronounced the name correctly and apologise if I have not. He seems to me to be a greater threat to our interests than anything from Jacques de Larosière, who was governor of the rather different French central bank in a rather different set of circumstances and with a different range of responsibilities.</p>

At the end of that obviously difficult period, I remember him saying that we had come out with a very good role for the Bank of England, with a clear Monetary Policy Committee that was transparent and accountable. He made it plain on each occasion that he still retained the overall responsibility and the lead role for financial stability and for eliminating, in so far as one can, systemic risk.</p>

No doubt much of the Bill will be further clarified and amended, but I believe that that is one important change to our arrangements and we should not lose sight of it.</p>

It can fairly be  said that both international and domestic regulatory arrangements failed, but it is clear to us that the greater failure of the domestic arrangements had a greater impact on our economy.

One of the inescapable conclusions must be that, if our economy is to recover, we shall need a thriving financial sector, and, given the crisis experienced by the financial markets, that will undoubtedly involve some changes in regulation.

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="91130-0016.htm_para23"><a name="09113050000022">There is provision for both the Treasury and the Bank of England to notify the FSA if they wish to indicate that a plan is unsatisfactory and recommend action, yet the FSA does not have to undertake that action. I raised that point earlier in an intervention on the Chancellor, and I acknowledge his point to me, which was, "We're the Treasury so we're all-encompassing and all-powerful, and as we're standing behind this, the FSA will have to take account of it." If that is the Chancellor's intention, however, why does the Bill not state that? The fact that it does not and that the FSA can ignore the warnings about inadequate regimes reveals an inherent contradiction in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="91130-0016.htm_para24"><a name="09113050000023">Clause 12 gives rise to two further questions. How easy will it be for complex financial organisations to comply with resolution plans? The FSA has already said it expects there to be some clashes and that it would simplify structures when a living will appears to be unworkable. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us in his winding-up speech on the definition of unworkable in this context, and about exactly what powers the FSA will have-and will need to have-to implement the resolution plans. I am sure the Minister is aware that the group finance director of Barclays has already indicated that it has a very complex structure of international subsidiaries and branches. In practice, how will the FSA simplify that organisation to make a resolution plan work? I am sure the Minister has the answer to that.</p>

I do not think there is any dispute that they are a good idea, and the likelihood is that we will see some co-ordinated international actions on such plans in the very near future. Therefore, in what ways do the Government intend to take notice of that co-ordinated action proposed by the G20? Do they intend to leave this clause in place? Do they intend to say that it will become a sunset clause, so that anything proposal from the G20 can change it, or do they intend to ignore whatever the G20 might try to set out in the framework?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="91130-0016.htm_para26"><a name="09113050000025">Clause 13 deals with short selling. As I am one of the Members who in a previous life worked in the financial markets, it is probably right that I resist the temptation to talk about any of the clauses on remuneration. There is an entirely erroneous myth that short selling is relatively new to financial markets, but prior to the change in the method of paying for bargains in the 1990s, the market had many operators who were known as account traders. These were exactly the same people as those who short sell nowadays; they bought stock they did not have the funds to pay for, and they sold stock they did not own. The 1990s marked the onset of hedge funds and the ability to "short", the use of derivatives, contracts for difference and so forth, and therefore short selling has become more widespread. However, do the Government accept the point of the Liberal spokesman, the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), which goes to the essence of this: the FSA already has powers to introduce emergency restrictions to prevent the creation, or increase of, net short positions? It also has powers to demand the daily disclosure of net short positions. Those powers were granted under section 118 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Therefore, this Bill is doing two things. It is extending the sunset clause on the powers to act on market abuse, but the power to act on short selling could be separated from the power to act on general market abuse. The Chancellor had some words to say on the Bill and the powers granted to the FSA on short selling. However, he will know that the British Bankers Association has said:</p>

What extra powers are needed? Do the Government accept that short selling is not intrinsically a market abuse? Short selling enables financial firms to offer hedging and market-making facilities-indeed, it allows essential market liquidity. Making liquidity in both the London markets and the international markets means that markets function. We have seen that when markets seize up that has direct economic repercussions. Do the Government accept that short selling is a tool that is not intrinsically wrong or an abuse, but just a financial tool? What is wrong or abusive is how it is used in some circumstances.</p>

 I do not know whether I shall be serving on the Committee for which some people are volunteering and on which others will be extremely disappointed not to be serving. It will consider a portmanteau Bill containing a wide range of issues relating to financial services. Thus, the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) reasonably said, "Well if it is such a bag, let's see what other elements might be stuffed into it." The Committee will almost certainly have before it a number of amendments suggesting the inclusion of a variety of measures, particularly on consumer protection, that might be useful.</p>

I serve on the Treasury Committee and I subscribe to the opinions that it expressed: that this would appear to be a rebranding exercise, unless far greater detail is given about how this body will function. The Bill is silent on that-we will doubtless hear more in Committee. Those who miss that experience will miss out on the detailed exposition that might be given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="91130-0017.htm_para2"><a name="09113050000032">One of the difficulties that we face is that at the start of this crisis no institution explicitly had responsibility for financial stability, but now everyone has. The Financial Services Authority has been given it-or it will be given responsibility, should this Bill pass into law-and the Banking Act 2009 gave it to the Bank of England. I am not sure that that makes us feel much safer, partly because when everyone shares a responsibility, it is not entirely clear who is genuinely answerable for decision making-I shall discuss that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="91130-0017.htm_para3"><a name="09113050000033">Secondly, I am not sure that we are very clear on what financial stability actually means. We know when it is absent-that is easy to work out; we have been through a period of obvious financial instability-but it is not entirely clear how we define "financial stability" and how we learn, institutionally, of the threats that there might be to it, which will not be identical to the ones through which we have been recently.</p>

This is one of the areas where the Governor of the Bank of England has been perfectly fairly pressing the political class in this country to define its positions more clearly. If we are to allocate responsibilities for financial stability, the crucial element is to work out who does the various tasks. We are still searching for firm answers on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="91130-0017.htm_para5"><a name="09113050000035">One of the issues that concerns me most is information flow. If the FSA retains, as I believe it should, the regulatory responsibility for financial institutions in this country, the information gathered will be a crucial part of the Bank of England's carrying out of its financial stability responsibilities. I am not entirely clear that that information flow works correctly now; it is not built into law in the 2009 Act. I, like those who sat through that Committee stage, remember some discussion about whether it might be included in the legislative obligations attached to the FSA and passed through to the Bank of England.</p>

The hon.

If I were in such a role, I would not want to be dismissive or rude about proposals put to me by an Opposition who appear to be leading in the opinion polls. We have to understand human nature.</p>

 I do not think that that has contributed to the severity of the crisis; I think it did contribute to the slightly muddled handling of the crisis at its very beginning. The report that the Treasury Committee prepared on the initial stages of the banking crisis usefully highlighted some of the difficulties of communication both between the tripartite authorities and, perhaps equally importantly, outwards to the rest of us, as they acted. I do not think that there was a proper process of public exposition of what was going on to critical market makers and to the general public.</p>

I went through the painful process of observing health service reform, as I suspect that we all did-certainly those of us who have been here since 1997-and the obsession with structural reform  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="30 Nov 2009">

in the health service is an exact example of the atrophy that can be produced if that obsession is followed through. We end up freezing people's actions for a period; they worry about their careers and try to work out where they will be doing their jobs and how they will carry out their responsibilities instead of doing the things that we genuinely want them to do. The Government have not been guiltless of an obsession with structures. I advise the Opposition, should they have the opportunity to implement their plans, not to follow those obsessions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="91130-0017.htm_para9"><a name="09113050000043">Let me turn to other positive elements of the Bill. I will be very surprised if anyone pops up in this debate and says that living wills are an unwelcome proposal. There is an issue with quite how they will be implemented, but I would probably argue with the hon. Member for Tatton, were he here, and say that part of the exercise is to tighten corporate rigour over the understanding of the structures and risks. One of the difficulties that we have seen is the extraordinary engineering that sometimes goes into corporate structures in the financial sector, which is perhaps lost on some of the board, too. An attempt to force companies into at least applying rigorously an understanding of how their organisations fit together and therefore how they might be deconstructed at some stage in the future, should it come to that, is a helpful process that they should have to go through. Yes, it is tiresome and possibly bureaucratic, but it will possibly also expose areas of uselessness and pure engineering in an activity rather than areas of functional need. It is certainly useful for the regulator to understand that process, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="91130-0017.htm_para10"><a name="09113050000044">That is only one element of addressing the issue of whether such institutions are too big to fail. I, too, take the view that capital and liquidity obligations are almost certainly the key element of dealing with the "too big to fail" argument. However, I do not rule out the approach that the Governor of the Bank of England has, I think espoused-if we do not force the break-up of these institutions, we should at least structure them in such a way that taxpayer risk is more confined. If one chooses a corporate model that includes a retail bank and an investment bank structure, we should at least have some means of limiting the taxpayer liability to the service element of the banking institution that we are supporting. Such a provision is worth considering and is not developed within the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="91130-0017.htm_para11"><a name="09113050000045">When it comes to improving corporate governance, although it is certainly true that there has been regulatory failure-those who do not think that should look at the internal audit report that the FSA produced after Northern Rock-there has clearly been behavioural failure too, which is not the responsibility of regulators but is possibly to do with the nudges, to use the fashionable term, that we try to apply to prompt appropriate action among those who are carrying out functions in our society. I assume that the new powers on financial reporting, which I believe that the Treasury will be taking, will address the Walker recommendations on risk committees, giving them a separate reporting stream in corporate governance. Perhaps we will hear more about that in Committee.</p>

the risk of the institutions. That is how they should be considered; it is not for this House to consider in this Bill whether it is equitable to pay people staggering amounts for carrying out their tasks. There is a question about whether society should permit that and whether people should be taxed more, but that is a separate issue that the House should certainly consider but in a different context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="91130-0017.htm_para13"><a name="09113050000047">Our decision making on that should be informed by, but not wholly governed by, competitive pressures. We are too easily persuaded by financial institutions saying, "If we do this, all these people will wander off and go to the United States, Switzerland or wherever else they think it might be advantageous to go"-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am not saying that we should ignore it. We should be informed by it, but not necessarily governed by it. One point that we should be governed by, which is important and that again came up in the discussions on the Banking Bill, is the fact that we should not threaten the contractual nexus between an employer and an employee.</p>

Although I would not subscribe to the view that our problems have stemmed wholly from a failure of regulation, there are ways in which we can encourage rational and prudent behaviours and discourage the opposite. These include addressing remuneration models and strengthening risk governance and reporting. They should also cover strengthening the capability of non-executives and the robustness of the relationship between shareholders and the board.</p>

Perhaps the most telling remarks were those made by representatives of HSBC, who related how they were strongly criticised by shareholder representatives for their conservative models of banking. Shareholders also totally ignored some of the evidence that lay before them of extraordinary risk: the ABN AMRO acquisition was endorsed by RBS's shareholders. It is worth thinking carefully about how shareholders can be better empowered and informed in making critical decisions about their interest in companies.</p>

I strongly welcome the operational separation of the FSA from the education function and the broadening of the governance of that critical activity, which I take to be the implication of setting up the board. Presumably, the body will absorb all the FSA's function in consumer education, including the work carried out by PFEG-the Personal Finance Education Group-in schools. It is worth commenting on the FSA's view of how it carries out those functions now.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point, on which I cannot enlighten him. I can say that if one glances through appendix 7 of the FSA's annual report, one finds an example of the way it reports targets. It was set a target of reaching 516,000 children in England with a learning money matters project and reported that it had exceeded the target by reaching 742,500 children. As far as I can tell, that figure seems to be the number of schools to which the FSA sent material multiplied by the number of pupils who were presumably in those schools, so one wonders whether the word "reach" is appropriately applied to such a limited and-from what I know about the distribution of the packs-doubtful link to a school institution. There is a lot more. I picked only the first two targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="91130-0017.htm_para18"><a name="09113050000054">A lot of money is being spent on that objective and more is to come, so clear quality indicators are required, showing what difference has actually been made by providing those services. No one doubts that providing financial education for children and for consumers at large is very important, but what I have seen is of relatively limited quality. Quite often it is fancy stuff; as an MP, I should be proud to give it to constituents, but I wonder whether they would actually use it. I have repeatedly raised concerns about the issue, but have not been satisfied, so if the measure improves the governance of the programme, I shall be delighted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="91130-0017.htm_para19"><a name="09113050000055">Finally, I welcome the measures on facilitating collective proceedings by consumers. It is an important step. I note the concern of the banking industry and its opposition to the proposal, but I merely note it-they would say that, wouldn't they? We should obviously listen carefully to detailed representations, but we should press ahead on the principle. We are dealing with complex products and services, and without the aid of a representative body the ordinary consumer at large is often ill-placed to pursue a complaint against a financial institution. Giving consumer groups a clear role would leave far less to the chance that well-informed and resourceful consumers will sometimes win through in the end. I represent someone who has been fighting their way through energy issues-an almost equally complex area-and it is a delight to deal with someone who is really getting to grips with the detail. However, the experience has left me feeling that vast numbers of people do not have the time, expertise or will to go through such a process. That definitely applies to the financial market, so if collective action is to be the first step, I welcome it.</p>

They fail to realise that it is no longer the case that just a bit of restoration to a slightly damaged canvas is required-changing the artistic imagery slightly. Instead, we need a new canvas. Instead, what we get in the Bill is detailed draftsmanship and micro-management to hide the fact that the proposals introduce little substantive change to the overall regulatory architecture of the financial sector.

I was interested in the comment by the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), who is no longer in his seat, that there is risk in changing the financial architecture. I agree; indeed, there was a risk in changing the architecture to the tripartite system in the first place, and the results are now coming home to roost. The question is not whether there is risk involved, but how that risk is managed. That goes to the point that my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="91130-0017.htm_para26"><a name="09113050000065">The second tool in the box is regulation, of which the Bill before us promises much. As with so many other Bills that rely on regulation, however, we debate it in a vacuum and we do not get to see the regulations into which the substance of the Bill has been hived off-sometimes not even in Committee. I therefore ask the Government to outline the timetable for producing the draft regulations associated with the Bill-particularly those on collective proceedings-and to ensure that they will be available to the Public Bill Committee, because I am volunteering to serve on it, given the fundamental nature of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="91130-0017.htm_para27"><a name="09113050000066">There is every indication that the Bill has been rushed through without as much thought as it deserved, notwithstanding the recent White Paper. Although there was consultation on the White Paper, I am struck by  the number of organisations that have complained at the lack of consultation on the detailed proposals in the Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para1"><a name="09113050000069">As other hon. Members have asked, why do we need a law to bring the Chancellor, the Governor of the Bank of England and the head of the FSA together, when there is a mechanism for doing that already? The answer was provided by a nameless Treasury spokesperson who was quoted in the "FT Adviser" website article. We now find out why the Bill is required. He is quoted as saying:</p>
<a name="91130-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="09113050000159"><ul><p class="tabletext">"We will be replacing the existing structure of the Tripartite arrangement where we meet strictly on an ad hoc basis and never publish any minutes of our meetings and never reporting to Parliament.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09113050000070">Well, there we have it-the real purpose of the Bill and its real impact. The Bill is required because the Chancellor, the Governor of the Bank of England and the head of the FSA cannot keep minutes. The real title of the Bill should be "A Bill to make provision amending the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and for  the installation of good practice in minute keeping by the principals in the tripartite system."</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para3"><a name="09113050000071">I am sure that we will all now feel much safer because of that-but things get worse. The Government's response to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee recommendation on the new tripartite system is that the new council will replace the existing memorandum of understanding. It clearly has no real Executive functions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) said earlier, this is nothing more than a  <br>

<a name="91130-0018.htm_brev2"><a name="09113050000160"><ul><p class="tabletext">"the tripartite structure is fundamentally defective."</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09113050000073">So I am left with four questions for Minister to answer on that part of the Bill. First, does he not accept that there was at best a lack of co-ordination between tripartite members, and does he really believe that the Bill will fix the problem? When meetings are so formal and the structure so inflexible, how will the system operate in a crisis? Any company that faces a new structure will at least have done some comprehensive modelling of what the new structure would be like, and those who take a proper risk approach will have done some modelling of how it would work in a crisis. Surely we should expect the same diligence to be undertaken by the Government in relation to what they propose in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para6"><a name="09113050000074">Secondly, does the Minister accept that the Bill will introduce more ambiguity about where institutional responsibility lies?

Thirdly, does he accept the advice from the House of Lords Economics Affairs Committee that</p>
<a name="91130-0018.htm_brev4"><a name="09113050000162"><ul><p class="tabletext">"for crisis management to be effective, it needs to be clear who is in charge",</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para7"><a name="09113050000075">and also accept that the Bill does not answer that question? If he is unwilling to listen to advice from the Opposition, is he willing to take on board the comments of the CBI, CMS Cameron McKenna and the Association of British Insurers about the remaining confusion of responsibilities that the Bill will create?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para8"><a name="09113050000076">The CBI says:</p>
<a name="91130-0018.htm_brev5"><a name="09113050000163"><ul><p class="tabletext">"A disadvantage of giving the FSA an explicit objective for financial stability is that this would perpetuate some of the ambiguities regarding institutional responsibilities that were apparent in the build-up to the financial crisis."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para9"><a name="09113050000077">Cameron McKenna says that this</p>
<a name="91130-0018.htm_brev6"><a name="09113050000164"><ul><p class="tabletext">"is old wine in a new skin-merely another way of expressing the existing Tripartite authority which has not delivered the stability that is needed."</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para11"><a name="09113050000079">Finally, does the Minister accept that the new role for the FSA that the Bill proposes is a rebranding exercise, without any meaning without more fundamental change? How else are we to interpret the Government's response to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee recommendation at paragraph 115, about the need for executive responsibility? How else are we to interpret the Government's response that the Council for Financial Stability will work essentially by reviewing publications about the problems that are happening? It does not sound as if a dynamic institution is being suggested. This is the time to give power for macro and micro-regulation and responsibility for financial stability to the Bank of England, so that we know that somebody competent is in charge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para12"><a name="09113050000080">There are two other areas on which I would be grateful for the Minister's comments in his winding-up speech. It is clear that the need to ramp up consumer protection issues so much in the Bill is an indication of a failure to take consumer protection into account in the tripartite arrangements that were put in place by the Prime Minister. I welcome a focus on the need for consumer education. There are 9 million people in the UK in serious personal debt, and British consumers are twice as indebted as people in the rest of Europe. There is very little financial education around-so little that a MORI poll from 2004 showed that only 30 per cent. of people could work out a simple interest rate calculation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para13"><a name="09113050000081">It is not only people on the lowest incomes who are likely to enter into serious personal debt. High debt can push people on higher incomes into poverty, too. We know that there is a circular link between personal indebtedness and social problems, and that debt is a cause of social problems. Recently, the Save the Children campaign calculated that the present recession has caused 5.2 million households to be classed as sub-prime, and 25,000 consumer credit applications are turned down every day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para14"><a name="09113050000082">It surely defies credibility that financial education should come from the FSA, given its record in the present crisis. I tend to agree with the British Bankers Association that this should be dealt with elsewhere and should be more fundamental. That is why our proposals for a strong new consumer protection agency are so important, setting it out as a champion for consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para15"><a name="09113050000083">I remain concerned about the practical implications of the use of the courts proposed in the class action proposals. Given that the courts are likely to be snarled up by judicial reviews of Government economic policy, one wonders whether there will be any room for consumer cases to be heard at all. But this is a serious issue and many commentators have commented on the fact that the proposals will create a US-style litigation culture. It would therefore be good to hear from the Minister what work has been done to show that that culture in the US has benefited customers, and what lessons have been learned by the Government in framing the Bill and the regulations that will come with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para16"><a name="09113050000084">This is an area that would have benefited from wider consultation, to ensure balance if nothing else. I would like to hear more about how the Government see the balance which will be required between the responsibilities and the rights of consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para17"><a name="09113050000085">I want to ask some questions of the Government about how the Bill will relate to emerging regulations from the EU and the direction of travel in relation to the G20. I listened with great care to what the Chancellor said at the beginning of the debate about the red lines and the connection with regulation. I am not yet convinced that any of us understands precisely how those red lines will work, or how the Government's stance in the Bill will be taken forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para18"><a name="09113050000086">I have two issues in mind. As the Minister knows, the Commission issued a Green Paper on collective redress, setting out a number of options for settling large-scale consumer complaints. That was followed by a period of consultation earlier in the year, which produced conflicting results not only on whether collective redress was desirable, but on how it should be implemented. I understand that some leading European lawyers have questioned whether, under EU law, there is a clear legal basis for consumer  <br>

collective redress. I am therefore keen to know to what extent the Government have taken into account the Green Paper and the underlying consultation, and whether their proposals conflict with European law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para19"><a name="09113050000087">In September the European Commission adopted proposals aimed at addressing regulatory weakness at micro and macro-prudential level through the creation of a European system of financial supervisors and a European systemic risk board. The Chancellor covered some of that, but I would still be grateful if the Minister who is to wind up could say what the relationship will be between what the Bill proposes and what the Commission proposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para20"><a name="09113050000088">Looking more widely at the implications in terms of the G20, concerns have been expressed that the speed with which the Government are acting in the Bill, in advance of similar proposals from other countries, is a distinct competitive disadvantage. That has been expressed mostly in terms of the power to control remuneration contracts, but also in terms of creating living wills. The CBI has pointed out the need for the consistent action that other countries are taking if we are to avoid damaging the UK's competitiveness, and PricewaterhouseCoopers has commented on how the provision as drafted may catch others whom it was not originally intended to cover. Indeed, Lord Myners dismissed that with a rather populist phrase about curbing "reckless greed", but I hope that the Minister will treat the subject more seriously and tell us how the proposals go further than merely treating the symptoms of the disease, and get to the heart of the cure, which would involve a complex culture change in the appreciation of risk-a much broader and more complex subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para21"><a name="09113050000089">The noble Lord dismissed concerns that the UK's unilateral action would be contrary to competitiveness, stating that it was</p>

 I welcome the Bill, which will give consumers more protection, an issue that I shall dwell on in my speech. The legislation will also empower the FSA and the Government to introduce tougher regulation of banks and their risky practices; better protect the taxpayer; importantly, restore consumers' confidence in financial services by providing people with greater protection and education; and, very importantly, provide powerful and easier routes to redress, when consumers have suffered widespread detriment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para28"><a name="09113050000097">Although we might be discussing how we will create better regulations to give the consumer more protection, we should not forget the impact of the banking and financial crisis on constituencies such as mine and the human cost, which is so often lost when we get to the detail of such Bills. Over the past year or two, unemployment has increased more rapidly in Halton than anywhere else in the north-west bar Knowsley. Recently, the unemployment rate has slowed, but it continues to affect many families and individuals in my constituency and elsewhere. People have found themselves unemployed for the first time. Indeed, one constituent told me that, until recently, he had not been unemployed in 38 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para29"><a name="09113050000098">Many poor people have fallen into debt, something that we are discussing as part of the Bill, and many have had their houses repossessed. We should not forget the impact on businesses, particularly small businesses. All that, of course, was caused by the incompetence and greed of bankers and financial institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para30"><a name="09113050000099">On executive remuneration, my constituents have raised with me the issue of greedy bankers and bank bonuses. Of course, I am not talking about the ordinary bank workers in the offices of local branches but those who take the decisions and make the big salaries. It is hard to ignore the link between the risky activities of companies at a corporate level and an incentive structure that rewards such risk-taking at an individual level. Knowing what we know now, it seems remarkable that the financial institutions and those who had responsibility for managing them did not recognise and understand the risks they were taking on and were unable to prevent the consequences or to put in place plans to deal with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para31"><a name="09113050000100">I am pleased that the Bill gives the FSA new powers on bankers' pay. Importantly, it also gives the FSA the power to rule that employment contracts not compliant with the code are void and unenforceable, and to make provision for the recovery of any payment made under a void provision. There must be more transparency on the disclosure of remuneration and pay bands. Irresponsible behaviour has to be changed.

already in financial crisis, and I am pleased that the Government will legislate to ban that practice. We have seen the usual bad practices with small-print conditions-for example, the interest rate applying to payments is not clearly stated in all cases, and it is sometimes not indicated that using credit card cheques to make payments means that cardholders do not have any redress against the credit card company. I welcome the intention to make it an offence for a credit card issuer to send credit cheques to a customer other than in response to a request from that customer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para33"><a name="09113050000102">Excessive bank charges have been the subject of ongoing discussion, particularly with the recent court ruling. That problem has to be dealt with, and I would prefer the Government to take more regulatory powers in order to do so. We should take action on unsolicited credit card limit increases that just appear through the letterbox. The practice of changing the interest on monthly credit card payments will particularly affect young people and get lots of them into debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="91130-0018.htm_para34"><a name="09113050000103">I very much welcome the proposed establishment of the consumer financial education body and the provision of guidance on money. Several hon. Members have mentioned the importance of education on consumer credit and financial management. Consumer education and awareness is a key part of the Bill. Citizens Advice welcomes the establishment of the consumer financial education body, saying that it is a step change that will benefit consumers enormously. The work of citizens advice bureaux in delivering financial education has demonstrated the appetite and need for such training and the quantifiable improvement that it makes to people's confidence in dealing with their financial affairs. For example, according to Citizens Advice, 38 per cent. of clients who took part in the Save Xmas financial education sessions funded by the Office of Fair Trading said that they had since made changes to how they save.</p>

I pay tribute to citizens advice bureaux, particularly the branch in my constituency, which does an excellent job, and with which I work very closely, in helping people in severe debt or other financial difficulties, which have been exacerbated by the economic downturn. I particularly commend its volunteer programme. I am pleased that the impact of debt on health is being further highlighted. That is why the primary care trust in Halton has been funding debt advice in addition to the money that the Government are putting in.</p>

 For some centuries past the City of London's greatest attraction has been its international reputation as a bastion of commercial certainty and reliability. English law is respected across the globe: countless contracts between parties from far away continents are often drawn up under its jurisdiction. In commercial affairs the City of London is rightly seen as a watchword for justice, neutrality and fairness. Too much, I fear, of what is proposed in this Financial Services Bill flies in the face of this fearless and hard-earned reputation. It threatens to do untold damage to the United Kingdom as a commercial and trading centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para0"><a name="09113050000112">Even in the face of two world wars, the City  of London regarded with the utmost seriousness  its international contractual obligations-even to counterparties from those nations with which we were in conflict. We meddle with this proud history at our peril. I am therefore especially alarmed at the plans to give the Financial Services Authority the power, among others, to tear up future contracts that do not comply with its new arbitrary regulations on curbing remuneration and bonuses. The notion that the FSA might in such a way strike out legal contracts will cause grievous harm to the reputation of English law and the national sense of fair play. It also seems likely to fall foul of international-in particular, European Union-obligations on competition policy.</p>

We will then be in the absolute worst of all worlds: putting on to the statute book legislation that gives a clear signal to international trading partners that Britain is no longer such a free or fair place to do business; but also concocting a set of regulations that are, for practical purposes, impossible to enforce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para2"><a name="09113050000114">As ever, there seems to be little consideration of the national interest in what the Government propose in this Bill. Instead, we see short-sighted, tactical positioning. At a time when my own party has made it clear that an incoming Conservative Administration would dismantle the Financial Services Authority, the Treasury now seeks to limit our future room for manoeuvre by empowering it even further.</p>

Given that the threat of closure hangs over the FSA, how on earth will it be able to recruit sufficiently talented new staff to take on its enhanced responsibilities? It is important that the authority and the Treasury properly think through all the practical implications of the Bill. Its unintended consequence will be that institutions are far less likely to wish to do business on these shores, which will be to our collective detriment in the years to come.</p>

Promoted as a way of recouping more quickly the taxpayer cash put into banking bail-outs, which at least superficially seems a desirable enough goal, and of rebalancing the economy and helping the poor, as a surcharge on financial services it would in reality fulfil none of those objectives. Unless it were implemented in precisely the same way globally, it would be impossible to put into effect without disastrous consequences for both London and the UK. The United States has already signalled its clear opposition to such a levy, making it more likely that if it were to be applied on these shores, even in a diluted way, business would flee to countries free of the tax or simply engineer new financial instruments to get around it.</p>

 My objection was to existing contracts being torn up. It was the retrospection that I was objecting to.

should be blackmailed by those in any industry into serving its particular interests above all others. However, I cannot help but conclude that in this Bill, the Government are simply grandstanding rather than introducing measures that will really be effective and minimise risk.</p>

Failings in risk modelling, credit ratings, macro-economic management and elements of regulatory oversight, as well as a number of other contributory factors, created the conditions in which excessive profits were made. As my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (John Howell) said, huge bonuses were the end product of a dysfunctional financial system, not the underlying cause of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para7"><a name="09113050000121">Another suggestion is that far more of any remuneration package should be in long-term incentives rather than cash salary. Superficially that is an attractive proposition, but we should not forget that it had very little effect on the fate of either Lehman Brothers or Bear Stearns, two of the banks that have collapsed most spectacularly over the past two years. Both those organisations were famous for rewarding successful employees with large amounts of stock, which either by law or by internal practice proved unmarketable for a considerable period, yet that had little impact on the ultimate demise of both.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para8"><a name="09113050000122">The City remains concerned that seeking short-term solutions on bonuses to quell public and media demands could bring down on the industry a raft of new regulations designed more to punish that anything else. It should also be remembered that high remuneration, be it in salary or in bonus, is not such an emotive issue outside Europe. We need to recognise that our regulation and tax policies have to take account of those prevailing in other countries that pose a competitive threat.</p>

The imperative to start repaying at the earliest opportunity cannot be overstated, yet commercial lending is unlikely to return to anything like normal until the second half of 2011 as toxic assets are gradually removed from banks' balance sheets. I therefore believe that the credit crunch will be with small and medium-sized businesses for some time to come.</p>

When can the Bank of England and the Treasury call time on their short-term fix? Amid the euphoria of a narrative that suggests that recovery is well within sight, I fear that we are a considerable way from being out of the woods. The root causes of the global imbalances brought about by the west's financial calamity were the credit/debt bubble, along with the east's aggressive desire to build market share in global trade. China's policy of suppressing its currency to soak up the west's debt in the bond markets further helped hold down interest rates. Yet the resultant over-investment, excess capacity and vast structural debt in the west remains in place. The underlying causes of the credit crunch have not gone away.</p>

that the Government's insurance of toxic assets has provided a dangerously false dawn. There is no incentive-or currently even a requirement-for banks to crystallise non-performing loans; they could not then ignore the losses on their balance sheet. Lloyds banking group, for example, with a huge property portfolio, courtesy of its ill-starred merger just over a year ago with HBOS, sits on an enormous pile of assets worth a fraction of their book value at their boom-time purchase.</p>

Put simply, we need to ensure that management in banks can summarise in simple terms the financial products they wish to sell. To that extent, I agree with the hon. Member for Halton (Derek Twigg)-if a derivatives product cannot be explained on two sides of A4, frankly it should not be marketed. Naturally an unworkably complicated regulatory framework risks seriously hitting the future viability and profitability of the entire industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para13"><a name="09113050000127">Instead, the well-being of the institutions in the sector-not to mention its customers-depends on the development of a workable regulatory system, based on commercial principles, which will pass muster for decades to come. How else can we persuade those in their 20s to commence a lifetime of prudent saving as a prelude to a financially comfortable retirement? It all comes down to trust. That is an ingredient that no amount of regulation or consumer protection will rapidly restore.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para14"><a name="09113050000128">Alongside the promotion of open competition and an end to the heresy that a bank might be too big or interconnected to fail, the best a Government can do is advance a culture of mutuality. We need to inculcate a sense of accountability between individual policyholders and a diverse range of financial institutions. For that reason, I support the potential for Northern Rock to revert to building society status once it has been stabilised financially. Promotion of as diverse as possible a financial services ecosystem should be a goal of future policy. Ethical values should come from individuals rather than resulting from a hostility which, inevitably, will be mounted against any all-powerful regulator. We should not expect too much from regulation. The buck must stop with all of us as consumers.</p>

A competitive free market can be promoted only by the re-establishment of less concentration among all institutions in the financial sphere. Ultimately, that means allowing companies-even huge players like Lehman Brothers-to fail. The interests of depositors and retail investors should be protected from such an eventuality, but not the bondholders. Protection of the latter is one reason for the problem not going away any time soon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para16"><a name="09113050000130">A healthy, competitive and innovative capitalist system requires risk-taking, which is why shareholders and bondholders should not naturally expect such blanket protection. The trouble is that too much of the current debate on banking regulation, as shown by the Bill, focuses on how we should have stopped the last crash. That has not been helped by a Government whose recent economic policy pronouncements are governed less by the national interest and more by a scorched earth policy, designed to limit the room for manoeuvre for years to come of any incoming Government.</p>

 I welcome the chance to speak after the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) who obviously has the interests of the financial services sector at the heart of his constituency. In my constituency, we have part of Nationwide, and Barclaycard is next door, so I also have a strong financial services lobby. All of us of course also have constituents who are entirely dependent on the maintenance of a secure financial system, both for their own jobs and for financial services, such as pensions and mortgages. For that reason, although this Bill is phenomenally technical, it goes to the heart of what our constituents want to see happen, and that is why it is right that the Government should include it in their legislative programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para18"><a name="09113050000133">The Government have to introduce the measures that they think right, and I agree with the separation of the Bank of England and the FSA, as set out in the Bill. The Government should not look to the pending election and ask "What are the policies of the Opposition?" and, depending on the answer, do nothing or do what they say. The Government should persist with the course of action that they think fit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para19"><a name="09113050000134">The origins of the debate, dating back to 1997, were mentioned at the outset. That was when the supervision of the banks was taken away from the Bank of England. It has been talked about as if that was the only thing that happened on that occasion, but it was not. The key factor was the Bank of England being given independence and control over the setting of interest rates. That was a phenomenally powerful tool to give the Bank, which had previously been jealously preserved by the Chancellor. It was a profound decision that affected all our constituents. Giving those powers to the Bank of England was a dramatic move and one that proved to be extremely successful. Control over interest rates was the key to controlling inflation, which at the time was the public financial enemy No. 1. It made perfect sense to transfer that power, and the FSA was then set up to deal with the regulatory issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para20"><a name="09113050000135">Over the years, we have had debates about what was done, and questions were asked about the wisdom of some of the moves. I have been on the Treasury Committee for four years, so I came in at the tail end of some of those debates. It was when things were starting to get a bit bumpy, because we had big debates about asset prices, especially property. Most of those debates, and the pressure put on the Governor, came from Members of Parliament, especially my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love). I did not tell him that I intended to mention him, but as I am flattering him,  I hope that he will not mind. He repeatedly pressed that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para21"><a name="09113050000136">We also had a lot of discussion about the dislocation of the bank's rate from the interest rates as all of our constituents experienced them, especially over the past 18 months to two years.

agree with the Governor's view of the rate of inflation. Many of those issues were a start in considering whether the system as set up in 1997 would hold for the next  10 or 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para22"><a name="09113050000137">In fact, quite often over the past few years, the Select Committee almost got to the point of spotting what would lead to the collapse. When we looked at some financial products-we looked at collateralised debt obligations, or CDOs, but not CDOs squared-questions were asked about their construction, what they meant, what underpinned them, what their creditworthiness was, and so on. However, we did not push as hard as was perhaps needed to see what was happening. The Governor certainly never warned of exactly what was happening. I noticed that although the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) referred to asset prices, he did not read out any clear warning from the Governor- or, indeed, from anyone else-about the scale of the  collapse that was coming down the line; and indeed, the FSA chair and chief exec at the time did not warn about it either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para23"><a name="09113050000138">When the collapse came, those of us on the Select Committee virtually had a ringside seat. The tripartite authority was caught out, albeit not because of anything inherent in its structure, but because of the speed and scale of the collapse. People could see the asset price bubbles and the complex financial products, although nobody quite knew what was in those products. Indeed, at one Committee meeting I remember people talking about how they would unwrap a layer to see what was under them, find that there was nothing at all and then pass them on as quickly as they could, before they ended up on their books.</p>

 Although I share the hon. Lady's view that the tripartite system in itself was not the main cause of everything collapsing, does she share the Opposition's concern that the Treasury turned a blind eye and did not warn anyone, in the way that probably none of us in politics did, because the money pouring in from the City was obviously attractive and because financial services brought huge income into the Treasury's coffers? The core question is: where did responsibility lie? However, when that question was asked of the Governor of the Bank of England, answer came there none.</p>

 I completely agree. There have been issues about what happened. The question that I was working towards is: how do we put it right? Everybody agrees that things went wrong, and everybody agrees that when the crisis came, the tripartite authority did not manage to resolve the issue in a very clever fashion. We heard all the accounts and all the evidence is there in  the reports. The primary issue was not so much that the people involved were having a bust-up, but that the speed, scale and unexpectedness of the collapse caught everybody by surprise. In particular, as soon as the collapse hit the public and they started the run on Northern Rock, a domino effect could have moved quickly through our financial services, had the Government not also moved quickly, which they did. They did so after the collapse of Lehman Brothers as well.</p>

to deal with what was a huge problem. However, just to say, "The relationships are dysfunctional; therefore we have to abolish or change everything," as the hon. Member for Tatton did, is not something that I buy into. That was the bottom line of his arguments, and I simply do not accept them. A number of issues have to be dealt with or thought through before we start talking about dismantling the FSA-or rather, not so much dismantling it, but tacking it wholesale on to the Bank of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para25"><a name="09113050000142">First, there are serious conflicts of interest in having an organisation that uses the monetary policy tools that the Governor now has at his disposal, including quantitative easing, and that also supervises the banks. We could create Chinese walls and separations within the organisation, but given the importance of the subject and the order of the issues being dealt with, it is much better for those different functions to be more clearly separated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para26"><a name="09113050000143">The second thing-it has grown out of the crisis and we have all had to learn about it-is that the public are now much more demanding about scrutiny and transparency. The hon. Member for Twickenham talked about the banks' obligations on lending rates, which have not been restored to what they were. I do not think that the public are going to accept that one organisation, although it has responsibilities to report to different organisations, is likely to have the most wonderful culture of openness and scrutiny by the general public. I do not think that it will provide the kind of openness that the public will demand for the next 10 to 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para27"><a name="09113050000144">I always remember the time when the Governor came before the Select Committee to talk about what was happening with Northern Rock. He spoke in terms of, "If only the Bank had been able to carry out a covert operation". I had visions of somebody with a big bag of cash running out of the Bank of England towards Northern Rock, and I wondered how on earth that could be done in the modern day and age. Just recently, of course, the Bank has managed to carry out such operations, which is quite remarkable. It is interesting that the debate then starts to be about where the public accountability, scrutiny and answering lies for what the Bank and others are doing with public funds. We need a structure that will allow us to answer those questions. Splitting the FSA into separate organisations will not help; it already has a culture of openness that will help it to provide better answers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para28"><a name="09113050000145">Placing all the functions into just the Bank creates the problem that it might become too big an organisation. We have all talked it being too big and too important to fail and all the rest of it, but having one body deciding quantitative easing, interest rates, the education of the public, bank supervision, old Uncle Tom Cobleigh and all involves too many functions for one organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="91130-0019.htm_para29"><a name="09113050000146">Most importantly-this explains my question to the hon. Member for Tatton, and both the Governor and the FSA said this-the issue is not just about who sits where but is about what they do. Although there has been much discussion about reorganising structures, we also need to discuss the new tools that can be used to fix the current problems. It is much better to improve the structures we already have and focus on getting tools-other than the capital ratios that everybody has talked about a great deal-to try to tackle the problems we are going to face over the next 10 to 20 years.</p>

People have talked about bankers' pay, which is a major public concern. There is also a real awareness of the importance of the international regulations. I was pleased to hear my right hon. Friend the Chancellor speak about them in his opening address. I was particularly pleased to hear what he said about the credit ratings agencies-some of the real culprits in all this when they went on advising people about putting together hopelessly complex products and provided ratings for them. That then encouraged people to sell them when they were, in fact, houses of straw. I also greatly welcome the measures on consumer protection, particularly on the credit card cheques, in respect of which many hon. Members of all parties have campaigned for extra controls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para1"><a name="09113050000148">Nobody has mentioned clause 29, which I am particularly pleased to see in the Bill. It gives extra powers to  the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. In all the disasters around financial services over the past couple of years, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme is just about the one organisation that has been extremely efficient and has managed to ensure with record speed that people have received the compensation owed to them. I am sure that the Financial Secretary will mention this in his concluding speech, but the clause would make it possible for the FSCS to ensure on an agency basis that all the customers of the Icelandic banks, for example, get paid out. That would mean that the money of overseas customers, or United Kingdom customers with accounts abroad, would be protected as well. I think that it would cover all internet banking as well, but perhaps my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will clarify that point when he winds up the debate. In any event, it is a small but important measure.</p>

 We have had a thoughtful but rather low-key debate. That is surprising, given that the Bill is meant to be the central plank of the Government's strategy in the run-up to the next general election. There seemed to be no passionate desire among Labour Members to defend the existing structure of regulation in the United Kingdom, and they seemed to have no real confidence in their arguments. When Labour Members discuss the reforms that Conservative Members have proposed, there are no discussions about whether they are right or wrong in principle; we are merely told that they might be quite difficult to implement. That hardly suggests that Labour Members have confidence in the structure of which the Prime Minister himself was the author in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para4"><a name="09120112000013">It is important to ensure that we produce the right response to the problems that we have seen over the last two or three years. Taxpayers have had to stump up billions of pounds in guarantees for the financial services sector. People have lost their houses, and businesses are under threat. We need to establish whether our current regulatory system has failed, and if it has failed-as we believe it has-we need to think about the right way in which to introduce reforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para5"><a name="09120112000014">My hon. Friend the Member for Henley (John Howell) referred to the confusion that has arisen from the FSA's being given the objective of financial stability. Those who us who are veterans of the proceedings on the Bill that became the Banking Act 2009-such as the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd), the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)-will recall our debate about financial stability. We discussed the problems involved in giving the Bank a responsibility for which there was no definition, and giving the Bank a responsibility without, necessarily, any additional powers to implement that objective. We also debated whether or not financial stability should be an objective for the FSA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para6"><a name="09120112000015">On that occasion, the hon. Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle), then Exchequer Secretary, responded by saying:</p>
<a name="91130-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="09120112000577"><ul><p class="tabletext">"the FSA has important objectives in relation to financial stability and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which has a direct bearing on what we are talking about. For example, the FSA has a responsibility for maintaining market confidence in the financial system. That, too, is about financial stability".<i> --</i>[<i> Official Report, Banking Public Bill Committee, </i>30 October 2008; c. 232.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para7"><a name="09120112000016">It appears that last year the Government were very clear about the fact that the FSA had responsibility for financial stability. This year they appear to have changed their mind. I wonder whether that has just a little to do with the problem that affects the Bill. The Government are focusing on cosmetic changes, producing the illusion of activity and reform without making any substantial alterations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para8"><a name="09120112000017">My hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) expressed concern about the contractual relationship between employer and employee. The hon. Member for South Derbyshire raised a similar issue last year during the debate on what was then the Banking Bill. My hon. Friend also spoke of imbalances between the economies in the far east with current account surpluses, the role that they had played in supplying funds to London and New York and acting as intermediaries in the financial services markets in those two centres, and how that had fed the growth in credits and led to the asset price bubble that has burst to the cost of families and businesses across the country. He also touched upon the need to understand complex financial products. I think we would all agree that regulators and businesses failed to understand the nature of the risks in respect of these products, and the consequences of those risks when people were taking up products such as collateralised debt obligations, and CDOs-squared, on a large scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para10"><a name="09120112000019">The hon. Member for Coventry, North-West was right to be critical of that appointment. I sometimes get the sense in discussions on European financial services that the Treasury has let a matter rest for a long time and then rides in like the seventh cavalry, but ultimately fails to change things. We have had a flurry of activity over the past few days, with the Prime Minister and others trying to persuade President Barroso that Michel Barnier should not be appointed as commissioner. All came to nought, however, because the Treasury and the Government did not wake up to the risks until it was too late. I fear that we will see the consequences of that inactivity over the course of the life of the Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para11"><a name="09120112000020">The hon. Member for South Derbyshire spoke about employment rights, and he referred to the Bill as a portmanteau Bill. That is an apt description, as it highlights the fact that it is a hotch-potch collection of provisions that lacks a coherent theme. It does not really address the financial crisis, or some of the consumer credit issues that a number of Members have discussed during the debate. He asked, rather cynically, "Well, what do the people who argue in favour of your Conservative reforms want?" I am not entirely sure what Jacques de Larosière, Austan Goolsbee or Stanley Fischer want from a Conservative Government, and I do not know what is in our gift to give them. However, the fact that they recognise that there needs to be significant reform of financial regulation, and that more powers need to be given to central banks over the regulation of the financial services sector, demonstrate that our proposed reforms go with the grain of international debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para12"><a name="09120112000021">The hon. Member for Halton (Derek Twigg) talked about the impact of the financial crisis on the economy and on families and businesses in his area. That reminds us of the need to get the regulatory system right in order to minimise the risk of such crises arising again. He also referred to the indefensible practice of credit card cheques. Whenever I talk to people from the credit card sector, I always listen with fascination to their defence of these cheques, but there is no credible defence, and they should be scrapped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para13"><a name="09120112000022">The hon. Member for Northampton, North was the only Member on the Government-party Benches to offer even a slight defence of the existing regulatory regime. She gave an account of the discussions the Treasury Committee had with the Bank of England and others about complex products and the credit bubble. Part of the problem was that no one really had responsibility for financial stability or for working out what the impact of these risks would be on the financial system and the wider economy. That points to the gap in the system of financial regulation, which the Prime Minister established in the late '90s. No one had that responsibility, and sadly, the Bill does not address that fundamental problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para14"><a name="09120112000023">There are no significant measures in the Bill that demonstrate that the Government have learned the lessons from having seen the first run on a UK bank in   <br>

living memory. There appears to be nothing in the Bill that would prevent that from happening again. Secondly, our economy as a whole has been massively over-leveraged because nobody took responsibility for macro-prudential regulation and the maintenance of financial stability. It now appears that the Bank and the FSA share that responsibility without there being any clarity as to what that means, and what they will do in practice. It is all still to take place within the framework of the tripartite arrangements set up in the late 1990s. We know from the criticism of those arrangements how badly they have worked. We still do not know who, in the final analysis, has responsibility for financial stability: is it the Bank, the FSA-or, indeed, the Chancellor of the Exchequer? We have gone from a situation where nobody had responsibility to one where everyone has responsibility, but neither is a satisfactory outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para15"><a name="09120112000024">It is not just banks that were over-leveraged; consumers were, too. Our consumers were more highly leveraged than those in America, and personal debt in the UK is equal to that in France and Germany combined. Where are the measures in the Bill to address that? As I said, we welcome the measures to ban unsolicited credit card cheques, but we have long called for the Government  to go further in tackling some of the issues relating to consumer credit and rebuilding the savings culture in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para16"><a name="09120112000025">This financial crisis has wreaked devastation on consumers, families and businesses. We have seen the mis-selling of structured products, falling interest rates for savers and pensioners, and an increasingly concentrated banking sector. Again, nothing in this Bill gets to the root of why regulation is failing consumers. We welcome the measures in the Bill on collective redress and class actions, but it says something about the weakness of the regulatory structure that we have to find mechanisms for consumers to hold product providers to account. Where is the FSA or the Financial Ombudsman Service failing, if we need to give consumers those powers? We need to examine some of the fundamental failures in consumer regulation if we are to get this right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para17"><a name="09120112000026">The Bill fails to address the weaknesses in the regulatory structure and demonstrates the Government's failure to undertake the fundamental reform of financial regulation that we so desperately need. It is a long list of measures that are, in part, cosmetic; it is a restatement of what is already happening, rather than reform to address the structural failures entrenched in the reforms of 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para18"><a name="09120112000027">A number of Conservative Members have asked whether the Bill is about cosmetic change or about change to the architecture, and whether it is substantial or merely a rebranding. Parts of the Bill remind me of one of those TV makeover shows: people come in and there is a blaze of activity for a short time-new paint is put on the walls and a few new lampshades and carpets are put in-yet the reality is that we still have the leaky roof, the rocky foundations and the dodgy walls. They remain unchanged as the makeover team moves off, leaving the real problems behind for someone else to sort out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para19"><a name="09120112000028">What the people of this country need is real change, not some tacky makeover from a Government running out of steam, caught out by their own failings but lacking the courage to own up to their mistakes and scrap the system that they set up. The Bill does contain measures that we will support, but they need more   <br>

scrutiny, because they are being railroaded through the House by a Government afraid of robust scrutiny of the new powers being taken by the FSA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para20"><a name="09120112000029">These welcome measures should not obscure the fact that the Government could have used this Bill to achieve fundamental reform of the regulation of the financial services sector. It could have been used to establish clear lines of responsibility for maintaining financial stability and it could have dealt with the fundamental structural weaknesses in the system that the Prime Minister set up in 1997, but instead it has entrenched the problems of the past, ducking the questions about who should be in charge and avoiding real reforms that would have given real protection to consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para21"><a name="09120112000030">We require wholesale structural and institutional reforms with a fresh approach to regulation and supervision. The Conservatives have put forward detailed proposals that learn the right lessons from this financial crisis and would put us on a sustainable footing going forward. Instead of defending the tripartite structure, as the Government are forced to do, we would scrap the FSA and give the Bank of England enhanced powers over prudential regulation, thereby leaving nobody in doubt as to who is in charge. Instead of having a single organisation trying to tackle financial stability and protect consumers, we would create a consumer protection agency to act as a consumer champion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para22"><a name="09120112000031">What a shame that the Government will not admit their mistakes, will not own up to their failings, and instead blame everyone but themselves. It is clear that while this Government are in charge, we will not get the real reforms that this country needs; all we will see are cosmetic changes saving the face of the Prime Minister-the architect of the system that has so badly let down households and businesses across this country. It is becoming increasingly clear that the Government are incapable of learning and incapable of implementing the change that this country needs. Only a general election can bring about real and substantial reforms to the architecture of financial regulation to ensure that we give better protection to consumers, learn the lessons of the excesses of the past decade and put this country back on the right track.</p>

 The global financial crisis has led countries across the world fundamentally to review financial systems and their interaction with the broader economy. Last year and earlier this year, we ensured that the UK authorities had the power to deal with failing banks while continuing to protect consumers and taxpayers. Our economy needs well-managed, well-functioning banks and financial institutions to perform a vital set of functions, channelling investment and helping people to save and plan for the future.</p>

Through this Bill, we have an opportunity to strengthen the financial framework so that the UK not only addresses the effects of the crisis but harnesses the lessons of the past two years, ensuring that in future any crises will not only be less damaging but less likely altogether. The Government's aim is simple: to ensure that the financial system that emerges from the crisis is not only built on a stronger and sounder footing but is fairer and works for consumers.</p>

Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) stood in stark contrast with those of the shadow Chancellor. I got the impression that the shadow Chancellor had thought deeply about this and that he disagreed with us on one fundamental issue to do with the structure of regulation, but agreed with large elements of the Bill. He said so. He said that recovery and resolution plans were a good idea and he supported lots of other elements of the Bill. However, I did not hear a shred of evidence to support the idea that the fundamental wholesale reform suggested by the hon. Member for Fareham would produce any benefits for consumers and investors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para25"><a name="09120112000035">It is clear that when it comes to structure there is a fundamental disagreement between the Government and the Opposition. The Opposition have made their views on the institutional framework clear, but their suggestion that if we had handed the FSA lock, stock and barrel back to the Bank of England we would have prevented the financial crisis, or would prevent a future one, is simply misguided. Putting together responsibility for regulating not just the big banks but the small ones-the smallest building societies, individual financial advisers and the smallest credit unions-does not make strategic sense. Many different institutions and frameworks exist in different countries across the world, but no model of financial regulation has been successful in fully insulating any country from the crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para26"><a name="09120112000036">The shadow Chancellor and the hon. Member for Fareham cited a number of people who support their view. We can do the same. The simple fact is that there is no perfect supervisory architecture. My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) quoted Andrew Large, who knows a lot about these matters. The solution, to my mind, is not to rearrange the responsibilities of those with a role to play in preserving financial stability, but to ensure that all responsible parties have the right tools at their disposal to maintain financial stability and that the right framework exists to ensure effective co-ordination of the authorities' activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para27"><a name="09120112000037">We should not be talking, as the Opposition are, about shifting the deckchairs. We should be talking about strengthening the deckchairs so that they can carry the weight that we all now realise is required of them.

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="91130-0020.htm_para28"><a name="09120112000038">At this critical time, we need the authorities to focus on reducing risk, not on having to deal with the disruption and uncertainty caused by unnecessary institutional upheaval. The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) made a valid point when he warned of the dangers that significant institutional upheaval could bring. Instead, by introducing the Council for Financial Stability, we propose a change from the existing standing committee arrangements. The council will be responsible for considering emerging risks to financial stability and co-ordinating an appropriate response by the UK's authorities. Most important, it will place financial stability arrangements on a more formal, transparent and accountable basis.</p>

 I would happily give way to a Member who has sat through the debate, rather than one who turned up two minutes ago. I should like to reply to the comments that a number of hon. Members have made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="91130-0021.htm_para0"><a name="09120112000042">Recovery and resolution plans will help to ensure that no bank is too complex, too interconnected or too big to fail, thereby going a long way towards addressing the moral hazard problem that is particularly prevalent among systemically significant firms. The plans are key to ensuring that such firms can no longer rely on an implied public subsidy. In response to the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) who, among others, raised the issue: yes, it is an ambitious programme of work. We are talking about complex financial institutions, but our proposals are not unworkable and we need to make sure we get the detail right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="91130-0021.htm_para1"><a name="09120112000043">The recovery and resolution plans are only one element of the Government's comprehensive policy to deal with the systemic risk posed by firms. The policy includes tougher prudential regulation.</p>

 The Minister cited my contribution to the debate, but he glossed over my point. He said that he wants to make the plans workable but he has given no detail. A number of problems have been raised to show the risk that the proposals may be made completely inoperable by the complex nature of companies' financial structures, but he has yet again glossed over that point.</p>

 I shall be happy to go into detail with the hon. Gentleman in Committee. The shadow Chancellor said that recovery and resolution plans were a good idea. As hon. Members know, on Second Reading we debate the principle of the measure, and the principle of the plans has been welcomed on both sides of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="91130-0021.htm_para2"><a name="09120112000048">The third crucial element of the Bill is remuneration. The Bill relates to improved corporate governance, which goes hand in hand with a strengthened regulatory framework. There is general consensus that remuneration practices in the financial services sector were a contributory factor in the recent financial crisis. That is why we are taking decisive action to tackle remuneration practices that incentivise excessive risk taking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="91130-0021.htm_para3"><a name="09120112000049">There are proposals in the Bill to enhance control of the system of rewards on one hand and transparency  of disclosure on the other. We are strengthening the FSA's hand as a regulator to take action against remuneration policies that encourage excessive risk taking, and ensuring greater accountability of the FSA to  the Government in that area. The hon. Member for Twickenham asked whether we actually needed such legislation and suggested that the FSA could already take action. No, it cannot. We are imposing a duty on the FSA to make rules requiring some authorised persons to have a remuneration policy and to implement it, and to ensure that remuneration policies are consistent with the effective management of risk and the Financial Stability Board international implementation standards as agreed by the G20 leaders at Pittsburgh. It is fundamentally important that we do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="91130-0021.htm_para4"><a name="09120112000050">The shadow Chancellor and others asked about the power that we have proposed in that area and about concerns expressed by Lord Woolf. The power that we are proposing is not a power to interfere with existing contracts-the FSA is not being given retrospective powers. As a public authority, its actions are required to be compatible with the rights in the European convention on human rights, which are protected by the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="91130-0021.htm_para5"><a name="09120112000051">In addition to what we are doing to strengthen the FSA's hand, we are, where appropriate, taking action to implement in full Sir David Walker's recommendations on disclosure and transparency. The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) raised points about remuneration, and, happily, I am sure that we will discuss them further in Committee. Through our proposals on disclosure, we are trying to support shareholders' ability to exercise effective oversight of the remuneration paid in the companies in which they invest. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor said, the first line of defence is well-managed companies, with directors taking responsible decisions about risk, effectively overseen by active shareholders. Through the Bill, the Government will have a power to make regulations to implement the Walker recommendations, which will naturally be subject to full consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="91130-0021.htm_para6"><a name="09120112000052">The fourth crucial element of the Bill is the measures designed to support and protect consumers. My hon. Friends the Members for Halton (Derek Twigg), for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) and for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) made specific reference to the consumer financial education body and the powers on collective redress. Hon. Friends who serve on the Select Committee that deals with the issue made broader comments, which we will happily debate in Committee. It is important that the FSA can establish a new consumer financial education body to provide strategic leadership and increase the profile of the financial education and capability agenda. It is also important to recognise that the recession has had the greatest impact on those who are most vulnerable in our society. We are committed to improving access to financial guidance and education to address these issues. <i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

 Order. I am sorry to interrupt the Minister. There is a rising tide of sedentary conversation, which is now starting to obtrude.</p>

<p><a name="st_o351"><a name="09120112000054"><a name="91130-0021.htm_spnew6"><a name="09120112000632"><b>Ian Pearson:</b>
 As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced, we also propose to introduce a representative body to bring action through the courts on behalf of groups of consumers. There have been representations from bodies that have concerns about what is being proposed. The proposals have been extensively consulted on. They are appropriate, and it is right that individuals have the power to band together to take class actions in the courts through a representative body. That power has limitations, which we have consulted on, and those are appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="91130-0021.htm_para7"><a name="09120112000055">The Bill will ensure that prudential regulation and supervision of firms are more effective. It will place greater emphasis on monitoring and managing system-wide risks, including by legislating for the new Council for Financial Stability. It will ensure that banking remuneration is more appropriate and, above all, more transparent.  <br>

 A national treasure, a thriving 4,500 mile linear national park, a catalyst for regeneration and economic growth, a nature reserve accessible to millions of people and belonging to us all -these are just a few of the descriptions given to our canals and waterways travelling through 250 parliamentary constituencies and past 19 million people every day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="91130-0022.htm_para13"><a name="09120112000522">When our navigable canal and river network began to develop in the form we know it today, Napoleon and Josephine were about to be divorced, Charles Darwin and Abraham Lincoln were new-borns, the vacuum, the phone and the car were yet to be invented, and the idea that working men-or any woman-might vote was unthinkable. A lot has changed in 200 years, and the canals and rivers that played a great part in the development of our industrial success are still with us. If they are going to be able to contribute to our next 200 years, they are in great need of development, maintenance and support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="91130-0022.htm_para14"><a name="09120112000523">The last decade or so has seen a widely acknowledged renaissance of our waterways and canals, especially as the agents of regeneration of many city centres-such as Gas Street basin in Birmingham-and of rural areas, offering some of the greenest recreational facilities available in the UK. Since 1999, this Government have invested an unprecedented £750 million in the network, ensuring-alongside the work of an army of volunteers-that it is in a much better state now than at any time since world war two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="91130-0022.htm_para15"><a name="09120112000524">As we are becoming more aware of the challenge of climate change, we are also seeing the potential of our waterways to alleviate flooding, to provide sanctuary for wildlife and alternative modes of transport, and even to generate clean energy. The most recent figures for visitors to our waterways, from 2008, show that some 3.4 million visits were made, and that the number of boaters on the network was the highest in modern times at 32,500. Of course, many businesses depend on the efficiency and maintenance of our waterways. The British Marine Foundation estimates that some 40 per cent. of its member companies have a direct business interest, including hire fleet companies, marina operators and narrow boat builders, all of which, of course, provide many jobs. Imagine, then, the confusion, fear and anger of so many people when they heard that this fantastic network is threatened once again with break-up, destruction and possible sell-off. Such feelings were so strong that within days, a petition of 9,000 names appeared on the Downing street website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="91130-0022.htm_para16"><a name="09120112000525">Many of us thought that the battle for our waterways and the argument for their remaining in the public sector had already been won in 2007-the last time the Treasury turned its hungry eyes our way, especially to the British Waterways property portfolio, the sale of which has been estimated to be worth around £16 billion. It was viewed then not only as a welcome answer to Treasury shortfalls, but as a way of making good the gap in funding from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in making payments to farmers via the Rural Payments Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="91130-0022.htm_para17"><a name="09120112000526">In answer to this onslaught, a massive coalition of waterways users, businesses and parliamentarians was formed. After some battles, the threat receded, although not without some loss of grant, but at least the argument was won and the waterways were relatively safe once again within the public sector. However, in the wake of the global downturn we find ourselves once more on the defensive, and once more in the sights of those ever-hungry Treasury eyes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="91130-0022.htm_para18"><a name="09120112000527">British Waterways is facing a cut in funding of some £10 million in the next financial year, reducing the available grant to £47.8 million. Government funding from DEFRA for England and Wales has been confirmed for the year 2010-11. The base level of grant will be  cut from £57 million to £52.8 million, with £5 million already brought forward to 2008-09 as part of the Government's fiscal stimulus plan. This points to an effective year-on-year reduction of £4.6 million plus  £5 million, equating to a cut of £9.6 million. The Inland Waterways Association has said that British Waterways' existing grant already fails to address an ongoing deficit of between £20 million and £30 million each year in the amount needed just to maintain the system in a steady state of repair. Any cuts will only exacerbate the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="91130-0022.htm_para19"><a name="09120112000528">On top of that grant cut, the prospect of the rumoured sell-off of the British Waterways property portfolio has been a bitter blow to confidence. It is difficult to see the economic sense in such a move, as the portfolio provides BW with about £45 million in revenue, which equates to more than a third of the money that it needs to run the waterways properly and almost half the maintenance budget.</p>

<p><a name="st_o357"><a name="09120112000529"><a name="91130-0022.htm_spnew5"><a name="09120112001070"><b>Charlotte Atkins (Staffordshire, Moorlands) (Lab):</b>
 My hon. Friend will know of the serious breach of the Leek arm of the Caldon canal recently. Does she share my concern that if the property portfolio of British Waterways is taken away by the Government, on top of the cuts in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs grant, beautiful canals such as the Caldon will be returned to the dereliction from which they came in the early '70s?</p>

<p><a name="st_o358"><a name="09120112000530"><a name="91130-0022.htm_spnew6"><a name="09120112001071"><b>Lynda Waltho:</b>
 Indeed. I am well aware of the situation on the Caldon, which applies to many canals across the country. Should the maintenance decline, there will inevitably be safety problems and closures, so the situation is awkward across the country. It does not take a mathematician to predict that such a move would be disastrous to British Waterways' finances. It could only lead to waterways falling into dereliction and safety being compromised, and there would inevitably be closures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="91130-0022.htm_para20"><a name="09120112000531">Many of us who are involved with the waterways see the move to sell the portfolio as a desperate measure, because as recently as April the operational efficiency review gave British Waterways a clean bill of health. It recognised that it had achieved significant growth in its canal-side portfolio, and there was no suggestion at all that it should be sold off. The only reason why Treasury officials returned to the matter like a dog to its favourite lamp post can be the plight of the public finances, yet the proceeds from the sale would make an insignificant contribution to reducing the national debt.</p>

and the sell-off of the property portfolio-would leave it in an impossible position and make a huge 200-year asset into a liability? Would she, like me, not be surprised if British Waterways were to say to the Government, "We cannot afford to maintain this. This is your problem"? The call upon the taxpayer would then be potentially quite large, and it would far outweigh any money that the Government, the Treasury or DEFRA would save or make from the sell-off.</p>

 Absolutely. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend that it would represent a very short-term gain and a very long-term loss and problem for our waterways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="91130-0022.htm_para21"><a name="09120112000534">Against the possible contribution to paying off the national debt, we must balance the potential losses of such a move, which would be devastating. Lost to us all would be all the public benefits that the Government have hitherto recognised, such as urban and rural regeneration, health and social developments and an expanding leisure facility. We would also lose the  £750 million of taxpayers' money invested over the past 10 years, effectively cashing in our public asset-it is the equivalent of selling off a national park.</p>

 On that point, does my hon. Friend agree that the Government can be very proud of the regeneration of the waterways and the investment that they have made in them since 1997? That is particularly characterised by the publication of "Waterways for Tomorrow". Does she agree that the understanding of the matter, which is probably shared by DEFRA Ministers, needs also to be shared by Treasury Ministers?</p>

 Absolutely. I am immensely proud of what the Government have done for investment in waterways. Indeed, the volunteers and the people who keep things going in my constituency and on the canals in the black country are aware of what the Government have done. The cut would represent a sell-off of not only the asset but of those volunteers' input and confidence. Furthermore, it represents effectively selling off a national treasure. That is what really hurts people.</p>

 As a former Minister with responsibility for waterways, I want to ask whether my hon. Friend agrees that Ministers are too wise to make such a mistake. There is a third way: to put the assets and liabilities into a mutual public interest model, to the benefit of the Government, the public, the users, the economy and the environment. Is not that the right way forward?</p>

 There is a further point to make. The effort and work of many of the volunteers has created the value of the assets.

 My hon. Friend is making an excellent speech. Does she also accept that another group of people feels let down? I have tenants in my constituency who live in BW property.

Hitherto, that aim was supported by the Government, but it will become unachievable and the system will be almost entirely dependent on the taxpayer. British Waterways will lose its autonomy and ability to prioritise investment. It is this point that I wish to develop because it is the area in which we have most to lose and most to gain.</p>

British Waterways has consulted widely on its form and direction, aiming to respond in December and to feed into DEFRA's "Waterways for Tomorrow" paper, which details the Government's policy for the future of our waterways. To allow any sell-off at this stage would scupper any prospect of a sustainable or indeed any meaningful future at all. It is therefore imperative that the Government give great attention to this plan or we risk selling off our heritage and mortgaging the future of our waterways.</p>

that an additional £400,000 is being made available to British Waterways this year from the aggregates levy sustainability fund. Those resources will be used to modernise and automate the Lees and Old Mill locks on the River Lea, thus enabling the waterway to become an economically viable transport route, as well as a recreational route, for moving the large volume of aggregates that will be used during the fit-out period of the Olympic park transformation and the Olympic legacy phases.</p>

 I understand how the River Lea will benefit, but does my hon. Friend agree that there is a danger that everything will be about London and the Olympics? Some of us represent areas with canals such as the Leeds and Liverpool canal, which runs through my constituency. I hope that he will ensure that we also get investment, as and when we need it in future.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a valid point. We want to see investment spread throughout all parts of England and Wales. However, I am sure that he would agree that, where we have such a significant opportunity to prove how vital the arteries of the waterways network are for transport as well as recreation, the investment that this Labour Government put in should be shown in a modern idiom such as the Olympic games. What we can see, from the investment at Prescott locks and in the Lea waterway stretch and so on, shows that we see the waterways as having a modern, vibrant and working future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="91130-0023.htm_para6"><a name="09120112000560">I do not think that any hon. Member here this evening will doubt that we have seen a quite remarkable improvement in the waterways over the past 10 years, a period in which this Labour Government have invested significantly in the waterways, with some £800 million provided to British Waterways alone. It is worth emphasising that point, because it is not the only investment, but simply the investment in British Waterways. That investment, together with, as has been pointed out, the considerable efforts of waterway enthusiasts, who work so hard to restore and recreate our inland waterway network, has resulted in the waterways being in a better state now than they have been since the second world war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="91130-0023.htm_para7"><a name="09120112000561">That is no small tribute to the constant urging and gentle pressure of the many hon. Members who have lobbied incessantly on behalf of the waterways network. Many of them are here this evening. I know that some hon. Members in the Chamber will have heard about the waterways renaissance many times, including from my lips, but it is important to recognise the priority that this Government have given, over a considerable period, to maintaining and enhancing our inland waterways, so that they can be enjoyed as they are today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="91130-0023.htm_para8"><a name="09120112000562">I recognise that the level of future Government support for the waterways is a concern, particularly in the face of the current severe pressure on public finances, which we cannot ignore and which will remain for a number of years to come. It is therefore even more important that the waterways can demonstrate what they are delivering for our continued investment and why they should remain a priority. We are already working with our delivery partners, including British Waterways, to address those points. For example, we are gathering further evidence about the wide range of public benefits that  <br>

the waterways already provide, in order better to identify all those who benefit and to be able to quantify this benefit in monetary terms. As just one example, British Waterways estimates that its waterways alone deliver benefits of some £500 million a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="91130-0023.htm_para9"><a name="09120112000563">Let me turn briefly to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge raised about the cut of £9.6 million and why it is not a cut of £9.6 million-this is not a conjurer's trick, but I will explain why it is not. DEFRA's grant in aid to British Waterways in 2010-11 is £52.8 million, which includes an additional £5 million that has been brought forward. The difference between that figure and the figure for 2009-10 is £4.6 million, which I acknowledge. That £4.6 million reduction in grant in aid has been necessary as part of the need to identify savings right across government-we are not immune from that-reflecting the current challenging fiscal environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="91130-0023.htm_para10"><a name="09120112000564">The Government recognise that the waterways are a tremendous asset, and we remain committed to maintaining them. We will continue to ensure that they are given due consideration in future discussions about the allocation of resources. Without the £5 million that was brought forward, British Waterways would not have been able to carry out some of the major works projects in this year's works programme. However, in addition, British Waterways has planned £10 million in efficiency savings, which will also go some way towards reducing the gap in funding from 2011-12. However, we all know that we are indeed entering a very difficult period and we must look at ways in which the waterways can be supported so they can continue to deliver on their very real potential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="91130-0023.htm_para11"><a name="09120112000565">There is no easy way to close the gap between what we would like to spend on the waterways and the funding available for maintaining them from both the central Government and from commercial and other user sources. The next few years, let us make no bones about it, will be tough-they will be tough right across government-but that is why it is so important to raise awareness of what the waterways offer so that they gain wider support for delivering local and regional objectives and so that they can participate in third and private-sector initiatives to mutual benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="91130-0023.htm_para12"><a name="09120112000566">I therefore plan to launch a consultation on the Government's new strategy for the inland waterways for England and Wales, called "Waterways for Everyone", before the Christmas recess. This will set out what the waterways deliver now and how we believe this might be built on to help us retain a vibrant and sustainable network into the future.</p>
