 I thank my right hon. Friend for that very positive response. Does he recall the private Member&#146;s Bill that I introduced in October 2005, entitled the Age of Sale of Tobacco Bill, in which I proposed to raise the age for smoking from 16 to 18? That proposal was later incorporated into the Health Bill, I am glad to say. Is he also aware that, in Barnsley, one third of all smokers under 18 buy their cigarettes illegally from what are known&#151;for want of a better expression&#151;as the local fag houses? The problem is so acute that Barnsley council has set up a tobacco task group to look at the issue. What more can the Government do to stop the illegal sale of tobacco to young people?</p>

 I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for his sterling work over a long period of time to get the age of sale increased to 18. He asks what more we can do. From April next year, the &#147;three strikes and you&#146;re out&#148; rule will come in. If any retailer is caught selling cigarettes to under-age children three times, they will not be allowed to continue retailing. Other measures to tackle illicit tobacco are important, particularly in the context of the famous Barnsley fag houses that we are now learning about. Micro-chipping illicit cigarettes is an important development from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, for example. There is a whole range of steps that should be taken, but that should not detract from the public health initiatives that we are taking in removing tobacco from the point of sale and ensuring that we take action to regulate vending machines.</p>

 I welcome the Secretary of State&#146;s proposed legislation, which offers the prospect of real and lasting progressive change for the better. Will he tell the House what steps he is taking to enlist the services of some of our sporting icons&#151;the Olympic gold medallists spring readily to mind&#151;in trying to persuade young people of the dangers of smoking and the benefits of abstinence?</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his welcome for our proposals. He has raised an important point. We know that there is an issue about young people smoking. On average, 10 per cent. of 11 to 15-year-olds smoke, but almost one in five 15-year-old girls smoke. They take up smoking&#151;as most of us did in our youth&#151;because they see role models and people whom they admire smoking. The message from Olympians and others, which we will ensure is strongly put forward, will help in that regard. The research evidence clearly shows that the only place where tobacco can now be advertised is on point-of-sale displays and that that gives young people the impression that smoking is normal. That is what we are seeking to address with these proposals.</p>

 Regardless of the merits or otherwise of the proposals, does my right hon. Friend accept that carrying out the proposed work will involve costs to small shopkeepers? Does he have an assessment of those costs, and does he have any plans to compensate retailers for them?</p>

 I accept that there are issues for small retailers, and of course there will be a cost. The Save Our Shop campaign is the brainchild of the Tobacco Retailers Association, which is an offshoot of the Tobacco Manufacturers Association, which represents Imperial Tobacco, Gallahers and others in the smoking industry. The campaign is estimating the cost at something like&#151;</p>

 This might be totally irrelevant to the question that my hon. Friend asked, but the campaign has put the cost at something like &#163;6,000. There is no evidence whatever for that. The evidence from the countries that have introduced these measures is that there is a maximum cost of &#163;1,000. In Canada, it was &#163;500. The cost of putting up the displays is met by the tobacco manufacturers&#151;by the cigarette companies themselves. We will of course offer assistance to small businesses. That is why we are saying that this measure will not be introduced for small shops until 2013. That will give us plenty of time to have a full consultation and to ensure that this will not damage those businesses.</p>

 I also welcome the steps taken by the Government further to reduce the damage done by smoking-related diseases, but will the Secretary of State reflect on his decision not to make progress with one proposition that achieved 98 per cent. support in the consultation exercise&#151;namely, the proposition that tobacco products should be sold in plain packaging? That seems to have been parked for the time being by the Government. Will the Secretary of State confirm that he is not ruling out considering that matter and that there remains a strong possibility of introducing it at some point?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman has welcomed&#151;indeed, two Opposition Members have welcomed&#151;the proposals, unlike the Conservative Front-Bench team. I heard the argument from the Conservative Front Bench in last week&#146;s Queen&#146;s Speech debate that there was no evidence base for the proposals. I have to say, however, that despite the fact that the right hon. Gentleman is quite right about the huge response in favour of plain packaging, there is no evidence base that it actually reduces the number of young children smoking. We want to keep that under review, and when there is an evidence base for it, it could well be another important measure to meet our goal, which is to reduce the number of young people smoking.</p>

 As the chairman of the all-party group on smoking and health, I warmly welcome the proposals. There will not be evidence on plain packaging now, as we are the first country to suggest the measure, so it needs to be piloted in some way. May I say to the Secretary of State that I was disappointed in one aspect of the announcement&#151;the failure to abolish vending machines, which are used as the medium of sale for fewer than 1 per cent. of all cigarettes? The suggestion that we can somehow tighten up to minimise the number of young people buying from vending machines is likely to prove a dead end. The sooner we introduce the abolition, the better.</p>

 I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s argument. We will take a power in the proposed Bill to ban vending machines. We were persuaded during the consultation, however, that there are other measures to restrict young people&#146;s access to vending machines without banning them. I do not think that Governments should move to banning things if there is another alternative. We were persuaded of the alternatives such as carrying out an age check before giving tokens to use in vending machines and other methods that have been used successfully to restrict access by young people. It is sane and rational to try those out first, to have the power to ban in the legislation if necessary and to move towards a ban if the other measures do not work.</p>

of emergency care? The Government have been signalling for some time that the rate of growth of cash available to the health services is going to slow down. In the pre-Budget report, the Chancellor made it clear that spending cuts were intrinsic to the Government&#146;s plans. Against that background, is it not important to begin to manage expectations about the structure of emergency care that is likely to be delivered by the health service in the years ahead?</p>

Of course, last week we announced annual increases of 5.5 per cent. and 5.5 per cent. for PCTs in each of the next two years.

 The Secretary of State will know that the NHS Information Centre provided to 10 Downing street information from hospitals about people presenting with knife wounds&#151;data that were unpublished, not yet validated and incomplete.

Can the Secretary of State tell the House whether he knew about 10 Downing street&#146;s intention to use those data and, whether he did or not, what steps he personally is taking to make sure that NHS data are not used for partisan purposes in that way?</p>

 Figures given to me by the Minister in a written answer show that alcohol-related finished admissions to hospital in Bexley have increased by more than 70 per cent. since 2002.

 On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s final point, I understand that the independent reconfiguration panel is considering the matter. On alcohol issues, the hon. Gentleman makes a serious point. The number of admissions as a result of alcohol is increasing. If one looks at the reduction in premature deaths from heart disease, cancer and cardiovascular disease against the increasing trend in diseases caused by too much alcohol, one realises there is a very real public message to get across. That is one of the reasons why, the week before last, the Home Secretary announced that she was taking measures to ban the promotions that lead to a large consumption of alcohol in a very short time such as &#147;women drink free&#148; and happy hours on which there will be restrictions. We need to look much more closely at how we introduce other public health messages so that people are aware that consuming too much alcohol is a real and dangerous health risk.</p>

 I wish to repeat a statement made a little earlier by my noble Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform about the Royal Mail. The Government are firmly committed to a universal postal service&#151;that is, the ability of the 28 million homes and businesses across the country to receive mail six days a week with the promise that one price goes everywhere. The universal service helps to bind us together as a country. As well as having social importance, it is the means by which many companies build and operate their businesses. However, it does not come free.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08121646000159">Last December, my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton), the then Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, invited Richard Hooper to lead a full independent review of the postal services market. Its purpose was to look ahead to the future and recommend the steps needed to sustain the universal service in a world where technology, consumer behaviour and the communications market are all rapidly changing. The review did not cover the post office network. We have now received Richard Hooper&#146;s final report. It is a serious, wide-ranging study and makes sober reading. We are publishing it this afternoon, and I am grateful to Richard Hooper, Dame Deidre Hutton and Ian Smith for their work on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08121646000160">Let me set out Hooper&#146;s analysis of the challenges facing the Royal Mail. First, there has been a revolution in communications technology in the past decade as consumers have turned to e-mail, the internet and text messages. In this country, 60 billion text messages were sent last year, and we now send 5 million fewer letters per day than two years ago. Hooper is absolutely clear that the main challenge to the Royal Mail comes from the impact of changes in technology and consumer choices. His estimate is that last year the shift from mail to those new technologies cost the company &#163;500 million in lost profits&#151;that is five times the impact of business lost to other postal companies in our liberalised market. The message is therefore clear: making those other companies go away is not the answer to make the Royal Mail succeed. Royal Mail&#146;s success matters because it is the only company capable of delivering mail to every address in the UK, six days a week. As Hooper makes clear, that will be the case for the foreseeable future, so a healthy Royal Mail is vital to sustaining the universal service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08121646000161">The second challenge that Hooper describes is that of efficiency. Hooper reports that Royal Mail is less automated and less efficient than its western European counterparts. In modern European postal companies, 85 per cent. of mail is put in walk order by machine for delivery to the individual home or business. By contrast, in British local delivery offices, that is still done entirely by hand. The Royal Mail urgently needs to catch up and modernise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08121646000162">The third challenge is the pension fund. Hooper warns that Royal Mail has a large, growing and volatile pension fund deficit. That is near impossible for the business to manage, and it is a huge demand on its revenues. Each year, on top of its regular &#163;500 million  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="16 Dec 2008">

<notus-date day="16" month="12" year="2008" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>16 Dec 2008 : Column 965</b><br>
contribution to the pension fund, the company is having to find an extra top-up of &#163;280 million to plug the deficit. These payments look set to rise substantially when the fund is re-valued next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08121646000163">Fourthly, Hooper says that labour relations in the company need to improve. We know that levels of trust and co-operation are low and that industrial action takes place too often, and a fresh start in industrial relations is badly needed. Fifthly, there is regulation. Hooper reports a lack of trust in the relationship between the company and the regulator. There are disagreements about even basic information and those tensions divert energy from the chief challenge of modernising the business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08121646000164">Overall, Hooper&#146;s conclusions are crystal clear: the status quo is untenable, the universal service is under threat, and we face the choice of either downgrading the universal service as we manage decline, or acting now to turn things around and secure Royal Mail&#146;s future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08121646000165">At the heart of the Hooper report are three linked recommendations. First, Hooper recognises that the pension fund deficit represents a significant challenge for the company. The report recommends that as part of a package of changes, the Government should take over responsibility for substantially reducing the pension deficit. I stress that Hooper says that that would be justified only as part of a coherent package to secure Royal Mail&#146;s long-term viability. Secondly&#151;and closely related to that&#151;to improve its performance, Royal Mail should forge a strategic minority partnership with a postal operator with a proven record in transforming its business, working closely with the work force. Hooper believes that that would give Royal Mail the confidence, the experience and the capital to make the changes needed to improve performance and to face the future&#151;in other words, save the Royal Mail by investing in its future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08121646000166">Finally, on regulation, Hooper proposes that Ofcom should take over responsibility from Postcomm for regulating the postal market. Its primary responsibility would be to maintain the universal service in the wider context of other changes taking place in the communication markets. My Department will study the report in detail and we intend to respond with a full statement of policy in the early part of next year. With backing from the Government, Royal Mail has been improving performance in recent years, but progress has been too slow, and Hooper makes it clear that, in the face of the challenges confronting the company, transformation must be faster and more far reaching.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08121646000167">The Government agree with Hooper&#146;s analysis and recommendations. As he does, we reject cutting back the universal service; indeed, we share his ambition for a strong universal service and a strong Royal Mail. We intend to take forward the recommendations as a coherent package of measures. We will fulfil our manifesto commitment to</p>
<a name="81216-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08121646000424"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a publicly owned Royal Mail fully restored to good health, providing customers with an excellent service and its employees with rewarding employment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08121646000168">Bringing in a partner through a minority stake in Royal Mail&#146;s postal business will help us to deliver that goal. It will bring Royal Mail fresh investment and new  <br>

opportunities to grow in Europe, and enable it to offer new services. It will provide a fresh new impetus to modernising the Royal Mail and to securing the universal service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08121646000169">We and the Royal Mail have already received one expression of interest from the Dutch postal company, TNT, to build such a partnership. I very much welcome that approach from an experienced postal company, just as I will welcome other expressions of interest from credible partners should they come forward. My Department will pursue that in the coming weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para15"><a name="08121646000170">Finally, I should comment on the Post Office, which was not part of the review&#146;s terms of reference. The network of local post offices combines a unique set of commercial, public and social roles. In recognition of that, a partnership would not include the post office network. However, a healthier Royal Mail letters business will be good for the Post Office, and today&#146;s announcement will help underpin our existing commitment to the post office network. We are providing &#163;1.7 billion until 2011 to support a network of around 11,500 branches. We will continue to support the non-commercial network beyond that time. The House will recall the recent announcement that the Post Office card account will stay with the Post Office. We will now build on that decision, to ensure a stable and sustainable network for the future. We are determined to have a post office network offering a broad range of services throughout the country, supporting both social and financial inclusion. I am delighted that the Select Committee on Business and Enterprise has agreed to undertake an inquiry into what further services the Post Office could offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para16"><a name="08121646000171">I believe that Royal Mail and the postal market can thrive in the future, provided that decisive action is taken now. Without far-reaching change, the opportunities brought about by technology will become overwhelming threats. That need not be the case. I believe that there are benefits for everybody in the package of measures that we intend to take forward. It will protect the universal service for consumers and give Royal Mail new opportunities to modernise and develop; it offers Royal Mail&#146;s staff a future in a modern, efficient postal operator, with more secure pension arrangements; and it offers the whole country a Royal Mail that we can be proud of. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o102"><a name="08121646000172"><a name="81216-0004.htm_spnew5"><a name="08121646000588"><b>Alan Duncan (Rutland and Melton) (Con):</b>
 May I thank the Minister for sight of his statement?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para17"><a name="08121646000173">We welcome Richard Hooper&#146;s report, which confirms what everyone has known for a long time. Royal Mail&#146;s working practices are inefficient, competition is intensifying, industrial relations are poor and sorting machinery is outdated. The fixed price of a stamp and Royal Mail&#146;s huge pension deficit seriously limit its room for manoeuvre. All that has been clear for a decade, but the Government have done little to curtail a precipitous decline in Royal Mail&#146;s fortunes. Today we learn that the Government are trying to strike a deal to see them through the next election. They are trying to look like the saviour of Royal Mail, but are doing so in flagrant breach of their election manifesto and by raiding the pension fund to bail out Government borrowing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para18"><a name="08121646000174">Even though the Minister&#146;s own party does not seem prepared to do so, we on the Conservative Benches broadly welcome his intention to introduce a new commercial partner. It is a step in the right direction,  <br>

but the details remain unclear. Will the Minister confirm the status and details of the plans? What will private partners be offered in exchange for their investment? Will he demand a commitment from them to invest in new sorting technology? Can he confirm whether the opportunity to buy a stake in Royal Mail will be put out for competitive tender? By what commercial method might he sell a stake, believed to be about 30 per cent., and can he guarantee that all the revenues from any sale will go directly to Royal Mail and not to the Government?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para19"><a name="08121646000175">The Government have had more than 10 years to deal with the problems that Hooper identifies, but they have completely failed to do so. In his first attempt as Business Secretary, Lord Mandelson said that the Government&#146;s policies would</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para21"><a name="08121646000177">Since then, almost 40 per cent. of all post offices have closed. Rather than creating innovative solutions to the problems facing the business, the Government have concentrated on managing its decline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para22"><a name="08121646000178">During those 10 years, the Government could have cut costs, done deals, forged partnerships or even, as they are now doing, part-privatised the business. However, until now, they have done none of these things. They have not driven through efficiencies in Royal Mail management; they have not invested in new technology; and they have not dealt conclusively with the pensions deficit. So just as the Government have wasted 10 years mismanaging the country, they have also wasted 10 years mismanaging Royal Mail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para23"><a name="08121646000179">Now, disguised in today&#146;s statement, is the truth. The Government intend to raid the pension fund in order to plug the black hole in the public finances, dumping the cost of a multi-billion pound liability on future generations. The seizure of &#163;22 billion from Royal Mail&#146;s pension fund would make the Government&#146;s woeful borrowing figures look a little better, but it would saddle future generations with an almost open-ended bill. The whole process has been engineered to make a quick buck for the Prime Minister, kill the issue until after the next election and pass the biggest financial problem not only to the next Government, but probably to those who follow them. In order to asset-strip, the Government have decided that if there is not quite enough in the pot, they might as well swipe the whole pot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para24"><a name="08121646000180">Can the Minister tell us what he estimates the long-term annual pensions liability to the taxpayer to be? Will Royal Mail&#146;s pensions liability be included in the Government&#146;s borrowing figures? What exactly will happen to the &#163;22 billion that is currently in the pension fund? Will the Minister keep the fund intact and top it up, or not? Has he been assured that such action would comply with European Union state aid rules?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para25"><a name="08121646000181">The other issue is the unions. Royal Mail workers are already planning strikes. What does the Minister expect will be their reaction to today&#146;s proposals? We believe that any restructured ownership package must include the full involvement and incentivisation of the staff. What will the pension terms and conditions be for future joiners and for agency workers? Thousands of  <br>

post offices have already closed; large-scale sorting office closures would be a further blow. What is the Minister&#146;s estimate of future job losses, and what is his assessment of the effect of a reconstituted Royal Mail on the income of post office branches?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para26"><a name="08121646000182">Proposals for the serious reform of Royal Mail are welcome. Private capital to fund improvements in its services is welcome. We welcome, too, Mr. Hooper&#146;s focus on preserving the universal service obligation, and the proposed amalgamation of Postcomm and Ofcom into a sensible, tidied-up single structure. But after a decade of missed opportunities, the Government&#146;s last-ditch attempt to dangle the prospect of part-privatisation must not distract us from the real story: a bit of Enron accounting that will impose a huge bill on every family in the country for generations to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para27"><a name="08121646000183">The Government are taking the funds that would have paid most of the pensions, and placing a new obligation on future generations to pay the bills that those funds would have covered. Yet again, the Government are stealing everyone&#146;s tomorrow for their today. For future generations, the bill is in the post&#151;and it has the Prime Minister&#146;s stamp all over it.</p>

 As ever, the hyperbole of the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) disguises the lack of any credible policy in his party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para28"><a name="08121646000185">The hon. Gentleman implied that nothing had been done about Royal Mail for the last 10 years. I remind the House that, in 2007, the Government made available &#163;850 million in reserves on the balance sheet to support the pension fund, that they made available loan finance to help Royal Mail to modernise, and that, back in 2001, they made available &#163;500 million in loans to purchase the companies comprising GLS, which is Royal Mail&#146;s European logistics and parcels arm. Action has been taken and change has happened, but, as Hooper reports, that change has been too slow to meet the challenges confronted by the company in the face of changes in consumer habits and the burden presented by the pension fund deficit. I did not follow the hon. Gentleman&#146;s logic in that regard. The pension fund does have assets, but it also has liabilities. The problem is that the liabilities are greater than the assets, and that represents a significant burden for the company when it comes to meeting the costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="81216-0004.htm_para29"><a name="08121646000186">The hon. Gentleman asked about figures. As I said in my statement, last year the company had to find an extra &#163;280 million&#151;on top of the normal &#163;500 million contribution to the pension fund&#151;because of the pension fund deficit. To help the company to deal with the deficit, we released funds that could be spent on modernisation and meeting the challenges.</p>

 Is the Minister aware that, in the real world, over the past nine months, the idea of privatisation and the halcyon days of 10 to 15 years ago have now disappeared? This Government have had to take steps to bail out some of the privatised companies so that they can carry on. The energy companies that were privatised are now ripping off the consumer, and the banking fraternity has had to be bailed out by the Government. Is it not strange to be talking about privatisation these days, when it has patently failed in so many areas? May I suggest that my right hon. Friend has a word with the Secretary of State and with this Mr. Hooper, whoever he is, and points out to them that things have changed in the past nine months?

It will bring the confidence to carry through the decisions necessary for such change, and it will bring access to the capital needed to fund the modernisation.

However, as the statement makes clear, that objective requires a profitable Royal Mail, and that poses formidable challenges. I should like to ask the Minister some questions on these points.</p>

Secondly, can he confirm that Royal Mail will continue to operate a pension scheme in the way that it has in the past, and that it will continue to be funded out of profits, as it has been in the past?</p>

The statement, however, said that a private company would take a minority stake in the postal business. The former does not necessarily mean privatisation because it could be a joint venture into which both companies enter with no transfer of assets; the latter, however, requires a stake to be sold, which is part-privatisation, and requires a valuation.

On the arrangements for postal competitors, it seems to me&#151;I hope the Minister will accept this&#151;that there is a requirement for a level playing field, and that we should look again into how to achieve that and into whether competitors should be required to pay in any way.</p>

Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail Group both face huge challenges and the report recognises the scale of those challenges, but huge numbers of questions on the details remain to be answered. For example, what will the relationship between Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail Group be in this new world, with a part-owned subsidiary run by a current competitor of Royal Mail Group?

it would be a matter for Ofcom in the future. It is important to remind the House that Hooper concludes firmly that the key challenge facing the company is not from other postal companies, but from other technologies. That is what lies behind a drop in the volume of mail of some 5 million items a day, and that drop is not just taking place in the UK, but in many other countries for precisely the same reason.</p>

 I recognise that my right hon. Friend has made this statement, but I am not convinced by Hooper&#146;s recommendations. New technologies may have reduced letters by 5 million over two years, but the number of packages and parcels have substantially increased. Therefore, we ought to be getting into that business. Let me explain where we are really missing the point, however. It is not about selling off the silverware and looking for partners. We must charge private companies sufficiently high sums to ensure that Royal Mail makes a profit and is not subsidised by the taxpayer, because bulk mail is having a free ride at the expense of taxpayers. If we put that right, Royal Mail will begin to make a profit. Let us do it that way, not the privatisation way.</p>

 My hon. Friend is correct to point to a growth in packet volumes as a result of people ordering over the internet, but that is not enough to counteract the falling volumes of mail. Overall, mail has fallen by 5 million items a day. My hon. Friend takes us back to the issue that the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) and other Members raised by contending that the principal problem facing the company is competition from other postal companies and the terms by which that competition is conducted. Hooper concludes that that is not the case, and that the impact of that is just one fifth of the impact of the shift from mail to other technologies. Therefore, changing the regime for upstream access or headroom pricing will not deal with the Royal Mail&#146;s problems. That demands wider change and wider reform.</p>

 With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the opening up of the family courts. I have today laid before Parliament the document &#147;Family Justice in View&#148;, copies of which will be available in the Vote Office and on my Department&#146;s website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="81216-0006.htm_para3"><a name="08121646000263">Family courts play a crucial role in our society. They make far-reaching decisions&#151;for example about how to divide finance on divorce, or what protection to give victims of domestic violence&#151;and they make life-changing decisions about the future of children: whether they should be given contact with their parents, whether they should be removed into the care of the state, and whether they should be placed for adoption. The decisions of family courts have profound and long-term effects on the lives of those involved and cumulatively on society as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="81216-0006.htm_para4"><a name="08121646000264">Family cases can be conducted in the magistrates family proceedings courts, in county courts, and in the family division of the High Court. All those with responsibility for these proceedings are well trained and work to extremely high standards. It is vital that these courts, like any others, command the confidence of the public, if the public&#151;including the parties involved&#151;are to accept their decisions. That can best be achieved if justice in these courts is seen to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="81216-0006.htm_para5"><a name="08121646000265">For entirely legitimate reasons, the privacy of parties to family proceedings must be properly protected. That is of enormous importance to adults, and is an overwhelming imperative in cases involving children. At present, with some exceptions, neither the public nor the media are permitted to witness proceedings in these courts. However, many argue that the current provisions to safeguard privacy and confidentiality go too far, leaving family courts unfairly open to accusations of bias or even injustice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="81216-0006.htm_para6"><a name="08121646000266">In contrast, there is a greater degree of openness in the youth courts. For example, the media are allowed to witness and report proceedings in the youth courts, so long as they do not identify juvenile defendants, and youth courts have a wide discretion to allow others to attend. These rules have worked effectively, and both their spirit and their letter have been well respected by the media.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="81216-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08121646000267">The debate about opening up the family courts has intensified in recent years, and two successive consultations have been carried out, in 2006 and again in 2007. The results of those exercises were inconclusive, with strong representations on the one hand in favour of improving transparency, and on the other in favour of maintaining the current position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="81216-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08121646000268">In the past few months, the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice), who has responsibility for access to justice, and I have been actively considering how we can shed more light on family courts while preserving the imperative of the welfare of the child. The Government have now reached their conclusion, and I am therefore announcing today that the rules of court will be changed to allow the media to attend family proceedings in all tiers of court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="81216-0006.htm_para9"><a name="08121646000269">Understandably, the media will be subject to reporting restrictions similar to those that apply in the youth courts. The courts will be able to relax or increase those restrictions in appropriate cases, and will have the power to exclude the media from specific proceedings altogether where the welfare of the child or the safety of the parties or witnesses requires it. The overall effect of these changes will be fundamentally to increase the openness of family courts, while protecting the privacy of children and vulnerable adults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="81216-0006.htm_para10"><a name="08121646000270">As well as allowing the media to attend family proceedings, there is a need to increase the amount and quality of information coming from the courts. At present, anonymised judgments of the Court of Appeal, and in some instances of the High Court, are made public, but that is not the situation for the county courts or the family proceedings courts, which deal with the bulk of family law cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="81216-0006.htm_para11"><a name="08121646000271">We have therefore decided to pilot the provision of written judgments when a final order is made in certain family cases. The courts in the pilot areas&#151;Leeds, Wolverhampton and Cardiff&#151;will, for the first time, routinely produce a written record of the decision for the parties involved. In selected cases, where the court is making life-changing decisions for a child, it will publish an anonymised judgment online, so that it can be read by the wider public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="81216-0006.htm_para12"><a name="08121646000272">The consequences of family proceedings are so significant that the parties involved will sometimes need to seek advice or support from a range of people, including legal advisers, family members, medical practitioners and Members of Parliament or other elected representatives. To do so, they must be able to discuss and share information about their case. In 2005, we made changes to the rules of court to allow people to disclose certain information to specified individuals, but after two years it became clear that those rules remained unnecessarily restrictive and too complicated. Following a consultation last year, the Government have now decided to relax the rules on the disclosure of information in family proceedings.</p>

In more cases, the person receiving the information will be able to disclose it to others, for the purposes for which it was originally disclosed to them, without seeking the permission of the court. To protect the anonymity of children after proceedings have concluded, the decision of the Court of Appeal in Clayton <i> v</i>. Clayton will be reversed. In principle, that decision removed the protection of the court once proceedings had been completed, although that protection could be reapplied in particular cases.</p>

When the Government last proposed transparency in 2006, they recognised, in the regulatory impact assessment, that both they and the courts would face increased costs, including for additional security. Have the Government estimated these costs? At a time when the courts&#146; budget is being cut, how will those costs be absorbed?

view of the media. I take his point that there is a clear distinction between a child&#146;s best interests and the privacy, not of the child&#151;no one is arguing about that&#151;but of proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="81216-0007.htm_para12"><a name="08121646000292">We have not estimated the cost of implementing the changes because we believe the costs will be marginal.

 I, too, broadly welcome the Secretary of State&#146;s statement as a move in the right direction. There is a basic principle, as I hope he will agree, that justice should be seen to be done. Secret justice is often injustice. Privately heard witnesses who think they are less likely to be found out are more likely to be self-serving than witnesses in public, judges are more likely to go along with the cosy consensus that often develops between experts when there is no prospect of public comment on their judgments, and public authorities are more likely to act on insufficient evidence when their decisions are not subject to public scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="81216-0007.htm_para14"><a name="08121646000295">It is right that that principle should apply even in difficult cases, such as those in family proceedings. It is understandable that there will be some resistance from some professional groups, and clearly there is a balance to be struck between the public interest and the interests of individuals, especially of children, but as the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) said, I hope the Secretary of State agrees with Sir Mark Potter when he said in October that more openness would help to dispel myths about bias and inaccuracy in the family court, especially if there are enforceable rules about anonymity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="81216-0007.htm_para15"><a name="08121646000296">The Secretary of State spoke only about the media. He did not speak about access to the courts for the public. Obviously, different considerations apply, but what conclusions have the Government reached on admitting the public to some family proceedings?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="81216-0007.htm_para16"><a name="08121646000297">On the publication of judgments, I am a little disappointed that the right hon. Gentleman has not gone further than a pilot. Publication of judgments, suitably anonymised, obviously, is vital to the scrutiny of what judges do. Their judgments must be open to comment and criticism; otherwise the law itself cannot develop. There have been cases where even professional law reporters were excluded from the courts. Surely the Secretary of State agrees that that should not happen.</p>

Will parents be able to discuss their case with their MP, which was one of the examples that he gave? What will be the position on the important issue of expert witnesses and second opinions? Will parents be able freely to approach experts who might help to challenge the views of the local authority expert in their case?</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his support for the proposals. He asked me a number of specific questions. Are we proposing that members of the general public be allowed into the courts? No&#151;and to that extent, this regime is more restrictive than the one that applies in the youth courts. However, I think that that is appropriate, although we are open to representations, if necessary, on the issue. Will parents be able to discuss their cases with MPs? Yes, and in my experience they do already, although often in breach of some extraordinarily complicated and convoluted rules, which I discovered only very recently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="81216-0007.htm_para20"><a name="08121646000302">One of the issues is about the identity of expert witnesses should be able to be made public. My default setting is that they should; I believe that in cases of this kind, the expertise of such witnesses should no more be allowed to go without scrutiny than the expertise of those in other cases, in which equally life-threatening or life-changing decisions are made and expert witnesses have to justify publicly their expertise and judgments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="81216-0007.htm_para22"><a name="08121646000304">There was a huge consultation on the increase in family court fees. Local authorities had a transfer of &#163;40 million from the Ministry of Justice budget&#151;and a little more, I may say&#151;to meet the full costs of that transfer of fees. I would have preferred the transfer to have been ring-fenced to the local authorities so that they could use it only for these purposes. The local authorities are themselves root and branch opposed to ring-fencing&#151;but they have had the money. It therefore does not lie in their mouth to complain that they cannot afford the fees: they can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="81216-0007.htm_para23"><a name="08121646000305">Moreover, the fee is &#163;4,000 on average; it ranges from &#163;1,750 to &#163;4,825, and the full fee applies only at the upper end. Local authorities have to base their decisions on the interests of the child. The fee, even at &#163;4,000, is a very small proportion of the total costs of taking a case, which average &#163;25,000. It is a still smaller proportion of the costs of taking a child into care, which are &#163;40,000 on average and rise to &#163;101,000 and more if the child is taken into secure accommodation for a year.</p>

 I go slightly against the flow in saying that I am yet to be convinced by these proposals, and I will watch the pilot schemes with interest.

I must confess&#151;I have written to him about this&#151;that that has not necessarily been my experience, particularly as far as witnesses are concerned. Will he say what the situation will be with witnesses in the county court and the family court? Will the press be allowed to report their names?</p>

 No, the press would not be allowed to report witnesses&#146; names, because they are parties to the proceedings. The situation is different for expert witnesses, but with that exception, the identity of witnesses will be protected. I have yet to see the letter from the hon.

 I welcome the Secretary of State&#146;s statement. I have experience; a family came to see me who were concerned about the local authority&#146;s involvement in their ongoing case. The case ended up in the family courts and the judge made a ruling that the family should not approach me again while it was in court. In my view, that was not really about protecting the child, which must be of the utmost importance, but about protecting the professionals involved in the case, because I was dubious about their judgment.</p>

As part of the review, will the Justice Secretary ensure that such errors are not given protection and that reporting will be possible in order to highlight those errors, to ensure that they are not made and to increase the accountability of those with key roles to play in the judgments that can be made?</p>

 The delivery of this summer&#146;s national curriculum tests for 11 and 14-year-olds was a shambles. I want to say to all the teachers, pupils, parents and markers who have been affected how sorry I am for all their inconvenience, stress and frustration. What happened this year was completely unacceptable. It was because I was determined to get to the bottom of exactly what went wrong and to ensure that it does not happen again that, in July, I asked Lord Sutherland to conduct an independent inquiry.

 I thank the Secretary of State for his kindness in sending me prior notice of his statement and also in allowing me to read Lord Sutherland&#146;s report in his Department earlier this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08121664000044">The Sutherland report is an epic catalogue of incompetence, inefficiency and blinkered inactivity in the delivery of a vital public service. It paints an unremittingly depressing picture of the fiasco that was this year&#146;s national curriculum test process. It points the finger at a series of figures, some of them still in office, who did not act as they should have done to safeguard the interests of our children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08121664000045">May I express agreement with the Secretary of State that Lord Sutherland does us all a service in revealing that the company responsible for running those tests, ETS, was guilty of a series of fundamental mistakes? May I also ask the Secretary of State how ETS was allowed to get a multi-million pound contract in the first place? The procurement process that led to ETS getting its contract took 10 months. As well as a huge team of bureaucrats, the accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers were asked to scrutinise the company&#146;s credentials, but in all that time not a single person uncovered the fact that ETS had a record of failure and poor performance in America.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08121664000046">Conservative Members supplied Lord Sutherland&#146;s inquiry with a dossier of ETS&#146;s past failures, and he records that the stories we uncovered</p>
<a name="81216-0009.htm_brev2"><a name="08121664000236"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;were not identified and considered as part of the due diligence&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para9"><a name="08121664000048">Lord Sutherland further recommends that the QCA should have carried out the due diligence that we carried out to assess potential suppliers&#146; track records. It took us 10 minutes on the internet to find out what the whole of Government could not establish in 10 months. How can Ministers ever have been satisfied with a procurement process that did not identify the most basic problem with a bidder&#151;serial incompetence in the past?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para10"><a name="08121664000049">I am grateful to the Secretary of State for the fact that the Government will now change the way in which they award contracts, but given the horrendous failure of the procurement process, will he explain why we still cannot see the original contract with ETS? We have still ended up paying money to ETS for its failure. Why did the contract not specify that ETS would pay fines rather than just have payments docked when it failed? In a case such as this, as the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) indicated earlier, the taxpayer should be compensated. We can judge whether our interests were properly safeguarded only if the contract is made public. So why can we not see it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para11"><a name="08121664000050">Blame for what went wrong properly rests on many shoulders. ETS has paid the price, although not as heavily as it should, and the QCA&#146;s chief executive, Ken Boston, has rightly resigned, but Ministers have argued that their responsibility is limited because the process of managing those tests was at arm&#146;s length&#151;the Pontius Pilate defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para12"><a name="08121664000051">In the House on 22 July, the Secretary of State said that Ministers did not even see the contracts drawn up with ETS, yet in evidence to Lord Sutherland, Ken Boston pointed out:</p>

Ministers and officials had access to exactly the same data and information as the QCA&#151;they were active participants in the process&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para13"><a name="08121664000052">Does the Secretary of State accept his Department&#146;s share of responsibility? Does he accept that Ministers were active participants in this fiasco? Or does he think Ken Boston was lying?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para14"><a name="08121664000053">The Sutherland report also reveals that Department for Children, Schools and Families officials sat in on the crucial meetings throughout 2007 when flaws were revealed with the handling of those tests. Lord Sutherland points out that problems were raised at the Department&#146;s own senior management review group in February 2008. He reports that DCSF observers escalated their own assessment of risks to Ministers on a number of occasions in 2008. Will the Secretary of State tell us when those occasions were? Will he tell us why, when his officials were escalating their assessment of risk, he did nothing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08121664000054">The Secretary of State said that it was not appropriate for him to challenge the complacent judgment of those delivering the tests, but the facts about failure were in the public domain long before he took any action. When we raised problems concerning ETS and its track record in May, the Secretary of State told us that matters were on track, and he did nothing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para16"><a name="08121664000055">On 11 June, the Minister for Schools and Learners told us that he had been in regular contact with the test delivery body, the National Assessment Agency, but the Sutherland report reveals that the first time the Minister had a substantial discussion with the man in charge of the NAA was only on 17 June, one week later. How does the Secretary of State explain such culpable inactivity? Does he not regret the fact that Ministers did not act earlier? Why, when his officials knew what was going wrong, his Department&#146;s review group knew that things were going wrong and we told him that they were going wrong, did he ignore all these warnings? Why were so many signals flashing danger so studiously ignored?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para17"><a name="08121664000056">It is crucial that we have confidence in national curriculum tests. They are vital measures by which we hold schools and heads accountable. It is only fair that those in charge of this process are also held accountable. This Government have failed, and no Minister has acknowledged their role in this failure. Until they do, parents and teachers will conclude that this Government believe that everyone should be accountable for failure apart from them.</p>

 I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman that there was a clear failure, and that is why we commissioned an independent report. The report makes it clear that the primary failure was a failure by ETS, the supplier, but there was also a failure of the QCA to deliver on its remit. That is where the failure lies, and it is where the recommendations for action are. It is clear from the comments that I made in my opening statement that Lord Sutherland himself said that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para20"><a name="08121664000062">and he notes that there were two Office of Government Commerce reviews into that procurement procedure, the first of which gave a green light to the procurement, and the second of which gave an amber light because of a payment issue, which was subsequently resolved. As the Minister for Schools and Learners said in his evidence to Lord Sutherland,</p>
<a name="81216-0009.htm_brev6"><a name="08121664000238"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in this case, two OGC reviews satisfied me that there had been proper oversight of the process and that the QCA Board in turn, that we appoint, had approved it and had in fact endorsed it very strongly as an example of best practice.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para21"><a name="08121664000063">We know, and Lord Sutherland says, that while there was proper due diligence on financial strength and liquidity, the reviews did not look at the 180 countries in which ETS operates, or the 2,600 staff that it employs all around the world, to find some of the examples that subsequently came to light. I say, quite rightly, that that was a failure. It was a failure in the procurement process, and a failure that should have been spotted, as Lord Sutherland says&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

 If hon. Members had taken time to read the report, they would have found that the answers are right here on the page. I am afraid that their questions betray the fact that they have not yet had time to study the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para22"><a name="08121664000066">We have asked the OGC to implement Lord Sutherland&#146;s recommendation that in future we should ensure that such information comes to light. When the information came to light in May, as the hon. Gentleman knows, I had a phone call and a meeting with Mr. Ken Boston, who assured me in a meeting on 2 June that things were on track with the delivery of the tests in 2008. The hon. Gentleman asked what Ministers did, and I just say again that in February, March, April, June and July, Ministers were informed by DCSF officials that there were concerns. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I will state what Lord Sutherland says, because he conducted the independent review:</p>
<a name="81216-0009.htm_brev7"><a name="08121664000239"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;On this basis, ministers usually pressed QCA&#146;s Chief Executive for answers.&#148;&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para25"><a name="08121664000069">We did not take the advice of Conservative Members, however. We did not take the advice of the Leader of the Opposition, who throughout July repeatedly called  <br>

on us to sack summarily the contractor, ETS. As the legal advice made clear to me, if we had done so we would have been in a legal dispute with ETS, and we would not have got the &#163;24 million back to the taxpayer, which we secured in August. Throughout July, Opposition Members, having made no comment on this matter at all until May, grandstanded time and again, calling for steps that would have cost the taxpayer millions of pounds. We did the proper thing, which was to ignore their calls, their grandstanding and their irresponsibility; instead, we did the right thing by the taxpayer, and that is what I am determined to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para26"><a name="08121664000070">The fact is that, as Lord Sutherland&#146;s report makes clear, there was a delivery failure by the QCA. The leaders of the QCA and of the part of it that delivered the test, the NAA, have both now been suspended. There are a number of recommendations, all of which will be implemented in full. That will not repair the damage of the tests this year, and I cannot take away the inconvenience suffered by pupils and teachers. What I can do, however, is take seriously the conclusions of an independent inquiry that clearly says where the blame lies, and act upon that to ensure that in future we return to the way things were before ETS Europe, with a proper delivery of tests in our country.</p>

Sadly, what Lord Sutherland has reported seems to be a masterclass in incompetent project management, with ETS, the NAA, the QCA and perhaps Ministers to blame in varying degrees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para28"><a name="08121664000073">First, I want to make it clear that I support the action that the Government have taken so far in removing the contract from ETS and in changing the management of the QCA and the NAA. Those actions are justified by the information provided by Lord Sutherland. However, I am not quite so clear that the Secretary of State&#146;s statement is satisfactory in relation to the role of his Department and Ministers. Indeed, his statement could be summed up as follows: &#147;Everybody is to blame other than Ministers.&#148; Even officials in his Department get the blame, along with ETS, the QCA and the NAA.</p>

He clearly does not believe that that should fall only to the QCA and the NAA. Did the Secretary of State request Ken Boston&#146;s resignation or was that offered by the chief executive of the QCA on an entirely voluntary basis? Let me make it clear to the Secretary of State that I am not suggesting that ETS, the NAA and the QCA do not have the primary burden of blame, because they clearly do. I am suggesting that it is also the case that Ministers appear to be asleep at the wheel and that they should accept some responsibility.</p>

First, we understand from one of the letters that the Secretary of State has issued today that he&#151;or the QCA&#151;will be releasing information today on the number of appeals against the 2008 test results and what proportion of them have been upheld. Why was that information not available to the House before this statement, and can he shed some light on that today? Secondly, does he accept that, given the short time scale before the key stage 2 tests in 2009, Ministers will need to accept direct oversight and responsibility for ensuring that those tests are delivered effectively? They will not be able to get away with distancing themselves in the way that they have done this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="81216-0009.htm_para34"><a name="08121664000079">Thirdly, and finally, may I ask the Secretary of State about the future of key stage 2 national tests? May I suggest that those should be retained and that he should not proceed with the single level tests? However, in the review that is under way, will he ensure that the opportunity is taken for a fundamental reappraisal of what is being tested and of the scope for improving and streamlining the tests and for using more internal assessment, complemented both by external assessment and external checks? If he manages this review effectively, it is still possible that we will salvage something from the shambles that Lord Sutherland describes so effectively today.</p>

 Let me answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions first. I shall ensure that the expert group does a thorough job, and I will forward its conclusions on future testing to the House. We will need to make future decisions at that point, because as I have said, the regime is not set in stone. However, I disagree with his proposals for key stage 2 tests.</p>

That compares with 50,000 in the previous years.

of reviews. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an answer as to which of those two things has been more important, but I shall keep him and the House updated on those figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="81216-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08121664000082">I will also ensure that the procurement process is properly managed. Indeed, I hope that the letter from Lord Sutherland that I have released today, which says that he will continue to oversee how the procurement works, will give the hon. Gentleman some assurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="81216-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08121664000083">The hon. Gentleman is right to say that this was a case study in poor risk management. That is made very clear in Sutherland&#146;s report, but it is also clear that the contract was delivered at arm&#146;s length from Ministers by trusted delivery partners in the QCA and NAA. On repeated occasions, the QCA and NAA at executive level failed to escalate risks upwards to the board and to Ministers, who were given repeated assurances that things were okay when they were not. Those executives then failed to follow up problems when they were identified. I read out the quote from Lord Sutherland because it is telling. It points out that time and again during 2008 my officials and Ministers raised questions with the QCA and were reassured that things were okay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="81216-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08121664000084">Usually, it was the chief executive of the QCA, Ken Boston, who responded, but sometimes it was the managing director of the NAA, David Gee. Whichever it was, they reassured us that things were on track. As Sutherland says, it was only on 30 June that it was brought to our attention that tests were being delayed&#151;</p>

 Well, I advise the hon. Gentleman to read the Sutherland inquiry. It says, in terms and as I quoted in my statement, that in practice it was only on 30 June that Ministers were informed by QCA that there would be delays in the tests. There was a meeting on 17 June because my right hon. Friend the Minister for Schools and Learners asked for a meeting with David Gee and Ken Boston because he was concerned about the advice that he had had from DCFS officials&#151;not from LEAs or the QCA. My right hon. Friend asked for that meeting, in which Ken Boston deferred to David Gee who assured my right hon. Friend that things were on track. In retrospect, David Gee got that badly wrong, but it was our job to ask our delivery agent to deliver. We regularly asked questions and we were told that they were delivering. It is all substantiated in the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="81216-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08121664000087">The delivery failure was by the QCA and the NAA, and Lord Sutherland is very clear on that point. Ken Boston said in his evidence that the information that was being made available to him was also being made available to Ministers and our Department. The problem was&#151;as the report makes clear&#151;that he did not have a management system in place that meant that concerns in the NAA were escalated up to him. In fact, months earlier, NAA had a red risk rating and put scores of its own staff in to run the ETS contract, while telling Ken Boston that things were okay. But when he knew about the red risk ratings he did not act, and he assured us that things were okay. We did not have all the same information, but in any case it was his responsibility to act and he did not do so. That was the problem, and that is why the suspensions have occurred. That is why the inquiry was carried out, and that is why Sutherland says that while the primary responsibility was with ETS Europe, there was a failure on the part of the QCA to deliver.</p>

is there any point in publishing the key stage 3 results on a school by school basis? Should we not now simply put key stage 3 to bed and forget about it? On key stage 2, does the Secretary of State accept that it is possible to support a policy of national testing without requiring every child in every school to sit a test every year in each of the key subjects at the same time? There are other forms of perfectly valid national testing that could be more effective and would certainly be cheaper.

 The position is clear: a school pays a financial penalty only if a review is unsuccessful. That is an important principle, as it means that it is not possible for there to be review after review. If there were no financial cost to a litigious review, everyone would appeal. We have had 200,000 reviews this year, compared to 50,000 in 2007, and it is estimated that a further, and final, 18,000 review outcomes will be issued to schools. The rise is partly due to concern about test marking, although in her letter to me today the head of Ofqual makes it clear that she retains the view that she expressed in July&#151;that marking standards were maintained and that there was no decline in marking quality.</p>

Its abolition means that cases that in the old days would have been allowed a bit of an upgrade do not receive one now. That will have led to an increase in the number of reviews, but it is really important that the review process is undertaken properly and with integrity. A school that succeeds does not pay the fee, whereas one that fails does.</p>

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.

He assured me, in this Chamber, that the Government&#146;s response would come before the House of Commons before the Christmas recess. That has not happened, and it will not happen now.

 This is the last occasion on which my Committee, the Business and Enterprise Committee, will initiate a debate on energy policy. We have produced our last report, so this is something of a nostalgic occasion, although it will be much briefer than I had hoped. I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron), the Chairman of the Select Committee on Health. When there are so many Government statements on a day on which there are important matters to debate, injury time should be added to our proceedings, so that all those who want to participate can do so. It is very regrettable that we are down to less than two hours for each of today&#146;s two important debates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="81216-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08121664000136">The Government were right to create a new Department of Energy and Climate Change given the importance of the issue of energy, but it is a policy area that members of my Committee and I will miss greatly. It is an endlessly fascinating policy area, with economics, domestic politics, science, geopolitics, social policy and many other considerations forming part of the mix. The policy needs to reconcile three often conflicting aims: security of supply, affordability and sustainability. For example, achieving sustainability often means subsidy and cost, and that is paid for by the consumer, which means higher prices. Security of supply means investment, and that means reasonable profits for the energy companies, which means that prices must move with markets&#151;and with the imperfect wholesale markets, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="81216-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08121664000137">At the start of the year, the six main energy companies announced double-digit price hikes for their retail gas and electricity consumers. Not surprisingly, those steep increases were met with howls of protest from consumers, politicians and the media. <i> The Sunday Times </i>even went as far as to say that the big six were operating a cartel. The firms told us that they were simply responding to rising wholesale prices. Understandably, the Chancellor  <br>

and the Government wanted to appear responsive to consumers&#146; concerns, so the Chancellor hauled the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets before him and demanded to know what was going on&#151;perhaps surprisingly, as he had had responsibility for Ofgem only six months previously. Ofgem responded:</p>
<a name="81216-0011.htm_brev4"><a name="08121664000249"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Britain&#146;s competitive market in energy is working.&#148;</p>

Member for Croydon, North (Malcolm Wicks), who is in the Chamber&#151;it is a pleasure to see him here&#151;in order to understand what was happening. His evidence was eloquent and elegant, as always, but I have to say that we were not totally reassured, so we launched our own inquiry. It soon transpired that Ofgem did not believe its analysis of the markets either, as the regulator launched its own probe into the energy supply market little more than two weeks after we had done so. We do not believe that Ofgem would have launched its probe had we not forced its hand. At the very least, our inquiry ensured that the regulator did its job properly. Its initial findings are a very thorough job of work. Our work turned into one of the largest and most complex inquiries that the Committee has ever conducted, and this debate marks its culmination, as we hand over responsibility to the new Committee in the new year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="81216-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08121664000139">This debate is primarily about our July report, &#147;Energy prices, fuel poverty and Ofgem&#148; but also tagged is our most recent&#151;and last&#151;report, published last Friday, called &#147;Energy policy: future challenges&#148;. Together, the two reports represent our main views on those complex issues, and I hope that the new Committee will study them carefully. I believe them to be politically and economically well-founded and, for such a complex subject, to be pretty readable, too. I want to thank all the Committee staff who worked so hard to ensure that the documents were published rapidly and efficiently. I am blessed with a great team in my Committee office, and I am proud of them all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="81216-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08121664000140">Let me turn to the subject of wholesale oil and gas markets. Any discussion of energy prices must begin with the price of oil. At the start of 2008, the markets heralded a price of $100 per barrel&#151;an amount that would have been unthinkable five years ago. Not content with one high water mark, the markets continued to push prices up for the first half of the year. By the time my Committee published its July report, prices had reached almost $150, and some pundits were predicting that the price would be $200 or even $250 by about now. Such expectations now seem laughable. The energy price bubble has met the same end as most other asset price bubbles; it was pricked by the harsh reality of a sharp economic downturn. That is not to say that the oil price will not reach such heights again&#151;it probably will, but not in the short to medium term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="81216-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08121664000141">The important point is that the price of gas and electricity are inextricably linked to that of oil. That is because the UK is no longer self-sufficient in its supply of gas, and must instead depend increasingly on imports, particularly from Europe. On the continent, for largely historical reasons, gas prices are linked to oil prices. There is no economic rationale for that at all, and no one could really explain to us why it persists, other than that it seems rather to suit the interests of the oil and gas companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="81216-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08121664000142">Gas supply from the UK continental shelf is falling rapidly, and almost all the new electricity generating capacity due to come online in the short to medium term will use gas. That means, it seems, that the UK&#146;s dependency on gas imports is set to increase. That poses major challenges for the Government. We have a liberalised gas market in the UK, but it is structurally tied to an unliberalised European market. UK gas prices rarely fall below European levels because our companies simply choose to export surplus production. That is particularly the case in the summer, when gas consumption is lower. In the winter, UK prices have to rise significantly above European levels to attract that gas back. That is part of the reason why we have seen such large spikes in the price of gas during recent winters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="81216-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08121664000143">A further big reason is that the European markets have not liberalised in the same way as we have. There is not much that we can do about that, try as we might. Heaven knows successive Energy Ministers have tried, and I am sure that they will continue to do so.</p>

<p><a name="st_o237"><a name="08121664000144"><a name="81216-0011.htm_spnew5"><a name="08121664000294"><b>Mr. Mike Weir (Angus) (SNP):</b>
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s analysis, but does he not agree that the situation is even worse than that? In its evidence to the Committee, the Energy Intensive Users Group said that even when its members were in a position to take gas from continental suppliers, those suppliers would not supply it to them, so they could not take advantage of cheaper supplies on the continent, even where an interconnector existed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o238"><a name="08121664000145"><a name="81216-0011.htm_spnew6"><a name="08121664000295"><b>Peter Luff:</b>
 I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman&#151;a distinguished member of my Committee&#151;for that remark. As far as I am aware, that issue has not yet satisfactorily been addressed. It seems to be a breach of the simple single market rules of the European Union, and I cannot understand that. It is a matter of great concern to the Committee, and I hope that it will be to our successors, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="81216-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08121664000146">On gas supply, the Government must take some of the blame for the current predicament. If we were able to store gas at times when it is cheaper, the UK would not suffer from the current volatility in prices. Our growing dependency on gas and the need for more storage was a car crash that the Committee, and its predecessor, saw coming years ago, and I am afraid that the Government have been very slow to react to it. We have just 13 days of storage capacity. Germany has 99 and France has 122. Even if all the projects under construction or with the required consents were built, we would add only another five days of storage by 2014. In other words, we need growth of a greater magnitude than that achieved to date if we are to match the Europeans and protect our vital national interests. Planning has been a problem in that regard, as it has been for many aspects of energy infrastructure. We can only hope that the new infrastructure planning commission will help in that regard, although even if it does&#151;there are some doubts about that&#151;it will be some time before it begins to have an impact. The Government must move quickly to put in place a national policy statement on gas storage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="81216-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08121664000147">Worryingly, planning is not the only important issue. The industry told us that the economic incentives for the market to build new storage simply did not exist  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="16 Dec 2008">

<notus-date day="16" month="12" year="2008" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>16 Dec 2008 : Column 1010</b><br>
until fairly recently. Those incentives have now been virtually wiped out by the collapse in energy prices, and by the reduced availability of financing resulting from the credit crunch. In simple terms, the market will not deliver. If new storage capacity is to be built on time, the Government must think again about the incentives that they can provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="81216-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08121664000148">Lack of gas storage is not the only problem with the wholesale gas markets. Companies have been investing in new infrastructure for liquefied natural gas imports to the UK. One of our main facilities is at the Isle of Grain. Its owners&#151;BP and Sonatrach&#151;have barely used it this year, choosing instead to send LNG to the far east, where economies are willing to pay more. Third parties have the right to use the facility, but none have done so this year. Ofgem has been dismissive of the possibility that the regulatory framework for gaining access might be a factor, despite several witnesses telling us that it is. We believe that Ofgem should look again at the issue. Otherwise, we will have concerns about the outlook for new LNG capacity at Milford Haven.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="81216-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08121664000149">Liquidity in the gas market is a major concern for the Committee. For those who want to buy gas to use right now, the UK has one of the most liquid gas markets in the world, but that is not the experience for manufacturers who want to hedge prices by buying ahead; they just cannot do that. The financial crisis has served only to reduce liquidity further. Ofgem and the Government&#151;I hope that this will not be true of the new Department&#151;do not seem to believe that that is a problem. The UK&#146;s manufacturing base has told us otherwise. When even an arm of government&#151;the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency&#151;is concerned that there is</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="81216-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08121664000150">for gas, the Government and the regulator should take notice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="81216-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08121664000151">What about wholesale electricity? Failings in the wholesale gas market feed through to the wholesale electricity market, because 40 per cent. of our electricity comes from gas, and it provides the marginal source of generation in the UK&#151;it sets the price. Our Committee found serious failings in that market, too. In 2008, electricity prices have been driven up, not just by higher gas prices, but because of environmental costs. For example, Ofgem reckons that since the start of phase 2 of the European Union emissions trading scheme, &#163;9 per megawatt-hour has been added to the price of electricity, despite the fact that generators receive 93 per cent. of their permits free of charge. The Government estimate that the resulting windfall is about &#163;2 billion a year over the five years of phase 2.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="81216-0011.htm_para19"><a name="08121664000152">No one knows exactly what the energy companies are doing with their windfall gains, which are distributed very unevenly between energy companies and generators. At first, the energy companies denied that the windfall gains even existed, and to the extent that they did admit to them, companies claimed that the value of the windfall had been passed on through lower prices or greater investment&#151;investment that we need. The Government have rightly taken a different view in clawing back some of that money to tackle fuel poverty&#151;that was one of the recommendations in our July report&#151;but we are disappointed that neither they nor Ofgem have conducted a fuller analysis of what those windfalls were or how they were distributed.</p>

If other firms&#151;potential new entrants&#151;cannot see where profit-making opportunities lie in the value chain, it is easy to see why they are reluctant to enter the market to compete with the existing players, which is why we welcome Ofgem&#146;s decision, following the Government&#146;s prompting in response to one of our recommendations, to require the vertically integrated companies fully to disaggregate their accounts. That is an important, and big, step forward.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point with which I agree. It is something about which British Gas is particularly aggrieved, because it sometimes gets more of the blame than other companies because its profits are more visible than those of its competitors.</p>

We found that the electricity market suffers from a profound lack of liquidity&#151;a problem exacerbated by the financial crisis&#151;which contributes to price volatility and poor price transparency. It contributed, too, to the exit of two of the largest independent electricity suppliers outside the big six in recent months. We welcome Ofgem&#146;s tough line on this issue, announced in its probe findings, and we hope that our successor Committee will look at the issue in detail. As it stands, the market discourages new investment in generation by new entrants, which leaves us heavily dependent on the big six to deliver the conventional capacity that the UK needs to replace the nuclear and coal-fired power stations that are set to close in the coming years. We are fearful that the economic and financial crisis will lead to delays in that much-needed investment.</p>

As with gas storage, it is clear that the market could fail to make the necessary investments on time without intervention from the Government. Every month that we lose increases the risk of the lights going out, or of increased dependency on gas generation, or both. The Government have already said in their White Paper last year that security of supply is their top priority alongside reducing carbon emissions. They will now have to work very hard to ensure that those two objectives do not become mutually exclusive. For example, new coal-fired generation will be possible only if there is  <br>

significant progress on carbon capture and storage, which requires a much greater level of investment from the Government. They must quickly make the relevant national policy statement on nuclear power, and learn from the recent Finnish experience of cost overruns and delays, if new nuclear is to play the role that they want in the future energy mix, and which I believe it is right to want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="81216-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08121664000159">The retail markets receive most attention, and we uncovered many problems in the service provided to households and small businesses. I want to make it clear that neither we nor Ofgem found any evidence of the energy companies acting as a cartel, but they do not need to do so. Given that the market is dominated by just six players, it is easy for them to make informed judgements about one another&#146;s actions and position in the market. They do not need to collude because the market is broken. Ofgem has, rightly, always advocated the benefits of consumers switching to realise the benefits of the liberalised markets. About half of households have changed either their electricity or gas supplier since liberalisation. Most of them have done so to benefit from a dual fuel tariff or some other offer. However, 20 per cent. of households have never switched, and they are predominantly pensioners, people in social group E and those in rented accommodation&#151;in other words, some of the most vulnerable people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="81216-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08121664000160">Our inquiry and Ofgem&#146;s probe found that those consumers least likely or able to switch were most likely to be the victims of price-discriminatory practices by the energy companies. For example, suppliers charge their legacy customers&#151;the ones who stay with them and do not switch&#151;an average of 6 per cent. more for electricity than &#147;out of area&#148; customers. Suppliers earn much higher margins on electricity than on gas, thus disadvantaging 4.3 million households that are not on the gas main. Both standard credit and prepayment meter users are disproportionately overcharged compared with direct debit customers. I therefore welcome what Ofgem said today, but I want to highlight the issue and ram the point home: it is not just about prepayment meters&#151;where standard credit terms operate, that is where the bulk of fuel poverty exists.</p>

 Most of us welcome the Committee&#146;s work and the timely reports that it has produced. Does the hon.

They pay &#163;100 a year more than standard payers, and they pay &#163;500 a year more than people on direct debit. Even under Ofgem&#146;s proposals, they will pay &#163;51 a year more.

 The Committee&#146;s view on that point was very simple. There are additional costs involved in running prepayment meters, and it is essential that there is no excessive recovery of price beyond that actual economic cost. If the Government want to say that those people should pay the same price for electricity as people on other terms, some kind of subsidy is required&#151;either a cross-subsidy from other consumers or a subsidy from the taxpayer. That is a perfectly legitimate thing to want to do, but I point out that a cross-subsidy from standard credit customers to prepayment customers would work against the interests of tackling fuel poverty. However, I accept the point that the right hon. Gentleman makes.</p>

 May I, too, congratulate the hon. Gentleman and his Committee on their work? In recent weeks something has come to the fore that I discussed with interested groups in the summer recess, and it concerns people who pay by direct debit who have received demands from their supplier to increase their monthly payment. On a personal basis&#151;and I let my good lady wife deal with this&#151;I received a demand in recent weeks for an increase of 57 per cent. on what we previously paid. When my wife challenged that&#151;that is the point: I have encouraged people to challenge those demands&#151;the energy company reduced it to 17 per cent. The companies are taking people&#146;s money, putting it into their bank accounts, and they may well be dragging people needlessly into fuel poverty.</p>

My e-mail inbox and my postbag have swollen to huge proportions, because there are many experiences like that. The essential weakness of the energy companies&#146; position is that nine times out of 10, they reduce the price. When the Minister appeared before the Committee, he admitted that he had a similar experience with his direct debit. I have had a similar experience with mine. I know police officers, journalists and colleagues in the House who have all had the same experience. The problem is too widespread to be ignored. I gave a file of evidence to Ofgem, which is looking at what it can do to investigate the problem. It says that it lacks quantitative evidence but, my God, it has a lot of qualitative evidence. It needs to get on with it and look at this, because it is an important issue. If we want to move people on to direct debit terms to get the benefit of better prices, we must tackle other aspects of the deal that hurt those people, as could well be the case at present.</p>

 I, too, am grateful for the work of the hon. Gentleman and his Committee. Were they able to look rigorously at the weakness of Ofgem&#146;s claims about switching and the fuel-poor? The reality is that 1,000 households a week have been forced, as a result of fuel debt, to come off standard tariffs and on to prepayment meters, which is the only choice that they are offered. Even the argument that someone who has not been forced on to a prepayment meter could choose to switch to another tariff is not valid, because they do not have access. Conditions applied by energy companies say that to gain access to the best tariff people must have  <br>

 That is a powerful point. I strongly suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) will make some observations about the Post Office card account when he speaks on behalf of the Opposition, and offer some proposals to deal with that issue. The hon. Member for Nottingham, South is absolutely right, but that is not the only concern, because we are concerned, too, about the number of people who switch on to higher tariffs. The evidence is that 20 to 32 per cent. of households move on to a higher tariff after switching, so it is a mess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="81216-0012.htm_para4"><a name="08121664000172">On the specific issue of the fuel-poor and direct selling, recent evidence from Ofgem showed that 48 per cent. of gas customers and 42 per cent. of electricity customers who switched as a result of a direct sales approach&#151;doorstep selling&#151;failed to achieve a price reduction. Ofgem has proposed action, but we think that although direct selling plays a role in helping people switch, if it helps people switch wrongly, it is doing more harm than good and needs to be banned. We will look at that carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="81216-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08121664000173">Incidentally, it is not just private individuals who are affected, but small and medium-sized enterprises. We heard compelling evidence of predatory pricing, delaying tactics to win back customers, and confusing contract cancellation requirements. We are glad that Ofgem is looking at the SME market as well, but it is sad that that has come too late for my constituency company, BizzEnergy, which has gone into receivership, and for Electricity4Business, which has been driven out of the market. The market is thus becoming less, not more, competitive.</p>

Briefly, we believe that fuel poverty levels will reach 5.5 million. That figure is quite widely accepted. The Government will therefore fail to meet their target to eradicate fuel poverty for vulnerable households by 2010, unless there are sharp reductions in price in the future. In our reports, we asked for the Government to go back to the drawing board in their approach to fuel poverty.</p>

We said that income-raising measures should be targeted more accurately at the fuel-poor, not only pensioners. Pensioners are not the only group in fuel poverty, just as prepayment meter customers are not. Disabled people and many other vulnerable groups are also in fuel poverty, and we need to take action to help those groups as well, particularly through levels of investment in the energy efficiency of our housing stock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="81216-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08121664000176">We were very pleased to see the Government&#146;s &#163;1 billion fuel poverty package, which we thought struck the right note.

Part of the solution may lie in its powers. We hope the Government will look to ensure that the regulator has all the tools it needs to police the sector effectively.

make structural changes to our medium and longer-term energy policies and supplies, rather than simply deal with shorter-term changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="81216-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08121664000194">Those considerations are relevant to the problem of fuel poverty. We are told that, because of the definition of fuel poverty as a percentage of income, 40,000 people go into fuel poverty for every 1 per cent. rise in electricity prices. Logically, 40,000 people come out of fuel poverty, according to that definition, if prices come down. If prices are in a slump, the Government might look as though they are reaching their target for the eradication of fuel poverty over, say, a six-month period, yet six months later they might look as though they are way off beam. The people involved, of course, do not have more money in their pockets to pay for fuel, and neither do they consume different quantities of it; they have simply moved around as a result of forces way beyond their and other people&#146;s control. We need to concentrate on structural changes to the relationship of fuel-poor people to the energy that they consume. That is the right way to combat fuel poverty in a high-cost energy economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="81216-0012.htm_para21"><a name="08121664000195">That will require measures to enable fuel-poor people to control their energy consumption more effectively, and the recent measures to equalise pre-payment meters are a pointer in that direction. The issue is not just that people with such meters are more likely to be in fuel poverty, although that is not exclusively the case, or that it is unfair that pre-payment meter users are charged excessive premiums, although my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (John Battle) is absolutely right to be concerned about how those meters have effectively been used as an additional charging device. The issue is also that if consumption is controlled, an additional expense for the fuel-poor is avoided.</p>

Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) emphasised, just as small imbalances in a roulette wheel system will always benefit the casino, small changes in direct debit payments appear systematically to end up putting money in the energy companies&#146; banks. Even given the churn over time, direct debit consumers are probably systematically lending energy companies money. That does not appear to be right as far as long-term energy supplies are concerned, and I hope that Ofgem will take seriously an investigation into the matter. One of the roles of the successor Committee should be to make sure that the issue is pursued.</p>

and a number of energy companies&#146; assumptions about how the market operates&#151;and for their own benefit&#151;need to be fundamentally reviewed. There were assumptions that worked apparently well in an era of very cheap energy, when people were not particularly concerned about the environmental consequences of their energy consumption and the role of energy companies was&#151;provided that the lights stayed on&#151;to provide as much energy as possible to people at the lowest possible cost. If they made a lot of money, there were no further issues to address. However, now the issues have all fundamentally changed, and the role of energy companies in addressing them and changing things becomes crucial. Energy companies that do not change are guilty of living in a different era of energy supply and making assumptions that are not acceptable in the current debate on energy supply.</p>

 I accept that the hon. Gentleman does not altogether subscribe to what the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) said about energy bosses, but I think that he would acknowledge that the energy companies have acted too slowly and not sufficiently to deal with the problems. Does he not think that one of the solutions is to put social tariffs on a statutory basis&#151;standardise them across the companies so that the public can understand them, and make sure that we in the House, the Government and the companies themselves make the public aware of them? Currently, the public are simply not aware that social tariffs are available. Does the hon. Gentleman not think that what I have mentioned might be part of a good solution?</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that suggestion. Putting social tariffs on a statutory basis and making sure that they are not simply a device to shift responsibility for underwriting them to different forms of customers is important. However, I emphasised earlier that our world has changed; I also think that simply saying that we can shift notions about how people pay for electricity is not a sufficient answer to fuel poverty or energy supply problems.</p>

Both those issues could be resolved instantly by the introduction of smart meters. Smart meters give people control of their energy supply and mean that readings can be made regularly, rather than there being estimated bills. Pre-payment smart meters could be calibrated regularly and an accurate reading could be made of what is being paid. All that would make a big difference to how the energy is supplied and the consequences.</p>

There are still what are virtually wind-up meters in many houses, and a lot of the time those who clamber in to read the meters do not do so accurately. A lot of people are living in a world of estimates and possibly of substantial overpayments, whatever their tariff.</p>

 Personally, I think it essential that smart meters are rolled out in the shortest time possible if we are to move into the new era of energy supply&#151;particularly if we are to supply as little energy as we can, rather than as much as we can, to each household. Anything we can do to truncate the period as much as possible&#151;perhaps by three to four years&#151;is important. Measures suggesting that at any one stage the six major companies could visit the same street, to compete to put the smart meters in, are probably not the way to go. It is important for us to consider a roll-out area by area.</p>

There was &#163;300 million for the community energy-saving programme&#151;which, incidentally, is to be rolled out street by street and not as a patchy programme&#151;and an additional &#163;174 million for the Warm Front programme. There was also an increase in the carbon emissions reduction target over the next two years, a &#163;3.7 million commitment. However, the process by which energy companies appear to have to search out the fuel-poor and vulnerable so that their properties can be made more energy-efficient will have to be considered again. Local authorities have a substantial role to play in that. If a further windfall tax on energy companies is being considered, such a levy needs to be placed firmly in the context of energy saving and controlling the use of energy. If we simply take a tax from energy companies that can be wholly recovered by them, we will not make any difference to what is happening to energy supply and we will have failed in terms of the imperatives that now exist as regards the energy market.</p>

I am not convinced that Ofgem, in its current incarnation, can perform that role. I remain concerned that its main weapon appears to be switching, yet more than 30 per cent. of people switch to a higher priced tariff in any event. Even if everybody switched, there would not be a lower supply of energy to any particular household as a result.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. There are a variety of problems with switching in terms of the extent to which evidence suggests that a number of impediments are put in the path of switching and the extent to which people have usable information about what switching means in terms of their future tariffs. However, that has to sit with the overall point that switching is not the answer in its own right, by any stretch of the imagination. Although it may be an important element of how the current market operates, it is ultimately a zero sum game as regards the imperative of reducing the total amount of energy going round the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="81216-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08121664000211">One small structural change that we might pursue is to consider the methods whereby we delivery insulation and renewable, sustainable devices into the domestic environment and into small and medium-sized enterprises. The Treasury rules about what one can and cannot lease could be changed very slightly to make it possible to align the leasing arrangements in SMEs or the ability of energy companies to supply renewable products and insulation to homes. That would enable devices to be leased rather than purchased and therefore enable those leases to be paid for by the savings that people make in the energy supply that the devices then supply to their homes and buildings. At the moment, the Treasury rules say, &#147;If you can wheel it out of the door you can lease it; if you can&#146;t, you can&#146;t.&#148; Even if it can be unbolted from the wall and moved away, it cannot be leased. A change in leasing arrangements, like other aspects we have discussed&#151;smart meters, switching and other devices that do not look fundamentally significant in their own right&#151;could make a substantial difference to how people manage their energy supplies and how energy companies deliver those devices and services to people. Over the next decade, we should try to achieve the aim of a low-carbon energy economy that nevertheless supplies energy at an affordable price.</p>

That is astonishing. Will the Minister discuss with his officials why we have official statistics on this subject that are two years out of date? I understand that the reason is partly that the English house conditions survey has to be done and processed, individual consumption has to be applied to that and the numbers crunched.

to the prices of the main suppliers and to benefit levels, and it would not be too difficult to get an up-to-date figure. That is important, because the changes that go on in the market have a different impact on different people. We are almost trying to make policy with a blindfold on. If we are using the fuel poverty statistics to inform policy, we should not be using two-year old statistics.

 I think that we will let the Minister off in this case. All I can say is that I strongly suspect that he would not be rushing out bad news early. To be serious, I point out that informed policy making needs up-to-date data, and that is a problem in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="81216-0013.htm_para6"><a name="08121682000008">I recently wrote to the big six energy companies and asked them for an up-to-date and comprehensive account of their social tariff structures. They all wrote back quickly and gave me a full account, which I will publish shortly. One or two interesting things came out of that, which I was not aware of and want to raise with the Minister. First, the Government have legislated to allow the companies to know which of their customers receive pension credit. The companies have told us in the past that one of the problems that they face is finding their poor customers&#151;knowing who they are. The Government are now going to enable them to know who those customers are, at least as far as pension credit is concerned. The companies tell me that they are concerned about the assumption that once they know, they will have to do something about it. There are millions of people on pension credit, but only 600,000 people on social tariffs, and the Minister will know that there is a big difference between the two groups. What can he tell us about his expectations of the energy companies now that taxpayers&#146; money is going to be spent on telling them which of their customers are on pension credit? Does he expect them to do anything about it? It would be interesting to know what the Government&#146;s position is on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="81216-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08121682000009">Secondly, I found out about how breathtakingly complex social tariffs are; perhaps that was already well known to everybody else. I discovered that depending on which company someone is with, their eligibility for a social tariff might depend on how many bedrooms they have, whether they are over 60 or over 80, which benefit they are on or how long they have been with the company, so that they may have to switch to a company and stay with it for a year before they are eligible. I find that most consumers do not have a clue; in fact, many do not even know that their company has anything called a social tariff. I recently contacted a power company because I had met a very elderly lady who was struggling financially; I said, &#147;Can you help her?&#148;, and it said, &#147;Now we know that she is very elderly and struggling, we will switch her on to such and such a tariff, and that will save her a lot of money.&#148; She did not know, and if I had not contacted  <br>

 Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that there is actually a slightly worse problem, because all the companies&#146; tariffs are different?

 The hon. Gentleman is right. Not only might someone be better off with another company or on a different social tariff; they might not even be on the best tariff of the company that they are with. Fuel poverty is important. I do not know when the figures for excess winter deaths will next be published&#151;the Minister might be able to tell us&#151;but they are truly shocking. One excess winter death is truly shocking, especially when we think of the cold countries that do not have that problem. One can only fear that this winter will be a bad winter.

One company will tell the House that it offers more social tariffs than any other by a long chalk. That company may have closed its social tariffs temporarily, however, because it is waiting for the others to catch up. However, it can turn out that when the company applies its social tariff, it charges more than some other companies charge on their normal tariffs. The consumer is baffled by all this. Again, that is an argument for regularising the situation and giving people an entitlement, rather than just hoping that everything will work out.</p>

I did a bit of mental arithmetic over my cornflakes and worked out that if he has saved, to take some round numbers, &#163;200 million in 20 million households, that works out at &#163;10 a year or 20p a week on average.

I also take the Chairman of the Committee&#146;s point that there is no straight corollary between pre-payment meter usage and fuel poverty. We need to ensure that the fuel poor in particular are not being overcharged for their energy. The second way relates to people who are off the gas main and who cannot access dual-fuel benefits. Some action there is necessary; indeed, it is good to see some.</p>

That is a classic example of a market not working. Where a company has a huge base of inherited customers, many of whom would be better off switching, but who have stuck it out because they do not know how to switch, cannot be bothered to switch or whatever, that company can cream off millions. Ofgem says that there is a problem, but does not seem to be changing much.

 I have been involved in the oil industry since 1973, first working in it and from 1992 representing Milford Haven, the largest UK oil port. When I saw crude oil prices starting to rise in the middle of 2007, peaking at $147 a barrel in July 2008, I scratched my bald head and thought, &#147;What on earth is going on?&#148; Since 1973, I have seen middle east crises, the straits of Hormuz closed, the Iran-Iraq war, problems in Nigeria and hurricanes in the gulf of Mexico that have taken out significant proportions of the American refining industry. However, I have never seen the price of crude oil double, as it did between the summer of 2007 and the summer of 2008, or fall to around $40 a barrel, as it then did in the space of six months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para0"><a name="08121682000025">The effect of that has been catastrophic. We have been talking about fuel poverty and the fact that since around the beginning of 2007, 2 million more people are likely to be in fuel poverty than before. We have seen riots around the world and the beginning of a huge global downturn, the like of which the Chancellor of the Exchequer believes we have not seen for 60 years. We have seen a huge hike in energy prices, coupled with the credit crunch&#151;I want to link the two, because I believe that they are absolutely interconnected&#151;and now we are facing a severe downturn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08121682000026">When I undertook some research in February and March on why the price of crude oil was doing what it was doing, I discovered that the US Congress was conducting exactly the same sort of investigation and taking evidence, so I have used quite a bit of that research. It appears that approximately five years ago, commodity index funds started to grow quite substantially. Between 2003 and July 2008, trade in commodity index funds in a range of commodities, not just oil, grew from $13 billion to $317 billion. Taking into account not just trading on the exchanges, but all the over-the-counter trading taking place, the Bank for International Settlements believes that there is some $9 trillion involved in commodity futures and speculation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08121682000027">In the summer of 2007, when the credit crunch began, investors abandoned stocks and shares&#151;certainly banks&#146; stocks and shares&#151;and sought an investment market that appeared to them to be safe and profitable.  <br>

They alighted on commodity index funds for understandable reasons: these were pension funds, university endowments and the funds of insurance companies. The investors needed a safe income, and, believing that commodity index funds would provide it, they piled into them. As a result, we saw a huge growth in the market for commodity index funds. I am certain that the link exists&#151;that the consequence of that huge influx of funds was the remarkable speculative spike that has caused so much damage.</p>

We do not envisage a fundamental problem between supply and demand.&#148; In fact, Members may recall that Saudi Arabia was prepared to increase its output by 500,000 barrels a day back in May and June. There was not really a problem of tight supply. I have concluded that while China and India were certainly playing a role in increasing demand, that did not justify the level of increase that we saw between the summer of 2007 and the summer of 2008.</p>

Once the impact of high energy prices had had its effect on the global economy and we started to see the beginning of the downturn, the fundamentals kicked in, and we saw the collapse of not only crude oil prices but metal prices, and even food prices, as people withdrew from commodity index funds.</p>

of what we saw in 2008. I think that the only way in which to do that is to ensure proper regulation of vital markets, not just in oil&#151;important though that is&#151;but in metal and other commodities. We need full transparency, not only in relation to commodities traded on the exchanges but in all the over-the-counter deals which are, in effect, unregulated and have a huge impact on the prices of commodities. We also need to return to the situation that existed probably 10 years ago, and had certainly existed since the 1930s, in which position limits were placed on those in the market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08121682000037">Ten years ago, producers and suppliers of oil were the main players in the exchanges. Perhaps 60 per cent. of trading was carried out by people who had a direct impact; the other 40 per cent. was carried out by those who provided liquidity. Their trading involved speculation, but it was necessary to provide the opportunity to hedge prices on those exchanges. Now the ratio has reversed. The majority of traders do not want to buy a pork belly, a bushel of grain or a barrel of oil. They are there to make money, from their pension funds, their university endowments or their insurance companies. I believe that until we return that ratio to where it was, the risk will remain that we will face yet another speculative spike in the future, and the only way in which to deal with that is through global regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08121682000038">I am very pleased that the Prime Minister is considering all those issues. It is clear that not just the financial sector but the commodity markets need global regulation. I understand that the United States Congress is beginning to consider the matter seriously, and we need to persuade our regulator&#151;the Financial Services Authority, which looks after the ISAs futures market&#151;that it should take it seriously as well. The Treasury Committee, of which I am a member, is looking at the issue, although we currently have other problems on our hands involving the banking crisis. I should like to know what my hon. and learned Friend the Minister thinks about the need for greater regulation of the commodity markets to prevent a repeat of what happened this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para14"><a name="08121682000039">My second point relates to rural energy customers. I wrote to my hon. and learned Friend enclosing two letters forwarded to me by constituents. Both were customers of Flogas, from which they had bought liquefied petroleum gas. One of the letters, dated 1 October 2008, began</p>
<a name="81216-0014.htm_brev5"><a name="08121682000177"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Dear Customer</p>
</ul><a name="81216-0014.htm_brev6"><a name="08121682000178"><ul><p class="tabletext">Price fix for the winter&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08121682000040">The first constituent was offered a guarantee that the price of his LPG would be increased by 3p per litre, but that it would be fixed until 31 March 2009. Flogas wrote a similar letter to his neighbour on 2 October offering to increase his tariff by not 3p but 5p per litre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08121682000041">That suggests two things to me. First, on 1 October we had experienced nearly four months&#151;certainly three months&#151;of dramatic falls in the price of oil. LPG is tied directly to the price of oil: it is almost like a by-product of the refining process. Yet the company was telling its customers that despite those three or four months of dramatic falls, its price would increase and would be fixed until 31 March next year. I think that that is outrageous. It is clear that no proper market is operating in the LPG sector in rural areas. Furthermore, those two neighbours knew each other and were able to determine that they were being charged different tariffs even though they lived 100 yd apart.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08121682000042">My hon. and learned Friend the Minister gave me an excellent response on what is being done to try to increase competition, not only in the LPG market but in the heating oil market. Heating oil is actually kerosene; it is jet fuel, in effect. It is used to heat a very large number of rural homes that cannot get a connection to the gas main. I am certain that British Airways and other airlines have seen dramatic reductions in the price of jet fuel&#151;that is, kerosene&#151;recently, but I am also pretty certain that domestic users of kerosene have seen nowhere near that level of reduction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para18"><a name="08121682000043">This comes back to the suppliers. I am not talking about the relatively small businesses that deliver the kerosene. I mean the larger suppliers&#151;the energy companies and the oil companies. I do not believe that there is genuine competition in relation to the delivery of heating oil and LPG. Many of the distribution companies that I have spoken to tell me that the price to the consumer for both those products goes up immediately when the price of crude goes up, but that there is an awfully long time lag before any reductions are passed on. That should not be the case. I can understand it happening in the gas and electricity supply markets, but not in the LPG and heating oil markets. The price should fall as quickly as it rises, if it is keeping pace with the price of crude oil. Ofgem&#151;or perhaps the Department itself&#151;needs to look into what can be done to achieve proper competition in the supply of heating oil and LPG in rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="st_o277"><a name="08121682000044"><a name="81216-0014.htm_spnew1"><a name="08121682000215"><b>Peter Luff:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is making an important point. Some 5 million households are not on the gas network, and this is an important issue for many of our constituents. The trouble is that, in this respect, Ofgem does not have powers. I still think that the Government are wrong to imagine that the Office of Fair Trading can handle the matter, and I believe that Ofgem needs more powers in this regard.</p>

<p><a name="st_o278"><a name="08121682000045"><a name="81216-0014.htm_spnew2"><a name="08121682000216"><b>Nick Ainger:</b>
 I totally agree. There is blatant abuse going on, and there is no genuine competition in either of those so-called markets. Members who represent rural constituencies have heard about real problems that have been encountered. For example, many elderly people retire or move to a rural area, perhaps to a home that is not particularly fuel efficient&#151;although we can help them with that&#151;only to find that their outgoings are being hammered. The price can depend on the time of year at which they fill their tank up, which is also an abuse of the market. An 80-year-old man came to my constituency surgery on Saturday and told me that he was spending 20 per cent. of his income on heating oil, which I found quite incredible. There is a real issue that needs to be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para19"><a name="08121682000046">I support other Members&#146; comments about the need for far more Government action to tackle fuel poverty. The main reason for 2.5 million people being classified as in fuel poverty over the past two years is undoubtedly the huge hike in the unit cost of energy, and the Government are absolutely right to make significant investments to enable people to have more efficient systems, to start to tackle the problem of prepayment meters, and to make investments so that homes can be much warmer. In the short term, however, we will definitely fail to reach our 2010 energy target unless we can get the energy companies to pass on the substantial reductions in the wholesale cost of energy. I look forward to hearing my hon. and learned Friend&#146;s comments on this later.</p>

 The evidence session that the Committee heard when we were preparing this report was among the most interesting that I have been involved in, covering a huge number of issues, from the markets and the impact on industry to fuel poverty. The Chairman, the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), gave the House are very good resum&#233; of those issues, so I will not dwell on them further. I agree with everything that he said, apart from his enthusiasm for nuclear power, which I do not share. In the time available to me, I would like to comment on a few of the recommendations in the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para20"><a name="08121682000048">Clearly, the most pressing issues for households up and down the country are the price of energy and fuel poverty. The complex nature of this problem is reflected in the number of recommendations on those subjects. Some of those recommendations have already produced action, and I am now going to break the habit of a lifetime by saying something almost nice about Ofgem. Its action was prompted by the Committee&#146;s inquiry, and I share the Chairman&#146;s reservations about its needing to be prompted in that way. None the less, the report has produced some welcome changes, even if they are somewhat overdue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para21"><a name="08121682000049">However, I would urge the Government, Ofgem and, indeed, the companies to go much further, particularly in relation to prepayment meters. I agree with what many others have said about the difficulties that they present. Under the current proposals, there would still be an opportunity for companies to charge more for such meters, due to what they call opportunity costs&#151;namely, the fact that the meters cost more to service. There might be something in that, but I do not believe that we should accept that argument in respect of people who are on such meters because they are fuel poor. I deliberately make that point because not everybody who is on a prepayment meter is actually fuel poor. We should bear that in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para22"><a name="08121682000050">For the fuel poor, prepayment meters are an example of people being penalised for paying in advance in cash. They are often used when people are in arrears and they bring with them the serious worry&#151;for me, at least&#151;that people will simply self-disconnect when they cannot afford the tokens to feed the meter. We collected data on disconnections relating to other methods of payment to the energy companies, but there are no reliable data on the number of people who simply self-disconnect by not feeding their meter. That can present as many problems as there are for people who are disconnected for other reasons, and they might be disconnected for quite long periods of time because they are unable to afford to feed their meter. That risk needs to be tackled, because if we do not know that it is happening, we cannot take action to help people in that position.</p>

<p><a name="st_o280"><a name="08121682000051"><a name="81216-0014.htm_spnew4"><a name="08121682000218"><b>Steve Webb:</b>
 That is absolutely right. I have asked the energy companies to look into this, and they have told me that they do not know how to do it. The answer, however, is smart meters, and the sooner we can get on with installing them, the sooner we will know what people are consuming.</p>

<p><a name="st_o281"><a name="08121682000052"><a name="81216-0014.htm_spnew5"><a name="08121682000219"><b>Mr. Weir:</b>
 Indeed, and smart meters will also need to be interchangeable, so that everyone will know what the meter does and so that it can be easily looked at. It might also be possible to track instances of meters not being fed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para23"><a name="08121682000053">The report also tackles the difficult subject of social tariffs. I would particularly like to draw the House&#146;s attention to recommendation 38, which states in part:</p>
<a name="81216-0014.htm_brev7"><a name="08121682000179"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We do not accept the view that a mandatory and comprehensible definition of what constitutes a social tariff would create a &#145;race to the bottom&#146; for all suppliers&#151;rather, it would provide a minimum level above which they can compete, not only on tariffs, but also on other schemes to assist the fuel-poor.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para24"><a name="08121682000054">I strongly endorse that recommendation, and I cannot for the life of me understand why the Government and the companies are so against the idea of a mandatory, statutory minimum tariff. The current tariffs are contradictory and confusing and it is difficult to determine what is in fact the best social tariff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para25"><a name="08121682000055">Nothing sums up the situation so eloquently as the disputes among the energy companies as to which offers the best social tariff. British Gas claims that it does, as it has more customers on the tariff, but I would like to quote from a briefing from Scottish and Southern Energy that I received in the past few days. It says:</p>
<a name="81216-0014.htm_brev8"><a name="08121682000180"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Essentials Tariff (the BG social tariff used in their standard analysis) is set at their direct debit level. This is particularly significant as SSE&#146;s standard direct debit tariff has actually been cheaper than the British Gas so-called &#145;social&#146; tariff. Therefore, British Gas Essentials Tariff is not actually helping fuel poverty; it is just helping some of their poorer customers get a slightly better deal than some of their other customers&#151;all within the generally higher British Gas pricing policy. The SSE approach, on the other hand, discounts heavily from our, already low, baseline.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para26"><a name="08121682000056">Make of that what you will, Madam Deputy Speaker, but what is the consumer supposed to make of it? How is the consumer able to determine what is actually the best tariff? Even at this late stage, I urge the Minister to look again at the issue of mandatory social tariffs. Let us have a clear, transparent system so that people know what they are getting. That brings me on to question of switching. It has already been noted that a lot of people switch suppliers, but end up worse off&#151;further evidence of the lack of clarity about pricing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para27"><a name="08121682000057">I was very pleased yesterday when Scottish Power announced an improved tariff for vulnerable customers aged over 60 who receive benefits, but I make the point again that that does nothing for many vulnerable customers who are not over 60. Our Committee made a clear recommendation for more to be done to target the fuel poor who are not pensioners, particularly the disabled. We returned to that issue in our supplementary report, which was issued the other day and in which we said:</p>
<a name="81216-0014.htm_brev9"><a name="08121682000181"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We also reiterate our frequent recommendation&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para28"><a name="08121682000058">it is not just us, as the predecessor Committee also made the same point&#151;</p>
<a name="81216-0014.htm_brev10"><a name="08121682000182"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;that much more attention must be paid to groups in fuel poverty other than pensioners, particularly disabled people under 60&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="81216-0014.htm_para29"><a name="08121682000059">because they suffer just as much as many pensioners. Something must be done to tackle that problem.</p>

Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire (Nick Ainger) touched on, I was particularly pleased with the recommendation on off-network consumers&#151;an issue that I have pursued for some time, including through the hearings that are mentioned in the report. It became clear that neither of the consumer bodies&#151;Energywatch previously or Ofgem now&#151;had any remit whatever in that respect. These people had simply fallen off the radar of fuel poverty.</p>

Members for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire and for Mid-Worcestershire that Ofgem needs to be involved as well. The point that the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire made about LPG also applies to coal and fuel oil prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08121682000062">Let me ask the Minister to give consideration to this issue: we always pay the winter fuel allowance in the winter, but it may well be cheaper for someone to fill up a tank or buy coal in the summer months. I would like the Minister to reflect on whether, in certain circumstances, the winter fuel allowance could be paid to some people earlier in the year to allow them to take advantage of the lower prices. I appreciate the difficulties that that may cause, but it is worth considering, as it would help some people. There is no magic bullet to deal with fuel poverty and, as the report states, there are many other things to be done to combat it&#151;home insulation, for example. Many homes need to be retro-fitted with good insulation to save energy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08121682000063">The Scottish Government have launched an ambitious programme to help tackle fuel poverty and, unlike with Warm Front in England, they have maintained spend on fuel poverty programmes through the year. They have allocated an additional &#163;10 million for the central heating programme, which is about installing such heating in vulnerable homes, and for giving more help to fuel-poor households. A record number of central heating installations were completed last year. The Scottish Government have also proposed increased help beyond basic insulation, which is being provided UK-wide, to families on income support with children under five or with disabled children under 16, as well as to pensioners. The Minister should look into extending those measures to other vulnerable groups in the rest of the UK. Those existing programmes reveal the wide range of issues that need to be addressed in tackling fuel poverty. With all that going on, I have to tell the Minister that it is a scandal for the UK Government at this time to slash the budget of the Scottish Government by &#163;1 billion, which is bound to impact on many necessary programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08121682000064">I promised that I would not speak for much more than 10 minutes, so I will start to conclude. The report is not only about fuel poverty and energy prices, but about the security of our future energy supply. The Select Committee Chairman made many of the points that I would make so I will not dwell on the issue, other than to say that when we think about the big six energy companies we have to take into account the fact that we are asking them to do two contradictory things&#151;to reduce prices, but at the same time also to make the huge investments needed for future energy generation of whatever type. The Government need to look further into how to deal with such contradictory priorities. A bankrupt company cannot invest in generation and we need to consider whether the current market provides the best means of meeting those priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para4"><a name="08121682000065">The profits of the energy companies were mentioned, so I should like to return to a point I raised in an intervention. Because four of the big six are multinational  <br>

companies, it is difficult to ascertain how much profit they are making from generation, how much profit comes from sales and how much of it is actually made in the UK. In some ways, British Gas and Scottish Power and Southern are disadvantaged in that we can see how much profit comes from the UK, but the Government need to look further into the matter, perhaps in tandem with the European Union. We need more clarity and we need real thought about how to get the energy companies to meet the two contradictory objectives&#151;to invest in generation and to deal with climate change as well as with prices, particularly for vulnerable customers.</p>

 In the remaining time available, I shall ask a couple of questions, as some points in the report will have to be followed up and progress made. Having heard the issues raised in the debate about Ofgem, does the Minister believe that its terms of reference need to be revised in the light of market changes and current pressures? The electricity and gas companies, for example, have asked for an enormous increase in contributions to monthly payments. Is that justified and is Ofgem adequate to protect people from those demands? Although there is no doubt that the deregulation of the market brought about a fall in prices for consumers, is the Minister satisfied that the market is working adequately now&#151;and not just for domestic consumers, who are very important, but for business consumers? I represent a constituency in Scunthorpe that has much energy-intensive industry, so I am concerned to ensure that there is fair competition in respect of energy prices for companies in this country as compared with prices in the rest of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08121682000067">My final point is about carbon capture and storage, which was mentioned earlier. Yorkshire Forward presented a proposal for a carbon capture pipeline in the south Humber bank, leading to the gas fields and allowing energy-intensive industry to connect to them. I declare an interest here, because the installation of a carbon capture blast furnace in Scunthorpe is under active consideration and having that sort of infrastructure would make the project all the easier. I am very keen to see such new technology implemented in our own country. I believe that this represents one way forward for the low-carbon economy. I understand that, at the European Council, the EU agreed to make a sum of about &#8364;6 billion or &#8364;7 billion available. Given the existence of that European funding, is the Minister open to thinking again about a bid from Yorkshire Forward, perhaps in partnership with some of the energy-intensive companies in that area, as a means of providing such important infrastructure investment?</p>

 I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) and his Select Committee on its work in preparing these reports.

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08121682000069">The reports have given rise to a thoughtful and constructive debate and I hope that you, Madam Deputy Speaker, will make strenuous representations to the business managers of the House about the fact that so many outstandingly able right hon. and hon. Members who have tremendous expertise have been denied the opportunity to speak in the debate because of the lack of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para7"><a name="08121682000070">I want to focus on the issues of fuel poverty and this country&#146;s future energy supply. Today has been a bad day for consumers. I think that they had hoped for relief from the Ofgem announcement, but they have not received it. That is why this morning&#146;s announcement has received a poor response from organisations such as Age Concern, Help the Aged and the National Housing Federation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para8"><a name="08121682000071">Of course we welcome the progress that has been made on prepayment meters and in relation to those who are not on the gas grid, but more is clearly needed. Now that it has been recognised that people in those categories had a bad deal in the past, I hope that the Minister will say whether he will seek compensation for the way in which they lost their income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para9"><a name="08121682000072">There is little here for consumers more generally. We know now that there are probably 5.5 million households in fuel poverty, and every 10 per cent. increase in fuel prices pushes another 400,000 people into fuel poverty. We know that here in the UK energy prices are rising twice as fast as the EU average. We know as well that many people face a raw deal from how the direct debits operate. We also know that this is about not only those who are defined as being fuel-poor&#151;millions of households across the country will struggle to pay their bills this winter. Worst of all, knowing that 25,000 people died last winter because of cold-related illnesses, it is likely that that figure will be higher this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para10"><a name="08121682000073">We must recognise that more should have been done earlier. In October, we were told by the Secretary of State that he would give the energy companies four weeks to take urgent action. In November, he said that he would give them another four weeks. Today, he is saying that he will think about consulting on having a review to discuss what more should be done if they do not do something now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08121682000074">The time for action has passed and we should have seen more. We should now be seeing the Government taking action to make excessive profiteering on prepayment meters illegal. There should be legislation to provide social tariffs for vulnerable households. There should be a requirement that the companies from which people get their energy should say on their bills what would be the cheapest tariff. There should be an extension of the Post Office card account to enable those who do not have bank accounts to get the best tariffs available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08121682000075">We think that the time has come for the Government to ask the Competition Commission to look into how the companies operate. So, while the Government have said that affordability is a priority, it must be a matter of great concern that we have not seen that achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08121682000076">The report also considers how Warm Front works. A couple of weeks ago, I raised that matter with the Prime Minister at Question Time. I received a letter from him today and he says:</p>
<a name="81216-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="08121682000183"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In addition to the &#163;74 million of new money announced on 11 September, a further &#163;100 million of new funding has been made available to Warm Front through the Pre Budget Report... The additional &#163;100 million brings the total spent on Warm Front to over &#163;950 million for the 3 year period to March 2011.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para14"><a name="08121682000077">That is a very partial reply, because he does not say that new money is simply reinstating some of the funds that have been taken out. For those three years, we are still left with a Warm Front budget of &#163;100 million less than originally intended for that period. We need to know whether the Prime Minister is aware of the fact that the budget has been cut, or has he deliberately chosen to hide that? The bald fact is that the Warm Front budget has been cut, but because some of the cut has been restored, he seeks to portray that as an increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para15"><a name="08121682000078">Moving on to security of supply, which is so crucial to the debate because of its impact on future energy prices, there is recognition across the House that we need investment in new capacity. Paragraph 17 of the Select Committee&#146;s first report of the 2008-09 Session puts it well:</p>
<a name="81216-0015.htm_brev1"><a name="08121682000184"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The situation is now very serious and we believe that a simple trust in the market&#146;s ability to deliver without any intervention will see us facing an &#145;energy crunch&#146; in the medium term. The social and economic consequences of such a &#145;crunch&#146; would be disastrous.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para16"><a name="08121682000079">Although I recognise that the Minister is relatively new to his brief, I am afraid that he is showing complacency in how that is being addressed. On the &#147;Today&#148; programme a few weeks ago, he said that the lights would be burning even more brightly in 2015 because there would be 37 per cent. more generating capacity on stream by then. He must be the only person in the country who thinks that is true.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para17"><a name="08121682000080">The Minister took the figures from the national grid&#146;s seven-year statement, but he knows that they do not take account of planning consents, financing or the cost of commodities, which will determine whether some projects will be built. Crucially, they do not take account of the facilities, particularly in coal and nuclear, which will come off stream, or indeed the variability of wind power: 8 GW of that figure will come from onshore and offshore wind, but he treats wind power as providing the same reliability of supply as would come from gas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para18"><a name="08121682000081">We also need to recognise that this situation is getting worse. The return on equity required by companies, according to Alistair Buchanan, will be 15 per cent. or more, rather than 10 per cent., which it has been. He says as well that there will be significant refinancing needs across the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para19"><a name="08121682000082">If we need any more warning, we should heed the words of Wulf Bernotat, chief executive of E.ON, who, writing about Britain in <i> The Sunday Times</i>, said:</p>
<a name="81216-0015.htm_brev2"><a name="08121682000185"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;You have old nuclear plants, old coal, expensive gas, a need to invest in renewables to reach unrealistic targets, and a slow&#148;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para21"><a name="08121682000084">We have to be realistic because many of the things that we are looking to are simply not likely to happen. We have a problem here with people wanting to invest in coal: because of the Government&#146;s lacklustre approach to carbon capture and storage, they are questioning whether they can make those investments. We are seeing issues even in gas, with RWE in Pembroke saying that it needs an urgent decision on the 2 GW plant for it to go ahead. If that does not happen in the next few months, the financing of it may change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para22"><a name="08121682000085">Day by day, people in the renewables sector, and particularly those in offshore wind, are saying that they need more funding if their schemes are to come on stream. Centrica has put one of its plants on hold, Shell is pulling out of London Array, and Eclipse and AMEC&#146;s wind business have been taken over. RWE says that it needs more support. Projects that looked to be developed in round 2 are struggling, let alone those needed in round 3. They are all saying that the moves towards banded renewables obligation certificates, which we have supported, do not give them enough support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para23"><a name="08121682000086">The UK has 11,000 miles of coastline and should be a natural place to lead the world in marine renewables sector technologies, but the marine renewables deployment fund cannot be accessed. As Ministers have said, that is because they are not at the deployment stage. Well, the rules should be changed and that funding should be got through to the companies, the brilliant schemes and the brilliant academics so that Britain can lead the world in the sector, rather than seeing that lead heading off towards Portugal and elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para24"><a name="08121682000087">I come finally to the issues of gas storage and the role that it plays. The Minister has again shown disturbing complacency and when he gave evidence to the Select Committee, his own hon. Friends said that he did not seem to recognise what was happening. They pointed out the fact that we have moved from being an energy exporter to being an energy importer, so the need for gas storage is greater than ever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para25"><a name="08121682000088">We have about 4 billion cu m of gas storage and National Grid suggests that we might have 6 billion cu m by 2013. The Minister thinks that we might have 18 billion cu m by 2015. Nobody thinks that that, realistically, will happen because we are finding that projects on the list&#151;the Minister has referred to them&#151;are dropping off it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para26"><a name="08121682000089">Yesterday, National Grid issued a 10-year statement based on the report that the Minister is relying on, but that report says that 2.5 billion cu m of storage capacity will not proceed as planned, 0.7 billion cu m has been rejected in planning in relation to the Saltfleetby application, 1 billion cu m at Portland has been put on hold because of the investment climate, and a proposal for a further 1 billion cu m has been rejected by the Secretary of State, although it is still showing in the figures as something that might happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para27"><a name="08121682000090">We face formidable energy challenges and that will be the key issue of the winter for people who cannot pay their bills because they simply cannot afford the prices out there. They have been looking urgently for support and they deserve support because these problems are not of their own making, but the Government have delayed. As a result, people face a more challenging time this winter than was necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para28"><a name="08121682000091">As the Select Committee report points out, damage has been caused not just to those short-term issues, but to the long-term energy security needs of this country, because the Government have not put in place the steps to secure the necessary investment.</p>

professional and impressive piece of work, and I said so when I met the Committee. The latest report on future challenges involves a little bit of crystal-ball gazing, and when gazing into the future it seems to see things a little darkly, but a lot of challenges need to be met, and the Government are determined to meet them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para29"><a name="08121682000093">I can hardly think of any justification for the claim of Government complacency made by the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry). We have just enacted the biggest legislative programme on energy that has ever been carried through by this Parliament. The Energy Act, the Climate Change Act and the Planning Act are a major set of policy initiatives that the Government have undertaken to meet some of the key challenges. The formation of a Department of Energy and Climate Change shows that the Government treat seriously the key challenges of energy sustainability, security of supply and the ensuring of affordability. The Government aim to cut emissions, hit our climate change targets, defend consumers and ensure diversity of supply of energy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para30"><a name="08121682000094">I welcome the breadth of the debate. A number of serious points were made by hon. Members. My hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) gave an excellent analysis of fuel poverty issues and my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire (Nick Ainger), with his knowledge of the oil industry, made interesting points about the commodity market. My right hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley), with his knowledge of intensive energy users, made some important points, as have other Members, and I hope to deal with some of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="81216-0015.htm_para31"><a name="08121682000095">We need to deal with the key issue of affordability. Consumers must be able to get the energy they need at the lowest sustainable prices possible. Beyond that, they need to be confident that the prices that they pay are fair, and they are not at the moment. Healthy competition and fairness should be the hallmark of our independently regulated energy markets, and if there is any suggestion that consumers are being ripped off, we should not hesitate to take action by rooting out unfair practices. The Government want to ensure that that happens.</p>

 I will, but before I do so, I say to my hon. Friend that he used very provocative descriptions of the energy companies, and I have one point to make to him. We are looking to those energy companies, their shareholders and their foreign boards to make about &#163;100 billion of investment in the coming months and years, and to refer to them as he did is hardly likely to encourage that investment, much of which will come from abroad.</p>

 That may well be. I was going to defend the Government in one respect because until 1997 there was no winter fuel allowance at all. However, despite what my hon. and learned Friend said, everyone knows that the wholesale price of energy has substantially reduced, and he has said so on previous occasions. Are we to take it that the Government will use the utmost pressure to bring prices down, and if the energy companies refuse to do so, what action will the Government take?</p>

 The Government want to ensure that people pay fair prices. As my hon. Friend knows, the energy companies buy much of their gas, the price of which feeds into electricity prices, on the forward market. The energy chief executives tell us that that operates about six months ahead, so the prices that we are paying this winter tend to be based on the ones that they paid a few months ago. Changes, therefore, take time to feed through. That is a problem for us, but when he asks whether we are determined to do everything we can to ensure that we get energy prices down to a fair level, the straight answer is yes, we will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="81216-0016.htm_para0"><a name="08121682000100">We will ensure, too, that Ofgem does everything it can. This has been a hard year for householders and businesses, with price rises and dramatic fluctuations in energy costs. Earlier in 2008, there were dramatic price rises in oil, gas and electricity, and more recently, some of the wholesale prices have fallen, and oil prices have fallen from $147 a barrel to about $40 a barrel&#151;it varies. Petrol and diesel prices have now fallen below &#163;1 a litre in most places. This Friday in London, energy Ministers will meet to discuss the oil market and how to stabilise prices and improve transparency, and I was fascinated to hear what my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire had to say. He raised some interesting points about the commodity market, and I would like to look at those in more detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="81216-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08121682000101">I mentioned prices falling, but that cannot be said yet about electricity and gas retail prices. Wholesale prices have fallen, but as I said, it is the forward price that is important. That is starting to go down, and I have met the chief executives and most of the main energy companies in the last week and clearly told them that we want them to bring down prices as soon as possible. They were able to give notice of price rises, and we want some notice of when they are going to bring down prices. We want a greater degree of transparency in the wholesale market because it feeds into the retail market. The pre-Budget report asks Ofgem to provide quarterly reports showing the relationship between wholesale, hedged-wholesale and average retail prices. That will make it clearer whether companies are passing on the benefits of downward price changes or not. It is important that falling wholesale prices are passed on to retail customers, particularly when they are under so many financial pressures.</p>

agreed basis for the licensed system of social tariffs, and others do not. Some of the energy companies did not have a social tariff, such as Scottish Power last year. The energy companies adopt different policies. I am anxious to ensure that we bring about a more sensible regime on social tariffs, because at the moment it is difficult for those on low incomes to work out who is the best person to go to. People claim to have large discounts, but as the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) rightly said, some of those with the apparently biggest social tariffs charge the biggest prices. The deduction comes out of such prices and people end up paying more. It is a very complex matter. We have to ensure, however, that the energy companies are not making false profits and that they are not ripping off the consumer, and we intend to do so.</p>

If it had not before, it will as a result of the debate. I understand it, and I want to ensure that confidence in Ofgem is resumed. It has recently announced that it wants to eradicate unreasonable premiums, and that it will change some of the licensing rules to prevent such premiums from recurring. It has given companies until February to respond on licence changes, and to implement some of the changes in full. It tells us that there have already been &#163;300 million of reductions in prices for consumers, and that a further &#163;200 million need to be made by February.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="81216-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08121682000108">Legislation does not happen overnight in this place, but we are preparing to legislate should we need to do so. A referral to the Competition Commission, as suggested by the Conservatives, is an option, but it would involve a lengthy wait. CC reports can take 12 months to two years, so that would not help customers by February. It is a slow-lane response and it is not a sensible approach at present. Let us see if we can get this done; let us see if we can get some action from the energy companies and make sure that Ofgem keeps the pressure on them&#151;with the hobnailed boots that Alistair Buchanan talked about on the radio this morning. We want to get this done without referring the matter to the CC, which may take two years. Ofgem has clearly said that it wants all these changes to be in place by February and we want that, too. Ofgem wants to get these reasonable results by February, but it also wants to sort out some of the licensing conditions and I want to be very clear on this: we will legislate if Ofgem does not get the changes it needs through.</p>

For example, for average annual usage of electricity and gas, the highest annual dual use bill is &#163;1,240 from British Gas and the lowest appears to be EDF Energy at  <br>

&#163;1,168. On premiums paid for prepayment meters, British Gas came out the highest again at &#163;158 and EDF was again the lowest at &#163;78.80. On premiums above the cost for dual use on direct debit, customers paying by standard credit&#151;those whom some people, including the Select Committee Chairman, the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), have indicated are a major issue&#151;are likely to be paying more by between &#163;109 with Scottish Power and &#163;27 with E.ON. These are significant premiums and I want to be sure that they are justifiable. At present I am not entirely sure that they are; Ofgem seems to some extent to be sure, but I want to be sure that we are also happy with the figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="81216-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08121682000110">There are different ways of cutting these figures, and as there is competition they change regularly. When Members look at them, they will be comparing prices as of this week, and in many cases the sums are lower than they were some weeks ago when premiums were higher. However, although some of the companies have changed their prices in the past few weeks, Ofgem is still looking at them to ascertain if they are justifiable. The main justification for the expense of prepayment meters has been that they must be checked regularly. That was certainly true in the past when they were mostly coin meters, but nowadays they are often prepayment cards and the customer pays in advance, which brings a benefit to the company. Although Ofgem seems to some extent to be content with this, I am not convinced. Having seen today&#146;s Ofgem announcement, I want to drill down further into the justification for such a premium, which often falls on low-income people, and I have asked officials in the Department and Ofgem to look at this as a matter of urgency.</p>

We want to ensure that direct debit payments are looked at properly. I have some concerns and I have raised them with the chairman of each of the companies I have met. I have said I want them to justify some of the changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="81216-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08121682000112">In terms of our keeping the lights on, there is another energy gap&#151;that which is in Opposition policy. I will not go into that now; we can leave for another day discussion of their failure to support the renewables obligation, and their opposition to coal-fired power stations, planning legislation and a number of international initiatives. Before they start criticising us for an energy gap, let me say that as far as we are concerned there are 10 GW of consents in process and 7.5 GW in planning. Even if the energy crunch does create some delays&#151;we are looking at this with concern and I say to the Select Committee Chairman that since I gave evidence we have had some indications from some chairmen that a tightness is now developing in the market&#151;we believe that there will continue to be investment. We are getting reassurances from the chairmen on that, too.</p>

I can go through some of the figures, but I am conscious of the time: 4.4 billion cu m existing; 1 billion cu m in construction; 3.3 billion cu m with planning consent; 1 billion cu m awaiting planning consent; and 12 billion cu m proposed, but planning not yet applied for. We therefore have quite a lot of interest in developing our gas storage.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. In the past 30 minutes the Metropolitan police have issued a statement as a result of their receiving the report of the Chief Constable of the British Transport police into the matter relating to the hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green). However, I have tried to get hold of a copy of the report, but they say they are not publishing it. I then asked for a copy of their statement to be e-mailed to me, and by the time I came to the Chamber that had still not been forthcoming. Clearly, it is essential to Members that we have at least a copy of their statement, bearing in mind the clock is ticking and the recess is approaching, so time is short for Mr. Speaker to consider applications or submissions on whether this is a matter of privilege. Between now and 10 o&#146;clock would it be possible for the Speaker&#146;s Office or the Clerk, perhaps, to use their good offices of leverage on the Metropolitan police to cede two things, the first of which is that there is available in the Vote Office or on the internet a copy of the Metropolitan police statement that is being issued to journalists as we speak? We need to have this tonight, not tomorrow. It is a matter of discourtesy that it is not being made available. I ask if there is any way in which you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, can help in this matter because we should have it available now.</p>

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I, too, am aware of the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman has just raised. At 7.45 pm I wrote to the Speaker because I believe this matter pertains to the privileges of this House, and the complaint I have issued in respect of the matter concerning my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Damian Green) is a matter of privilege. I, too, endorse the idea that we should ask for and/or demand a copy of this report forthwith and that it should be placed in the Library, and I have been asking the Library&#151;as has the hon. Gentleman&#151;for the last half hour to make provision for it to be supplied in the Vote Office or the Library.

 It might be helpful if I give some background to the report that we are now going to debate&#151;sadly for somewhat less than two hours, as a result of the Government statements this afternoon. The Select Committee on Health published its fifth report of 2007-08, on dental services, on 2 July. We took evidence from a range of witnesses, including dentist campaign groups, primary care trusts, commissioners of dental services, public dental health experts, the British Dental Association, the Dental Practitioners Association and the British Orthodontic Society, as well as patient groups and practising dentists. The Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Ann Keen), who sits on the Front Bench tonight, also gave evidence, as did the chief dental officer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="81216-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08121682000122">One of the Committee&#146;s findings was that the nation&#146;s oral health has improved significantly since the establishment of the national health service general dental service or GDS in 1948. That is not surprising, given that most other things in society have improved since then. As recently as 1968, the proportion of the adult population in England and Wales who were edentate was 37 per cent. The latest figure is estimated to be about 6 per cent, so there has clearly been a massive improvement in dental health in recent years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="81216-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08121682000123">Nevertheless, by the 1990s there was a powerful case for reform of the GDS contract. It was widely agreed that although the provision of NHS dentistry was good in some areas of the country, overall it was patchy. Moreover, the payment system lacked sufficient incentives for the provision of preventive care and advice. In addition, the Department argued that there were too many incentives to provide complex treatments. In April 2006, the Department reformed the GDS contract, making a number of far-reaching changes: primary care trusts were given the power to commission dental services; the patient charging system was simplified; and under the terms of a new dental contact, dentists were remunerated according to the number of units of dental activity&#151;UDAs&#151;completed. The Department issued a number of criteria for success: patient experience; clinical quality; NHS commissioning and improving dentists&#146; working lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="81216-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08121682000124">Our inquiry found evidence that the new contract had failed to meet the Department&#146;s criteria for success in a number of areas. However, the Committee argued that with more good will from dentists and the Department,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="16 Dec 2008">

<notus-date day="16" month="12" year="2008" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>16 Dec 2008 : Column 1041</b><br>
the contract could be made to work. The Committee&#146;s main findings were that access to NHS dentistry was not as good as it was said to be, and that the total number of dentists working for the NHS and the number of treatments they provided had fallen slightly since 2006. There are many reasons why dentists moved away from the NHS, one of which was the income available in our society now. This move happened in the parts of the United Kingdom&#151;it certainly happened in England&#151;where one would have thought that there were bigger incomes and more better-off people compared with other parts. In such areas, dentists on some occasions moved wholly into the private sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="81216-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08121682000125">The total number of patients seen by NHS dentists fell by some 900,000 between December 2005 and December 2007. The latest figures for the period from April 2006 to April 2008 show a decline of some 1 million in the number of patients seen. It is possible that patients have good dental health, so it is not necessary for them to be seen. I know that call-backs for people with good dental health are few and far between compared with a few years ago, when there were regular call-backs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="81216-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08121682000126">The Committee also found that PCTs had performed patchily in how they commission services. For example, whereas in some areas, such as London, access was good, in others, such as Devon and Kent, it remained difficult for patients to find an NHS dentist.</p>

<p><a name="st_o297"><a name="08121682000127"><a name="81216-0016.htm_spnew9"><a name="08121682000235"><b>Mr. Oliver Letwin (West Dorset) (Con):</b>
 My constituency borders Devon, and I must report to the right hon. Gentleman that we find exactly the problem that he is describing: a shortage in the availability of NHS dentists. Does he agree that, in many cases, even if the area is relatively well off, there will be people within it who are not and who are suffering?</p>

<p><a name="st_o298"><a name="08121682000128"><a name="81216-0016.htm_spnew10"><a name="08121682000236"><b>Mr. Barron:</b>
 That is true. We took evidence, which was more than anecdotal, suggesting that some dentists who wanted to move into the private sector were saying to people, &#147;We will take your children as NHS patients, but only as long as you take out private insurance on your cover.&#148; Hon. Members will see what our report said about that, but I must say that not many people defended that practice&#151;I include the professional organisations in that comment. However, unfortunately the practice still goes on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="81216-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08121682000129">In addition, the Committee found that strategic health authorities were poor at managing PCTs and gave a dentistry a low priority. We also found that the number of complex treatments, such as extractions and root canal work, has fallen under the new contract by 50 per cent. That was seen to be a consequence of the contract not providing dentists with sufficient incentives to carry out this type of work. That is one of the areas about which we were concerned. I have some views about it, given what the Department has announced in the past few days that it will do to address the situation, as we hope it will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="81216-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08121682000130">The Committee found that the new dental contract had also failed to provide dentists with sufficient financial incentives to provide preventive advice, and that the system by which dentists are paid according to the amount of UDAs delivered should be changed.

in parts&#151;although not all&#151;of general practitioner practice. In those areas, people who have long-term conditions are being managed on the basis that GPs are providing such treatment. We believe that this is something that should be looked at.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="81216-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08121682000131">The Government&#146;s response to our report was published in October 2008. It accepted some of the Committee&#146;s criticisms, but maintained that the access to NHS dental services would improve over time. The Government response stated that although access was uneven, it was improving and would improve further once the contract had bedded in, and that the Department would investigate whether the number of complex treatments had fallen. The evidence was a bit more than anecdotal. We need to consider issues such as what happens if someone loses one tooth. Although a better way of proceeding would be to put in a crown or something substantial, under the new system dentists could just put in a palate with one tooth on it. That would suffice to get the UDA, and thus the income, into the practice. When we heard such information, we had grave worries about whether the issue of quality was being addressed at all in many senses.</p>

 Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that because most dentists are professionals, they will try to do the right thing and provide a quality service? Does he also accept that a system in which an extraction is funded in the same way as complex root canal work, which can take many sessions to carry out properly, is extremely difficult and heavy on consumables, is unlikely to encourage dentists to aspire to quality dentistry, but far more likely to encourage them to do the bare minimum, which is not conducive to good oral health or dentition?</p>

That is one of the great difficulties, because the new contract wanted to improve access to NHS dentistry services, but it also had to ensure that we did not lose any more dentists to the private sector. We found that the funding for the activity in question was historically based where NHS activity had been high&#151;and quite right, too. My constituency and the surrounding area are well served, and I would not want to see that diminish. That may sound selfish, but in other parts of the country dentists have walked away from the NHS and we have an obligation to look after the interests not only of the population, but of the dentists who did not walk away but continued to provide a service under the NHS banner.</p>

 In my constituency dentists walked away from the NHS. The right hon. Gentleman will welcome the 11 per cent. increase that the Government have put in, but can we be confident that the new formula will distribute that money on the basis of unmet need on this occasion? The key problem with the contract was that the basis of allocation by the PCTs was a historic and restricted view of previous spending.</p>

 That is precisely the area in which the Government agreed with the Committee. The contract had to be historic, because we had to defend existing NHS dentistry. The question whether that funding was based on the needs of the population is one of the most difficult when it comes to expenditure on the NHS&#151;I have in mind the debate on improving primary health care. The question is where the disease burdens lie, and answering it is still a problem.</p>

 It appeared to me from the evidence that we received that dentists did not walk away, but reluctantly left the NHS. They felt that they were forced to leave the NHS because of the contracts.</p>

 That is not my reading of the situation. Dentists walked away in areas of greater income. We also heard about offers to keep children on as NHS patients provided that the parents took up private insurance. I thought that that was wrong, and the Committee commented on it, but it was part of the same problem. Money gives people the option to make different decisions. My personal view is that in some parts of the country&#151;even in south Yorkshire&#151;dentists decided to walk away from the NHS because they felt that enough people had enough income to sustain private insurance.</p>

 My right hon. Friend describes the situation in my constituency. In the south, we have nothing but NHS dentists. They make the contract work, they think that the rewards are perfectly satisfactory and they are great supporters of the NHS. In the town of Stroud and its immediate environs, almost all the dentists are now private. In effect, there are two systems and it is as if the Berlin wall exists between them. Occasionally, people can cross over into the other system, but private dentists do not seem to want to come back into the NHS. If there is a magic bullet that will change that, I hope that someone will tell me, because I would love to get them back.</p>

 I am very grateful. The right hon. Gentleman argues that it is mostly in wealthier areas that dentists are leaving the NHS, but in rural Norfolk, where we have a low-wage economy, 20 per cent. of dentists left the NHS on the introduction of the new contract. Does he agree that in surveys dentists have expressed overwhelmingly negative views about the contract? The contract as a whole, and the bureaucracy involved, has driven many dentists away, as they believe that they can make an income in the private sector.</p>

 I would not disagree with that point, but over the past 15 years or more improvement in services in the NHS&#151;be it in dentistry, GP care or hospitals&#151;has been most successful if the professions have had ownership of it. In 1992, when the first new dentistry contract was introduced, large parts of the profession walked away from it and there were divisions in the representative bodies. It is my personal view&#151;it is not articulated in this way in the report&#151;that the new contract, like the 1992 contract, isolated the profession, to the disservice of dentistry in this country. When I said that at the press conference to launch the report, there were nods from some of the representatives of the dentistry profession, although in the press the next day they were reported as attacking the new contract and saying that it was all wrong. However, that is life, and we have all been there.</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes the important point that many dentists walked away from the NHS long before the 2006 contract was introduced. Many towns were NHS-dentist deserts for many years because the PCT had no way of ensuring that NHS dentistry was provided. The dentists could decide, on their own whim, how much NHS work they did and how much private work.</p>

 I agree. I do not think for one minute that the lack of NHS dentistry is just to do with the new contract. It was happening for many years before that, and in my personal view the lack of professional leadership was one of the main issues. Dentists were not engaged in the process. When we considered NHS charges, I asked a representative of one of the professional bodies what effect the new contract had had, and I cannot remember the exact response but it was along the lines of &#147;We pass comment on it from time to time.&#148; That is not the type of engagement that was envisaged. It is a great pity that we have lost professional leadership at that level, in terms of negotiating contracts for dentistry inside the NHS.</p>

 The professional bodies can defend themselves, but one of the reasons for that response is that they felt that the decision was imposed on them. It was not piloted, and the evidence from the previous pilots were ignored. If it had not been imposed on them, they might have stayed around the table to discuss a better contract, but it was imposed without their agreement.</p>

 Yes, but it was also imposed because they were not engaged in the process. In all the subsequent contracts, such as the hospital doctor contracts or the GP contracts, we have seen what some would call good trade union leadership in the negotiations. I would call it good trade union leadership&#151;it is what I used to do before I came here as a politician&#151;and my reaction is &#147;Well done.&#148; That is what people should do from that side of the table. There has been a lack of such leadership in dentistry, not just in the 2006 contract but for a substantial number of years before that, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="81216-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08121682000153">The Department also said that it would reconsider the unit of dental activity payment system to see whether it could also include quality of treatment. It did not rule out our suggestion of a quality and outcomes framework for style indicators in dentistry. Members will know that an announcement was made about that last Friday. The chief executive of the NHS was giving evidence to the Health Committee on Thursday morning and we asked him a question about dentistry. He replied, &#147;Oh, we are about to make an announcement.&#148; I said, &#147;Great, you normally make an announcement before you come to give evidence to us or before a debate.&#148; To be fair to my hon. Friend the Minister, the Government said in their response to our recommendation 41 that they would review NHS dentistry. Indeed, on 11 December the Secretary of State announced a change to the Department&#146;s line that the reforms to the contract were working and that over time they would deliver improved access. Those are my words, not those of the Department, but I think that there has been a slight change of thinking. The Secretary of State acknowledged that access to NHS dentists remained a problem in many areas of the country and announced the review of the dental contract, which was already contained in the Government&#146;s response to the Committee in October.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="81216-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08121682000154">The review will be led by Professor Jimmy Steele, who chairs oral health services research at the school of dental sciences in Newcastle. I alluded earlier to the people at our press conference. One of them, Susie Sanderson, who is the executive board chairman of the British Dental Association and who gave evidence to the Committee during our inquiry, said last week:</p>

 Yes, I would hope that it would. That was one of our major criticisms. It was said by my hon. Friend the Minister&#146;s predecessor that the new contract was about prevention. We tried hard to find out whether it was and my personal conclusion was that it was not. In this day and age of public health there are wider issues in relation to dental health and we believe that the contract did not place sufficient emphasis on prevention. Its importance should be recognised. In my view, the advice that health professionals give people should be measured and recognised.</p>

 It is probably fair to mention that the chief dental officer said that an element of preventive funding was included in the single UDA, but the evidence we took from dentists suggested that so much was included in the UDA that there simply was not time to do the preventive stuff as well as treating the patient.</p>

 The inclusion of more bands for the UDAs might be a way of addressing that problem. The smaller bands, which might not get as much money into the practice, would tackle that issue.</p>

having students on an outreach programme by negotiating more UDAs. If one measures UDAs according to how many patients are getting treatment and then finds that some are being used for student training purposes, the result will be that incorrect figures will be produced.

The High Green practice takes students from the dental school on six-week work placements, and I was told that it was normal for one dentist to have four students. The process takes time and, although the work involved is obviously not massively complicated, the students do spend time with the dentists who are training them. Inevitably, that slows down the amount of activity that takes place, but the same is true for trainee doctors and surgeons under close supervision in hospitals, where students are obviously not asked to carry out important work. When I spoke to the commissioners, they&#151;not the dentists concerned&#151;said, &#147;Things are still the same.&#148; They said that they were looking into negotiating UDAs, so that they could reward the practice for giving vocational training to students from Sheffield university&#146;s school of clinical dentistry.</p>

I am an NHS patient there. As I said to the chief dental officer, next door to the dentist&#146;s surgery there is a pharmacy, and next door to that is a doctor&#146;s surgery, run by four or five partners. That doctor&#146;s surgery gets capital allowances, and does not have to negotiate in the way that dentists do. It is a lot more engaged in building up NHS work than dentists are. I understand that dentists can move away from the NHS; we have heard evidence of that. However, there is something wrong if the only way in which income can go into an NHS practice is through UDAs, or what we had before them. That is how I understand the situation; my hon. Friend the Minister may know something different. Dentists do not have the type of capitation fees, or whatever we call them, that are in place in general practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para4"><a name="08121688000007">I want briefly to highlight some of the failings of the contract that the Health Committee identified, and to refer to the principles that should be applied when we review how the contract works and come up with a better way forward. First, as was highlighted by the Select Committee, the contract was imposed without being trialled. Rather like the Medical Training Application Service&#151;the basis for recruiting junior doctors to specialties&#151;the contracts were imposed by the Government. The right hon. Member for Rother Valley was absolutely right to suggest that we need engagement and ownership by the professionals if we are to ensure that reforms to our health system work to the greatest effect. Without ownership&#151;and that is what happens if we impose a system&#151;the system is unlikely to work effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para5"><a name="08121688000008">Access, despite what the Minister continues to say, is worse: 1 million fewer adults and 200,000 fewer children have had access to NHS dentistry since the reforms   <br>

came into effect in April 2006. Before the reforms, the Government claimed that 2 million patients wanted access to NHS dentistry, but they could not get it. On the assumption that those 2 million remain, together with an extra 1.2 million people, there are now well over 3 million people, on the Government&#146;s own figures, who want access to NHS dentistry but who are not getting it. As the previous Prime Minister said, the purpose of the new contract was to provide &#147;access for all&#148; who wanted it to NHS dentistry, but it was also to get dentists off the treadmill. The right hon. Member for Rother Valley was absolutely right: the previous contract was not a success, either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para6"><a name="08121688000009">We heard an intervention from the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins), in which she made a fair point, and I am certainly not arguing for a return to a better yesterday&#151;the old contract failed miserably in many respects. The new contract, however, continues the failure on access.</p>

<p><a name="st_o326"><a name="08121688000010"><a name="81216-0018.htm_spnew2"><a name="08121688000106"><b>Dr. Murrison:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is right that the old contract had its faults&#151;most contracts do. However, does he recall the personal dental services pilots that worked quite well and showed great promise? The Government, however, decided to jettison them largely, I suspect, for political reasons. Does he not regret the fact that lessons were not learned from those pilots?</p>

<p><a name="st_o327"><a name="08121688000011"><a name="81216-0018.htm_spnew3"><a name="08121688000107"><b>Norman Lamb:</b>
 I absolutely agree. The failure to pilot schemes or to learn the lessons from pilots that have taken place is desperately frustrating. A system that was introduced without being trialled, in a big-bang approach across the country, was destined to fail. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the Government should have learned the lessons from those encouraging pilots, which were completely ignored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para7"><a name="08121688000012">The Government&#146;s second assertion when the new contract was introduced was that it would get dentists off the treadmill. However, it appears to have reinforced the treadmill that many dentists believe they are on. We have heard that there is a disincentive to do complex work leading, dentists have told me, to a loss of skills. If they do not do that complex work, they become less skilled, which is worrying. There has been a 45 per cent. fall in root-canal work since 2004 and, to confirm the point that I made in an intervention on the right hon. Member for Rother Valley, the number of extractions has risen in the same period.</p>

<p><a name="st_o328"><a name="08121688000013"><a name="81216-0018.htm_spnew4"><a name="08121688000108"><b>Charlotte Atkins:</b>
 Further to the matter that I raised earlier, does the hon. Gentleman accept that the trend for a reduction in complex treatments kicked in before the new contract was introduced in April 2006? It was something that had already been identified as a problem. I should like to establish why that happened, as I do not think that it is automatically clear.</p>

<p><a name="st_o329"><a name="08121688000014"><a name="81216-0018.htm_spnew5"><a name="08121688000109"><b>Norman Lamb:</b>
 That may well be the case, but there is no doubt at all&#151;and I think that the Health Committee report confirms this&#151;that the new contract provides a disincentive to do that work, and the trend has continued with a vengeance since its introduction. In its conclusions, the Select Committee highlighted its concerns, particularly with regard to the loss of complex work, about the quality of dental care that patients who rely on the NHS receive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para8"><a name="08121688000015">There is a related problem: if someone is referred by their usual dentist&#151;in the past, that work would have been done by that dentist&#151;they have to wait again, perhaps in considerable pain. The Select Committee recognised that that was an unsatisfactory situation and that, more often than not, it is appropriate for the work to be done by someone&#146;s own dentist. The point has been made repeatedly, both in the debate and beforehand, that there is no proper incentive for dentists to do preventive work, and the system does not emphasise quality. As I pointed out in an intervention, it is massively unpopular with dentists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para9"><a name="08121688000016">UDAs are a sort of straitjacket that has been imposed on the profession. There is a great deal of evidence of dentists running out of UDAs before the end of the year, so they are left with no paid work to do under the NHS. If ever there was an incentive for someone to leave a system that imposes such a straitjacket, surely that is it. Even worse, dentists who do not reach their UDA target, perhaps because it has been calculated incorrectly, end up having to repay money that has already been paid to them. I have a dedicated NHS dentist in my area who gave up in disgust after he was required to repay a substantial sum because he had not met his target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08121688000017">There is clear evidence of a shortage of orthodontic work, leading to long delays in many parts of the country. A further problem is poor quality commissioning. There is accumulating evidence that primary care trusts are not taking advantage of the powers that they have and using those powers to good effect. By not carrying out dental health needs assessments for their areas, they are commissioning not on the basis of need, but on the basis of where dentists happen, by historical accident, to be. In Norfolk dentists have been allocated additional UDAs for the rest of the financial year, but they are reluctant to invest in new facilities and in bringing in extra dentists if they have no guarantee that that will continue, so the UDAs go unused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08121688000018">There is, however, some evidence of good quality commissioning taking place in some parts of the country. I refer in particular to the Heart of Birmingham PCT. I heard an extremely interesting presentation from Ros Hamburger, the public dental health specialist there. In that primary care trust, the contract has been manipulated to reduce reliance on the UDA for the payment of dentists. Instead, payments are based on quality thresholds and preventive work, adjusting the contract in a constructive and positive way. Time will tell whether it works and whether that lesson can be learned elsewhere, but it is right to point to the fact that good things are going on in some parts of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08121688000019">Concern has been expressed about the allocation of funding around the country and the importance of moving to a needs-based system for the allocation of funds. Many dentists are expected to leave in 2009. That is the expectation in the profession, and I suspect that that fear is driving the Government to get on with the review announced last week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08121688000020">All that leads me to ask whether that rather Soviet-style commissioning of care, rationed from the centre by an unelected quango, can ever work effectively. It clearly turns dentists off. Too often, they are left frustrated. The Minister shakes her head, but if she talks to dentists, she will find that that is what they say. They are left frustrated by slow, inefficient responses from the primary  <br>

care trust. As we know, the PCTs have failed to identify where the need is and to allocate UDAs accordingly. The system is not working and the temptation for dentists all too often, not just because of the money, is to escape to a simpler life where they are their own bosses and where they do not have to deal with such a bureaucratic system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para14"><a name="08121688000021">As the Select Committee also recognised, there is a need for fundamental reform&#151;the Chairman referred to it as a fundamental or comprehensive review&#151;of how the system operates.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is nodding from a sedentary position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para15"><a name="08121688000024">What principles should apply in shaping that reform? First, a set amount of public money is available for dental care, and I suspect that no political party in the Chamber will advocate at the next election a massive increase in that amount. The challenge is to maximise the effectiveness of the money available for NHS dental care so that it improves the nation&#146;s dental health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para16"><a name="08121688000025">I turn to the second principle. I am sure that we all agree that the objective is to achieve access to high-quality dental care for all. Some people achieve that access by paying for it. Ten years ago, our dentist announced that he was going private. We wanted to stay with him, so we reluctantly ended up on a Denplan scheme. I do not like paying it, but I get used to it and ultimately can afford it. Our concern should be for those who cannot. The right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) said that there is a real problem with low-income people in areas that are generally affluent; they often find that they have hopeless access to NHS care. In rural Norfolk, which is not a particularly affluent area, there is certainly poor access. Our focus should be on those who cannot afford to go private. We must ensure that they get access to high-quality dental care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08121688000026">The third principle is that we must focus on children&#146;s dental health, because if we get it right during childhood, the chances are that a substantial amount of work will be avoided later in life. Advances such as the use of fluoride in toothpaste and, in some areas, the fluoridisation of water, have had a significant effect in improving dental health. The fourth principle is that&#151;please&#151;we should involve the profession in shaping any reform. If we fail to do that, the reform will not work. We should trial any reform first and we should not go for a big-bang introduction, because that will end in tears.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para18"><a name="08121688000027">Despite the Minister&#146;s denials today, the Government appear tacitly to have accepted that the contract is not working as intended. The clear conclusion of the Select Committee is that the contract has not achieved the objectives set at the start. Now there is the opportunity to get it right, and it is important that we do so because many people on low incomes in our country are not getting access to high-quality dental care. We must focus our attention on them.</p>

much neglected area of UK health care. Perhaps that is because people do not generally die from dental decay, although a meeting of the British Dental Association panel the other day showed some alarming results for oral cancer and how dentists can save lives by ensuring that oral cancer is picked up early and treated effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para19"><a name="08121688000029">Dental decay is not a death sentence, so it is not regarded as a top priority, certainly among many primary care trusts. However, we ignore dental health at our peril. Oral health is integral to general health. In 2003, the World Health Organisation&#146;s &#147;World Oral Health&#148; report stated:</p>
<a name="81216-0018.htm_brev3"><a name="08121688000097"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The interrelationship between oral health and general health is particularly pronounced among older people. Poor oral health can increase the risks to general health and, with compromised chewing and eating abilities, affect nutritional intake.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para20"><a name="08121688000030">However, good oral health is a major issue not only for older people but for a range of people of all ages. It is particularly a problem for people from deprived backgrounds in terms of pain control, discomfort, and general self-esteem. Having decayed teeth makes a huge difference to the confidence of young and middle-aged people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para21"><a name="08121688000031">Before the new NHS payments system was introduced in April 2006, there was significant confusion and fear about the burden of dental costs, with up to 400 different charges possible and a maximum payment of some &#163;389. The new system has simplified that charging mechanism to three charging bands, with maximum payments almost halved to &#163;198.</p>

 I have not seen the figures to prove that, but there are certainly issues with the three bands, and there are perverse incentives for people to store up dental health problems. The Select Committee on Health, of which I am a member, rightly identified some of those problems. The three bands have not been developed well and they need to be looked at again. Simplification of the charging system is vital because someone on a low income needs to know that if they go to a dentist, they can pay the bill. There was also a lot of confusion over whether people were paying for private or NHS treatment. People must be clear about what they are paying for so that they are not encouraged to take up private treatment when they cannot afford it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="81216-0018.htm_para22"><a name="08121688000034">I am also pleased that the legacy of the old system whereby dentists provided NHS treatment to young people under 18 only if they treated their parents under a Denplan or other private care scheme has largely gone. It cannot be right to coerce parents to register as private patients as the only way of ensuring that their children get NHS treatment. The Chairman of the Committee rightly pointed out that our witnesses were clear about the fact that that should not be accepted. I understand that the chief dental officer has made it clear that children-only contracts with dentists have no long-term future in terms of PCT commissioning, but some PCTs have maintained them because they are concerned about the shortfall in treatment for children.</p>

 My argument is that it is right to have dentists choosing either private or NHS care. I was very concerned about the case of a constituent who had been in a contract whereby she and her husband were on a Denplan deal, and their children were being treated under the NHS. Through the new PCT commissioning arrangements, the local dentist had said, &#147;Actually your children now have to be under Denplan.&#148; They reluctantly agreed to that and were amazed when, after one of the children had a filling, they were charged &#163;50 on top of the Denplan rates for it. They were absolutely flabbergasted, because they had assumed that the children would be covered in full for all their treatment, but they were not.</p>

 My point is that the Government&#146;s priority must be to ensure that everyone who wants it should have access to NHS dentistry. I therefore very much welcome the independent review of NHS dentistry that the Health Secretary announced last week and look forward to the results of the study that is due to be published next spring.</p>

We need to learn from areas where good practice has become embedded. Ten years ago, I worked closely with the dental department of North Staffordshire hospital to encourage forward-looking dentists to relocate to north Staffordshire. I was delighted to welcome Jonathan Webb to Leek, where, after quite a struggle, he opened a new NHS dental surgery in Regent street. I was also delighted to perform the opening ceremony and to sign up as his first NHS patient.</p>

His practice, which is called TLC 4 Smiles, has relocated in Leek and now includes eight surgeries, four full-time dentists, one part-time dentist and three full-time hygienists and therapists. The practice is 96 per cent. NHS, with just a small amount of private cosmetic work.</p>

not fully equip them for the different culture and tasks that they face in the UK. It is not that they are not properly qualified; it is that things are a bit different in the UK. Mr. Webb needed to put in extra work with those dentists, but the new contract did not compensate him for his efforts&#151;efforts that PCTs should recognise as essential to ensuring that dentists are delivering high-quality dental care in an NHS service that is of the appropriate standard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08121688000043">In October this year&#151;some 10 years on&#151;in Biddulph, on the other side of my constituency, I was delighted to perform yet another official opening ceremony of an NHS dental surgery. It took me three years to persuade my local primary care trust of the urgent need for such a surgery, because it did not figure as a high priority for the PCT. I believe that that is a problem countrywide. Once it was established that the need was there, however, the PCT was very supportive of the dentists, Mr. and Mrs. Keen&#151;who, as far as I know, are not related to the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Ann Keen).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para2"><a name="08121688000044">The PCT helped to secure the right building for Mr. and Mrs. Keen&#151;just behind the high street&#151;and the right contract, so that Biddulph people, who had been denied access to NHS dentistry for so long, would be prioritised as patients in that surgery. We avoided the long queues around the block by directing applications through the PCT, but that has not halted the expansion of the practice. Although it has been open for just three months, it is already recruiting an additional dentist, and has the capacity to develop three more surgeries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para3"><a name="08121688000045">This is a young dental team who have enthusiastically embraced NHS dentistry and have the passion that will allow them to take on the challenge of huge inequalities in oral health in the town of Biddulph, which is an old mining town. That is not to say, however, that there are not significant issues relating to the NHS dental contract that must be addressed. It is widely recognised that PCTs are not renowned for their commissioning skills. In general, they seem to lack the necessary analytical and planning skills to carry out that role effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para4"><a name="08121688000046">With the commissioning of dentistry coming at a time of PCT mergers, dentistry clearly did not receive the priority that it deserved. As a result, access to NHS dentistry has deteriorated rather than improving with the new contract. But at least, through the GDS contract, we can now address the uneven and inequitable distribution of NHS general dental services. In the past, there was no mechanism to allow that. The people of Biddulph either had to travel out of the town, or had to sign up for private dental treatment through Denplan. Most of them&#151;unlike the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)&#151;could not afford that. They were at the mercy of the decisions made by their local dental practitioners, who could decide for themselves how much NHS and how much private treatment they provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para5"><a name="08121688000047">That all changed when the PCT awarded the NHS contract to Mr. and Mrs. Keen. Not surprisingly, many Biddulph people are choosing to move to NHS treatment in their state-of-the-art surgery, because they are now empowered to do so. I am pleased that the Department of Health is belatedly offering a programme of work to PCTs to encourage them to commission more effectively, and is reviewing its dental public health work force so that it has the skills to assess the need for better NHS facilities. That should help PCTs to get their act together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para6"><a name="08121688000048">As for the NHS dental contract itself, there is a real need for a review of aspects of the reforms. It should be established, for instance, whether the units of dental activity so hated by dentists can allow a proper focus on preventive care and cosmetic treatment. Now that the dental health of our young people is so much better, there is clearly much less need for the drill-and-fill approach. They demand much better cosmetic and orthodontic treatment, and we should focus on that. We must also look again at the payment bands to ensure that patients are not encouraged to delay visits to their dentists and store up dental problems in order to save money under the new charging system. We must ensure that the UDA system is used flexibly enough to allow dentists to get off the drill-and-fill treadmill and to address the wider public health agenda. That is what primary care trusts were set up to do, and they must do it in the area of dentistry as well as in other areas of public health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para7"><a name="08121688000049">PCTs must make more use of specialists and consultants in dental public health and carry out more effective oral health needs assessments. They must work more closely with their dentists to ensure that they are addressing the real oral health needs of their populations. They have to address the other health needs of their populations; why are they not doing it in relation to oral health? And where are the strategic health authorities in all this? They seem to have completely reneged on their responsibility to manage the dentistry performance of PCTs. The Department of Health needs to investigate with the profession whether the quality and outcomes framework-style system that GPs have would help to improve the dental health of patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para8"><a name="08121688000050">I welcome the closer working relationship that appears to be emerging between the Department and dentists. I also welcome the top priority that the Government are giving to improving access to dentistry, the increased &#163;2 billion funding for dentistry and the announcement of further action in the new year to improve access. I am sure that the Committee will look carefully at those new measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para9"><a name="08121688000051">I want to finish by thanking the Health Secretary for the &#163;14 million a year for local health authorities to support fluoridation schemes in areas of poor dental health. That is the single most effective measure to reduce oral health inequalities, and this provision demonstrates that we have a Government who are committed to doing that. I would also like to congratulate the South Central strategic health authority on being the first SHA to undertake a fluoridation consultation under the Water Act 2003. I wish it every success in its initiative, and I hope that the Government will give it all the support that it needs. Dental health in the United Kingdom is improving, but far more needs to be done through fluoridation and through working with the profession to ensure that we make the best of the health professionals working in dentistry.</p>

 I am interested that the hon. Lady mentioned fluoridation. Is she aware that most of the evidence that shows that there is a case for fluoride relates to its use in a topical sense, and that the evidence base for adding fluoride to the water supply is very limited? Some countries have actually removed fluoride from the water. I think that her enthusiasm is slightly misplaced, because the improvements in dental health in areas where fluoride has been added to the water have not been as great as had been expected.</p>

 That is absolute rubbish, I am afraid. That is not the case at all.

 I am going to try to rush through my speech, and to add to, rather than repeat, the points that have already been made. In his introduction, the Chairman of the Committee said that there were three drivers or criteria in the original contract and that, from the point of view of the dental patient and of the profession, it had certainly failed. We do not have a more preventive approach now, dentists are on a treadmill as they have never been before, and there has been a transformation, in that many dentists have moved out and many thousands more wish to do so. We really need to find a system that will encourage many of those dentists who have gone totally private to come back, at least in part. The difficulty with that, of course, is the treadmill I mentioned and the avalanche hanging over every dentist with UDAs&#151;units of dental activity&#151;and the UDA contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para10"><a name="08121688000055">The difficulties of the UDA system&#151;for example, the issue of whether to do root canal treatments or extractions&#151;have already been touched on. A root canal on a molar tooth will take about 90 minutes, if the dentist is practised at it and if they use very expensive nickel-titanium reamers, which must be thrown away. In contrast, an extraction generally takes 15 minutes and the forceps are retained, which provides quite an incentive to the dentist, sadly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para11"><a name="08121688000056">What really worries me is that according to NHS information centres, in excess of 1.2 million people are no longer able to access the national health service. That applies to about a million adults and, even more appallingly, about 200,000 children. That has got to be overcome. The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) mentioned that it is anticipated that many dentists will leave next year. The only benefit of the credit crunch that I can see is that they might be tempted to stay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para12"><a name="08121688000057">Let me move on to two other issues: the development of dentistry and the patient, who has not really been mentioned so far. Over the last 10 or perhaps 12 years, there have been dramatic changes in dentistry, mostly positive and with most gains predominantly experienced in the western world, by which I mean the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, parts of Europe and to some degree in the UK, but outside the national health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para13"><a name="08121688000058">Mention was made of fluoridation, and I would like to re-emphasise the point made by the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) and to contradict the intervention from the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley). Fluoridation is heavy in many of the countries I mentioned. It has made a huge improvement to the diminution of dental decay and without the detrimental health side-effects that were predicted by a few and were proclaimed by scaremongering detractors. Let me take a few moments to explain more fully.</p>
<br>

<notus-date day="16" month="12" year="2008" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>16 Dec 2008 : Column 1057</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para14"><a name="08121688000059">When I was a kid in New Zealand, dental schools provided dental nurses to work in state schools&#151;New Zealand&#146;s schools are almost entirely state schools&#151;and there were three dental schools. With fluoride in 60, 70 or 80 per cent. of the country&#146;s water supplies, those dental schools have been diminished to one. There are more schools, more children and more teeth, but there is less work. Instead of having three dental schools, as I said, New Zealand now has one, and the girls who come out of it who go to treat the children spend 50 per cent. of their time teaching prevention and 50 per cent. on actual treatment. Only a sixth of the number of children need treatment now, yet the effect of fluoride in the water supply has a lesser effect on children than on adults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para15"><a name="08121688000060">Let me come back to the changes in dentistry. Progress on dental materials and techniques has been dramatic. Dentistry provides very successful implants, new composite fillings, new all-porcelain crowns, porcelain inlays, protective porcelain inlays/overlays and new materials for dentures, many of which can be and often are retained and stabilised by implants. There are beautiful, natural-looking veneers, protective overlay veneers, successful dental bleaching methods, dramatic new orthodontic techniques producing quite superb results and improved oral surgery techniques. Protection against cancer is also better if patients go to the dentist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para16"><a name="08121688000061">We need to recognise that dentists are taught all those techniques in dental schools, but they are not available on the national health. I do not think that they should all be available on the national health. NHS dentistry should be driven predominantly as a health service for oral conditions. I am sorry to disagree somewhat with the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands, but although cosmetics are vital, the NHS should have no role in paying for them, except in exceptional circumstances, which do arise. A young girl who comes in with stained upper and lower anterior teeth should have bleaching available to her on the national health service. As the system works now, however, she will get six or 12 veneers where the teeth are stripped down via a high-speed burr and damaged for ever. The bleaching, however, would leave her with her natural teeth and make a dramatic change. We need to think about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para17"><a name="08121688000062">One negative, which I touched on during Question Time earlier and which the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands also mentioned, is oral cancer. It is distressing to see that the incidence of oral cancer has got much worse. There are more deaths, and the cure and detection rates are diminishing. A large degree of that relates to the fact that patients are no longer being seen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para18"><a name="08121688000063">The chief dental officer was reported in the press as claiming that dentists were milking the system by asking patients to return for annual examinations. I hope that that is wrong, because the prevalence of oral cancer, particularly in deprived areas, means that it is vital that patients are seen and checked for that cancer regularly. I am referring to young people as well as those whom we normally expect to get cancer as they get on. Another point needs to be made: if a decayed molar, for example, needs to be restored, it can be restored by amalgam, composite, gold, porcelain bonded to gold or porcelain bonded to porcelain, but whatever is used, that is one less decayed tooth among the national population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para19"><a name="08121688000064">We need to work to a system that introduces the private sector working alongside the NHS. I am a great supporter of NHS dentistry. I spent a lot of my career, in the early days, working in east London. We need NHS dentistry, but we need the dentists to be there for it. Taking away the drive to force them out, which the UDA targets system has introduced, might give us the chance to persuade some of those dentists to come back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para20"><a name="08121688000065">I have a few more points to make. I hope that the Minister will think carefully when she looks at the new review. I shall cut out most of what I wanted to say and put a few basic points to her. We need to move on fluoridation. I have touched on that. Australia, New Zealand, Canada, a number of European countries and most of the states of the United States have dramatically better dental health than the UK, and that is entirely down to fluoride.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para21"><a name="08121688000066">May I suggest to the Minister that she needs to recognise a few basics? Patients need choice and they need that choice presented to them by well-trained dentists. The dentists need the appropriate equipment and materials. They need the time to produce quality work, including prevention, which the UDA targets system does not allow them. The measure of success should be the number of dentists prepared to offer core dental health treatment on the national health, not necessarily the number of people using the NHS, because that choice must be the patient&#146;s choice.</p>

 I am delighted to take part in the debate. My remarks will be brief, because they have to be brief. I do not want to have a coughing fit. Like most Members who are present, I wish to keep my sanity and my health for the Christmas period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para22"><a name="08121688000068">As always, it is a delight to follow the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford), who knows much more about dentistry than I could ever want to know about it. My impression of dentistry is one of a profession going through quite dramatic change&#151;structural change, changes to training and changes in how the profession is funded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para23"><a name="08121688000069">My views have been formed in two particular ways. First, I have two quite close friends who are former dentists and are horrified at some of the changes that have taken place in the profession. They see themselves as good, old-fashioned NHS dentists and not in their wildest imagination could they think that, once they had left the profession, it would go from being almost comprehensively NHS to being much more dependent on the private sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para24"><a name="08121688000070">My second point of impact was a meeting with dentists in the Stroud area some years ago. It is the only meeting that I have had with dentists collectively because it was such a shocking experience; it is seared on my memory. This meeting pre-empted the new contract, and virtually to a person, the dentists made it absolutely clear that whatever was in the new contract introduced by the Government, it would be the baseline, and that they would negotiate on top of it. They did not see the British Dental Association as representing them; they saw themselves, more or less, as private contractors in a marketplace who would charge whatever the patient would be prepared to spend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para25"><a name="08121688000071">That was a pretty depressing experience, because I went to the meeting to try to bring those people back into the NHS, and I learned very quickly that they were not very interested in coming back to the NHS, whatever was in the contract. This is why my constituency is so unusual, as I said when I intervened on my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) earlier. In the south of my constituency, all the dentists are NHS dentists. I have to explain to my constituents that if they live in the Stroud area, they ain&#146;t going to get an NHS dentist, but if they live in the south of the constituency, they will&#151;unless they choose to cross over. It is a bizarre situation, and it is just like having the Berlin wall. I wish we could overcome that problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para26"><a name="08121688000072">It is grossly unfair that those in the north of my constituency do not have access to NHS dentistry, and dentists who operate in the south, such as Steve Clarke, who runs a big training practice, are able to make money out of the NHS. He is supportive of the NHS, and provides quality care on the NHS. I know that because I send to his practice a lot of constituents who moan to me about not being able to access an NHS dentists. Something peculiar is going on, perhaps because of the wider changes in dentistry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para27"><a name="08121688000073">The problem with the PCT is that it measures access to NHS dentistry across my whole area, so the picture looks quite good. Of course, it depends which part of the area people live in, and those in the northern part of my constituency are strongly disadvantaged. I had that argument with the PCT, which is now putting resources into Cheltenham, Tewkesbury and the Forest of Dean, having previously put resources into Gloucester. I keep asking for resources to be put into Stroud, and it looks at the figures and says, &#147;You&#146;ve got a good number of NHS dentists in Stroud&#148;. However, that is the case only on a locational basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para28"><a name="08121688000074">I shall end on the issue of fairness and equity. I hope that the Government will consider that issue in the investigation that they have launched. I could go into all sorts of questions of fairness and equity with regard to orthodontistry, where those who seem to be in the right place at the right time get free treatment and other people do not. I also feel strongly about the question of what people get for what they pay. We have all dealt with difficult constituency issues where people have felt that they paid money when they were not sure what treatment they would receive. That is one of the problems of not underpinning dentistry more widely. I could speak about fluoridation, but I am clearly not among friends because I am a long-time opponent of fluoridation of the water supply, so I will say no more about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="81216-0019.htm_para29"><a name="08121688000075">In conclusion, I hope that there is a comprehensive investigation of dentistry in this country. I accept that we have not got it right, but that has been true for a long time, and we owe it to people in those deserts where there is no NHS treatment to provide greater fairness and equity. If this investigation can do that, it will have come not a second too early; too many people have lost out, and continue to lose out, which is completely unfair in this day and age.</p>

perhaps having three statements at the start of the day did not help. I know that the Chairman of the Select Committee raised that during a point of order earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="81216-0020.htm_para0"><a name="08121688000077">I shall try to touch on some of the points raised by hon. Members this evening, starting with the Chairman of the Select Committee. I was a very proud member of the Select Committee, and we heard earlier that there were calls for an inquiry into dentistry some time ago. I agree that there were such calls, and I praise Committee members for calling for that. I also praise the Committee for the quality of the recent report, which was very fair. It is scathing in places, but it also offers forward-thinking and innovative ideas on how the contract could be progressed. I do not agree with parts of the report, however, and Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition also have some ideas on how we could make progress, to which I will return shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="81216-0020.htm_para1"><a name="08121688000078">I was interested to hear the Chairman of the Select Committee, the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron), refer to his dentist earlier, because unless he is having treatment at the moment, he has not got a dentist as this contract does not involve registration. Therefore, unless someone is undergoing treatment, they do not have a dentist. I would have liked that to be made clear in the report; I do not think it is generally known by the public, but it is a fundamental point of the contract, which was imposed on dentists in 2006, that people are not registered unless they are actually having treatment. That is a very important issue, because if we were to go out on to the high streets of this country and ask members of the public who rely on NHS dentistry whether or not they are registered with a dentist, the vast majority would still say they were even though they are not. They might turn up at the dentist and say, &#147;I need treatment&#148;, but that dentist might have already run out of UDAs; that dentist might already have said, &#147;I can&#146;t treat any more patients this year.&#148; Those are the circumstances when some of the problems are occurring.</p>

<p><a name="st_o344"><a name="08121688000079"><a name="81216-0020.htm_spnew1"><a name="08121688000124"><b>Dr. Murrison:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend not agree that one of the most powerful ways of incentivising dentists is to register patients, as they would then have an incentive to build up a list of people with good oral health, which would ultimately reduce their work load? That aspect of incentivisation has been completely missed in this new contract.</p>

<p><a name="st_o345"><a name="08121688000080"><a name="81216-0020.htm_spnew2"><a name="08121688000125"><b>Mike Penning:</b>
 I completely agree with my hon. Friend and I will come on to that point later. I do not see how we can have preventive dentistry without having some form of capitation and registration. I think the right hon. Member for Rother Valley alluded to that in his speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="81216-0020.htm_para2"><a name="08121688000081">The report digs deeply into what NHS dentistry is capable of doing in this country today. Should we actually give up on parts of the country that rely on NHS dentistry? There is a postcode lottery; it is a fact that in some parts of the country that I have visited there is a plethora of NHS dentistry. In Newcastle and the north-east there is almost no private dentistry, whereas in other parts of this country&#151;I am referring to England now&#151;there is almost no NHS dentistry. This is a national health service, however, and that is partly&#151;although not completely&#151;why this contract was created. It was already in difficulties before, which is why the Government, in good faith, tried to bring in a contract that would help, but instead it has made the situation worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="81216-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08121688000082">When the Select Committee took its evidence, about 900,000 people who had had NHS dentistry had lost it. The latest figure is 1.2 million. That means there are now 3 million people in this country who need to rely on NHS dentistry but who cannot access it. As the economic climate becomes increasingly difficult, more people will need to rely on NHS dentistry. I listened carefully to the comments of the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) when he said he is in Denplan. A lot of people who are in Denplan will not be able to continue to afford to make those monthly payments should they lose or change their job. The demands on NHS dentistry will, therefore, increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="81216-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08121688000083">We must look at what the Government might propose in the review. My personal view is that this contract is a damaged brand, with its language of UDAs. From meeting dentists around the country, it is clear that they are not confident that the contract can provide for the British people the sort of dentistry we expect in the 21st century. I therefore look forward to the review with a degree of scepticism in terms of where the contract can go.</p>

 The panel undertaking the review has been welcomed, but I note that it contains no community dentist and so some dentists will be wondering about its composition. It seems to be made up of a couple of academics, somebody who apparently wants to be the chief dental officer one day and a failed commissioner who commissioned dental services without doing a needs assessment. Does that augur well for the future?</p>

As has been mentioned, no one body represents the whole of dentistry and the dentistry profession&#151;perhaps it would be better for the dentists if they did have one body that could stand up and fight their corner. I am very concerned that there appears to be a lack of engagement between Ministers and the professionals.</p>

Let me therefore go back for a second to where we were. I asked why no Minister went to the British Dental Association conference in Manchester this year to speak on behalf of the Government, given that the contract is so controversial within the profession. The Liberal Democrats spokesman was there, I was there and so, too, was the chief dental officer. He is a civil servant&#151;he is not a Minister of the Crown and he is not elected; he is appointed by the Secretary of State for Health&#151;and it is fundamentally unfair that a civil servant is there to represent the mistakes and problems that the Government have got themselves into on dentistry.

Health Minister at the time. I said to him, &#147;Fantastic, you are obviously coming to the BDA conference to represent the Government.&#148; He replied, &#147;No, I am going home.&#148; The only person who was representing the Government was the chief dental officer, and that was fundamentally unfair on him, because he was put in a position that only an elected Minister should be put in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="81216-0020.htm_para8"><a name="08121688000089">As the process goes on and as this contract is reviewed, I am very concerned about whether the Government will have the courage to admit how much of the contract they have got wrong and how much of it has affected people in this country. We see reports in the press of people extracting their teeth with pliers and people going to the pharmacists to get do-it-yourself fillings, which are available in most pharmacists in this country, because of the lack of NHS dentistry. That might be down to fear; it may not be fact, but the perception of a lack of such dentistry exists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="81216-0020.htm_para9"><a name="08121688000090">We have discussed the UDAs at length today. It cannot be right that in band 2 up to six fillings or one root canal or an extraction can be carried out. The obvious situation to consider is that of a dentist who is under pressure. What is such a dentist going to do? I hope that all dentists do what is right for the patient, but given that they are looking at the UDA rather than at the outcomes, it is obvious that, at times, real problems will arise. Many dentists have said that they are not willing to work under this contract and they have walked away, and we have to encourage them to come back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="81216-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08121688000091">One area of the report that concerned me&#151;this issue came up when I was on the Select Committee and we were examining charging&#151;was the bit dealing with dentists who say &#147;I will keep your children on only if you take me on as a private dentist.&#148; Such an approach is fundamentally wrong, because it is blackmailing people by saying that they can have NHS dentistry only if they pay for a private insurance plan or they pay as they go. But I think that we have to accept the fact that because so few dentists have been working in some parts of this country, I cannot, at this stage, see anything wrong with a dentist who is willing to take on a child, with no strings attached, under an NHS contract. That is better than nothing, and we need to examine such an approach. I know that the Select Committee was concerned about people being pressurised into certain things. That is fundamentally wrong, but if we can encourage private dentists to come back into NHS dentistry and take children on without any strings attached, that has to be good. On average, children have 1.5 fillings or extractions by the age of five, so the oral hygiene of our youngsters is going in the wrong direction. If we do not address children&#146;s oral health problems, that will have an effect as they get older. It is therefore vital to address the issue of oral health in the young.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="81216-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08121688000092">We have to encourage more dentists to come back into NHS dentistry. We have to look seriously at the court case earlier this week, which the Government lost on appeal when a dentist objected to the fact that, whether he had performed well or poorly, the PCT could remove his contract at any time. The courts ruled that that was wrong. We should extend the length of contracts, so that dentists can invest in their practices. PCTs do not pay for surgeries or equipment: the investment has to be made by the dentists themselves. There must also be a presumption that should a dentist want to move on or retire, they have the right to sell on the  <br>

goodwill in their contract. If we want dentists to come back into the NHS, or young dentists coming out of training schools&#151;I have visited them and they are fantastic&#151;to come into the NHS, we must give them the confidence to do so, especially in this difficult economic climate.</p>

Dentists themselves recognised that the old contract was a so-called &#147;drill and fill treadmill&#148;. Under that contract, dentists themselves chose where to set up in practice, they chose how much NHS work to do, and if they chose to leave the NHS, there was nothing that the local NHS could do to protect local access. As the Committee and many Members have pointed out, it is access that is important. Our new contracts give local primary care trusts the power to decide what services they need. Local PCTs contract with dentists to provide those services.</p>

 Will the Minister explain why it takes so long to commission new services? It takes more than a year to do so locally.

How can the Minister possibly defend the contract in terms of access? When will she accept that it has failed in that aim and that the review must fundamentally address that point?</p>

 I will not accept that at all. Many Members have said to me, both inside and outside the Chamber, that dental care has improved. In fairness, hon. Members need to recognise that the problems of dental access date back to the early 1990s. The problem had been growing for many years and culminated in the famous queue in Scarborough. That was probably the first time that the nation&#146;s attention was focused on a system that was badly in need of reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="81216-0020.htm_para20"><a name="08121690000034">I ask the House to remember that the queue in Scarborough occurred in January 2004, more than two years before we introduced our contract reforms. Indeed, it demonstrated the need for them. On top of the problems with the old contract that I have already described, we had a shortage of dentists. We have now opened two new dental schools and increased the total number of dental undergraduates in training by 25 per cent. The first of those new graduates will leave dental school next year, and the recurring increase in dental graduates will transform the availability of dentists. I hope that hon. Members of all parties will listen to what I am saying and be honest enough to accept that, although a decision was taken under the previous Administration to close two dental schools, we have now put that right. Does the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) want to intervene to accept that the Conservatives closed the schools, and that we have put that right?</p>

<p><a name="st_o359"><a name="08121690000035"><a name="81216-0020.htm_spnew15"><a name="08121690000208"><b>Dr. Murrison:</b>
 Does the Minister accept that those closures were predicated on projections about the reduction in dental care made by the profession at the time? I am sure that she likes to adhere to the evidence base, so she will know that many dentists, because of the changes to dentistry, have been drawn to cosmetic dental surgery. That was not expected, and she should acknowledge that both those factors are part of the problem that we face today. Will she acknowledge that it is wrong of her to lay into previous Governments for adhering to the evidence base that underpinned those closures?</p>

 The fact remains that two dental schools were closed under the previous Administration, and that they have been opened by the present Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="81216-0020.htm_para21"><a name="08121690000037">As I said, the new contract is based on dental services locally commissioned by PCTs to meet the needs of people seeking care in their areas. We have shown our commitment to increasing access to NHS dental services by increased investment of 11 per cent. in the current year. Next year, we will invest a further 8.5 per cent., for a total increase of &#163;385 million over the two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="81216-0021.htm_para0"><a name="08121690000038">We have reinforced that commitment in the NHS operating framework for 2009 by stating that PCTs should aim to provide access for anyone who seeks help in accessing NHS dentistry. In 2006, a significant number of dentists chose not to accept their new contracts. The level of service that they represented was 3.6 per cent.  <br>

and, in patient terms, that was the equivalent of services for around 1 million patients. This loss is still reflected in the 24-month access data published by the information centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="81216-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08121690000039">The number of dentists providing NHS treatment in 2007-08 increased by 655. So although the dentists who refused the new contracts in 2006 were lost, the number of dentists has started to grow again. The number of courses of treatment delivered in 2007-08 was 2.7 per cent. higher than in 2006-07, and the figures that the information centre published in November show that courses of treatment delivered in the first quarter of the current year are on course to be 3 per cent. higher.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="81216-0021.htm_para2"><a name="08121690000040">Looking forward, the figures show that PCTs this year have commissioned more dental services than ever. This increase in activity will show in the access data very soon, but locally it is already visible in the form of new practices opening and of existing contracts being grown.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="81216-0021.htm_para3"><a name="08121690000041">Despite the national figures, many PCTs are already ahead of the game. Some 30 per cent. of PCTs have actually increased dental access from March 2006. Some have done very well. The Isle of Wight, for example, has increased dental access by 24 per cent., while both the Medway and the Telford and Wrekin PCTs have increased it by 17 per cent. Those figures hardly support the view that the new contract somehow causes access to reduce, but I accept that other PCTs need to move further and faster on access. The new commitment in the operating framework gives PCTs a clear signal as to the priority that we place on access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="81216-0021.htm_para4"><a name="08121690000042">In my constituency, dentists have developed and run an outreach project to apply fluoride varnishes to children&#146;s teeth to protect them from decay. At the same time, they have put the parents in touch with local dental services. There are many other examples around the country of similar initiatives that can be carried out as part of the contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="81216-0021.htm_para5"><a name="08121690000043">The Select Committee was told to expect a mass exodus from the NHS in April 2009. We do not see any sign of that, although some practices that previously have employed a restricted contract approach to their NHS commitment may find that the PCT proposes a contract value that more properly reflects its commitment to the NHS. Such practices tend to offer child-only contracts, or contracts for exempt patients only.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="81216-0021.htm_para6"><a name="08121690000044">In conclusion, the past three of four years have been turbulent and unsettling. We now need to move forward with the profession, using the increased investment and larger work force as part of a greater focus on providing NHS dental services that we can be proud of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="81216-0021.htm_para7"><a name="08121690000045">I am proud of our NHS dentists; they work hard. They have worked hard for all of us, with a difficult contract.

<p><a name="st_o361"><a name="08121690000058"><a name="81216-0021.htm_spnew0"><a name="08121690000210"><b>Mr. William Cash (Stone) (Con):</b>
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, regarding the statement made by Assistant Commissioner Mr. Bob Quick on the entry into the House of Commons and the arrest of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Damian Green). The statement, we are told, recognises parliamentary rights and freedoms, but we are also told that a report exists. I have written to you, asking whether you would be kind enough to demand and/or ask the person who produced the report&#151;Chief Constable Johnston of the British Transport police&#151;to make it available and put it in the House of Commons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="81216-0021.htm_para20"><a name="08121690000059">The statement that we have been provided with welcomes the assurance of Chief Constable Ian Johnston</p>
<a name="81216-0021.htm_brev14"><a name="08121690000153"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;that the arrests and searches were lawful.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="81216-0021.htm_para21"><a name="08121690000060">Irrespective of whether the arrest was lawful, on which I make no comment, the question of whether the searches were lawful is a matter of privilege for the House. The statement asserts that they were lawful, but that is a matter of grave dispute. It is well established that the question of whether a privilege exists is one for the courts. It is for the House to decide whether there has been an infringement. I therefore regard the matter as being within the framework of the complaint of privilege that I have already made to you. I would be grateful if you considered the matter and made appropriate representations, so that we can have a copy of the report; otherwise, there would, I believe, be a breach of privilege.</p>

 Perhaps I might reply to the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash). As I came downstairs this evening to take the Chair, I learned of the statement that was made. It is my understanding that the Johnston report will not be published until criminal proceedings are dealt with. Therefore, there has been no publication of the report, and the situation is as it stood this afternoon, when I replied to the hon. Gentleman to say that I was not going to allow a debate.</p>

<p><a name="st_o364"><a name="08121690000063"><a name="81216-0021.htm_spnew3"><a name="08121690000213"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 Further to that statement, if I may, Mr. Speaker. This is very important. The question of whether article 9 of the Bill of Rights provides for the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to be overridden by that article in proceedings in Parliament is the question before the House. The complaint of privilege that I have made effectively states, as you know, Mr Speaker, that article 9 overrides PACE in respect of the precincts of the House. That is a matter on which the Standards and Privileges Committee must adjudicate in due course if a motion is passed. I believe that that is the position, if I may say so with respect, Mr. Speaker.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to raise in an Adjournment debate what I regard as an important matter. It arises from the oral exchange that took place on 30 June between myself and the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, following my giving him a couple of examples of physical contact issues relating to teachers and children in their schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="81216-0022.htm_para1"><a name="08121690000088">Let me reprise those examples briefly. One instance involved a little girl who had fallen over and injured herself in the playground and was clearly distressed, but the teacher felt unable to put her arm around her and comfort her as she would like to have done. For the child in question, that was a distressing and inexplicable situation. Someone whom she regarded as effectively a surrogate parent in the school situation was not comforting her, as she would have expected. The second instance, which is rather different, occurred when a young lad who was causing some difficulties for his teacher put himself under a desk in the school and refused to come out. The teacher felt unable to remove the child from under the desk. There he remained until his parents were called, completely disrupting the education of the rest of the class.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="81216-0022.htm_para2"><a name="08121690000089">The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families said in reply:</p>
<a name="81216-0022.htm_brev4"><a name="08121690000168"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The common-sense thing would be for the hon. Gentleman to advise that school that there is no reason at all not to provide such comfort and support&#151;whether the issue is about reasonable restraint or comfort. Of course teachers should be comforting children. Rather than raise the matter with me, the hon. Gentleman should go back to the school and tell its staff that they should have given that comfort and that they should do so in future.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 30 June 2008; Vol. 478, c. 588.]</p>

I wrote&#151;in neutral terms, I assure the Minister&#151;to all the schools in my constituency to ask about the matter and whether they thought there was a problem. Not all the schools replied, but 90 per cent. of those that responded indicated that they felt there was a problem, and gave me further instances of how that problem manifested itself. The Minister will understand that it is not sensible to revel the names of the schools here, but if she wishes to have those names, I am happy to provide them subsequently.</p>

November 2007; no doubt the Minister will refer to that. I have looked at that guidance, and let me say quite honestly that there is nothing particularly wrong with it; it is sensible and strikes the right balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="81216-0022.htm_para20"><a name="08121690000107">I have also looked at the extensive physical contact guidance for school and other education staff offered by my own local authority, East Sussex county council. It is a big document, which all schools in my area have been given. Again, I do not have a problem with the content; the issue appears to be that the guidance itself is not enough. Notwithstanding the fact that the guidance may be sound, it is clear that teachers are not happy following it for fear of unfounded allegations. When such allegations are made, it seems that teachers are regarded almost as guilty until proven innocent; they are often suspended and have a cloud hanging over them. As a consequence, common-sense, sensible physical contacts, which in a logical world all of us would wish to see&#151;comforting a child who has hurt herself, dealing with a child who is disrupting the whole class&#151;are not being carried out, notwithstanding the guidance that would support such contact, because teachers are afraid of the consequences of following the guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="81216-0022.htm_para21"><a name="08121690000108">I want to draw that particular issue to the Minister&#146;s attention. I am not criticising the guidelines or the Government, but saying that there is a problem with teachers, who, from the evidence that I have seen, do not have confidence that if they follow the guidelines they will be supported in the event of being challenged. One of the ways to tackle the issue is for the Government to make it absolutely clear that when teachers are in the classroom or school, they are effectively in loco parentis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="81216-0022.htm_para22"><a name="08121690000109">The Minister may say that that is the position, but the reality is that in the case of the boy under the desk the teacher would not remove him but the parents were called to do so. In that teacher&#146;s mind, there was a difference between the power that he was able to exercise legally, or wisely, and the power that the parents could exercise. There should not be a distinction in those matters. The teacher should have the same responsibilities and powers as the parents when the children are in school. I am interested to know whether the Minister can confirm that that is the case and, if so, what she will do to reinforce it through guidance and information to our teachers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="81216-0022.htm_para23"><a name="08121690000110">The next issue is what happens when an allegation is made. I suppose that there are a minority of occasions when the allegation is well founded; one cannot deny that that may be so. However, I am absolutely sure that the majority of allegations made against teachers are not well founded, and in those circumstances it is wrong for teachers to be suspended and to have a cloud hanging over them while investigations take place and the police are called. I have lots of examples for the Minister of where the police have been called and have turned up and questioned teachers at great length. Let us think about the power trip that children are given when they call in the police and have teachers held before them answering questions&#151;what an attractive proposition that is for certain young minds. That is inappropriate. There must be an assumption that, unless there is very clear evidence to the contrary, a teacher is probably innocent and should be allowed to carry on in their work. Obviously, if someone has witnessed something  <br>

horrendous, that is a different situation, but in most cases a teacher should be presumed to be innocent and allowed to carry on. Children should not be given the power to have the teacher suspended or subjected to police investigation, sometimes very overtly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="81216-0022.htm_para24"><a name="08121690000111">I am concerned that we do not collectively do enough to support our teachers. I have encountered examples in my constituency&#151;it is a law-abiding constituency, so if it is happening there it is happening elsewhere&#151;of what sometimes happens when a teacher attempts to enforce discipline in a way that all of us in this House would think entirely appropriate. When they keep a child in for detention, the parents arrive and attack the teacher, sometimes physically, and sometimes in front of the children. There is a real problem with a minority of parents who, on occasion, do not support the teachers. I do not know what the answer is, I freely confess, but I recognise the problem, and we have to try to deal with it. If the Minister has something helpful to say, it would be very welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="81216-0022.htm_para25"><a name="08121690000112">Finally, I want to draw attention to an unfortunate compensation culture within our schools, which is part of the same problem. This is from an article in <i> The Argus</i><i> </i>headed &#147;&#163;80,000 bill for Sussex school injuries&#148;:</p>
<a name="81216-0022.htm_brev18"><a name="08121690000182"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A ten-year-old boy who pulled his hamstring at school was awarded more than &#163;6,500 in compensation...Another pupil was given &#163;4,200 for slipping on ice in the playground&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="81216-0022.htm_para26"><a name="08121690000113">That kind of arrangement is not appropriate in our schools. All of us, when we were at school, went out in the playground, and no doubt we all slipped over on ice at some point. It is not appropriate to sue schools or for them to pay out &#163;4,200. If we get to a situation whereby the children feel that they have power over the teacher in terms of the police and allegations that they can make, and power over the local authority in terms of being able to sue for costs, no doubt through their parents, we are creating a society full of people who have unrealistic expectations and will not adjust properly to the real world when they get outside school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="81216-0022.htm_para27"><a name="08121690000114">Not only in the interests of teachers, but in the interests of children, we need to do more than we have done.

exchange with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, where a child had fallen over in the playground, is a case in point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="81216-0022.htm_para29"><a name="08121690000117">Clearly teachers should be able to comfort a child if they are distressed, as the teacher is the natural person for a child to turn to when they are at school. We can understand teachers&#146; worries, but common sense must be applied. If a pattern emerges or if touching a child is gratuitous, clearly that is wrong. It is also risky to attribute being tactile to a personal teaching style or a way of relating to pupils. However, if a child is distressed, a teacher should be able to feel as though they can take reasonable steps to comfort them. The same applies if children are misbehaving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="81216-0022.htm_para30"><a name="08121690000118">School staff who supervise pupils have the statutory power to use force to prevent injury, damage to property or serious breaches of school discipline. If the risks posed by the child leave no viable alternative, teachers will in some cases need to use restraint. The teacher will need to exercise their judgment. Powers exist under the legislation covering the use of force and the power to discipline to enable teachers to take what action is necessary to maintain good order and the safety of themselves, other staff and pupils. The legislation has existed in its current form since 1998 and was re-enacted by section 93 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="81216-0022.htm_para31"><a name="08121690000119">On the whole, our teachers exercise good sense and judgment when dealing with such issues. There are only a small number of allegations of staff using excessive force&#151;around 2,500 a year in a sector of well over 10 million students and 1 million staff. About 6 per cent. of all allegations are referred to the Crown Prosecution Service. But of course, any instance of excessive force or abuse is one too many and we must do everything that we can to guard against it. We want to make the recording and reporting of such incidents a statutory requirement for schools, so that there is a clear account of what happened, in order to protect pupils and teachers and so that parents are fully informed. We intend to legislate for that in our fourth Session education and skills Bill. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will be a member of the Committee that considers that Bill, when we can explore those issues further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="81216-0022.htm_para32"><a name="08121690000120">I know that some have concerns that teachers will be left exposed to allegations and I am acutely aware of the devastating effects that false accusations can have on a person&#146;s career, family and health. However, those risks must be balanced against ensuring that children are safe in school. That is why we have rigorous checks for those working with children, from the earliest years right through school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="81216-0022.htm_para33"><a name="08121690000121">As the hon.

We have been working on how to improve the handling of allegations, and in 2005 we issued guidance on how to handle cases in a more consistent and timely way. To support teachers further and to reduce the chance of such situations arising in the first place, we have published guidance to help clarify their position in circumstances that might call for physical contact.</p>

 I should like to begin by exploring the research that the hon. Gentleman has done in his constituency.

It is certainly unlikely that it is an isolated incidence, confined to the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="81216-0023.htm_para5"><a name="08121690000133">For learning to be truly effective, children need to feel safe, secure and happy at school, as well as receiving a high standard of education. No child should feel uncomfortable or threatened, and teachers should feel confident that they can manage situations in an appropriate and effective way, without fear of being penalised if the actions that they took were appropriate and absolutely necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="81216-0023.htm_para6"><a name="08121690000134">It is Government's responsibility to ensure that the systems are in place to make a pupil&#146;s education and childhood as positive and as safe as they can be. We take that responsibility very seriously. We have acted, and will continue to act, to keep students and staff safe, and to build the best possible education system and world-class children&#146;s services.</p>
