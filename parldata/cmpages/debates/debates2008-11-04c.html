It is true that the Scottish system, via the Scottish Medicines Consortium, works more quickly than the one in England, but that is because it takes its lead from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, by and large, and it does not have a consultation process. It does not consult the public on its decisions. The hon. Gentleman, as a Member for an English constituency, can take heart from the fact that the accusations he hears in his local Dog and Duck are quite unfounded.</p>

 My hon.

A number of points in it are really important, not least the recitation of the history of the problem, which points out how bad dentistry was in the 1990s, and the need to introduce a new contract. The report raises issues that we need to look at. I believe that fluoridation is a major force in tackling dentistry inequalities, and a dentist said to me recently, &#147;It gives poor kids rich kids&#146; teeth.&#148; That is why the consultation that is going on in the south-west and will soon take place in the north-west is so important.</p>

 I do not blame the hon.

Three hundred copies were published on a bank holiday Monday, with a foreword by the then Conservative Secretary of State, Patrick Jenkin, stating that everything in the report was basically rubbish. <i> [Interruption.] </i>They are chuntering on the Conservative Front Bench, but they know that health inequalities worsened between 1979 and 1997. The hon. Gentleman might like to know that, since then, in eight years, the health of the poorest and most deprived in our nation has now reached the level that the rest of the population attained eight years ago. Infant mortality is down and life expectancy is up in spearhead areas. That shows what one can do with a Government who genuinely set tackling health inequalities as a priority. The Conservative party did nothing&#151;indeed, we went backwards during their 18 years in government.</p>

 Let us deal now with 2008 issues, for which the Government are responsible. Earlier this year, my mother broke her hip while in hospital and I observed at close hand the wonderful work of occupational therapists. However, the Minister knows that, in adult social services, occupational therapists form 2 per cent. of the work force, yet deal with 35 per cent. of referrals. With health and social services becoming integrated, how will the Minister and the Government tackle the increasing number of referrals with such a small work force?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o2"><a name="81104-0002.htm_para0"><a name="08110438000084">I am happy to say that the number of occupational therapists working in the NHS has increased to 17,024&#151;an increase of some 48 per cent. since 1997. There has therefore been a huge increase in the number of NHS occupational therapists. In addition, local authority occupational therapists provide social care and help. The integration of the two services is important, and I would like more of that to happen. We have good examples, such as the Torbay care trust, which is not in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency, of local authorities working closely with PCTs to create a single referral pathway for those who wish to use occupational therapists. Self-referral is also popular. Those who self-refer get much benefit from going straight to an occupational therapist and gaining the treatment that they need to give them successful lives and improve their well-being.</p>

 I welcome my hon. Friend&#146;s contribution. We are aware that the prevalence of diabetes can be up to five times higher among those from a black or minority ethnic background&#151;for example, those from a south Asian background in the UK. That increased prevalence may be due to different underlying behavioural, environmental and lifestyle mechanisms&#151;and, of course, the wonderful food that is produced. On a recent trip to India, I realised the seriousness of the escalation of diabetes in that country, with 40 million diagnosed with the disease and another 30 million undiagnosed. It is a serious issue, and I know that many innovative PCTs are looking into cooking methods. I would be pleased to hear more about the scheme that my hon. Friend mentioned.</p>

 Recent fighting in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has further worsened a dire humanitarian situation. The displacement of an additional 55,000 people in North Kivu in the past week compounds the suffering that has continued for years. Access to food, sanitation and shelter is urgently needed. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary saw the suffering caused by the violence at first hand when he visited DRC on 1 November. We are determined that that suffering should be effectively addressed. The UK has increased its commitment to provide humanitarian aid, and we are supporting flights to help meet the immediate needs of displaced people in the region. We urge all parties to observe the current ceasefire and allow humanitarian access to those affected by the fighting. Contingency planning is under way to strengthen the provision of aid to those who need it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="81104-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08110438000168">The issues underlying the violence are political. The leaders of DRC and Rwanda need to co-operate to reach political solutions to those issues, and in that regard I welcome the appointment by the UN Secretary-General of former President Obasanjo of Nigeria as his special envoy to facilitate this process. I also commend the action taken by the chairman of the commission of the African Union in appointing an emissary, who will travel to Kinshasa tomorrow. It is right that regional partners should play a role in the efforts to stabilise this volatile region and encourage stronger relations between neighbours. We will continue to do everything possible to bring peace to the region.</p>

The Opposition are pleased that the Foreign Secretary visited the region quickly at the weekend.

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="81104-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08110438000172">The second matter is the continuing role of United Nations troops.

of UN peacekeeping operations is in the Congo assessing the situation. When will he report to the UN Security Council? Five thousand UN troops are meant to be providing protection for aid. Is the Minister satisfied that those troops have the organisation and capability to do that effectively, especially given that the commander of the UN forces has resigned?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="81104-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08110438000173">The third matter is the involvement of UK troops. Last night&#151;I think&#151;the Foreign Secretary said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="81104-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08110438000177">In the Government&#146;s opinion, are those things beginning to happen? Is the Minister satisfied that all possible pressure is being exerted on General Nkunda to ensure that his forces lay down their arms?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="81104-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08110438000178">The Foreign Secretary and French Foreign Minister have warned both the Congolese and Rwandan leaders that they will be held to account for any further fighting. Can the Minister say more about how it is proposed that they will be held to account? Has he raised that matter with the International Criminal Court, which is already involved in the Congo?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="81104-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08110438000179">Finally, in welcoming the impending visit by the UN Secretary-General to the region, and other initiatives, including those of the African Union, how confident is the Minister that the Congolese and Rwandan leaders will be persuaded to pursue existing road maps on disarmament, integration, transitional justice, resource sharing, institution building and so on? Does he agree that, if the responsibility to protect is to mean anything, the UN has to demonstrate how it will assert its collective responsibility never to allow anything like the 1994 Rwandan catastrophe to occur again?</p>

 I thank the right hon. Gentleman for those questions and the tone in which they were put. It is certainly imperative that the Government keep the House up to date. Like him, I think that the Foreign Secretary&#146;s visit at the weekend was exceedingly timely and constructive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="81104-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08110438000181">The humanitarian situation is bleak: 55,000 people have been displaced in the last week, which makes the figure 250,000 since August and 850,000 in total. That is very concerning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="81104-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08110438000183">The right hon. Gentleman asked about the involvement of British troops. We have made it clear that that is on the table as a last-case contingency provision, but even if we were to consider that, it is certainly not our immediate priority. Our immediate priority is to ensure that the MONUC force works effectively, because it is a substantial force. Were we to consider a contribution of further troops, we would do that in conjunction with our international partners on a contingency basis. We would need to be very clear about how any additional forces could supplement MONUC&#146;s efforts. A hasty, poorly planned deployment could complicate the situation further, which is why we are focusing all our efforts on ensuring that MONUC, which has the troops on the ground, operates effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="81104-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08110438000184">The key to the situation is a political solution. It is welcome that President Kikwete has given a commitment to bring the two leaders together within the region. As the shadow Foreign Secretary pointed out, there are road-map commitments and a potential solution in place. We all need to use all our efforts to ensure that those solutions are taken forward.</p>

 The Minister will be aware that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a vast country with 60 million people, most of whom earn less than half a dollar a day. It is very poor, yet very wealthy in resources. Does he agree that this long-standing problem will not be solved in Kinshasa but through its neighbours and by addressing the conflict between the Tutsi and Hutu peoples of the area around the lakes? An intensive political effort, particularly involving Rwanda, is required to get the political solution that is called for.</p>

 I very much agree with my hon. Friend that the situation requires a political solution. I know that he has taken a strong interest in the issue. It requires a political process between Tutsis and Hutus, as well as political engagement between the DRC and Rwanda. There is also an important key role to be undertaken by the AU. In that regard, I was pleased by the announcement that the AU will send its own envoy, Ibrahima Fall, to contribute to the process.</p>

 The Foreign Secretary is to be commended for his action in recent days, working with his French counterparts. The Liberal Democrats strongly support the urgent and courageous humanitarian efforts that are now under way. He has rightly been cautious in promising British troops, given the appalling overstretch suffered by our forces in Iraq and elsewhere. The proposal for an EU force to back the UN mission that was discussed in the other place yesterday would have our support.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for those questions. Cash certainly has a role to play, and we are one of the biggest bilateral aid donors to both DRC and Rwanda. It is clear that the UN mission has a role both to monitor and to enforce the accords that are being put in place. Ultimately, as the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, there needs to be a negotiated, political solution based on the commitments in place already. There is an economic driver for the present situation, in that the region has economic resources. We have been at the forefront of pressing, at international level through the UN, for the extractive industries transparency initiative as a way to ensure that there is effective governance and so that corruption and killing are not driven by a desire for economic profit.</p>

 While the immediate need is to try to mitigate the appalling suffering of the refugees, may I ask the Minister whether, in future, even more serious and urgent consideration, above that which he has already mentioned, will be given to one of the root causes of the problem, which is the scramble by foreign firms for the control and exploitation of the mineral wealth of the Congo? That leads to the funding of the so-called warlords, who buy a great deal of weaponry, with which they dominate and terrify the civilian population.</p>

 I acknowledge that there is an economic dimension to the conflict, and that is why, as I say, we have strongly supported the extractive industries transparency initiative at UN level. We are fooling ourselves if we do not acknowledge that there is a significant political, ethnic conflict taking place. That has to be addressed, but it can only be done through a political solution. In particular, it means that the Presidents of DRC and Rwanda have to come together, with regional partners and international support, to make political progress.</p>

 Although the Congo is a vast country, the area in which the chaos has occurred is relatively small&#151;not much larger than Sierra Leone. Given the disorganised nature of all the armed groups in the area, it is a place where a relatively small but well-disciplined and well-organised outside military force, under the command of MONUC or whoever, could make a difference, as the French demonstrated with Operation Artemis some years ago. One recognises the constraints, given our commitments elsewhere, but I hope that my hon. Friend and the Government will not rule out our making a contribution to whatever force eventually restores order there. Enforcing whatever political agreement is reached will have to be done by outsiders, because the internal forces are absolutely incapable of doing it.</p>

 I pay tribute to my hon. Friend; I know from having worked with him at the Foreign Office that he has enormous experience on this issue. He is right to stress that we are talking about a relatively small part of DRC. That is why our efforts are focused on ensuring that the MONUC force on the ground is appropriately and adequately deployed in the area. We do have some challenges, in that some of the international partners that form part of the MONUC force have caveats relating to their deployment. We are seeking to remove those caveats, so that we can deploy as effectively as possible.</p>

 Britain has become one of the biggest donors in DRC precisely because we wanted the country not to move back into a conflict situation, as most post-conflict countries sadly do within five years. Will the Minister acknowledge that, in the short run, we must have international forces to deal with the crisis, but in the long run we have to develop the capability of a well-disciplined army and police force to enable the Government of the Congo to govern the country? EU countries have been noticeably reticent about providing the support and training for which they have been asked. What can we do to ensure that they play their full part?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is certainly correct to identify that we are, and have been, a very substantial aid donor. Through the Department for International Development, we are committing &#163;300 million over three years, and that is making a difference. The &#163;5 million that was announced by the Secretary of State for International Development last Friday is already helping to facilitate aid missions from UNICEF and others in beginning to make progress. In the longer term, as he says, increasing the capacity for self-governance of DRC and others is critically important. We are making a contribution; we need to ensure that all states are making the contribution as effectively as possible.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend, who I know takes a real interest in these issues. Certainly, here and elsewhere in the world, her concern about the plight of children involved in conflict is critical, and the issue will be at the forefront of our thinking and planning. MONUC has not only a monitoring role but, importantly, an enforcement role&#151;to enforce the accords that are already in place and, in particular, the zones of separation, which were announced through the UN. Ultimately, it has to be one of the building blocks for our substantive progress.</p>

 May I reiterate the point&#151;I think it is a strong feeling in the House&#151;that our armed forces are already doing enough, if not too much?

 Like the hon. Gentleman, I think that our troops are doing a superb job in many parts of the world. It would be irresponsible to rule out contingencies, given what is a very difficult situation, but all our efforts and statements have made it clear that our overriding priority is to ensure that MONUC operates effectively and is deployed effectively.

 When one goes and sees the MONUC force, it is actually very impressive, but we know that too often in the past troops have either been badly led, as my hon. Friend the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley) said, or, more particularly, not been paid, which has led to ill discipline and problems on the ground. Will the Government ensure that, at the very least, the UN and all those who contribute to the force pay up front to make sure that it is equipped and able to do the work that it has set out to do?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a powerful argument.

 Further to the Minister&#146;s response to the right hon.

 The hon. Gentleman is right to caution against irresponsible language in a fast-moving situation. He is right also to point out that this year we are committing &#163;46 million to Rwanda. In this debate, it is important to make it clear that, even in this very difficult situation, some progress is being made. The military situation overnight in Goma town remains calm and under control; efforts are under way to reinforce troops in Goma; and humanitarian activity is slowly improving as access slowly improves. That is one of the key fundamentals in the situation. We must ensure that the non-governmental organisations and aid agencies gain access to the most acutely affected areas.</p>

 Those individuals who have committed such crimes need to be brought to book. That has certainly been a key part of our focus.

 I noted the Minister&#146;s response to the concerns raised earlier about the role of commercial interests. However, may I draw his attention to the UN panel of experts report, which specifically listed companies and individuals implicated in what it described as a multi-billion-dollar theft of the country&#146;s natural resources? The report also described the role that that played in sustaining the conflict. Yet none of those interests&#151;none of those individuals or companies&#151;was ever brought to justice.

 There is another angle to this issue. In 2005, every member of the Security Council and of the General Assembly signed up to the concept of the responsibility to protect, which, if need be, involves peacekeepers and peace enforcement. At present, disproportionately few members of the United Nations are contributing to UN peacekeeping. It is one thing for all those countries to sign up in New York to concepts such as the responsibility to protect, but they then have to deliver to the Secretary-General by being willing to contribute peacekeepers. Other UN member states do not have enough peacekeepers in Darfur, let alone in the Congo. When will we see the countries that subscribe to the responsibility to protect contributing to the UN by way of peacekeepers?</p>

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement about Professor Mike Richards&#146;s review of current policy concerning NHS patients who wish to pay for additional private drugs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="81104-0005.htm_para2"><a name="08110438000240">I start by paying tribute to Professor Richards and his review team for the diligence with which they have conducted this review. The report is informed by evidence from thousands of patients, carers and clinicians across the country, and it was completed with necessary urgency but without in any way compromising its thoroughness. The time scales that I set were deliberately challenging, because this issue is causing great concern and distress to a number of patients and their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="81104-0005.htm_para3"><a name="08110438000241">The review&#146;s terms of reference were to examine current policy relating to patients who choose to pay privately for drugs that are recommended by their clinician but not funded by the NHS and who, as a result, are required to pay for the NHS care that they would otherwise have received free of charge. I also asked Professor Richards to make recommendations on whether policy or guidance could be clarified or improved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="81104-0005.htm_para4"><a name="08110438000242">Professor Richards quickly identified the underlying causes of the problem. His review starts from the fundamental principle that the NHS provides a universal and comprehensive service to all its patients, free at the point of need. During the Second Reading of the NHS Bill in 1946, Nye Bevan described the financial anxiety endured by people seeking medical help as the &#147;first evil&#148; that the NHS must vanquish. Yet Professor Richards&#146;s report shows that access to certain treatments on the NHS, particularly drugs for the terminally ill, is inconsistent, and as a result a very small number of patients feel that they have to pay for additional treatment and are worried that in doing so they will jeopardise their entitlement to NHS care. His report makes recommendations not only to revise the guidance for those exceptional and rare circumstances, but to improve access to certain drugs on the NHS, reducing the need for such patients to resort to private care. His recommendations are accompanied by proposals put forward by Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, chair of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, to employ greater flexibility in the appraisal of certain treatments, specifically those relating to drugs for the terminally ill. I accept Professor Richards&#146;s recommendations in full and today I can announce two immediate developments to make drugs more available on the NHS to those who could benefit from them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="81104-0005.htm_para5"><a name="08110438000243">Since it was established in 1999, NICE has ensured not only that many thousands of patients benefit from access to the latest treatments, but that the taxpayer gets value for money. NICE provides wholly independent and scientifically rigorous assessments of the latest medicines and treatments and is widely admired across the world for its work. Its guidance on drugs and treatments is internationally respected, and many other countries are adopting similar models.</p>

increase patients&#146; access to new drugs. Those arrangements will include enabling drug companies to supply drugs to the NHS at lower initial prices, with the option of higher prices if value is proven at a later date. The new arrangements will also build on patient access schemes already developed for particular drugs. That will help to ensure that patients can access medicines that would not otherwise have been deemed cost-effective by NICE. I expect to be able to say more about that soon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para1"><a name="08110438000245">In addition, NICE has for some time been concerned about its ability to take into account the premium that society places on helping those with terminal illnesses. Professor Sir Michael Rawlins has written to me to outline a new, more flexible approach to the appraisal process in order to address those concerns. NICE proposes to introduce more flexibility in the evaluation of higher-cost drugs, which have been shown to extend the lives of terminally ill patients, and where the less common nature of a particular condition may mean that the more flexible pricing arrangements we are discussing with the industry are not in themselves sufficient. The proposal will be implemented immediately while NICE holds a full consultation</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para2"><a name="08110438000246">Those two measures will ensure that more treatments, which in the past patients may only have been able to access privately, will be available free on the NHS. The work of NICE is necessarily complex, but as we highlighted in the cancer reform strategy, it sometimes takes too long. Its appraisal guidance has often not been available for two years or more after a drug has been licensed. Steps have already been taken to address that, with, for example, fast-track procedures to appraise automatically significant new cancer drugs, but the time it takes NICE to publish guidance can lead to significant local variation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para3"><a name="08110438000247">In response to Professor Richards&#146;s report, I am today setting out a new timetable to speed up the appraisal process for all drugs evaluated by NICE. In 2009, draft or final guidance will be available within six months of licensing for about half of the drugs that are being appraised through the fast-track single technology appraisal programme. In 2010, draft or final guidance for all new cancer drugs will be available within six months, on average, of a drug being licensed. We will work with NICE to explore further ways of speeding up the appraisal process with the intention of announcing the outcome of our work early in the new year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para4"><a name="08110438000248">All of those measures will dramatically reduce the instances where a drug is available on the market but primary care trusts have no guidance from NICE on which to base their decisions about funding. However, we cannot totally eliminate instances of primary care trusts having to make decisions in the absence of NICE guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para5"><a name="08110438000249">Professor Richards has found that patients and professionals are often unclear about who takes such decisions or how they make them. Patients and their families are often left bewildered about why a particular treatment has been denied, despite what they see as a clear clinical need. As we highlighted in the NHS constitution, we need to do more to improve the quality and consistency of the decisions, especially in any interim period before NICE&#146;s guidance is released.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para6"><a name="08110438000250">We will therefore publish a set of core principles to inform the way in which primary care trusts make decisions about funding new drugs. It is essential that the process, as well as the decisions, is clear and accessible to patients and the public so that, if a patient is denied  <br>

access to a particular treatment, the reasoning behind the decision is transparent and consistent. We will publish detailed good practice guidance for primary care trusts about the processes that they should have in place to make decisions about funding new drugs and handling exceptional cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08110438000251">Better local decision making, a faster appraisal process, fairer pricing and greater flexibility in evaluating certain treatments will address the main issues that have fuelled the demand from some patients for additional private treatment. However, it would be unreasonable to expect the NHS to fund every single new treatment, and we cannot guarantee that we will completely eradicate the circumstances in which a small minority of patients wish to pay for a drug that the NHS does not provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08110438000252">The vast majority of people to whom Professor Richards spoke during his review thought that, in such circumstances, it would be wrong to take away a patient&#146;s entitlement to NHS care because they had purchased additional treatment privately. Professor Richards recommends that that practice should end and I agree. It will end with immediate effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para9"><a name="08110438000253">However, Professor Richards is also clear that there must be tight controls to prevent the NHS from becoming a two-tier system. Today, we will publish draft revised guidance, to take immediate effect, to ensure that the NHS is clear about how to deal with the rare occasions&#151;which, with the implementation of the proposals already mentioned will be even rarer&#151;when patients opt to fund additional drugs privately. The guidance will make it clear that NHS care should never be withdrawn and that administering private care should take place separately from NHS care to ensure that NHS funds are never used to subsidise private care. In short, there is no question of patients who can pay more being able to access a different and higher level of NHS treatment, but neither should any patient who has at some point paid for private treatment lose their entitlement to NHS care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para10"><a name="08110438000254">Today&#146;s draft guidance sets out that, in such circumstances, private treatment should be provided in a private facility so that it is always clear whether a particular treatment is NHS or private. That removes any confusion about what constitutes a single visit or single episode of care. It will also remove any question of a two-tier system, whereby those who pay for additional care have their private care subsidised by the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para11"><a name="08110438000255">The NHS must, by definition, continually evolve and improve to fulfil rising expectations and offer the latest advances in medical care to all our citizens, irrespective of wealth, class, ethnicity or disability. The debate has been critically important to the NHS and the values that underpin it. I believe that the measures that I outlined today will, in enabling the NHS to exercise its natural compassion, help secure those values for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para12"><a name="08110438000256">We are fortunate in Britain to have a health system that provides a comprehensive service for all patients, based on clinical need, with public funds for health care devoted solely to the benefit of the people it serves. The report by Professor Richards enhances those principles and I commend the statement to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para13"><a name="08110438000258">I regret, however, that the Secretary of State&#146;s statement, far from clarifying the issues, leaves them as unsatisfactory as ever. Professor Richards&#146;s report says on page 6:</p>
<a name="81104-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="08110438000456"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I believe that the option of NHS top-ups should be rejected&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para14"><a name="08110438000259">However, the Secretary of State says that if patients are denied access to new cancer drugs by the NHS, they can pay for them without losing their entitlement to NHS care. So, contrary to past guidance and in a U-turn on policy, patients will be able to be both private patients and NHS patients in relation to the same course of treatment, even if the Government dress it up as separate care, with patients being wheeled to another ward in the hospital to have their cancer drug administered and then a bill sent to them by the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para15"><a name="08110438000260">I refer Government Members to page 6 of the report, where the Secretary of State requires strategic health authorities to say where private drugs are going to be administered, which includes designating an area of an NHS hospital for the delivery of privately funded treatments, and to page 51, where the proposed option for separate care says that patients will receive different care from the NHS and the private provider, although this will often be the NHS, so the NHS will be the private provider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para16"><a name="08110438000261">The Secretary of State has not really answered the question: is he in favour of top-ups or is he against them? In reality, the Government have jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire, from, on the one hand, denying cancer patients their entitlement to NHS care, which has rightly been abandoned, to, on the other, requiring patients to pay for their cancer drugs and thereby creating two-tier access to NHS care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para17"><a name="08110438000262">That has happened because the Secretary of State, after we have asked him time and again, has not answered the key question: why are NHS patients in England not receiving clinically effective life-extending cancer treatments that are routinely available in other European countries? An OECD report published last week on pharmaceutical pricing said that UK spending on medicines per capita is below the OECD average.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para18"><a name="08110438000263">The Government admitted last year in the ministerial industry strategy group that the uptake of new cancer drugs in this country was slower than across Europe. We know from the Minister&#146;s reply that we spend 5.6 per cent. of our NHS budget on cancer services, whereas France spends 7.7 per cent. Why does the Secretary of State not understand that the heart of the issue is about enabling clinicians in this country to provide the cancer treatments that they believe are necessary for their patients?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para19"><a name="08110438000264">There are many steps that we could take on that. Why has the Secretary of State not followed the advice that we have published on NICE and taken ministerial referral out of the system? That would take six months out straight away and speed up NICE appraisals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para20"><a name="08110438000265">Despite the talk from the Secretary of State about more flexible pricing&#151;frankly, for two years I have been urging this on Ministers&#151;why did he not implement a fully value-based pricing system for new medicines in the review of the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme this year, so that patients can access the treatments through the NHS and the price paid will reflect the therapeutic and innovative value? Instead, the Secretary of State still seems to be prepared to contemplate cancer patients paying thousands of pounds for their  <br>

medicines, just as long as they are administered by the NHS in another ward, as separate care. If so, is he planning new primary legislation to introduce a new power for NHS trusts to charge for treatment?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para21"><a name="08110438000266">Is the Secretary of State preparing legislation to remove the private income cap on foundation trusts, which specialist cancer hospitals such as the Royal Marsden or the Christie would otherwise breach? How will he stop the new rules from becoming a bureaucratic nightmare? How can his rules be applied if patients exercise choice and go to an independent hospital or even go abroad in future, using the cross-border health care directive?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para22"><a name="08110438000267">How will the Secretary of State prevent the NHS from becoming a core service, with increasing numbers of top-up treatments or patients being pressurised to buy more treatments and services privately? Will he confirm to the House that separate care will often mean private health care provided by NHS trusts?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para23"><a name="08110438000268">Based on the Secretary of State&#146;s proposals today, how can he still argue that treatment through the NHS would be available based on need rather than on the ability to pay? Let us take the case of a patient with bowel cancer, whose hospital consultant recommends Erbitux, a life-extending treatment. At the moment, some primary care trusts provide that treatment, while others do not. Some hospitals pay for it themselves, while others require it to be administered at home with the patient paying. Still others require it to be administered wholly privately, with all the associated treatment costs being paid for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para24"><a name="08110438000269">In today&#146;s statement, only that last case has been ruled out, and rightly so. It has always been morally repugnant to make cancer patients pay for their continuing NHS care. We made that clear months ago, and the Secretary of State could have made this decision months ago. It is equally unacceptable for cancer patients still to be put through months of delay&#151;whether as a result of NICE appraisals or exceptional case panels&#151;while not knowing whether their treatment will be provided by the NHS, even if their consultant says that it is the best, and sometimes the only, option for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para25"><a name="08110438000270">Those patients might also be aware that Erbitux will be provided for bowel cancer treatment in every other country across Europe, but not here. Indeed, it was Erbitux to treat bowel cancer that Linda O&#146;Boyle needed to pay for. Hers was one of the central cases that gave rise to the review. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron), who represented Linda O&#146;Boyle, her family and her interests assiduously in the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para26"><a name="08110438000271">The Government are planning to stop cancer patients having to pay &#163;7.10 for a prescription, yet they are still prepared for those patients to pay &#163;11,500 to acquire Erbitux for their bowel cancer treatment. The Rarer Cancers Forum estimates the cost of extending access to new cancer drugs at &#163;175 million a year. The NHS surplus last year was 10 times that amount. This summer, the Secretary of State imposed a price cut on the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme, saying that that would save &#163;300 million a year. Where is this money going? Why is the money voted by Parliament to  <br>

provide care for patients not providing the cancer services that our constituents need, and which they know other countries provide?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para27"><a name="08110438000272">Let us be clear about this. There are two principles involved: if a patient has cancer, they expect the NHS to provide the treatments that they need and that are recommended for them, including those that will extend their life; if they want something different, and pay for it privately, the NHS should not penalise them for doing so. Those are two simple principles. Why could not the Secretary of State have made it that simple today? Why could he not have got up and said that those would be the principles that we would work to, while respecting the values of the NHS?</p>

<p><a name="st_o168"><a name="08110438000273"><a name="81104-0006.htm_spnew1"><a name="08110438000660"><b>Alan Johnson:</b>
 I am very surprised by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s response, not least because, if he has read the report, he will know that Mike Richards looked at a spectrum of alternatives. The first point&#151;the important point&#151;is that we will no longer withdraw NHS treatment from people who have to pay for a drug that has been recommended by their clinician but which is not available on the NHS. The hon. Gentleman says that he raised this issue months ago, but I never heard a single word about it from Conservative Front Benchers until the Conservative party conference, three months after we had announced the review. Yes, there was a question a year ago from the Opposition Back Benches, but it was not followed up at all by those on the Front Bench. Yet, suddenly, the Mr. Know-alls have always been aware of this problem and always been determined to resolve it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para28"><a name="08110438000274">Why has Professor Richards, after talking to all his colleagues, come up with this proposal? At one end of the spectrum, there is the current, rather cruel, practice. Incidentally, I too pay tribute to the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron) for the work that he has done on behalf of Linda O&#146;Boyle&#146;s family. At the other end of the spectrum, there is something that Mike Richards calls top-ups. I do not want to get bogged down in the terminology, but the understanding of people in the profession was that some people were concerned about the change in practice, and a thorough debate took place on the issue. The understanding was that a top-up system would involve an NHS patient being offered a range of choices, one of which would involve the patient in bed No. 1 being offered a drug that was not available on the NHS and paying the NHS for it, while the patient in bed No. 2 could not afford to pay for the same drug. However, Mike Richards points out that the only people who were vehemently proposing that option were the people who felt that a tax-funded system could not survive and that, at some stage, we would need to move to an insurance-based system. They are the only people, Mike Richards says, who put forward that view. That is top-up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para29"><a name="08110438000276">What Mike Richards has said, of course, is that we should not withdraw this treatment; we should ensure that NHS treatment continues; we should allow the patient to pay for that treatment; but we should not under any circumstances&#151;to reiterate a point put to me in a consultation by the hon. Member for Billericay&#151;endanger the principles of the NHS. The system of top-ups would, however, endanger that principle. <i> [Interruption.] </i>This is a serious issue, so let us not have barracking from the gallery; let us rather try to understand what Professor Richards has done in a very important report over a short period. We will deal with Europe  <br>

and all the other peripheral issues, but what Professor Richards has said is that we cannot carry on with this cruel system, but neither can we allow the NHS to be used to subsidise private care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para30"><a name="08110438000277">I do not know the current position of Conservative Front Benchers on this issue. It has been all kinds of things over the last 10 years and I am not sure what it is today on this particular Wednesday; it might well have changed again&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Sorry, it is Tuesday today, so it will no doubt change again tomorrow. The real issue is this: what Mike Richards says is that we should have separate care, perhaps provided in a private facility in an NHS hospital; that is fine, because we allow private care in NHS hospitals. If such care is not available in an NHS hospital, the patient can get the drug from a private practitioner and have it administered at home, which is what happens in Birmingham. However, NHS care will not be withdrawn from such patients and they will be allowed to buy those drugs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para31"><a name="08110438000278">The final point made by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) was about flexible and value-based pricing, which was in the Office of Fair Trading review of the pharmaceutical industry a while ago. The hon. Gentleman and the Conservative party need to understand this: either we keep the current system, which Labour Members value, of reaching a voluntary agreement with the pharmaceutical industry through the PPRS or we move to reference pricing&#151;the European model. I believe that we would lose out from that system. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire asks why we did not introduce value-based pricing earlier. The answer is that we need to negotiate it with the pharmaceutical industry. If we do not negotiate it, we will have to introduce it through legislation, which is not the route we want to take. The negotiating route has led us to a patient-access scheme, which is being used for some drugs, and we will soon, I hope, conclude our negotiations and have a flexible pricing scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="81104-0006.htm_para32"><a name="08110438000279">The worst scheme would be the Conservative policy launched a couple of days ago, which amounts to a huge bureaucracy with every drug having to be evaluated through the system. We would lose the voluntary agreement with the pharmaceutical industry and probably lose some major research and development in pharmaceuticals. I think that Conservative Members need to get their act together; as far as I can see, the policy seems to be put forward by &#147;Confused of Conservative central office&#148;.</p>

 Yes, indeed it does. NICE has seen that people are concerned about this aspect of end-of-life care and believe that as people approach the last years of their lives, society should put a premium on that, which is not reflected in the current system. The supplementary system announced today will indeed mean more of these drugs being made available.</p>

 I thank the Secretary of State for early sight of the statement and join hon. Members in thanking Professor Mike Richards for his work in producing the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="81104-0007.htm_para0"><a name="08110438000285">The statement&#151;albeit it a remarkable U-turn, albeit that it comes after pressure of a threatened judicial review and albeit that the Government seem to be fudging or drawing a distinction between what is proposed and the principle of top-ups&#151;is none the less a welcome step. It is a complex area. There are understandable anxieties about the implications of moving in the direction outlined, but the bottom line is that we cannot justify a cruel and pernicious system that threatens to withdraw NHS care if a patient chooses to follow a clinician&#146;s advice in paying for a drug that is not available under the NHS. However, allowing top-ups must go hand in hand with reforms to ensure that access under the NHS is available to drugs that are routinely accessible in Europe but are not currently available in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="81104-0007.htm_para1"><a name="08110438000286">On proposals to extend access, the Secretary of State&#146;s ambition is to achieve draft or final guidance within six months, but he will only achieve that for all drugs by 2010. Surely if it is only draft guidance within six months, there could be a further long delay in producing the final guidance. Why will it take so long to get to the six-month point, given that there is already a much faster system in Scotland? I know that the process there is different, but it usually ends up achieving the same verdict as we do in England only it does so much quicker. That the system is taking so long results in a great sense of unfairness in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="81104-0007.htm_para2"><a name="08110438000287">The Secretary of State said nothing about the need to reform the requirement of ministerial referral.

Will he consider widening the factors that NICE takes into account&#151;the impact on carers and the potential to get an individual back to work&#151;in assessing whether a drug is cost-effective?

principles, and will they take into account social factors&#151;family circumstances&#151;in determining whether a drug should be available?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="81104-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08110438000291">The statement contained nothing about the absolute importance of independent advice to patients on whether it is right to pay for an additional drug. It also said nothing about the potential need to regulate any market that might develop in dealing with very vulnerable people at a critical stage in their life. Finally, the right hon. Gentleman said nothing about addressing the potential conflict of interest for clinicians and the NHS in making these difficult judgments. Will he address those concerns as well in his response?</p>

<p><a name="st_o174"><a name="08110438000292"><a name="81104-0007.htm_spnew2"><a name="08110438000666"><b>Alan Johnson:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his welcome for the statement. He says that it is a remarkable U-turn, but this guidance has been around for many years. We can track it back to the early &#146;80s, under the Thatcher Government, and it was there before that. <i> [Interruption.] </i>He says from a sedentary position that it is a U-turn from what I said, but I said that if we allowed NHS care and private care to be given together&#151;I talked about an episode of treatment, to introduce a new variation into all the descriptions, back in December last year&#151;that could be the end of the founding principles of the NHS. It could be, and Mike Richards has accepted that it could be, which is why separate care is an important part of his proposals. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Everyone in the House apart from those on the Conservative Front Bench understands that Mike Richards&#146; terms of reference were to defend the principles of the NHS, and that combining private and NHS care would be the route to an insurance-based system and the end of a taxpayer-funded system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="81104-0007.htm_para7"><a name="08110438000293">The hon. Gentleman said that the proposal would have to go hand in hand with greater availability. That is what Mike Richards recognised, and that is why a large part of my statement was concerned with that. The hon. Gentleman asked the reason for the delay in NICE&#146;s appraisal of the drugs. I understand that it is due to the tail in the system. We committed ourselves to a more rapid appraisal a year ago in our cancer strategy, and as new drugs come in we can move quickly, but the old drugs are still being appraised under the old system. It will take us some time to work our way through the backlog, but NICE has already announced that it is increasing the number of appraisal teams and standing committees and starting more appraisals earlier, so I think that the time scale is realistic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="81104-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08110438000294">The hon. Gentleman mentioned ministerial referral, which was also mentioned by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire. We are not handing the whole process over to NICE and taking politicians out of it completely, but once a drug has been referred to NICE, the process becomes a NICE process, independently run. NICE also has an enormous role in the earlier process of selecting drugs to be referred. It is responsible for the consideration panels of experts before the matter is sent to the referral oversight group, which consists of clinicians. The ministerial sign-off for which my right hon. Friend the Minister of State is responsible is a very short part of that process.</p>

 I welcome the measures proposed in the statement, which will go a long way towards speeding up the process and making more drugs available. However, I have some concerns about what my right hon. Friend has said. One of the founding principles of the NHS is that it is based on medical need rather than ability to pay. If a drug is medically necessary, how can it be right to make it accessible only to those who can afford it? If a drug is needed it should be available, and it should be available to all.</p>

 The drugs that come through the NICE process will be available, thanks to the NHS constitution which will make it absolutely clear that patients have a right to access the drugs. There will be more of those drugs coming through. The PCT exceptional circumstances committees will have a far more transparent way of considering drugs that have not come to NICE for appraisal, have been refused by NICE or are off-label, so there will be a better system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="81104-0007.htm_para11"><a name="08110438000301">I would previously have shared my hon.

Even when drugs come through the new system which are not available on the NHS&#151;and there will be fewer of them&#151;we will no longer withdraw treatment, but will ensure that it is administered privately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="81104-0007.htm_para12"><a name="08110438000303">The announcement is positive for two reasons. First, it ends the obscene threat that NHS care could be withdrawn from patients simply because they wished to access care that was not available on the NHS. Secondly, it will, I hope, act as a catalyst to widen access to beneficial treatment for cancer patients. May I, however, press the Secretary of State on the issue of continuity of care? Can he put my mind at rest by assuring me that the separate care to which he referred will not involve sending patients halfway across town to have their private care administered? I am sure he will agree that continuity of care is important, given that some drugs need to be administered concurrently, and given the condition of many patients.</p>

 I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks, and I, too, pay tribute to Brian O&#146;Boyle. The hon. Gentleman eloquently described that case of a woman who had spent her whole life in the NHS being charged for the cost of her treatment or having that treatment withdrawn, and any politician who came across the case would have felt that if there had not previously been the time to review the guidance, the time had certainly come now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="81104-0007.htm_para13"><a name="08110438000305">The hon. Gentleman raised an important question&#151;which the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for North Norfolk, also raised, but which I did not get around to addressing in my reply to him. Professor Richards says in his report that there may be circumstances in which one would need to give such care to a patient in an NHS environment for clinical safety reasons; he expects such situations to arise very rarely, but they may do so because patient safety comes first.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="81104-0007.htm_para14"><a name="08110438000306">In terms of where patients would have to go, there is currently no difference: they would have to access the medicine from the private sector. What we are saying in the report, as one of Mike Richards&#146; recommendations, is that strategic health authorities should look at this, to make sure that patients know exactly where they need to go to access the drugs in a private setting&#151;it may be in an NHS hospital, a private clinic or at home. Professor Richards and his colleagues think this is entirely appropriate, and that it will work well and will not cause any concerns, and it is certainly far better than the current system in which, as the hon. Member for Billericay pointed out, the cruelty of withdrawing such treatment is beyond anything we in this House would want to cause.</p>

 I welcome the Secretary of State&#146;s statement and his recognition that some health economies, such as Birmingham&#146;s, have already successfully worked out a way of dealing with the private sector and the NHS.

 If the drug company has not applied for this, the same circumstances will apply: the drug has not been NICE-approved, because the company has not applied to have it NICE-approved. However, that does not stop a PCT allowing that drug to be prescribed, which is why the transparent and clear process around PCT exceptional circumstances committees&#151;which is where such matters would rest&#151;is an important part of the Richards review.</p>

There are strong opinions on both sides of the argument. The evidence submitted by the Royal College of Nursing sticks in my mind. It made the point that the NHS is about providing services, not withdrawing them, and it made the cruelty case&#151;it said there was a lack of clarity and a lack of charity in how the current arrangements applied. My hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) was the first person to raise this issue with me. He said to me a while ago, &#147;Look, we need to rethink this.&#148;</p>

 I understand that. The NHS constitution, when we finally get it launched, will help in some ways. Mike Richards makes a recommendation pointing out that in the north-east of England an overview of this issue is taken, so that PCTs do not make different decisions.

 I preferred my hon. Friend&#146;s description of my statement to the Conservative party&#146;s one. I can confirm that this is all eminently doable within NICE&#146;s current budget. Medical science moves on; end-of-life treatments and the drugs available to treat rare diseases, such as melanoma and so on, were not an issue five or 10 years ago. NICE has been keen to keep pace with those changes, and there is nothing to prevent it from introducing this immediately and taking note of the consultation in five weeks&#146; time. We will then make a further announcement in January.</p>

 Does the Secretary of State accept that there are lots of unanswered questions? For example, how does he deal with the situation of an NHS consultant referring and recommending a private treatment given by himself in an NHS pay bed with the income going to that trust? How does he deal with the problem faced by someone who responds to a private treatment that keeps them alive but then runs out of money and finds that the drug is not allowed on the NHS because it worked for only a few people? Surely that treatment should then become payable by the NHS. Does he accept that more work needs to be done on those questions?</p>

 I accept that, as does Mike Richards. He has done a thorough piece of work in a short space of time; he needed to do so, given the urgency that the public attach to this. He says in his recommendations that measures need to be in place to prevent what the hon. Gentleman described. I think that the ethos and the integrity of doctors, their contract, the fact that they are not allowed to raise the issue of private drugs&#151;it must be raised by the patient, rather than by the practitioner&#151;and perhaps some other measures that we could introduce would resolve those problems. If we stick to the current system, what the hon. Gentleman describes could happen just as well, except that tied on to it would be this withdrawal of NHS treatment.</p>

 I cannot give a date for that. All I can say to my hon.

This is the way we must go if we accept that we do not want to take money away from more affluent areas. We do not want to reduce the health spend; we want to increase it for everyone, but we want to increase it most for those areas with the most deprivation. We need a gradualist approach.

<a name="81104-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="08110438000457"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require simple, uniform nutritional labelling on the front of packaged foods; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="81104-0008.htm_para2"><a name="08110438000344">In our busy lives, even with the huge improvements to the labelling of packaged food since I first tabled a food labelling Bill four years ago, we often shop in a hurry. We do not have time to stop and study labels in detail, or we might just not have very good eyesight. We need to be able to compare and choose healthy options easily and simply. Front-of-package labelling that gives at-a-glace information about how much fat, sugar and salt different foods contain is crucial for shoppers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="81104-0008.htm_para3"><a name="08110438000345">The Co-operative introduced front-of-pack labels 10 years ago and was one of the first retailers to sign up to the Food Standards Agency&#146;s traffic lights scheme. Co-op customers say that they find front-of-pack traffic lights simple and straightforward and this year the Co-op decided to include them on all products, with a few exceptions. Fruit and vegetables will have nutritional information without colour coding, because the health message in their case is the importance of five-a-day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="81104-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08110438000346">Sainsbury&#146;s uses multiple traffic lights on almost 5,000 of its own brand products and has found a strong recognition&#151;93 per cent.&#151;of the label among customers. Customers use the labels to choose sandwiches and healthy meals so that they can get healthy. The company is aiming for fewer red traffic lights by reducing salt, sugar, fat and saturated fats and removing all hydrogenated fats from its own brand products. Sainsbury&#146;s is being led by its customers, as 63 per cent. of them said that multiple traffic light labels were helping them to eat more healthily.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="81104-0008.htm_para5"><a name="08110438000347">Asda has a combination food labelling system. The traffic light approach was the option requested by customers and Asda has received hugely positive feedback since introducing it. The labels include guideline daily amounts and are designed to be read and understood in less than two seconds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="81104-0008.htm_para6"><a name="08110438000348">Many other retailers and manufacturers including Boots, Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose, McCain, Virgin Trains, National Express and YO! Sushi are using the FSA&#146;s multiple traffic light scheme. Other retailers have responded to customers&#146; desire for quick, easy-to-see information by designing other labelling schemes using guideline daily amounts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="81104-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08110438000349">Tesco&#146;s label also includes a pastel colour code for each main ingredient. At Tesco, too, front-of-pack labelling has driven changes in product content. In the last 12 months, salt levels have been reduced in more than 200 products and fat has been cut in more than 150 products. The introduction of front-of-package labels by a wide range of retailers is giving people much more control over what they eat.</p>

quarter of all children could be obese&#151;and obesity increases the risk of a range of chronic diseases, especially type 2 diabetes, stroke and coronary heart disease, cancer and arthritis.

That means that there are 16,000 people and their families in my home town with a very urgent need to know how much salt, sugar and fat their food contains, but we all want to be able to take control of what we eat and to know what is inside the packaging, and everyone needs to be able to access that information. Those who cannot read too well or calculate percentages&#151;or people who are in a hurry&#151;also need to know that information, and not just people who can understand complex variants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="81104-0008.htm_para11"><a name="08110438000353">The Food Standards Agency has commissioned a major piece of work on comprehension and use of the UK&#146;s nutrition signpost labelling schemes. The interim report published this September found that customers like front-of-package label schemes and use them to make choices, but that various issues were causing confusion for some customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="81104-0008.htm_para12"><a name="08110438000354">The FSA report said that people were confused about what the colours in traffic light labels meant, and about whether there were different guideline daily amounts for different people according to gender, age and body type. It found that people were uncertain about how GDAs related to portion size and the mathematical calculations that were needed, as well as about the meaning of the GDA pastel colours and the percentages involved. They were even confused about what the acronym &#147;GDA&#148; meant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="81104-0008.htm_para13"><a name="08110438000355">Those confusions have to be resolved in a simple system that meets the need of all consumers. Which?&#151;formerly known as the Consumers Association&#151;is absolutely clear about what needs to be done:</p>

The Food Standards Agency is carrying out extensive research to establish the best labelling approach for achieving this. The food industry needs to give their customers a helping hand by adopting the approach that works best&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="81104-0008.htm_para14"><a name="08110438000356">Over 14 million ready meals are eaten each week in Britain. Last summer, Which? bought all the cheese and tomato pizzas, beef lasagnes and chicken tikka masalas that it could find in the main supermarkets. For each type of meal, it compared the fat, saturated fat and salt content. It found that people could eat five times as much fat and more than three times the amount of salt, depending on which brand of lasagne they bought. Some pizzas had seven times as much salt as others, and five times as much fat. A curry could have three and a half times the amount of saturates or more than four times the amount of salt per 100 g, depending on which chicken tikka meal was chosen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="81104-0008.htm_para15"><a name="08110438000357">That may sound funny, but 30 per cent. of deaths from coronary heart disease and around one third of cancers are believed to be down to diet. When the FSA publishes the results of the full research project on UK nutrition signposting labelling schemes next year, the food industry must respond with simple, uniform nutritional labelling to enable people to choose healthy food.</p>

 This is now a time-limited debate, and I am anxious to ensure that we deal with all the important issues scheduled for debate today, so I shall try to be as brief as possible. I shall speak about new clauses 1, 2 and 3, but I shall seek a ballot&#151;pardon the pun; I meant a Division&#151;on new clause 2, on balloting procedure, at the appropriate time. I shall be advised by you on that, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I seek to press it to a Division following consultation with hon.

I am grateful for the advice and assistance of the Clerk to the Committee, which helped us to ensure that the new clauses were in order, and could be selected today. I also pay tribute to the Institute of Employment Rights for its tenacious pursuit of trade union rights, and its advice and assistance. In particular, I pay tribute to Carolyn Jones, John Hendy QC, and Professor Keith Ewing. I also pay tribute to the late Brian Bercusson. Together, as a team, they have provided support throughout the last two decades in trying to seek trade union reform and establish basic trade union rights once again in this country. May I also pay tribute to the many trade unionists who have campaigned on these issues over the years and lobbied Parliaments? They include many rank and file trade unionists, general secretaries and others: we all owe them a debt of gratitude for campaigning for basic trade union rights in this country.</p>

They are supported by every trade union affiliated to the TUC, they are unanimously supported by the TUC general council and they have been unanimously supported by the TUC for at least three years. My concern is that they are more important now than before. As the country moves into a recession, there is always a danger that unscrupulous employers will use the excuse or the smokescreen of recession to seek to undermine wages and conditions under which workers are employed and even to shed labour without due regard to appropriate procedures and processes. Workers will look to their trade unions for protection, and, inevitably, there will be disputes, but people will look also to the Government to provide security and protection from exploitation, loss of  <br>

employment and unfair treatment by ensuring that appropriate rights and protections are on the statute book. The three new clauses go some limited way in providing reassurance that there is legal redress against unfair treatment and victimisation, and that trade unions can operate effectively in representing their members and in implementing their members&#146; wishes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="81104-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08110438000379">The aim of new clause 1 is to provide protection from dismissal or detriment for workers taking industrial action. I think that Members in all parts of the House agree that the right to take industrial action is a fundamental right. It is guaranteed by international treaties and conventions: the International Labour Organisation conventions of 1987 and 1998; the Council of Europe&#146;s European social charter and article 11 of the European convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms; and article 8.1(d) of the United Nations international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights. The United Kingdom&#146;s law on trade unions&#151;in particular, the denial of the right to strike and to take industrial action&#151;has been held to be in breach of those international treaties by the decisions of their supervisory bodies over many years. The new clauses would not go as far as to try to incorporate or enact the international statutes in UK legislation: I wish they could. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), who was described earlier as a Fabian, will appreciate the approach of gradually improving legislation, and the moderate approach that I generally take to such matters. The aim is to protect workers taking industrial action from being sued, sacked or otherwise penalised by an employer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="81104-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08110438000380">New clause 1 would provide that dismissals in anticipation of, during or after lawful industrial action would be void and ineffective, unless the employer could show that the reason for the dismissal was not connected to the industrial action.</p>

 I have a lot of sympathy for my hon. Friend&#146;s new clauses, and I am inclined to vote for the one on which he will call a Division, but, on the point that he just made, I am concerned that we would be asking the employer to prove a negative&#151;that the interest in striking was not the reason for the proposed dismissal. I wonder whether it would not set an impossibly high hurdle, whereby someone who was threatened with dismissal could threaten to strike to invoke the new clause.</p>

 In normal dismissal cases, the employer would need to bring forward evidence that demonstrated the grounds for the dismissal. We seek that balance&#151;a demonstration of the legitimacy of dismissal&#151;in this case, so that there are legitimate grounds, other than the taking of industrial action, that the employer can demonstrate. I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns, but, in practical terms, for those of us who have been trade unionists and defended people at industrial tribunals, the emphasis is on the employer to bring evidence of why the dismissal took place. In such instances, the issue is about proving not a negative but the action, other than the relationship to industrial action, that demonstrates the grounds for dismissal.</p>

 All this is destroying my revolutionary credentials. Let me be clear: we are trying to reach a consensus with the Government.

For employers, that will act as a powerful disincentive to taking on replacement staff and making strikers redundant. Interim relief would be available in all unfair dismissal claims relating to lawful industrial action and employees who had been unfairly dismissed would be entitled to automatic reinstatement if they requested it. The same principle would apply to the imposition of a detriment on the worker by the employer. The employer would have to show that the reason was not the worker&#146;s participation or proposed participation in lawful industrial action. However, let me be clear that that would not invalidate the normal process of withholding remuneration and benefits, limited to those that the employee would have received had he or she not taken industrial action.</p>

They could not gain reinstatement orders or even compensation because the employer company had gone into liquidation. Actually, the real owner was trading at the same factory under a differently named company, and the strikers&#146; jobs had been filled by others. That was grotesquely unfair, and that example&#151;one of the starkest&#151;shocked the House and the Labour trade union movement into action.</p>

 That demonstrates how the law currently fails to protect workers undertaking lawful industrial action, and fails to provide them with any prompt and effective form of redress.

In the past, the Government&#146;s response to these proposals has been to argue that during a lawful strike, protection against dismissal has been provided for up to 12 weeks, but in practice that has proved to be illusory. The right to claim unfair dismissal and receive compensation when sacked does not amount to protection against dismissal.</p>

Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley), the last figures that I have obtained, which are admittedly 18 months out of date but show a trend, show that reinstatement was awarded in only 0.2 per cent. of tribunal cases where claims went to a hearing. That is only 0.4 per cent. of all unfair dismissal claims. Even where an employer is ordered to reinstate, they are free not to comply, subject to penalties of compensation. There are now numerous cases where it is very difficult to gain reinstatement, and even where that happens employers flagrantly refuse to comply. I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point with regard to burdens on business, but I do not believe that these proposals would be burdensome, and that has not been argued in the discussions that have taken place within Government. I think that he will understand that there is an issue of unfairness and equity if we can reach a situation whereby only 0.2 per cent. of tribunal cases result in reinstatements when so many are demanded.</p>

 That is a good point. When Tony Woodley, who was general secretary of the T&amp;G and is now joint general secretary of Unite, was the midlands organiser for the car industry, he consistently argued how much easier it was to sack workers in Britain, and therefore how much easier it was to relocate to other parts of Europe. The supervisory body of the United Nations international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights has told the Government on at least two occasions that in order to conform to their ratified obligations they need to protect the right to strike and to ensure that the dismissal of those on lawful strike is prevented and that any such dismissal must be rendered void and ineffective. The new clause would enable a form of compliance with this element of the Government&#146;s obligations and provide some protection from dismissal for workers taking lawful industrial action&#151;those who, before taking industrial action, have complied with every procedure that the Government have obliged them to with regard to balloting, notices and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="81104-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08110438000401">That brings me on to new clause 2 and balloting. The new clause attempts to resolve the ongoing administrative problems of balloting procedures for industrial action. Let us be clear about this: under the existing procedures, trade unions must, before conducting lawful industrial action, comply with extensive rules on notices and ballots. Anybody who has had practical experience of that process can demonstrate the difficulties of consciously complying with the law. It places a heavy administrative burden and costs on the unions.</p>

 As my hon. Friend knows, I used to practise in this area of law, and once those rules were introduced, it became a battle of lawyers rather than a battle of unions and employers. Time after time, I was asked to check balloting processes, and it was absolutely frustrating to find that employers would do all that they could to frustrate the ballot but would immediately rush off to court if one of the t&#146;s was not crossed. I cannot understand why, of all my hon. Friend&#146;s new clauses, the Government do no agree to this one, which I have backed. All it does is level the playing field. If an employer wants a ballot to be held, let us expect him to co-operate by giving the names and addresses of those to be balloted. What is wrong with that?</p>

The current laws require unions to provide the employer with exact numbers of members, categories of workers and the workplaces of those to be balloted, but still allow lawyers to apply for injunctions based on small technical errors, even where they have no effect on the outcome of the ballot. That cannot be just, and it cannot be right. The use of injunctions by lawyers is frustrating and undemocratic, especially when the error complained about could have no impact on the final result.

In these days of postal ballots, how on earth is the union to get the ballot papers to the members if they do not register their addresses?

First, flexible work patterns have increased among the modern work force. In some industries, workers do not have a regular workplace&#151;they often work from a distance or move between different work sites. Privatisation, out-sourcing and offshoring individual contracts in company departments have exacerbated the trend. Payment of union subscription is often made by direct debit and people do not notify the union of change of employment or workplace. Consequently, employers issue injunctions for minor technical issues, disputes escalate and the overall industrial relations climate deteriorates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="81104-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08110438000417">Let me give some examples of the farcical nature of the problems that are experienced. The Communication Workers Union and Royal Mail have already been mentioned. The Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians&#151;the building workers&#146; union&#151;finds it virtually impossible to comply with the law because so many of its members are on so many different sites that it is cost-ineffective even to try to ballot them. It is difficult to trace them at any one time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="81104-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08110438000418">The latest example involves Unite and the bus strike in London. Unite balloted its bus worker members on a wages matter. Bus drivers were being paid differently for doing the same job&#151;even on the same route&#151;because they were employed by different companies under the privatised system. There was 90 per cent. support for industrial action and the results were provided to the general secretary. As some hon. Members know, the procedure in Unite is that the general secretary receives the results, discussions take place with the national executive committee, the matter is passed on to the relevant region and it is decided whether to proceed with the action. That is perfectly appropriate and exhaustively democratic. However, because the process took 36 hours, Unite was injuncted and the industrial action could not go ahead. We are now told that the union may be threatened with damages for some action that took place.</p>

It also frustrates several managers on the ground, whose wishes have been overridden as a result of senior management decisions, after conferring with lawyers, to resort to legal action.</p>

It balloted employees of Southeastern Trains and the result was a 72 per cent. majority in support of strike action. Three days before the action was due to commence, Southeastern Trains announced that it sought an injunction against the union on the basis that the ballot was invalid because the union had not included four drivers. The union then balloted those four drivers, but it was argued that that was too late. Four votes either way would have made no difference whatever to the decision to undertake industrial action, but that action was prevented, as was, in my view, the speeding up of negotiations to resolve the dispute. There is example after example of where the Government&#146;s genuine wish to reform the balloting procedures and enable us to return to a decent industrial relations climate and re-establish basic trade union rights in this country have been frustrated because we did not go far enough in 1999 or 2004.</p>

The union will rerun the ballot, hoping to dot the i&#146;s and cross the t&#146;s, and inevitably the vote in favour of industrial action will increase dramatically, hardening attitudes on both sides and making the dispute that much harder to resolve in the long run.</p>

It is irrelevant whether the employer is in the public or private sector.

There can be poor employers in the public and private sectors.

Among the 25,000, it knows that 10,000 now have a degree of self-management, and that not all those schools are well disposed towards trade unionism. However, the union does not know which other schools might have changed their status and, as a belt and braces measure, it has to contact all of them. This involves massive expense and a great deal of uncertainty for those involved. It makes no difference to the outcome of the ballot, because a ballot has never been lost on that basis, but it does increase resource costs to union members.</p>

 We have been talking about the complicated nature of the changes taking place in the workplace, in the public and private sectors. I am sure that my hon. Friend will be aware that individual workers are often not informed of changes&#151;for example, changes involving the identity of the employer, complex corporate changes and changes to job categories. That is precisely the kind of information that the courts require be provided.

That is all that new clause 1 seeks to achieve. It seeks to ensure that employers are engaged in assisting unions to keep their records up to date, which would enable proper democratic ballots to take place. My hon. Friend mentioned Unison, and that is a good example. One of the worst things that can happen is for someone not to receive their ballot papers.

 We would then be on a par with European law, because the right to strike is in place in most European constitutions. As my hon. Friend knows, the history of this goes back to Taff Vale in 1906, when we gained impunity against actions for tort when industrial action was taking place. The interesting thing is, however, that we now have fewer trade union rights in this country than we had in 1906. After 11 years of a Labour Government, I congratulate them on some of the improvements that have been made, and I am hoping that tonight we will be able to move that bit further towards re-establishing some fundamental rights for trade unionists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="81104-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08110438000438">New clause 3 deals with agencies, and seeks to address the continuing problem of the use of agency workers by an employer to replace striking workers during an industrial dispute. I congratulate the Government on seeking to address that issue in 2003, but certain anomalies remain as a result of problems with the law. The new clause seeks to tidy up the Government&#146;s original proposals. I should like to explain that in a little more detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="81104-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08110438000439">In 2003, the Government introduced the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003. The regulations bar the use of replacement labour to carry out the duties normally performed by a worker undertaking lawful industrial action or lawful strike action. They also bar the replacement of a worker who has been assigned to do the work normally performed by a worker undertaking lawful industrial action or lawful strike action. There are, however, three fundamental weaknesses in the regulations that need attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="81104-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08110438000440">First, the regulations distinguish between an employment agency and an employment business. An employment agency introduces workers to hirers for direct employment by the hirer, and it can include temporary contracts. An employment business, on the other hand, supplies temporary and casual workers to third-party hirers. The clause barring the provision of replacement labour during lawful strikes applies only to those hired through employment businesses. If an employer hires labour through an agency rather than a business, they can avoid liability for engaging casual labour during lawful strikes. The amending provision would remove that anomaly. Secondly, the bar on supplying replacement labour applies only if the supplier knows that the worker is replacing one taking industrial action, so the onus is on the supplier of the labour to know whether industrial action has taken place. The amendment would clarify the regulations to impose a duty on the hirer&#151;the employer&#151;to inform the supplier about industrial action, and makes it unlawful for the hirer to hire replacement workers to carry out work usually done by workers who are lawfully engaged in industrial action. It closes that loophole; it is a tidying-up provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="81104-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08110438000441">Thirdly, current regulations relate to replacement labour being employed during periods of official industrial action. However, the legislation has proved ineffective in that it allows employers to hire labour just prior to industrial action, thereby letting bad employers avoid the intent of the legislation. The amending provision would ensure that replacement labour could not be used to do the work of those taking part or intending to take part in a lawful strike.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="81104-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08110438000442">My hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) provided a good example earlier when she mentioned the Communication Workers Union dispute at Royal Mail. Hon. Members will recall that the CWU took industrial action in 2007 when Royal Mail was repeatedly challenged about the recruitment of casual labour during the dispute. The union referred to the restrictions in the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003, claiming that in Bristol alone the use of casual staff increased from 12 immediately prior to the dispute to more than 250 during the dispute. The employer, the Royal Mail, insisted that it was acting in accordance with the law. So confident was it in its ability to circumvent the intention of the legislation that it established a number of operations at various  <br>

sites across the country to do the work of the striking workers, using casual labour. It did so by utilising the loopholes in the Government&#146;s legislation. The use of such tactics undermined the staff&#146;s decision to go on strike and demonstrated the failure of the regulations to prevent employers&#146; abuses, which the Government had sought to legislate against. It soured industrial relations in the Royal Mail for a long period to come.</p>

 May I provide my hon. Friend with a more up-to-date example, in that a dispute is brewing in the port of Dover? About 200 of the work force are about to be laid off or hived off to the private sector, and we heard yesterday that Dover harbour board is considering taking in Gurkhas to fill the gap. Is that not precisely the sort of loophole that we need to close to stop that sort of thing happening again?</p>

 I believe that the Government legislated with good intent to close that loophole in 2003. Let us be frank about it: scab labour was being used to undermine a legitimate dispute. The Government thought that they had seriously resolved the problem. Since 2003, however, we have seen so many examples of where employers can, with appropriate legal advice, ride a coach and horses through the legislation. That shows why we need the new clauses.</p>

 I want to add to my hon. Friend&#146;s point about the bitterness that has been caused in the unions. The Communication Workers Union does things properly and has done so for many years, and its members serve the public day in, day out. I know how much bitterness has been left in areas such as my Nine Elms and other parts of London as a result of what happened in that dispute. It has been particularly damaging and it shows precisely why the Government should accept the new clause. Otherwise, long-term damage will be done to the relationship between trade unions and the public.</p>

 I could not have said it more eloquently myself. I would add that abuse of the system by attempts to outflank the regulations also provokes unlawful wildcat action&#151;understandably, as people get so angry when other workers are brought in to take their jobs and undermine their work and conditions. Usually, as we all know, people are paid pretty exploitative wage levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="81104-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08110438000447">If the Government cannot accept the new clause, I hope that they will accept that there is an issue to be addressed and produce some proposals within a limited timetable. It was the Government themselves who sought to legislate to avoid the problem in 2003.</p>

 As my hon. Friend knows, I have signed up to his new clauses. If the Government are not minded to accept them, however, does he agree that since the previous reform was brought about through regulations, the Government could quickly produce amendments to those regulations, which could then be passed relatively quickly if they thought it desirable?</p>

 It is my view that the provisions are a tidying-up exercise, closing loopholes in legislation. It would be reasonable for the Minister to announce some consultation on appropriate delegated legislation that could deal with the problem. That would be entirely within the spirit and conform to the principle of the Government&#146;s intentions in 2003.</p>

On new clauses 1 and 3, I would welcome a statement from the Minister that there are issues to be addressed and that the Government will look into how to address them, perhaps by consulting hon. Members, trade unions and employers to see how best to move forward and ensure a good industrial relations climate in the coming period. At the very least, we should attempt to ensure fairness and prevent unequal and unfair treatment.</p>

 The Bill has wound its way between our two Houses for some time now&#151;I believe since 7 December last year&#151;with more or less agreement between the various parties on its contents, albeit with a difference of emphasis. We feel that the Bill is also a lost opportunity in failing to relieve the regulatory burden on business in respect of employment. As to these pro-union new clauses, the mood changes somewhat, as we totally oppose them. Here the true face and belief of the hard left of the Labour party is exposed and it is not a pretty sight for business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="81104-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08110447000002">The starting point of all modern industrial relations law is&#151;and has been for well over 100 years&#151;that industrial action is unlawful unless protected. In effect, participants in authorised industrial action have protections against being sued, making industrial action lawful. As such, the new clauses would represent the most fundamental change to industrial relations law for a century and could catastrophically unbalance industrial relations in the UK, empowering trade unions to bring our economy to its knees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="81104-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08110447000003">Section 238A of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 was inserted by the Employment Relations Act 1999. As it currently stands, the section provides protection to a striking employee within a framework. There is no sense that the employee is to be considered unfairly dismissed through an arbitrary action in statute. The new clause would allow striking employees to hold companies to ransom. It would serve as a brake on commercial enterprise and return us to the dark days of the 1970s&#151;three-day weeks and perpetual strike action.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman clearly does not understand industrial relations or the law. What he refers to was originally set up to ensure that when employers face a ballot for industrial action, they have good-quality information. It runs side by side with provisions such as cooling-off periods, which were introduced so that the employer and the trade unions could negotiate to try to resolve the problem and the ballot would not need to be put into action. He is wrong to tell the House that the problem is striking employees. They do not strike until after all the law on balloting has been implemented. He is wrong.</p>

 I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman says. Indeed, the Bill is reforming the law in relation to ACAS, and we have for the most part supported the provisions on that. However, with this new clause we are staring down the barrel of a return to the old nasty days. Given that 90 per cent. of the Labour party&#146;s funding comes from the very trade unions that the new clause would empower, perhaps Labour Members would welcome such a change&#151;or they are at least unable to prevent their arms from being twisted by their party&#146;s sponsors.</p>

Jobs will be lost and businesses may fold. The last thing the Government should do is hand the power to self-interested employee groups to hold companies to ransom. The Government would be wrong to do anything that more than simply dismisses the new clause.

 The trade unions have not personally approached me to discuss the new clause, but it seems as though they have approached a lot of Labour Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="81104-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08110447000016">Let me mention the worst aspects of the new clause from the Conservatives&#146; point of view. It would be virtually impossible to dismiss a worker conducting industrial action under proposed new section 238A(1) and (2). Currently, employers can only fairly dismiss workers who are conducting union-approved industrial action where, first, there has been no proper ballot; secondly, they have made reasonable steps to resolve their trade dispute; thirdly, they dismiss every striking worker; and fourthly, they do not re-engage any of them within a three-month period. Although that scenario is extremely rare, the provisions are vital. They ensure that an employer can ultimately get on with business when striking workers are making unreasonable demands. In our view, the provisions clearly already provide reasonable protection to those who are conducting authorised action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="81104-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08110447000017">Industrial action short of a strike would be legalised by proposed new section 238A(3) and (4). The effective legalisation of action short of a strike, such as work-to-rule or a sit-in, would empower unions in a way not seen since the 1970s, when work-to-rule formed part of the action taken by unions intent on crippling the economy. Unbelievably, unions would no longer be liable for the consequences of their actions under the new clause. That is of fundamental importance. Under the current law, injunctions can be granted against trade unions by the courts and damages awarded where actions that they have endorsed are viewed as unjustified or disproportionately damaging to the employer. That provides an important check and balance against inappropriate behaviour and is mirrored by a substantial body of law restricting an employer&#146;s conduct in a trade dispute. By removing liability on a worker engaged in industrial action, the unions would no longer be liable either. That would fundamentally unbalance industrial relations in our country.</p>

Proposed new section 113A to the Employment Rights Act 1996 would make it impossible to make redundancies wherever industrial action occurs, even if the whole business would collapse as a result. Requiring employers to provide the detailed information necessary for ballots would place an unfair administrative burden on them during tough times. Moreover, the new clause would shift responsibility for conducting a proper ballot from the unions to employers, effectively giving the union someone else to blame if there are flaws in their paperwork or ballot conduct.</p>

That too goes one step further than the current provisions of section 238A, thus pushing the new clause further into the category of what we see as unacceptable. I am afraid that, from a pro-business standpoint, it loses none of its initial unreasonableness as it proceeds. Taken as a whole, the new clauses would tie the hands of business in an unacceptable manner, at a time when we should be unburdening businesses to allow them to survive these turbulent times.</p>

Again, trade union representatives are seeking preferential treatment for those on strike, or, in this particular case, those about to strike. On a fundamental level, I find the new clause difficult to swallow. It would place a duty on an employer to assist in an action that would harm their own business, which is akin to asking a condemned man to tie his own noose.</p>

That right should not be further extended to impose a duty on companies to assist union members in bringing their action within the protection of the legislation. If union officials cannot do that themselves, and also need the company to supply the details of their own members, I cannot see why they deserve the protection that the new clause would provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="81104-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08110447000034">Unlike some Members, I have listened carefully to both sides of the argument, and have taken advice from both the TUC and the CBI. On new clause 1, I cannot quite agree with the CBI, which has said:</p>
<a name="81104-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="08110447000070"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Implying that industrial action is inherently lawful would represent the most fundamental change to industrial relations law in generations&#151;and could empower trade unions to bring our economy to its knees&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="81104-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08110447000036">New clause 1 would replace the section of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 which deals with the dismissal procedures applying to those who participate in official industrial action with a new section that strengthened the protection of employees participating in lawful industrial action. The question is whether the onus should be on the employer to prove that a dismissal was not related to a strike, or on the employee to prove that it was. If the dispute was about wages the new clause would work, but if it related to disciplinary charges or charges of victimisation, it might well encourage workers to go on strike in the knowledge that they could not be sacked. Although I am very sympathetic to the aims of the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), I hope that the Government will investigate the new clause further, and return with a proposal on which all Members can agree.</p>

 The hon. Lady says that strike action can have an onerous effect on employers. I was an officer for the Unite trade union for 20 years, and never once encountered a trade union member who wished to go on strike. Employees never gain from strike action: they lose money that they never get back, and they can only ever achieve what they were aiming for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="81104-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08110447000044">The hon. Lady should bear in mind the fact that although employers have legitimate claims about industrial action, so do employees. That is why the law is couched in a way that protects employees against detriment. Any employee whose name is not on the list is not protected; the aim of including all the names on the list is to protect the employees as well as the employer.</p>

 My right hon. Friend highlights the complete chaos that still exists within the trade unions. Perhaps before the unions go to the employers and ask where their members are, they should make a point of contacting their members and explaining to them how much of their contribution to the trade union goes to the Labour party and is bankrolling the Government. That is crucial, because if they are doing that&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Labour Members say from a sedentary position they are doing that now, but if they are doing that, they do not need an employer&#146;s help to find out where their members are.

They and the union concerned were very careful to follow the rules and the law. They acted properly, and they remained united with the support of the local community. They won their case at the industrial tribunal because, fortuitously, my predecessor, Dafydd Wigley, kept recorded contemporaneous accounts of a telephone conversation with the employer, which revealed his real intentions, which were to provoke a strike, sack the workers, strip the assets from the company and make away with large sums of money. That is what happened at Friction Dynamex, and the aftermath is that Friction Dynamex has closed, the factory is derelict, the workers have been dispersed and have received no compensation, and the employer has now set up in another town and, from all accounts, is up to his old tricks again.</p>

Had these provisions been in place, there would also have been a disincentive to bad employers to set up in the first place, setting in train the sort of wicked plans the employer at Friction Dynamex followed. I hope the Government take notice of this debate and look carefully at changing the provisions so that good employment practices can drive out the bad. That is no small prize.</p>

 Let me begin by thanking the many hon. Friends who have turned up to support this important Bill, which deals with a number of issues that are close to our hearts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="81104-0012.htm_para23"><a name="08110455000004">I think it is safe to say that the new clauses would take the Bill into some new areas compared with the debates we have had so far, and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) said, some of them reflect the private Member&#146;s Bill that he and other Members sponsored not long ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="81104-0012.htm_para24"><a name="08110455000005">New clause 1 proposes extensive changes to the law protecting individuals against dismissal or the suffering of other detriment for taking, or proposing to take, industrial action. My hon. Friend is always modest when proposing these changes; he describes them as modest and minor tidying procedures, but although I appreciate that these are sometimes subjective judgments I am not sure whether everything he has said would be regarded as such.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="81104-0012.htm_para25"><a name="08110455000006">The law with which new clause 1 deals was changed by the Employment Relations Acts 1999 and 2004, which introduced two new forms of protection against dismissal for employees taking part in protected industrial action&#151;in other words, action that is official and lawfully organised. The first protection was that it became automatically unfair to dismiss individuals for taking protected industrial action lasting 12 weeks or less&#151;we also discounted lock-out days from the calculation of that 12-week period. My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington and the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams), who spoke for the Welsh nationalists, mentioned the Friction Dynamics dispute. Some of these changes came in after that dispute, and reflect the changed legal picture since.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="81104-0012.htm_para26"><a name="08110455000007">The second protection covers the actions taken by an employer to resolve a trade dispute with a trade union. Under the law, it is unfair to dismiss a person for taking any form of protected industrial action, including action lasting more than 12 weeks, where the employer has failed to take reasonable procedural steps to try to resolve the trade dispute&#151;a protection does extend beyond the 12 weeks where the employer refuses to engage. Those significant protections have come into force since some of the disputes that have been mentioned, and they cover the vast bulk of official industrial action. Most industrial action is relatively short-lived; few disputes last more than 12 weeks. We can argue about the past, but the statutory protections against dismissal are greater than have been in place for a long time.</p>

Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington believes that the law should specify in detail what sanctions short of dismissal the employer may apply against those taking part in protected industrial action and that those sanctions should be limited to the loss of earnings when the workers are on strike and, therefore, not working. That is typically what happens at the moment, although I accept that there can be disputes about this. For example, I understand that in a recent case in the education sector there was concern that the employer had deducted larger sums from pay than was fair in relation to the dispute. The court found in favour of the union member, stating that the employer had incorrectly  <br>

calculated the amounts of pay to be deducted. In that case, the existing law provided an adequate constraint against abuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="81104-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08110455000009">New clause 1 contains an extensive proposal to change the law by making it, in effect, unlawful for an employer to terminate a contract, where it is broken by a worker, for taking protected industrial action. The new clause would make it automatically unfair to dismiss an employee if any of the reasons concerned the taking of protected industrial action and would lift the limit of compensation.</p>

<p><a name="st_o299"><a name="08110455000010"><a name="81104-0013.htm_spnew0"><a name="08110455000544"><b>Mr. Binley:</b>
 The Minister will know that I welcomed the Bill in Committee, specifically because it placed more responsibility on ACAS to negotiate before tribunals were reached. Does he recognise that new proposed new section 238AA(2) opens up the opportunity for vexatious cases in the way that I described in Committee? Such an approach has helped to create a blackmail culture, which has made many small businesses give in to charges because it is cheaper to do so than to fight them. Will this proposal not simply open that up again?</p>

<p><a name="st_o300"><a name="08110455000011"><a name="81104-0013.htm_spnew1"><a name="08110455000545"><b>Mr. McFadden:</b>
 Elsewhere in the Bill we are strengthening the role of ACAS in dispute resolution, as is right. We have also committed to increase funding to ACAS in order that it may fulfil this role. That is the right thing to do, because if we can resolve more disputes before they reach a tribunal, that is in the interests of all concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="81104-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08110455000012">New clause 1 also proposes that tribunals be required to order the reinstatement or re-engagement of people sacked under these provisions. Under the new clause, the tribunal would not have a judgment to make about the suitability of reinstatement. This is a delicate area, because automatic reinstatement may not be suitable in all cases. As we know, tribunals can order reinstatement in some circumstances. I appreciate the intent behind the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington, but there is at least a question to be answered about why unfair dismissal on the grounds covered in his new clause should be treated differently from unfair dismissal on the grounds of discrimination or disability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="81104-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08110455000013">New clause 1 is based on the premise, which the Government do not share, that the law governing these matters is grossly unfair to one party. There will always be debate about the balance in these situations, but we believe that, through the reforms that I have cited, we have put in place a fair and balanced system of protection for those taking industrial action.</p>

<p><a name="st_o301"><a name="08110455000014"><a name="81104-0013.htm_spnew2"><a name="08110455000546"><b>Mr. McCartney:</b>
 An important aspect lies in ensuring that a tribunal has the capacity to take a decision other than reinstatement. There are occasions when between being dismissed unfairly and a tribunal decision the worker seeks and gains employment somewhere else. If it is simply a matter of reinstatement, they will lose the opportunity to be compensated for the loss of their job and for being dismissed unfairly. It is crucial that the options should include reinstatement, but, where that is not in the worker&#146;s interests, an alternative to reinstatement should be forced on an employer, if necessary, by the tribunal.</p>

Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington may view this is a minor tidying amendment, but I am not sure whether that is how it would be seen.</p>

 The Minister will be aware that there are 274,000 companies in the construction industry and that an amalgam of companies work on many of the larger sites. Many of the employees are falsely self-employed, so it becomes terrifically difficult to organise any kind of industrial action in a way that will engage everyone who is working and who has the right to strike. A provision of this nature would cover those circumstances.</p>

 As I said, representations have been made to us about the difficulty that the law imposes on trade unions&#146; organising industrial action. There is a rationale behind that difficulty, because we want disputes to be properly organised and for there to be a ballot where people can express their views in private and make a free choice. In response to those representations, is the right thing to do, as the new clause proposes, to place an onus on the employer to aid the union in organising the industrial action?</p>

 My hon. Friend is over-interpreting what I am saying; I am saying that we have received representations about this matter, but I am not indicating what he suggested. He says that the employer should assist the trade unions because the obligations on them are too onerous and small slips by a union can result in legal action against it, the granting of injunctions and so on. The new duty on the employer that he proposes would relieve what he sees as an excessive burden on the union. Again, I hope that he would acknowledge that we took steps in the 1999 and 2004 Acts to clarify industrial action law. About a dozen measures were taken to unravel some of the complexity in that area. For example, new section 232B of the 1992 Act permits the court to disregard small accidental failures by the trade union to comply with key aspects of the law on industrial action ballots&#151;so some flexibility has been provided.</p>

 My hon. Friend is correct to say that the Government have introduced legislation in the interests of working people and employers. I am not a lawyer, but the crux of the matter&#151;this is what exercises me greatly&#151;is that there is a difference between the approach to law in a criminal court, which is there to see justice done, and that of an industrial court, which is there to see the word of the law carried out. Industrial courts are very much colder and deal with much more specific situations. No matter what the member for the Fire Brigades Union, the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning), says, it is almost impossible for organisations as big as trade unions to be word perfect and on the dot.</p>

During those 36 hours, the union was injuncted because the employer was not informed in time. I do not believe that anyone would consider it reasonable for the court to make such a decision.</p>

 Employers, such as the Post Office, rightly have the opportunity to write to their employees about why they should not strike. If that happens, it means that the employer has decided what position the work force is likely to take in the ballot. That must mean that it has the information available to enable it to write to its work force. Employers and trade unions should have access to a common list of people with whom to communicate. Increasingly, employers, such as the Royal Mail, that take unions to court will have already written to employees&#151;legitimately&#151;asking them not to take part in a dispute.

 Regulation 7 already contains provisions prohibiting employment businesses from supplying temporary workers to replace workers who are taking part in a strike or other form of industrial action. The same regulation prevents employment businesses from supplying temporary workers to do the work of other workers who have been transferred by the business to do the work normally done by individuals taking action. New clause 3 seeks to add to that provision by placing similar prohibitions on businesses that seek to hire agency workers and by requiring those businesses to inform the employment business of any strike or other industrial action when seeking to hire workers wholly or partly as a result of that industrial action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="81104-0013.htm_para10"><a name="08110455000044">Representations have been made to me and to the Department about compliance with that provision. Although the employment business is liable to be prosecuted for any unlawful supply of agency workers, the allegation is made that non-compliance could be at the behest of the business hiring the agency workers. In addition, there might be circumstances where the agency is not aware whether the workers it supplies are working in an area that is affected by industrial action. That is the representation that is sometimes made. I know that we have been given examples, but we have received few reports that the existing provisions have not proved effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="81104-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08110455000045">There have been a number of investigations by the employment agency standards inspectorate into complaints about breaches of the provision and, in the vast majority of cases, the inspectors have not found evidence of non-compliance. Indeed, there is evidence that agencies take their responsibilities under the provision very seriously, frequently warning their client companies that they cannot supply workers to replace those taking strike action. The new clause would also require businesses to inform the employment business of such action when seeking to hire workers, but unions often inform the employment businesses that industrial action is taking place in order to ensure that the employment business cannot claim to have no knowledge of it.</p>

They do not feel that they have the appropriate protections. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) made a point about international law and ILO conventions, and yes, we are in breach of them. We have consistently been in breach of them. Various international reports, which I listed earlier, have emphasised that point. We no longer have the standards of industrial and trade union rights in this country that apply across the rest of Europe.

 First, I pay tribute to the Public and Commercial Services Union. The new clause had its genesis in a conference of PCS environmental representatives last year. They discussed the role that they could play in tackling climate change, and the significant role of workplace representatives. The new clause therefore seeks to provide the right in law to time off work for trade union representatives who serve as environmental representatives. It would ensure reasonable  <br>

time off to promote environmentally sustainable practices at work, carry out environmental audits, consult on environmental policies and carry out environmental risk assessments. It would also allow time off for training for environmental workplace representatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="81104-0015.htm_para0"><a name="08110461000014">The law currently entitles trade union representatives to reasonable time off to fulfil trade union responsibilities regarding industrial relations and health and safety matters. That is covered by the ACAS code of practice on time off for trade union duties and activities. Trade unions are working in partnership with employers to play a greater role, particularly with regard to raising awareness of environmental issues, and to develop company policies on green workplace initiatives and practices. I give the example of PCS, which has a range of environmental representatives working in various Government Departments. Those representatives are increasingly active in developing policies to tackle climate change, prevent carbon emissions and improve the environmental standards in their workplaces. They have also established a national green forum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="81104-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08110461000015">Why is the issue important? Half of carbon emissions are work related. Businesses and other organisations therefore have a critical role to play in reducing emissions. Staff at all levels need to be involved. The collective action of employees, working with employers, can lead to changes in policy and individual behaviour. To date, many employers have been slow to implement carbon reduction policies and wider environmental measures. Policy statements may well have been produced, but they have not yet been translated into practical action. The Labour Research Department found that one in nine employers had comprehensive measures on energy efficiency in place. More than half did not provide any training on environmental issues, and fewer than a quarter had environmental management plans in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="81104-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08110461000016">Trade unions are now developing their role to work with employers to ensure that they develop environmentally sustainable policies and practices within individual companies and organisations, and green&#151;environmental&#151;representatives from trade unions can play an important role in constructing and developing a practical agenda for implementation in the workplace. Staff are willing to get involved. A recent survey demonstrated their willingness to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and their feeling that employers are not doing enough and employees need more support from employers to develop those policies. In the House, two early-day motions on that issue have been tabled over the past two years, and the last one received the support of more than 102 Members.</p>

The Government need to recognise that&#151;not dampen the enthusiasm of those who have become involved in such work through the trade unions&#151;and respond constructively. On that basis, I urge the Government to consider the new clause for inclusion if not in this legislation, then in some subsequent Bill.

 Looking at new clause 4, I wonder whether its promoters actually understand the meaning of work. The hon.

We find that unacceptable. Moreover, I received a letter dated 28 October 2008 from a Chris Baugh, the assistant general-secretary of PCS, in which he said that PCS had tabled an amendment to the Bill. I must say that I did not know that unions could table amendments in this place. Would the hon.

A number of Members from all parts of the House are members of various trade union groups, as I am, and, on an all-party basis, they listen to the views of the unions and, if they agree with them, bring them before the House.

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="81104-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08110461000037">There are several problems with the new clause. First, every business should be involved with environmentally sound practices, but we fail to see why employees who have trade union membership should have time off work for environmental issues when their colleagues at the next workstation simply have to get on with their work. Secondly, we do not appreciate the way in which the new clause attempts to unionise environmental issues in the workplace. &#147;Workplace environmental reps&#148; smacks of Orwellian, Big Brother tactics by unions. By bringing the issue within their remit, they seem to be attempting to secure preferential treatment for their members and, at the same time, to give their union a point of leverage over the business. Finally, we fail to see why the actions in proposed new section 43A(2) to the Employment Act 2002 would be better carried out by a trade union than by a company. If the proposal is for the workplace environmental rep to be there to oversee the company&#146;s own efforts, the new clause needs redrafting.</p>

 I am sure that trade unions can make constructive comments and talk with management and other third parties about how they think the workplace should be improved environmentally; that does not mean that we should legislate for time off.</p>

In these times of economic uncertainty, we must be careful in respect of the fundamental necessities. Continued employment, economic growth, financial stability and so on are all factors that must line up alongside the environment when we strike the balance. We support responsible, environmentally sound business practice, but we also support business efficiency and businesses&#146; freedom of choice on how best to reach their overall environmental targets. That is why we oppose the new clause.</p>

It is that there is a reality not only to the concept of freedom of association, but to that of the freedom not to associate. That concept is accepted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which some years back expelled members with a pro-hunting agenda who had infiltrated it. It is also accepted by Churches; it would be inconceivable for people to be able to join a Church if they did not subscribe to its views. Furthermore, the concept is accepted by all political parties; mine has certainly sought to expel those whose aims are incompatible with its own. In that context, it is right and proper that the concepts of freedom of association and freedom not to associate should be exercisable by our trade unions.</p>

For example, it does not accept the ethnically Asian or those who are of African or Caribbean origin. The BNP itself accepts that the freedom not to associate is legitimate. I would not normally ever pray the BNP in aid, but it is worth recognising that although it prohibits certain people from membership, it does not respect that principle in the context of the trade union movement.</p>

The BNP is abhorrent and horrid, but we are discussing a catch-all new clause that could catch any other political party in future.</p>

place on record the fact that the background to this whole situation is a decision by the European Court of Human Rights, which is controversial among some Conservative Members, although not among Labour ones. The Court sat in judgment on a case between ASLEF and Jay Lee, a BNP member who was expelled from the union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="81104-0015.htm_para21"><a name="08110461000054">Industrial tribunals in the United Kingdom had held that the union had behaved unlawfully in expelling Mr. Lee. The Court, however, stated that:</p>

Similarly, the right to join a union &#145;for the protection of his interests&#146; cannot be interpreted as conferring a general right to join the union of one&#146;s choice irrespective of the rules of the union: in the exercise of their rights under Article 11 § 1 unions must remain free to decide, in accordance with union rules, questions concerning admission to and expulsion from the union&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="81104-0016.htm_para0"><a name="08110461000055">The Court made a clear decision that ASLEF&#146;s action was legitimate. To return to the point made by the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning), I should emphasise that the Court said that unions must remain free to decide in accordance with union rules; that is an important conditioner of union behaviour and of what the law means. The Court&#146;s decision was unequivocal. It went on to say that any restriction on a union&#146;s right to expel should be proportionate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="81104-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08110461000056">Let me concede at this point that the Government&#146;s intentions have been proper: to make domestic law consistent with the judgment of the ECHR. Nothing lies between the Minister and other Labour Members&#151;and, I hope, others across the House&#151;in wanting that ambition to be achieved. As I said, when it made its first progress in the House of Lords, the Bill had a form of words that would have been acceptable to all parties, certainly to the Government and Labour Members. At that point the Government view was, rightly, that the combination of existing statute, union rule books, unions&#146; legal obligation to conform to their rule books, and the capacity of the certification officer to rule on what the unions did, provided adequate protection against arbitrary or unfair expulsion or a refusal to accept for membership not BNP members but Conservative trade unionists, perhaps, or those from certain religious backgrounds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="81104-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08110461000057">There is already protection against such arbitrariness in the law, save where it is clear in the rule book that that expulsion can take place in a way that is consistent with that rule book. I would say to the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead that under the clause as it stands, or under the amendment, the capacity of the union to change its rules to expel a member of the Labour party, for example, still exists. Under any of these formulations, it would be possible for a union to expel a member for political or other reasons as long as that was consistent with the rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="81104-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08110461000058">However, it is almost inconceivable that that would take place in a society such as ours. There is no evidence that any member of the Conservative party has ever been expelled by any trade union&#151;the Fire Brigades Union or any other&#151;or that people have been expelled from trade unions for being members of the Labour party. That is because the values of the Conservative party, even though I do not share them, are consistent with the objectives of British trade unions&#151;as are, clearly, the values of the Labour party. There is no inconsistency there; the inconsistency comes with a  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="81104-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08110461000059">The problem with the amendments that the Government accepted in the House of Lords is that they have moved the agenda on to give too much protection to the individual who feels disgruntled by this process at the expense of the rights of the collective. In particular, these changes ignore the general principle of the right of any organisation&#151;political party, charity or trade union&#151;to freedom of association or freedom not to associate. The interests of an individual fascist who does not want to be a member of the same union as black, Jewish or Asian colleagues are put ahead of the rights of those black, Jewish or Asian colleagues not to want to be a member of a trade union with a fascist involved. That is an important freedom that is being eroded.</p>

 The problem is that picking on a specific party&#151;I do not want to give it too much oxygen&#151;does not prevent someone who is openly fascist from being a member of a trade union. The danger lies in picking on a political party rather than an individual. As I understand it, this is not about the BNP but about abhorrent views of individuals.

The question now arises whether the way in which he was expelled by ASLEF would be consistent with the law as it will be under the Bill as drafted. Jay Lee was a member of the BNP&#151;there is no ambiguity about that. ASLEF&#146;s rule book says that</p>
<a name="81104-0016.htm_brev1"><a name="08110461000120"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;no person shall be admitted into membership of ASLEF if by choice they are members of, supporters of, or sympathisers with, organisations which are diametrically opposed to the objects of the union, such as a fascist organisation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="81104-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08110461000063">That focuses more on racism than on naming the BNP, and there are good reasons for not naming the BNP. ASLEF&#146;s rules clearly state that membership of ASLEF is incompatible with being a member of a fascist organisation. Jay Lee undoubtedly was such a person, and ASLEF resolved at its conference to expel him. That was consistent with its rule book, and the European Court held that it was a legitimate and legal thing for it to do.</p>

I think that the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead was with me in saying that we should be considering fascists, not just members of the BNP. In that case, he may find himself, surprisingly, on the same side as me in hoping that the Government will move on this.

Almost inevitably, the ability to change a union&#146;s rule book is not an instantaneous process. This is not Adam Smith&#146;s invisible hand&#151;it has to take place at certain moments. I therefore fear that the fascist party can always be one step ahead of the union.</p>

 Let me answer that simply. I do not think that what the hon. Gentleman refers to is different from a political party. Hopefully, our great political parties have a great material impact on the people of this country, and I would not want to allow the suggestion to run abroad that being a member of a political party is trivial, or membership of a Church for that matter. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which has specific ambitions, expelled some members whose expulsion was held to be legal because it was consistent with what that organisation sought to do.</p>

 I would like to back up the point of my hon. Friend the Minister. I do not see any reading of clause 19 that supports the idea that a political party would have to be named in the union&#146;s rules. To support what the Minister said, clause 19 says that conduct has to be contrary to a rule or an objective, not a rule and an objective, so it catches rather more than the Minister suggested.</p>

 Yes, except for the fact that, as my hon. Friend knows, some good legal opinion says, &#147;We do not know what an objective means.&#148; It is not well defined in the Bill or more generally. We know what the rule book is, but to talk about the objectives of the union is to talk about an amorphous concept. With great respect to my hon. Friend, I know that he has far more legal experience than I have, but he does not have more legal experience than all the lawyers I have spoken to. He and other lawyers disagree, which does not mean to say that he is wrong, but he and my hon. Friend the Minister have to reflect on the fact that if lawyers are disagreeing at this point, the Bill is not good law. That is the issue we have to address.</p>

 Is not the more fundamental problem that there is no definition of what a political party is? It does not have to be a political party at all; it could be a lobbying organisation.</p>

 It could indeed be a lobbying organisation if, as in the case of ASLEF, it is a membership organisation that is fascist. That touches on what we are seeking to achieve. The ASLEF rulebook was consistent with its ambition to drive racists out of the union because they are incompatible with the rest of its members. It is important that it can so proscribe, which is why we do not want to build into the Bill the need to name the BNP or whatever. There is obviously a dispute between us as to whether that is necessary.</p>

 Sometimes in the trade union movement we are in danger, if we are not careful, of taking an opinion from a lawyer and placing it against another lawyer&#146;s opinion while failing to have an opinion ourselves.

It is precisely because lawyers clashed on the matter in the first place that we ended up with the ASLEF decision going to the industrial tribunal. The tribunal made its decision, but it was overturned at the European court, and that was not because lawyers disagreed over some academic legal exercise. Sometimes, lawyers disagree about the most profound issues that affect real people&#146;s lives. That is what we are talking about.</p>

 The Government do not seem to understand that the critical principle is not about membership of a political party but about active racism and fascism. The case that the Attorney-General recently prosecuted provided a good example of the sort of person whom unions would not want as a member. A fascist was prosecuted for the first time in this country for uploading a neo-Nazi website from America that would have been banned in this country.  <br>

 I agree, and stress that the Government share that objective. We are not disputing objectives, but I am not sure what those of the Conservative party are.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman said that we opposed clause 19&#151;that is not the case. The Conservative party appreciates and respects the finding of the European Court of Human Rights. Indeed, the clause that we are discussing is a compromise provision that Liberal Democrats and Conservatives in the other place proposed. Our opinion is that it still needs refining.</p>

<p><a name="st_o387"><a name="08110461000099"><a name="81104-0017.htm_spnew2"><a name="08110461000183"><b>Tony Lloyd:</b>
 We are at one about that, but I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman&#146;s definition of refinement and mine are the same.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08110461000100">There are serious doubts about whether the Bill as it stands achieves what we all support&#151;compatibility with the European Court&#146;s decision, and unions&#146; ability to expel fascists from their organisation. However, the serious concerns apply not only to the measure&#146;s overall structure but more narrowly to the belt and braces of the clause. As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, there is a genuine question about what &#147;objectives&#148; mean and how the word is interpreted. He shakes his head, and he may want to comment further when he makes a speech, but the point has been made by reputable members of his profession. Although I accept the injunction of my right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield not to take seriously questions between lawyers, it is important that we know what we are talking about when considering clause 19.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08110461000101">There are concerns about the Bill&#146;s rigidity and inflexibility, especially the provision to protect those who are excluded&#151;not expelled&#151;from joining, which would not apply to any other organisation. The European Court of Human Rights did not ask for a would-be member of a union who was turned down because of membership of a fascist organisation to be given a hearing about the reason for the refusal. That is unlike anything that would happen in other organisations. If the Conservative party decided not to accept someone, it would not hold a hearing to determine whether that was right and proper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08110461000102">Clause 19 also uses the words, &#147;exceptional hardship&#148;. We know what exceptional hardship means for someone who loses a job&#151;that concept is clearly understood. However, exceptional hardship for being refused membership of a union is not well defined. We do not know how a court would define it. That creates ambiguity for any union that tries to use clause 19, yet we have been told that the provision is straightforward. Will the ambiguity mean that unions would not use the provision, and therefore not have the power that we want to give them? If they used the provision, would they risk being taken before a tribunal?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08110461000103">Why does the Bill use the same terms as those that relate specifically to somebody losing a job? Under existing law, which the Government introduced, it is illegal for an employer to sack somebody for non-membership of a trade union. We got rid of the closed  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08110461000104">I also wish to ask about the amount of compensation. The sum of &#163;6,900 for someone who manages to find a technical fault in the process whereby a union excludes or expels is a heavy penalty for the union, and brings us back to the British nationalists&#146; advice to their members: &#147;If you&#146;re not a member of a union, then join.&#148; Those who look to be thrown out to get a big five-figure pay-out should make it known to the local union that they are BNP members. The BNP clearly perceives such legislation as a cash cow that can fund the party.</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend, but does he know that the average award to employees who have successfully claimed unfair dismissal is much lower? The last I heard, compensation averaged &#163;3,000. Why should there be a difference?</p>

 My question is, why should there be compensation at all in the case that we are considering? However, as my hon. Friend says, why is it out of line with other forms of compensation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08110461000107">If new clause 6 were adopted instead of the current provisions, it would grant the flexibility that the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead seeks. It would provide for a much more general process that was consistent with the union rule book. The union rule book could&#151;as the ASLEF rule book did&#151;specify that</p>
<a name="81104-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="08110461000125"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;no person shall be admitted into membership... if... they are members of, supporters of, or sympathisers with organisations which are diametrically opposed to objects of the union, such as a fascist organisation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08110461000108">That is clear, albeit general, and covers the problem of rotating party membership. It would grant genuine protection to those who sought it against arbitrary and unfair expulsion or exclusion because of membership of other parties&#151;the Labour party, the Conservative party and so on. The union would be restricted by the rule book and by statute, which would insist on proper reference to the due procedures of a trade union. There are also the principles of natural justice and the role of the certification officer, who has stronger powers in a trade union than the equivalent in a private company. I therefore believe that, for example, the Conservative trade unionist and the Labour trade unionist are protected. The new clause is specifically about unions invoking their rule book to get rid of or not accept those who are avowedly fascist. We should all share that ambition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para7"><a name="08110461000109">I therefore recommend that my hon. Friend the Minister revert to the law before it was changed, as set out in new clause 6. If he cannot accept the new clause, he must demonstrate how the genuine doubts that have been raised about the workability of clause 19 can be properly addressed. We cannot find that we have not moved matters on&#151;that would be a victory not only for those who want to amend the measure in the wrong way, but for the BNP and its supporters.</p>

tabled a related amendment to the Climate Change Bill, which was not picked up. However, my party is very happy to support his new clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para8"><a name="08110475000004">New clause 6 would repeal outright those provisions in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 that provide for individuals employed in industries that require union members not to be unreasonably excluded or expelled from any trade union. I have a great deal of sympathy for the comments that the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd) made, but the proposal ignores the European Court of Human Rights judgment in ASLEF <i> v</i>. the UK, to which he referred at some length. I will not go into that, but noble Lords from all parties in the other place worked hard to construct the current law, including the noble Lord Morris, so unfortunately we are not in a position to support new clause 6.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para9"><a name="08110475000005">Clause 19 may not be perfect, but the best brains from all parties in the Lords worked hard to draft amendments that were acceptable. Therefore, we cannot support amendment No. 3.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para10"><a name="08110475000006">Amendment No. 10 calls for an individual&#146;s membership of a political party to become relevant only if it fell within the 12 months prior to their application for membership of a trade union. I can completely understand the reasoning behind the amendment. If someone became a member of an unacceptable party such as the BNP when they were 15 and then wished to join a trade union at 40, it seems unfair that they should be penalised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08110475000007">However, there is another side to the argument. A trade union should have the right to expel whomever it feels it wants to expel. Imposing conditions such as those in amendments Nos. 10 and 11 would amount to the Government telling trade unions whom they could and could not have as members. If the Government starting telling political parties whom they could and could not have as members, they would not countenance such interference.</p>

 But political parties can decide to exclude someone. If someone brought our party into disrepute, they could be excluded, including for something that they had done before joining. I am sure that the same is true for the Labour party, although I do not know about the Liberals.</p>

 I am not sure that I get the hon. Gentleman&#146;s drift. My point is that any party or trade union should have the right to expel whomever it feels should be expelled. Of course there need to be safeguards, however, and that is completely understood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08110475000010">The principle behind amendment No. 11 is the same. The trade unions should be allowed to exclude whomever they please. If we are talking about a new party that is not yet registered or a party that is changing its name in order to get round the rules, it should still be possible for trade unions to exclude whomever they feel it appropriate to exclude, without being placed in a straitjacket. It is up to trade unions to decide, just as it is up to political parties to decide.</p>

to which I am a signatory, in order to respond to the rather weird tirade that we heard from the Conservative Front Bench on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08110475000012">Delivering the green agenda in the workplace can be done only in co-operation with the work force and the unions, even if it just means persuading people to turn the light bulbs off when they go home. To suggest that the activities set out in proposed new section 43A(2) to the Employment Act 2002, such as consulting on the workplace environment, should not be done in the firm&#146;s time, given that the environmental reps will have to negotiate with the employer about the issue, is frankly ludicrous. I therefore support new clause 4.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para14"><a name="08110475000013">My real reason for speaking is to address new clause 6 and the ASLEF judgment. The Joint Committee on Human Rights, which I chair, a little while ago published a scrutiny report on the issue&#151;our 17th report of the Session. I apologise to the House that the report was not tagged on to today&#146;s debate, which it perhaps ought to have been, because it deals at length with the ASLEF judgment and its implications. When the ASLEF case went through the European Court of Human Rights, the Government rightly accepted the need to amend the law in the light of that Strasbourg judgment. They consulted on two options, the first of which was effectively the option proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd) and the second of which was not quite the option in clause 19. That was the right thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para15"><a name="08110475000014">When we scrutinised the issue in our Committee, my view was very much along the lines of my hon. Friend&#146;s view. Having practised in that area of law and written a number of union rule books, I thought that the existing safeguards were adequate. The historic safeguard is the fact that the union rulebook is a contract with the membership that is subject to enforcement through contractual law and natural justice, and more latterly through the certification officer process. We discussed the issue at some length, having the benefit of advice from our legal adviser and the opportunity to look at some of the other debates. I came to the conclusion that we simply could not rely on the traditional safeguards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para16"><a name="08110475000015">The first point is about the possible impact on other political parties. The debate has focused on the BNP, but the risk is that the provisions could go beyond. We have heard a pretty anti-union tirade from the Conservative party tonight, which has reverted to type. It has been said that the Conservative party is not against the objectives and rules of most unions, but the way that it is going, one could easily see it slipping into being against such things, given its anti-union attitude.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="81104-0017.htm_para17"><a name="08110475000016">In the 1950s, communists were expelled from unions wholesale, and particularly from the electricians union. So this has happened before, but to the left, not the right. That is why we have to be very careful about proceeding on such a basis. The Communist party might be a fringe party now, rather than the industrial power that it was in the 1950s, but the Socialist Workers party, for example, is very active in some trade unions and organises in those unions on a political level. We have heard, too, about other campaigners being affected. For example, animal rights campaigners might set up a party to campaign in unions involved in scientific industries, which could cause significant difficulties.</p>

It is interesting that when we discussed the issue in my Committee, Lord Morris, the former general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, an influential trade unionist in his time and a man with immense experience of trade unions, was concerned about the lack of additional safeguards. I should also pray in aid Lord Wedderburn of Charlton, my old law professor from decades ago and probably the doyenne of trade union law, who also expressed his concerns in debates in the House of Lords about the lack of additional safeguards. As a result, my Committee proposed an amendment. A member of my Committee from the Liberal Democrat Benches, Lord Lester, also proposed his own amendment, which Lord Wedderburn thought was rather good, because it was as narrow as we could get, while also concomitant with the need for appropriate safeguards.</p>

For example, none of the existing safeguards&#151;the contractual rulebook safeguard and the certification officer safeguard&#151;is available to deal with a person who is excluded from trade union membership in the first place, as opposed to having been expelled. Such a person cannot go to the certification officer, and they cannot go to court for a breach of the union rules.</p>

Sometimes, human rights can be a little inconvenient for us on the left, as well. There is clearly a positive obligation under human rights law to provide safeguards against abuse, and that is why my Committee proposed an amendment. My problem is that clause 19, as it stands, goes rather further than that amendment. My hon. Friend has made some quite trenchant criticisms of certain aspects of clause 19. I disagree with his point about the rules and objectives of the unions.

By way of background, clause 19 gives trade unions the right to exclude or expel individuals on the basis of their membership of a political party, subject to several safeguards, which are set out in the relevant subsections.

importance of the rights that were being debated. We recognised the potential conflict between two fundamental civil liberties: the right to freedom of association and an individual&#146;s right to a political belief, unhindered by arbitrary interference by public authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="81104-0018.htm_para0"><a name="08110475000032">The bar on trade unions excluding or expelling individuals from membership is set out in section 174 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. That section was itself introduced as an amendment by section 14 of the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993. The section was subsequently amended again in considerable detail by the Employment Relations Act 2004. Those changes made it clear that it was lawful for trade unions to exclude or expel individuals on the ground of their political party activities&#151;that is, their conduct. In Committee, we agreed with the right of unions to end membership on the ground of conduct, but not on the ground of belief. So, despite the best efforts of this House and of the other place, when passing that legislation to balance the competing rights of the individual and the trade unions, the European Court of Human Rights&#151;in its decision on ASLEF <i> v.</i> the United Kingdom&#151;felt that we had not struck the right balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="81104-0018.htm_para1"><a name="08110475000033">We have been discussing new clause 6 and amendment No. 3, tabled in the name of the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd). We believe that their combined effect would be to take us back to the pre-1992 position. We would have to disregard the decision in the ASLEF case, and to forget about the need even for a human rights dimension, in allowing trade unions to expel or exclude members at will. These proposals run contrary to the Conservative view of employee-employer relations. On one level, however, their effect would be to force the Government to reassess this whole area, and perhaps that is what hon. Members truly wish to legislate for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="81104-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08110475000034">Attractive as that proposal might be, however, it is unfortunately unworkable. Our real concern with these amendments is that they would once again make quasi-legislation out of trade union rule books. In the past decade, we have moved away from that towards what must be the correct position: the rule book acting as a contract between the trade union and the employee. If we now seek to return to the old ways, we should force the courts into interpreting trade union rule books just as they interpret statute in employment proceedings. That would not only set the employment relations process back 10 or 15 years; it will also place the courts in a very difficult position and open the floodgates for further litigation.</p>

I accept that this is a question of balancing interests, proportionately and in a common-sense fashion. We recognise that, with time, people change, that their views change and their actions are adapted. As we pointed out in Committee, membership of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament as a student in the &#146;60s should not automatically allow a 50-year-old to be expelled from a trade union that represents workers in the nuclear industry&#151;</p>

The Bill&#146;s provisions seem at odds with a person&#146;s human rights, so our amendment would address that wrong by saying that party membership must have been within the 12 months prior to an individual&#146;s application for trade union membership. On the advice of a number of hon. Members in Committee, we have also tightened the drafting to include future party membership. We hope that that will satisfy other concerns that had been expressed. It seems unfair to us that the union&#146;s right to expel should last for ever. Amendment No. 10 would deal with that concern and I give notice of my intention to press it to a Division.</p>

We need to ask at what point a person&#146;s associations become more indicative of their beliefs than their individual conduct or characteristics. Several members of the Committee noted that although they were members of one of the main political parties, they did not necessarily agree with the entirety of their party&#146;s views. We know that political parties are broad churches, but I fear that we are danger of tarring all with the same brush.</p>

fellow travellers from being hounded out of the unions, so although we can talk about countering the BNP, we must not think that legislation is the only means of doing so. It is not, and many other organisations could be caught in that legislative net.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="81104-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08110475000047">Given the position in which we find ourselves, we need carefully to regulate who will be caught, which is why we suggest limiting expulsion rights to registered members of political parties. We accept that the proposal has flaws&#151;personally, I have real sympathy with some of the ideas expressed in Committee, especially on extreme political groups such as Combat 18 or the Militant Tendency, which would fall outside my definition of a political party&#151;but we have to understand that we are debating this on the back of the ASLEF decision. Since 1993, as the Minister rightly noted in Committee, the unions have had the power to expel or exclude an individual on the basis of their conduct. The clause deals expressly with political party membership&#151;the very issue at stake in the ASLEF case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="81104-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08110475000048">When we fall within the wide parameters of democracy, the spectrum of beliefs is very broad and the question becomes where we draw the line and who draws it. We must be careful not to allow the Bill to creep into areas that it is not designed to cover. The ASLEF decision dealt only with expulsion or exclusion on the basis of political party membership, not on the basis of conduct or association with a group. We must ensure that we draw the line at a reasonable place, and I believe that our amendment does just that. If we do not say that the provisions should apply to registered members of political parties, to whom will they apply&#151;people who wear Nazi insignia or Che Guevara T-shirts or who are known to associate with extremists? I fear that we may end up with trade union witch hunts in which members who show even the slightest diversion from the party line find themselves out on their ear.</p>

One thing is for sure: as things stand, clause 19 is inviting court cases to decide what constitutes a political party&#151;and many extreme groups have shown themselves only too happy to go to court over such matters. The amendment will, I hope, provide less room for them to do so.</p>

We have to ensure that once enacted, it achieves the objectives in a way that maximises support for it within the community and wider society. In my view, we are righting a wrong against ASLEF and others. No one has so far congratulated ASLEF and other trade unions up and down this country on spending a lifetime opposing fascism, especially when it infiltrates their organisations. We should congratulate ASLEF on sticking to its guns and winning an important legal point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="81104-0018.htm_para16"><a name="08110475000053">The point that ASLEF won was not to do with its rule book per se. Instead, it related to a piece of legislation introduced by the Conservatives in 1992 which was a breach of article 11 of the European convention on human rights. A Conservative Government implemented bad legislation. On behalf of the European Court of Human Rights, we are attempting to implement a new piece of legislation to get rid of what happened in 1992 which was so damaging to ASLEF and others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="81104-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08110475000054">No doubt if we pass the Bill, all unions should, as a matter of course, look at the rule book to ensure that it is compatible with changes set out in clause 19 so that they can use it effectively now and in the future to protect themselves, their members and workers in the workplace against fascist activity by individuals or collective groups of individuals, whether they are in the BNP or other organisations.</p>

 I think that the hon. Gentleman is about my age. He should have realised what was happening in the 1950s. There were witch hunts against communists, but not by trade unions or trade unionists; they were carried out by right-wing politicians here and in America, and of course blacklists were introduced by Conservative employers which lasted all the way through to 1999. This Government got rid of blacklists as well. There is a history of people being blacklisted and blackballed, but not for their political views, in the way that we are talking about the BNP and fascists, but because of their capacity and willingness to represent working-class people in the workplace against employers who did them down.

 Although I wish to concentrate on new clause 6, let me first speak briefly to new clause 4. I agree that environmental representatives are a valuable and relatively new development. Their emergence shows that unions are seeking to develop new services for their members, and trade unions have a valid and legitimate voice on this agenda. I also believe that that voice can contribute significantly to business success. My Department is producing a joint statement with the TUC and the CBI, which will focus on the benefits that lay union representatives can bring to the workplace. That statement will incorporate case study research, and we plan to publish it early next year. The issue in question is whether to place these representatives on a statutory footing. Members may not be too surprised to learn that I believe it is premature to do so, but I welcome their development, and I encourage ACAS and environmental quality representatives to work on guidance in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="81104-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08110475000079">Let me turn to new clause 6 and clause 19. Clause 19 seeks to amend section 174 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 to bring UK law into line with the European Court of Human Rights judgment in the ASLEF <i> v.</i> UK case. That is our intention, not the introduction of wider reform of trade union law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="81104-0019.htm_para2"><a name="08110475000080">I would like to begin by setting out the motivations behind the clause and its intentions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd) and other Members have pointed out, the case that gave rise to this clause was about a trade union that desired to expel a British National party member. Abhorrence of the BNP is widely shared in this House, and many of us, myself included, have campaigned against it and will continue to do so. This clause was debated for many hours in the other place, and it was discussed for longer than any other in Committee as well; it has, in fact, been discussed more than any other clause. That is understandable because although the case that gave rise to the clause was about the BNP, as Members have pointed out the provision in question does not mention the BNP and is a more general power to expel or exclude people from trade unions on grounds of membership of a political party. There is an important point here, because Members have raised the issue of conduct, and I want to make it clear to the House that expulsion on grounds of political conduct was already legal before the ASLEF judgment. The change the ASLEF judgment made was, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) has pointed out, to say that our law was incompatible with article 11 of the European convention on human rights on freedom of association, precisely because it did not have these rights of expulsion on grounds of membership of a political party.</p>

 I cannot accept the verdict that my hon. Friend read out, which says that clause 19 is totally inadequate. The ECHR judgment centred on balancing individual freedoms with freedom of association as set out in article 11 and found that, against that backdrop, our law, as it stands, was not compatible with article 11. It did balance those things, because it said:</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention, but I do not believe the clause is unworkable. If he allows me to develop the point, I will talk about the safeguards that we have built in and the proposals to which we have listened in the debate on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="81104-0019.htm_para7"><a name="08110475000092">As has been said, when we consulted on changing the law in this regard, we canvassed two options, both of which introduced changes relating to the particular part of section 174 that deals with political party membership. When we introduced the Bill, we thought that the more deregulatory option A was the better approach to follow. As has been mentioned, in subsequent debate in the other place, when strong representations were made by Lord Morris of Handsworth and others, and in the deliberations of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, a strong case was made for more safeguards against potential abuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="81104-0019.htm_para8"><a name="08110475000093">Hon. Members have cited the Joint Committee&#146;s report. It said that expulsions should be permitted if</p>

Let me lay to rest some misconceptions about the changes that we have made to the clause. It is certainly not the case that the Government are somehow refusing to legislate in line with the judgment; we believe that it is right to legislate in line with the judgment. Members can be expelled on grounds of political conduct, but we are now talking about membership of political parties. It is not the case&#151;as has been reported, including today&#151;that the changes will mean automatic compensation for those expelled or excluded. If trade unions act in line with the clause, compensation will not be necessary.</p>

which concerned the expelled member&#146;s political party membership and its compatibility with the union&#146;s rules and political orientation. I appreciate my hon. Friend&#146;s intentions, and I agree that we have a shared objective, but the Government do not think it necessary to extrapolate the Court&#146;s reasoning in the way that new clause 6 does in order to legislate in line with the judgment.</p>

I repeat that clause 19 does not mean that names of political parties have to be specified in the rule book. The important question is whether a trade union can use clause 19, and the procedures built into it, to expel or exclude members. It sets out a process whereby unions can act in line with the judgment. Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 would restrict the operation of the clause too much. How is a union to check exactly how many months a person has been a member of a political party?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="81104-0019.htm_para17"><a name="08110475000102">When the Conservative party was in government, it introduced legislation on the rights of political parties, but did not produce the definition that Conservative Members are calling for tonight. How is a union supposed to police registration systems around the world? We intend to legislate in line with the judgment in a way that trade unions can use, but we do not intend to restrict that so much that the legislation is impossible to operate in practice. For that reason, if the Opposition press their amendments, I shall ask my colleagues to resist them. On clause 19, the Government have listened and responded to points that have been made. It is the best way to operate.</p>

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. As you know, yet again, the majority of new clauses and amendments tabled on Report by Back-Bench Government Members and Opposition Members have not been debated. Five new clauses and four amendments have been debated; eight new clauses and eight amendments have not. May I ask whether you, your co-Deputy Speakers and Mr. Speaker report to the Leader of the House on the amendments and new clauses that are not reached? The Leader of the House has assured the House that she is seeking to do something to ensure that the process is improved, but we have seen no action. May I ask that you, Madam Deputy Speaker, consider with Mr. Speaker reporting, yet again, another Bill where amendments and new clauses have not been discussed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para2"><a name="08110484000008">The Bill covers a number of significant issues. It reforms dispute resolution at work, minimum wage legislation, employment agencies legislation and, as we have just discussed, trade union membership. It brings together elements of the Government&#146;s employment relations strategy to increase protection for vulnerable workers and reduce costs for law-abiding businesses. The Bill gives a better deal to low-paid workers and to agency workers who have been denied the national minimum wage against their rights. The Bill reflects on 10 years&#146; experience of the national minimum wage and seeks to build on it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o426"><a name="08110484000009"><a name="81104-0020.htm_spnew3"><a name="08110484000132"><b>Mr. McCartney</b>

 I pay tribute to the tremendous contribution made to the minimum wage legislation by my right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney), who has been present throughout the debates this evening. I am happy to give way to him.</p>

<p><a name="st_o428"><a name="08110484000011"><a name="81104-0020.htm_spnew5"><a name="08110484000134"><b>Mr. McCartney:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend for his kindness towards me in today&#146;s debate and previous ones. Will he meet my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) and me to talk about the enforcement of employment tribunal awards for vulnerable workers? Will he have further discussions with me, Public Concern at Work and the CAB about the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 and what we need to do in relation to that?</p>

<p><a name="st_o429"><a name="08110484000012"><a name="81104-0020.htm_spnew6"><a name="08110484000135"><b>Mr. McFadden:</b>
 I will, of course, be happy to meet my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel), and to have those further discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08110484000013">The Bill&#146;s provisions on dispute resolution stem from Michael Gibbons&#146;s independent review of dispute resolution in the workplace, published last year. The provisions will lighten the burden on workers and business by encouraging the resolution of more workplace disputes earlier and informally. The tribunal route provides important access to justice and it must be available. However, if we can resolve disputes sooner than we would through a tribunal, that will often be better for all concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08110484000014">The Bill makes changes that will enable us to move away from the current, rigid legal process for resolving disputes, which, as Michael Gibbons found, has led to more claims being taken to employment tribunals than may have been necessary. We are putting in place a package that encourages employers and employees to resolve their issues earlier and informally. As I said earlier, we are expanding ACAS&#146;s role in that area and we have allocated additional funds to ACAS so that it can fulfil its expanded role. The package includes statutory changes, revision of the ACAS code on disciplinary grievance procedures, and substantial investment to improve advice to employees. We estimate that, once in force and fully operational, the measures could save business up to &#163;170 million a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para5"><a name="08110484000015">The Bill introduces a new enforcement framework for the national minimum wage, involving the introduction of a new civil penalty that can be levied against all non-compliant businesses. The framework also introduces a fairer method of calculating arrears. Until now, an  <br>

employee who was paid less than the minimum wage over a number of years would lose out on the uprating of the minimum wage even if the arrears were restored. The Bill changes that; it makes non-payment of the minimum wage act, in effect, as an interest-free loan from the employee to the employer and introduces a fairer system of arrears by making sure that they are paid at the prevailing national minimum wage rate.</p>

<p><a name="st_o430"><a name="08110484000016"><a name="81104-0020.htm_spnew7"><a name="08110484000136"><b>Lorely Burt:</b>
 Does the Minister not regret, like me, the passing of the opportunity that the Bill offered? We could have strengthened enforcement to make sure that rogue employers paid arrears, and that ex-employees could not take redress other than through the civil courts.</p>

<p><a name="st_o431"><a name="08110484000017"><a name="81104-0020.htm_spnew8"><a name="08110484000137"><b>Mr. McFadden:</b>
 I do not believe that we have missed opportunities in this Bill. We have taken the opportunity to do two things&#151;to strengthen the system for paying arrears to workers who are not paid the minimum wage and to strengthen the penalty regime for employers who do not pay the minimum wage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08110484000018">The Bill makes offences under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 triable in the Crown court as well as the magistrates court and strengthens the powers of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to investigate criminal offences. The aim of these provisions is to create a clearer deterrent to non-compliance with the minimum wage and to provide a fairer outcome for workers who have suffered a loss in real terms as a result of underpayment of the minimum wage.</p>

<p><a name="st_o432"><a name="08110484000019"><a name="81104-0020.htm_spnew9"><a name="08110484000138"><b>Simon Hughes:</b>
 There are many good things in the Bill&#151;I do not argue with that. However, does the Minister accept that it does not change the fact that it is still not compulsory for there to be a conciliation process between employer and employee in all cases of prospective dismissal?</p>

<p><a name="st_o433"><a name="08110484000020"><a name="81104-0020.htm_spnew10"><a name="08110484000139"><b>Mr. McFadden:</b>
 We thought that it was right to give ACAS a power to offer conciliation so that it can use these increased resources in cases where it can make the greatest difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para7"><a name="08110484000021">The Bill introduces an improved enforcement framework for employment agency standards, making offences under the Employment Agencies Act 1973 each-way offences and defining investigative powers. Combined with the minimum wage provisions, the Bill provides more effective enforcement and greater support to vulnerable agency workers. It also promotes compliance, which we should never forget is in the interests not only of vulnerable workers but of the vast majority of law-abiding, decent businesses. Among other things, the Bill makes the changes that we have discussed, and which I will not go over again, in response to the European Court judgment in ASLEF <i> v.</i> UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para8"><a name="08110484000022">I am pleased that as we approach the end of our deliberations in this House, most major stakeholders have broadly welcomed the Bill and that the broad consensus on its elements has been reflected in most of our debates. I believe that it has been improved during its passage through both Houses, and I am grateful to hon. Members on both sides of the House who have contributed to the proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para9"><a name="08110484000023">The Bill will achieve two main things: it will reduce costs and burdens for businesses and for workers in terms of dispute resolution and strengthen enforcement  <br>

of the law, particularly for low-paid and vulnerable workers. In that sense, it benefits individuals, those who represent workers, and good business. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_18"><a name="81104-0020.htm_ordayhd1"><a name="08110484000121"><h5 align="left">9.27 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o434"><a name="08110484000024"><a name="81104-0020.htm_spnew11"><a name="08110484000140"><b>Mr. Djanogly:</b>
 This Government have so far introduced some 18 Acts and more than 280 statutory instruments dealing directly with employment laws and regulations, and we are now debating another one. Their continual tinkering with employee rights and employer duties has left business and individuals confused. The Bill was originally called the employment simplification Bill, so the change was fully justified given that it involves no simplification whatsoever. It is hardly surprising that if one reviews the figures for employment tribunal cases, it is clear that small businesses make up the overwhelming majority of respondents. Many small businesses are no more sophisticated than the employees claiming against them. They do not have the large human resources departments or teams of lawyers that are needed to decipher the tangled web of employment laws that the Government continue to create.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08110484000025">Even while the Bill has been making its way through the House, a further, under-the-table deal was done between Labour and the trade unions to tamper with the laws on agency workers in a way that could be very damaging for our already over-burdened businesses. While that is hardly surprising from a Government who are almost entirely funded by the trade unions, it has got to a point where even the ex-Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform seems to have recognised that the Government have gone too far. Prior to his promotion, he admitted that there was a</p>
<a name="81104-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="08110484000111"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;need to challenge the automatic assumption that the only way to deal with exploitation in the workplace is by passing new laws.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08110484000026">I hope for the sake of employers across the country that Lord Mandelson has read his handover brief thoroughly, not least because, given the Labour amendments tabled, it looks as if we will need to prepare for a union legislative onslaught as the TUC calls in its Warwick II promises. Just to recap: we heard proposals today to protect employees taking industrial action from dismissal; to prevent trade unions from being sued by employers suffering loss as a consequence of industrial action; to provide union members with a dual award&#151;damages and reinstatement&#151;where they are dismissed for striking; to shift the responsibility for ensuring ballots are properly conducted from unions to employers; to prevent businesses using so-called strike breakers; to provide special privileges not to work for so-called union workplace environmental reps; and to abolish all restrictions on trade unions&#146; rights to expel or exclude members&#151;</p>

came to us. However, we have some problems with aspects of it. Mention was made of how the Government have taken us back to the position before the earlier provisions came into force. Our concerns focused on clause 3, and the changes that it would make to the employment tribunal system. The new ACAS code would remove the overly legalistic system that arose, despite the Government&#146;s assertions to the contrary, from the Employment Act 2002. The ACAS code is now principle-based, but we could be in danger of elevating procedure over substance. Tribunals have the power to vary awards based on non-compliance with procedure and we think that there could be a dichotomy. If one acts in the spirit of a principle-based code, could one never fall foul of that procedure? In Committee, we asked the Minister to give us some statistics, and to discuss the various awards that the tribunals had granted, but those were not forthcoming. There is a perception among businesses that tribunals are disproportionately inclined towards the employee, and we share some of those concerns about the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para13"><a name="08110484000030">The second part of the Bill deals with the national minimum wage. We support the national minimum wage, and a continual monitoring of legislative provisions that deal with it. We also support action to ensure that workers who receive the minimum wage do not lose out in real terms when they are owed arrears as a result of underpayment. The previous law gave almost no deterrent to underpayment, so the change in the Bill is welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08110484000031">We had various concerns about the extension of powers of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, and we still have those concerns. While the proposal to allow enforcement officers to remove documents under clause 10 is accepted, we do not accept that the balance in the Bill is as good as it could have been.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para15"><a name="08110484000032">I urge the Minister to give maximum publicity to the changes in the implementation of the national minimum wage provisions. All employers must be given full opportunity to assess their companies and correct any failings in payment of the minimum wage before the new penalties are imposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para16"><a name="08110484000033">We had a full debate during all stages of consideration of the Bill, including this evening, on clause 19, which relates to the European Court of Human Rights judgment on the ASLEF case. Although we believe that it was appropriate for the Government to respond to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights, we continue to have genuine concerns about clause 19 as it stands. Only time will tell, but I predict that court cases will derive from the provisions with which we have ended up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para17"><a name="08110484000034">The definitions of &#147;membership of a political party&#148; and of &#147;political party&#148; remain outstanding issues, which will lead to further court cases. The debates on the Bill&#146;s progress through both Houses show that the Government have been slightly inclined to burrow their head in the sand when faced with reasoned argument. Worse, they legislate for perceived threats or concerns, without hard evidence to back up the need for legislative intervention. That could not only be expensive in terms of taxpayers&#146; money and the House&#146;s time, but has made for a weaker Bill than it should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para18"><a name="08110484000035">Although we agree with the Bill&#146;s overall aims, concerns remain about its scope and implementation. Moreover, the Government have failed, once again, to address properly the concerns of business when they are mounting by the day. As it stands, the Bill will be a fitting  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para19"><a name="08110484000036">British business has been crying out for reform to employment laws, which are making them increasingly uncompetitive, and for protection from vexatious employee claims. Surely we could have done more than simply give unions the power to expel members for their political beliefs. To that extent, the Bill is a missed opportunity.</p>

 I welcome the elements of the Bill that deal with dispute resolution, and especially the provisions that cover the national minimum wage. However, I join the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) in expressing concern about not reaching many amendments about the minimum wage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para20"><a name="08110484000038">Any Bill&#146;s implementation must be properly resourced. Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs has continuing concerns about the number of officers who are required and have been recruited so far to implement the minimum wage provisions. Earlier this year, the Minister promised us that there would be at least 20 extra officers and a 50 per cent. increase in expenditure on enforcement. I understand that those 20 officers have not been recruited so far. At best, we are up to 17, possibly 18, this week. Some&#151;at least 10&#151;are staff who are already in post, so there seems to be an element of double counting. I am therefore worried about whether there are adequate resources to implement the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="81104-0020.htm_para21"><a name="08110484000039">Although the minimum wage provisions are welcome, they go nowhere far enough in some sectors of industry to address the genuine problems of low pay. I deeply regret not reaching the amendments about the minimum wage for seafarers. Let me remind hon. Members of the implications of that. On the vessel &#147;Daroja&#148;, owned by Marlow Navigation, which sails between Aberdeen and Lerwick, a Filipino worker is paid &#163;295 a month. On the AHTS Survarna, an Indian seaman is paid &#163;1.63 an hour. That is not acceptable.</p>

 I, too, am in some difficulty, in the sense that when one weighs up a Bill, as amended, on Third Reading, one has to reflect on the processes by which we have arrived at the Bill as amended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="81104-0021.htm_para0"><a name="08110484000047">I was pleased to hear the tribute that the Minister paid to the right hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney).

That no doubt includes new clauses 12 and 13, which were not reached and which concern matters to which the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) alluded in a point of order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="81104-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08110484000048">We are in a difficult position. Do I believe that the process by which we have arrived at the Bill as amended is right? If the House cannot debate whole areas of a Bill, how can I attest that it has been properly constructed? The guillotine, over which we have no control, was designed in such a way that matters that pertain directly to the Bill, such as open justice on tribunal cases, were never debated in Committee or even reached here, because of the constraints of the guillotine motion on Report. That is why I have to weigh up whether the process is sufficiently legitimate to enable me to support the Bill.</p>

 This is an important area of legislation and, as the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) said, there has been a huge amount of legislation on these matters. I want to follow on from where the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) left off. There are five areas of importance in the Bill, and we had some debate on all of them on Report. Those who were privileged to serve on the Committee were able to explore them in more detail but, as is always the case, that involved only a minority of Members. Over the years, many of us have taken an interest in many of the matters that have been touched on in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="81104-0021.htm_para6"><a name="08110484000054">Some of the outcomes of the deliberations in the House of Lords, and in the Commons so far, have been good, but I have to share the frustration that the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills has just expressed, and which I ventilated when I raised a point of order earlier, that there has been no opportunity to explore some of the matters in the Bill or to test whether they are as valid as they could have been. I want to concentrate on two of those areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="81104-0021.htm_para7"><a name="08110484000055">The first area, which covers the first seven clauses of the Bill, deals with dispute resolution. I have had a meeting with the Minister on this matter, for which I was grateful. He knows that I have taken an interest in this, and I have also raised the matter in Adjournment debates in the House. I am concerned that the Bill, as it stands, still does not deal with one of the areas in which the worker often feels that he or she does not get a fair shout. Changes to the dispute resolution procedure are proposed in clauses 1 to 6. Variations have been made over the years&#151;these proposals undo the changes we made four years ago&#151;as to how much should be optional, how much should be procedural, and the extent to which complying with the procedure should make a dismissal unlawful. However, there is still no automatic right to a dispute resolution procedure for someone who is dismissed summarily. There are many people up and down the land, in small and large firms, who, as a result of this legislation, will still be able to go to work and find themselves dismissed with no right to any dispute resolution procedure in the workplace. They can take their case to an industrial tribunal but, in four fifths of the cases that get to a tribunal, the employee does not succeed. Furthermore, in many cases, the tribunals and the higher courts will say that such cases fall within the band of a reasonable decision taken by the employer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="81104-0021.htm_para9"><a name="08110484000057">Clause 3 allows the awards that can be granted to be varied and provides for a financial penalty. Bluntly, however, a financial penalty is not much use if, at the end of the day, the person loses their job. If someone is dismissed, the chance of getting back to work is very small, certainly reduced, and the person might be out of work for a long time.</p>

Secondly, when I got to the hotel and unpacked my hand luggage, I discovered that in the side pocket of a shopping bag that I had brought with me for use as a beach bag there was a fruit knife. It had been left in the bag some time ago, and I had not spotted it when I was packing. The knife is a small kitchen knife, its total length is 7 in, with a 3 in blade. Let me make it quite clear that I do not habitually walk around carrying knives and I certainly had no idea that this particular knife was in my bag, so I was not conducting a test case to check the security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="81104-0021.htm_para25"><a name="08110484000075">However, first thing on Monday morning, I asked my office manager in Birmingham to get in touch with Gatwick airport to tell it that it had a problem, because the knife surely should have been spotted as the hand luggage was screened. My instincts were that someone had made a mistake and Gatwick security should be made aware of it so that they could put it right. I would have been content to leave it at that but it took a number of phone calls to establish the appropriate person to contact. In the end, my office e-mailed July Spellward and Fiona Carleton at BAA outlining the events. There was no response other than being told that Fiona Carleton, the aviation security manager, would be out of the office until 11 August. So the security manager at Gatwick airport is out of the office for the second week in August!</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="81104-0021.htm_para26"><a name="08110484000076">On 11 August, my office contacted Gatwick again for a response. We received a response from Wendy Leigh, personal assistant to Andy Flower, who informed us that Andy Flower was away on annual leave but that she would forward our e-mail to the customer service department for it to respond direct, which it did not do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="81104-0021.htm_para27"><a name="08110484000077">When I returned to Gatwick on 17 August two things happened. First, the suitcase that I had lost on the way out and of which I had heard nothing for two weeks mysteriously reappeared and was on the luggage belt. It had returned with me and I just picked it up. Secondly, I went to the BAA information desk where I told my story and asked whether there was anybody I could speak to. I was given the card of July Spellward. At this point I discovered that she is the traveller insight manager. I left my mobile number, as I wanted to pass on some insights, and was assured that she would call me first thing on Monday morning, which she did not&#151;nor did she do so at any other time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="81104-0021.htm_para28"><a name="08110484000078">However, on Monday 18 August the commercial director, Mike Luddy, contacted me in a letter to discuss the problems that I had encountered&#151;of course, I thought that BAA had the problems, but he clearly thought that I had them. On 18 August he said&#151;he was very precise about this:</p>
<a name="81104-0021.htm_brev3"><a name="08110484000115"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I can advise that 317 passengers were processed through North Terminal security between 0315 and 0345 on 3rd August. Three cameras were in operation at the time and if you could provide us with the time you passed through security and perhaps a photograph of yourself to help us with identification, then we may be in a position to take this matter further forward as appropriate&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="81104-0021.htm_para29"><a name="08110484000079">So two weeks later, BAA has something from security and is asking for a photograph to look into the matter further. I responded that I found those answers unsatisfactory and put a number of questions to Mr. Luddy. I also had a phone call from Scott Colvin, head of group public affairs, on Thursday 21 August who began by telling me that a letter resolving the open questions had been sent, but later apologised when he realised that the letter he had in mind had nothing to do with my problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="81104-0021.htm_para30"><a name="08110484000080">I confess that at this point I ran out of patience and contacted <i> The Mail on Sunday</i>. Curiously, once a journalist got involved and started to ask questions, what had started out as a question of public relations suddenly became a matter of national security, which Mr. Luddy told me prevented him from discussing security standards and individual incidents any further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="81104-0021.htm_para31"><a name="08110484000081">To illustrate why I have absolutely no confidence in anything that BAA told me, I shall quote two statements from the same day. On 22 August, Mr. Luddy told me that</p>
<a name="81104-0021.htm_brev4"><a name="08110484000116"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;as we are unable to identify the individual involved we have now taken the decision to take all fourteen members of staff off line for re-training.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="81104-0021.htm_para32"><a name="08110484000082">However, I also have an e-mail from him dated the same day in which he says:</p>
<a name="81104-0021.htm_brev5"><a name="08110484000117"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Yes, we have identified the individual and she has not worked a shift at the airport since but as a precaution we have taken the entire crew off shift for re-training&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="81104-0021.htm_para33"><a name="08110484000083">In addition, he says that</p>
<a name="81104-0021.htm_brev6"><a name="08110484000118"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the team have not been on duty since the date you travelled&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="81104-0021.htm_para34"><a name="08110484000084">In other words, the entire team has not been on duty from 3 August to 22 August.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="81104-0021.htm_para35"><a name="08110484000085">On 29 August, Mike Luddy sent an e-mail that in order to &#147;close this issue&#148; he was telling me that the crew had been retrained and were now back at work, and that new procedures were in place to deal with complaints. I told him that I did not regard it as closed and said that once the House returned from its summer recess I would try to get an Adjournment debate on the subject. I am indeed grateful to have the debate. I am also grateful that my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt), whose constituency covers Gatwick airport, is in the Chamber because I want to reassure her that I am confident that the many people who work hard at Gatwick airport, often for long hours and not good pay, are doing their very best. What is happening is that they are being let down by incompetent management.</p>

 Just as I had entered the phase of thinking that perhaps this was just my problem and I should let it rest, I was surprised&#151;or, more to the point, not surprised&#151;to read in the 19 October edition of <i> The Sunday Times </i>that</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081104/debtext/81104-0022.htm"/>


<a name="81104-0022.htm_brev0"><a name="08110484000119"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;replica bombs were smuggled past security staff in hand luggage during a safety inspection at Britain&#146;s second busiest airport. Staff at Gatwick airport failed to identify artificial explosives carried by undercover transport inspectors from Brussels even though one device was allegedly identified as suspicious by X-ray scanners.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="81104-0022.htm_para0"><a name="08110484000090">An interesting interpretation of that incident by <i> The Sunday Times </i>was that although the staff who check objects through security know that a quality control device sometimes brings up images to check that they spot them, they are under so much pressure to get people through security quickly that they do not have time to concentrate on what they see on the screen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="81104-0022.htm_para1"><a name="08110484000091">As for the incident that I have described, for all I know BAA&#146;s management has improved the way in which it deals with complaints, but I am not confident that it has improved the way in which it deals with security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="81104-0022.htm_para2"><a name="08110484000092">I also want to mention the matter of the missing suitcase. We are always told that it is imperative that there should be no piece of luggage on an aeroplane that is not identifiable, and that therefore there should never be any unaccompanied luggage. That leads me to the assumption that, in the interests of security, staff ought to know where suitcases are; but that clearly did not apply to my suitcase. It went AWOL, then reappeared, and when I asked BAA staff where they thought it was, I received no answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="81104-0022.htm_para3"><a name="08110484000093">The curious aspect of the matter is that air travel is the most prescriptive mode of travel that I can think of. Air travellers must buy named tickets that cannot be transferred. They are told exactly what they can and cannot take on the plane. They are asked to turn up hours in advance. They are not allowed to take any liquids through security, which means that they must leave their can of Coke at one end and purchase a rather expensive can at the other end. People put up with all that because the deal is that it is to do with safety, so the least that we should be able to expect is that those with a duty to impose safety measures take safety seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="81104-0022.htm_para4"><a name="08110484000094">The same applies to the issue of suitcases. The problem seems to be not just security, but the fact that BAA deals with one thing while&#151;in this instance&#151;EasyJet deals with another, while a third company tracks the luggage. None of them seem to care much what happens. They assume that tourists need only take out travel insurance. In no other walk of life would it be regarded as acceptable to assume that people insure themselves against the breach of part of a contractual obligation, but in this case it seems to be considered routine that people will lose their luggage. I was without luggage for two weeks, but the maximum that BAA is prepared to provide is three days&#146; compensation at &#163;25 per day against receipts&#151;in other words, a maximum of &#163;75&#151;because it is assumed that people have insurance.</p>

First, I should be very grateful if he could obtain what I failed to obtain: a genuine datelined account of what was done with the security crew. At what point were they taken off duty, and at what point were they retrained? Secondly, I ask the Minister to obtain the European Commission report&#151;which I tried to obtain through the website, but which proved not to be available&#151;and, if possible, to share it with me. Thirdly, I ask him to examine the issue of lost luggage. It seems to be dealt with in such a haphazard way that I do not feel confident that security is taken as seriously as it should be.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) on securing this debate. I am sincerely sorry to learn that her experience of security at Gatwick airport was far from happy. It is also disappointing that she had to go to so much trouble to follow the matter up, and sometimes even had difficulty in finding the right person to deal with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="81104-0022.htm_para6"><a name="08110523000002">Responsibility for each security measure is allocated by law to appropriate parts of the complex aviation industry, and it clearly is a complex system. However, I can assure my hon. Friend that the Department for Transport, as the security regulator for the industry, monitors performance through its inspectors and takes appropriate action where required. I will turn to the specific questions my hon. Friend asked shortly, but I would like to begin with some more general remarks to set the scene.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="81104-0022.htm_para7"><a name="08110523000003">We are in a period of sustained severe threat to the UK from terrorist attack. Aviation remains an aspirational terrorist target. A lot of good work is done by the aviation industry to deliver security requirements. At Gatwick, the airport deploys the very latest equipment available for the screening of cabin bags and the passengers themselves. The staff working at airports have a difficult task, and I am sure Members will join me in paying tribute to the hard work they do. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) raised this matter, and my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston, who has had the problems, has generously accepted that staff generally do an excellent job in difficult circumstances. We all appreciate their efforts. I hope that my hon. Friend will understand that I cannot comment now on specific operational matters at particular locations, but what I will do is set out the general context of the UK&#146;s aviation security programme with reference to Gatwick airport, and respond to her points later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="81104-0022.htm_para8"><a name="08110523000004">As I have said, the Department for Transport sets the standards for aviation security, but it is up to the airport&#146;s own management to decide precisely how it will ensure that these standards are met. Locations differ, and this means that different practical approaches to security need to be taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="81104-0022.htm_para9"><a name="08110523000005">The other essential aspect of aviation security that I should touch on is what we call the layered approach to security. Public attention on aviation security is often focused on the aspects of security that are most obvious  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="4 Nov 2008">

<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>4 Nov 2008 : Column 232</b><br>
to travellers, such as X-raying of hand luggage and walking through a metal detector, and, of course, these are important aspects of the security picture. Importantly, however, these are only small parts of the security picture. Other aspects such as physical security measures, staff screening, policing, intelligence, travel document security and staff training all contribute to the layered security arrangements at Gatwick and other airports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="81104-0022.htm_para10"><a name="08110523000006">The Department for Transport always investigates any alleged breach of security so that any weaknesses can be addressed. However, we also have to consider the balance between the public&#146;s right to be informed of the risks&#151;and the mitigating measures&#151;and the need to ensure that terrorists are not fully aware of the preventive measures in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="81104-0022.htm_para11"><a name="08110523000007">This brings me back to the layered approach to security. None of the parts of the security set-up at any location can, by themselves, deliver 100 per cent. security. As my hon. Friend mentioned, the knife she accidentally took on board an aircraft in her hand luggage when she went on holiday in August was not detected. The fact is that BAA plc made a mistake, and I am not here to make excuses for it&#151;and, to be perfectly frank, after listening to the litany of problems my hon. Friend had, I would not know where to start.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="81104-0022.htm_para12"><a name="08110523000008">As my hon. Friend says, BAA has written to her on a number of occasions, and, as well as taking steps to retrain the security officers concerned, it has a new procedure in place to respond to complaints of the kind that she made. As I am sure my hon. Friend would expect, this is not the end of the matter. Airport security is not simply about dealing with particular incidents of the kind she mentioned; it is a continuous process of maintaining and improving high standards in a difficult working environment. While we are reliant on the airports themselves to ensure that the necessary measures are implemented on a day-to-day basis, we undertake a regular programme of compliance-monitoring visits, including announced and unannounced inspections, and we provide appropriate advice and guidance to the industry. The inspection of Gatwick airport that was carried out by the European Commission in October, to which my hon. Friend referred, is one part of the programme of work that the Department for Transport and the European Commission have in place for Gatwick and other airports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="81104-0022.htm_para13"><a name="08110523000009">My hon. Friend asked two specific questions about Gatwick. The first was whether I would ask BAA to provide a timeline of when precisely the crew was taken off duty, what kind of retraining they received and when they returned to work. I will certainly do that, and I will let her have a copy of the response I receive from BAA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="81104-0022.htm_para14"><a name="08110523000010">My hon. Friend also asked about reports of the European Commission inspections of UK airports. I assure her that my Department acts on information arising from our joint working with European inspectors. The information that emerges from any inspection is always constructive and is the subject of a great deal of activity by Department for Transport officials and UK airports, as well as by the European Commission. For the reasons that I have stated, I cannot provide further details, but, as I am sure my hon. Friend would expect, where security is concerned we act as soon as is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="81104-0022.htm_para15"><a name="08110523000011">Finally, my hon. Friend asked about luggage handling. It is annoying for passengers when luggage is lost or  <br>

delayed, and it is in the aviation industry&#146;s own interests to make sure that that happens less often. Indeed, it happened to me this summer, so I know how frustrating it is. I must say that the airline with which I was flying found the baggage within 24 hours and couriered it back within another 24 hours, so my experience was more reassuring than her own. On the security issues surrounding delayed luggage, I can assure my hon. Friend that as well as there being 100 per cent. hold baggage screening for all bags at UK airports, there are additional, more intensive security measures above and beyond that to deal with luggage that travels separately from its owner, for whatever reason.</p>

I am sure that we also all agree that they do not make the travelling experience any more pleasant, and that it is worrying when things do not go as they should&#151;my hon. Friend experienced that.
