 My right hon.

Does he agree that, rather than pulling up the drawbridge and cold-shouldering the European Union, as the Conservatives wish to do, or spending many months fruitlessly renegotiating its way back into the European Union, as would happen if the Scottish National party were to lead us, Scotland should play its full part as an integral part of the United Kingdom in leading change in Europe that will make a real difference to climate change for our citizens?</p>

 I find myself in complete agreement with my hon. Friend. The European Union&#151;now 25, soon to be 27, members&#151;can make a significant contribution to tackling climate change. The Kyoto protocol and the process that was taken forward evidences the leadership role by the European Union. It is therefore incongruous that the principal Opposition party spends its time trying to disentangle itself from a principal party in the European Parliament, and that one of the main Opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament is so confused that it seems to support independence in the European Union, but wants to secede from the one Union that has been more successful than any other over the last 300 years: the United Kingdom.</p>

Does the Minister agree that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and other Departments, can learn from the Scottish example and that, in Scotland, we can and should go further and meet 100 per cent. of Scotland&#146;s electricity needs from renewable sources by 2050?</p>

 The starting point is somewhat different. The foresight shown by predecessors in my office as Secretary of State for Scotland has resulted in a far greater element of hydro power being generated in Scotland than south of the border. I am proud that, historically, the Labour party has been supportive of those kinds of environmentally friendly power-generating initiatives in Scotland, and I am glad to say that the Scottish Executive, led by the Labour party, have once again shown a leadership role in showing that we can be a world centre for renewables in years to come.</p>

 I am sure that the Minister is aware that the Scottish Affairs Committee is in the highlands and islands as part of our inquiry into poverty. Yesterday, I met representatives of Highlands and Islands Enterprise, other stakeholders and members of the public.

 I am aware that the Scottish Affairs Committee is in the highlands and islands today, although I was not aware that the hon. Gentleman had mastered the art of bilocation by managing to be here at the same time. As I have said at the Dispatch Box almost every month for the past 18 months, the Government accept the need to continue to sustain a viable post office network throughout the country. That is why we are investing &#163;2 billion to ensure that the post office can compete in the modern world. However, there are problems. When the rural network loses &#163;150 million a year and there are 800 post offices throughout the UK with four or fewer customers a day, with each transaction costing the taxpayer &#163;17, that is an unsustainable state of affairs. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry will make a statement in due course and set out the way forward.

 The Minister will doubtless be aware of the great commitment that Highlands and Islands Enterprise has demonstrated towards the development of marine renewables. In that regard, however, will the Minister speak to his colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry about the way in which its marine renewable fund operates? The creation of the fund was welcome, but those who are involved in research and development tell me that because of the way in which it was set up, it is virtually impossible to get money out of it.

 I am happy to look into the matter on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s behalf, although I do not accept the assertion that it is virtually impossible to get money out of the fund. However, it is important that organisations with good proposals are able to access that funding. I am sure that he would want to pay tribute to the funding that the UK has given to the maritime research centre that is based in his constituency, which has done a lot of work to ensure that we will be in a position very soon to get more of our energy from wave and tidal sources. We are not there yet, which is why the investment is needed, but I will examine the point that the hon. Gentleman makes.</p>

 Can the Secretary of State comment on the absence of discussions between Northern Ireland Ministers, those in his Ministry, as Secretary of State for Scotland, and those in the Department for Transport, which is the other portfolio that he holds, to deal with the parlous state of the road between the English-Scottish border and the ports from which ferries go to Northern Ireland? Is it not important that there is discussion between the three Ministries about improving the road from Stranraer to Gretna, in the interests of the United Kingdom, and the important commercial life of Northern Ireland? May we have those discussions?</p>

 My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary was just reminding me of the scale of investment in the roads network in Northern Ireland. Of course, we maintain a dialogue with the Scottish Executive looking at issues such as the one that my hon. Friend described, which impacts on the locality and more widely. Those discussions would be infinitely more difficult if we were dealing with foreign Governments.</p>

 As I said in my main answer to the hon.

The best thing that we can do for pensioners and people on low and modest incomes is to ensure that they receive the help and support that they require through pension credit and above-inflation increases in the state pension.

 The impact on hard-working two-income families would be devastating if we adopted a local income tax. The Burt report, which was published recently, said that to make the same amount of money as the council tax, local income tax would have to be set at 6.9 per cent. I understand that the Scottish National party would cap it at 3 per cent., which would leave a black hole in local finances of &#163;1 billion. That would mean massive Government tax hikes and borrowing or massive cuts in spending in local authority areas. Once again, it would be the hard-working families&#151;</p>

 I think that it can be said that my party has learned from bitter experience that there is no easy answer to financing local government in Scotland. However, the answer is definitely not a local income tax or a property tax, which would result in working families paying thousands of pounds more in tax. As ever, the First Minister has prevaricated on the matter, but given the expectation that the Lyons report will recommend the introduction of a property tax for England and Wales&#151;such a tax is to be introduced in Northern Ireland&#151;is not the reality that a property tax is a fait accompli if Labour is returned to power in the Scottish Parliament elections?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is quite right that the answer is not a property tax or a local income tax. However, neither is the answer introducing a poll tax, which was his party&#146;s last attempt to solve the problem and which was overwhelmingly rejected by the people of Scotland. We have clearly said that we are not going to introduce a property tax nor will we introduce a local income tax, which would cost a fortune to fund, with 32 different rates across Scotland and all the administrative nightmares that that would involve. Most of all, it would clobber hard-working two-income families the length and breadth of Scotland who would be up to &#163;1,000 worse off.</p>

 There is no doubt that studentification is a major and growing problem in towns such as Loughborough and in many cities in England.

A recent UK Universities report stated that the key is joint working, which I welcome, but I hope that the Government examine proposals to strengthen the ability of housing authorities to protect local citizens.

 It would be wrong for my hon. Friend to assume that the Government have set their face against changes that improve the situation. The original purpose of the HMO legislation was to run fire safety and risk assessments. Different remedies are available in GB that are not available in Northern Ireland. For example, Northern Ireland does not have local area agreements. One of the approaches that we are pursuing, particularly in Loughborough, is that of using local area agreements, and if possible bringing in the universities as well. That is not an option in Northern Ireland. We must consider every possible way of trying to resolve the problem.

 Prior to the local government White Paper, Ministers and officials had extensive discussions, including on overview and scrutiny, with local authorities and others.

 I am pleased about the importance that my right hon. Friend attaches to scrutiny of matters internal and external to the council. Does she agree that there are many good examples of scrutiny in local authorities, some of which model their role on that of Westminster Select Committees? In other authorities, however, scrutiny is too lowly graded. It is not properly resourced, councillors are not properly trained, and in many cases the officers being scrutinised manage the officers who give advice to the scrutiny committees. Does she accept that there is a role for her Department and the Local Government Association to play together in disseminating examples of good practice and trying to pull the poorest performing authorities up to the levels of the best?</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend. There are some fantastic examples of local councillors coming together and challenging the council and others in their local area, thereby raising the quality of scrutiny and ultimately of local public services. That depends partly on genuine interest from members and partly on the authority&#146;s willingness to respond. Committees that are independently resourced can be very effective in ensuring high-quality scrutiny. We want to work with the LGA to ensure that best practice in our best councils is spread right across the country.</p>

 I certainly give my hon. Friend that commitment. As we move forward, we want to shift responsibility for target setting and scrutinising proposals from central Government to local government. That will free resources that are currently spent on looking upwards, filling in forms and central bureaucracy, thus allowing local overview and scrutiny decisions to be made at the right level.

Of course independent resourcing of scrutiny committees can make committees work better and raise the quality of local decision making.

 Overview and scrutiny committees can be incredibly effective. Indeed, 60 per cent. of executive councillors said that they had a policy decision changed because of overview and scrutiny. I do not know the details of the case that the hon.

Bolton has lost a third of its housing stock, largely through the right to buy, and its housing waiting list in the last few years has quadrupled from 5,000 to over 23,000, and it is rising steeply. A few days ago, the Minister for Housing and Planning met the northern housing forum. Will the Department look at its proposals for alleviating the housing crisis in northern areas?</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to recognise that housing issues affect not only the south of England, but the north as well. We need to build more houses throughout England.

 The Department plays a critical role, working effectively with local government and communities to tackle Islamist extremism.

 Last month, the Secretary of State told the House that action had been agreed on all but three of the 27 recommendations of the &#147;Preventing Extremism Together&#148; taskforce that were addressed to Government.

 Yes I can, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for asking the question&#151;it gives me an opportunity to put the record straight, because some misinformation has been perpetuated on this point by mischief makers. Action has been agreed on all but three of the 27 recommendations that were for Government to lead on. Three have been completed&#151;the recommendation about consultation on the Department for Education and Skills Green Paper, expansion of the minority ethnic achievements project, and the extension of equal opportunities legislation to cover discrimination on the ground of faith&#151;and 17 are in progress. The Government have accepted the recommendations and are working on implementing them. Three are under consideration and the Government are deciding whether to accept them.

 My hon. Friend makes a very important point. It gives me the opportunity to re-emphasise on behalf of the Government what is of course the case: those who use the name of Islam to justify violence and criminal terrorism are to be condemned. The Government&#146;s programme with the mainstream Muslim community, Imams and various organisations to make that point clear includes events to perpetuate the true nature of Islam and to put to bed the arguments of those who use it to justify their violent extremism, and more than 30,000 young British Muslims have attended those events.</p>

 There are practical difficulties in changing the definition in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests. There is not only the question of how one deals with patios; we do not want to make it harder for people to build extensions in their own gardens and to their own homes. There are ways for local councils to address the problems associated with unsustainable development on garden land. Several local authorities already have such policies, and I suggest that the hon. Gentleman take up the matter with his local council. The new planning policy statement on housing gives local authorities greater powers to have particular policies in this area, and he would be wise to look at that new planning guidance.</p>

 To ask the Defence Secretary what the implications of recent events are for British policy towards Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="st_o116"><a name="06121262000171"><a name="61212-0004.htm_spmin2"><a name="06121262000555"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne):</b>
 I have always said that lasting progress in Iraq cannot be achieved by military means alone, but will depend on a combination of security, politics and economics. Our security strategy is clear and has not changed. It is not driven by the American political calendar, nor will it be thrown off course by those who use violence and terrorism to provoke sectarian reaction and to stop progress in Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="61212-0004.htm_para0"><a name="06121262000172">Our strategy has three main elements. First, we are helping the Iraqis to build up their own security forces&#151;still with a long way to develop, but already with more than 300,000 recruited, trained and equipped. Secondly, as these forces develop we are handing them control, province by province, city by city, moving to the point where they have complete responsibility. Thirdly, we are underwriting that handover process by leaving in place quick-response forces not to do front-line security work, but ready to support the Iraqis if the situation gets out of control. We remain convinced that that remains the right strategy&#151;indeed, the only one that could possibly work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="61212-0004.htm_para1"><a name="06121262000173">I welcome the constructive approach of the Iraq Study Group. As I made clear yesterday, its assessment of the security situation is largely in tune with our own. We recognise the gravity of that situation, but I also note the group&#146;s conclusion that there is no magic formula to solve the problems. People should not confuse a difficult situation with a problem of strategy. Our strategy has long included many of the elements that the group has highlighted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="61212-0004.htm_para2"><a name="06121262000174">What is changing is the pace at which this strategy unfolds. Prime Minister Maliki and his Government want it to go faster. That is a natural response and, indeed, a welcome sign of increasing confidence, but it also crystallises the great challenge that Maliki faces. On the one hand, to keep up momentum&#151;to reinforce a sense of progress and nationhood&#151;he must show that Iraq is regaining control of its own destiny. At the same time, he must not ask too much too quickly of its developing security forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="61212-0004.htm_para3"><a name="06121262000175">The Prime Minister made it clear during his visit to Washington last week that we have always been open to engagement with Iran and Syria, but it is absolutely vital that the basis for their engagement must be support for the democratically elected Government of Iraq, not support for sectarian or terrorist agendas. Those countries know what they have to do, and they must decide which path they want to follow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="61212-0004.htm_para4"><a name="06121262000176">There are some parts of Iraq, especially Baghdad, where the reality on the ground clearly is a long way from the point where the coalition can hand over. This morning&#146;s suicide bombs were another reminder. Part of their motive, of course, is precisely to provoke an escalating sectarian reaction, but Baghdad is not Iraq, and I make no apology for reminding people that 14 of the 18 provinces are relatively peaceful. The security  <br>

situation, and therefore progress along the security strategy, is different in each of these provinces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="61212-0004.htm_para5"><a name="06121262000177">In the area under British lead in the south, two provinces have been handed over to the Iraqis, and a third is soon to follow. The fourth, Basra, remains the most difficult challenge, but again, the security situation is a symptom: the underlying cause is rival Shi&#146;a power blocs vying for power. Right now, this is too much for the Iraqi security forces to deal with on their own, and there are real weaknesses in the local police, so unlike in the other three provinces, British forces are still doing front-line work in the main city.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="61212-0004.htm_para6"><a name="06121262000178">Operation Sinbad is working through Basra city area by area, re-establishing security, building confidence, rooting out corrupt and failing police, and putting Iraqi soldiers on street corners as a sign that the Government are determined to govern. Friday&#146;s Operation Pisa&#151;an impressive operation involving a number of bold &#147;strikes&#148; across the north of Basra city&#151;shows that when we need to act, we do so and we do so decisively. But of course, the key is that these improvements in security are followed, quickly, by progress in governance and by economic regeneration, building momentum and winning over local people to a positive view of the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="61212-0004.htm_para7"><a name="06121262000179">This is our strategy. We will continue to support the Iraqis in overcoming the violence and intimidation that disfigure their country. We will work with them to build a long-term relationship, including training and mentoring to help the security of both the country and the region, and to deal with the ongoing challenge of international terrorism. Both in security and in the parallel strands of politics and economic development we have to accept that how quickly things move will depend on many factors, not all of them directly under our control. In fact, it is a measure of success if the path of progress becomes increasingly an Iraqi one. As I said in a speech last month, we must get used to thinking in terms not just of our strategy but of our role in their strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="61212-0004.htm_para8"><a name="06121262000180">We continue to insist that we will not cut and run. This is not about political gestures or a trial of wills, but about recognising the challenges we face and also the commitment we have made. We will hand over when it is right so to do, driven not by arbitrary deadlines but by the reality on the ground. I have made clear several times why we will not be drawn into laying out a prescriptive timetable for draw-down, and I note that the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) supported that position yesterday. Our strategy will and must remain conditions-based. We will work to ensure that our plans remain clear and realistic, but we will also work to resist cynicism and defeatism as long as we still believe that we are making a difference&#151;as long as we still believe that the presence of our forces is increasing the chance of a positive legacy for their work and their sacrifice in Iraq in the past three years.</p>

 I thank the Defence Secretary for that response. While we accept much of what he said, does he accept that as the Iraq Study Group described the situation in Iraq as &#147;grave and deteriorating&#148; and as 7,000 British troops are deployed there, the Government should not hesitate to report to the House when major developments arise?

We appreciate that talks between the United Kingdom and the United States are going on, but in that case can the Secretary of State tell us when the Government will be in a position to describe definitively the response of the coalition Governments to the Iraq Study Group?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="61212-0004.htm_para10"><a name="06121262000183">In the meantime, can the right hon.

For instance, did the Prime Minister reach an agreed view with the President in their talks on the ISG proposals last week? In particular, did he obtain a bankable assurance that the United States will now make a firm and sustained effort to revive the Israel-Palestinian peace process?

What will be the objectives of the Prime Minister&#146;s forthcoming visit to the middle east? Can the Defence Secretary tell us what was the result of sending an envoy to Syria a few weeks ago, and have any parallel exploratory talks taken place with Iran?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="61212-0004.htm_para13"><a name="06121262000186">Is it not the case that the need for internal reconciliation in Iraq, the building up of the Iraqi army and the creation of an international support group&#151;all proposed by the ISG&#151;have already been proposed by many of us in the House? What has been the reaction of the Iraqi Government to the proposal to withdraw the bulk of American forces by early 2008? What assessment have the Government made of the reaction of the Iraqi Government to the report&#146;s conclusions? Do they agree that any international contact group formed must have Iraqi involvement throughout?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="61212-0004.htm_para14"><a name="06121262000187">Finally, on a defence matter, while those decisions are pending&#151;as they clearly are&#151;are contingency plans being made to provide for British forces to assist in the more rapid training of the Iraqi army called for by the ISG?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="61212-0004.htm_para15"><a name="06121262000188">Given the myriad questions that legitimately arise from the situation and the apparent imminence before Christmas of an announcement by the President of the United States on the reassessment going on there, will the Secretary of State and his colleagues ensure that the House receives a further full report from the Government before the Christmas recess, so that a full debate on Iraq&#151;the lessons and the prospects&#151;can be held early in the new year?</p>

 I make no criticism of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s desire to have the issue addressed at the Dispatch Box and I cast no aspersions on his motives. I welcome his positive contribution to the debate in respect of these challenging issues. There is, however, a degree of prematurity about his questions, given that the US Administration are still deliberating on the report&#146;s recommendations.

I understand that he has also done a presentation for the British media this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="61212-0004.htm_para23"><a name="06121262000200">Like the Secretary of State, I pay tribute to our armed forces who have suffered a great deal in Iraq in the past few years. However, surely Secretary Baker&#146;s report has stripped any remaining grounds for complacency about the situation in Iraq. We could ask why no similar exercise has been carried out on behalf of this country. As the report states, violence is increasing and the situation is worsening. The report states explicitly:</p>

When President Bush says that there will be a new statement on Iraq policy before Christmas, I&#151;like the shadow Foreign Secretary&#151;urge that we have a similar statement in the UK and a debate as early as possible. It is surely the case now that Britain has to have its own strategy for dealing with Iraq that will lead to a phased withdrawal of British armed forces sooner rather than later.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister will, of course, be here tomorrow to answer questions at the Dispatch Box. It will be interesting to see just how many questions relate to this pressing issue. The complexity of the Iraq Study Group report will no doubt emerge in the questions that I will be asked. The report makes more than 79 recommendations.</p>

The report recommends to the US Administration that there ought to be a change of policy, and the hon. Gentleman suggests that that means that it is recommending the same thing to the British Government. I have gone to some lengths, both here in the House and outside it, to set out our strategy and policy in Iraq. The hon. Gentleman thinks that policy changes need to be made because of the ISG report: I should be grateful if, in the questions that he puts to me as I stand at the Dispatch Box, he would outline what he thinks that they should be.</p>

 I also welcome today&#146;s opportunity to discuss this report, and add my voice to the call for a full debate in this House in the near future. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was right to say that the situation in Iraq is difficult, but does he agree that it would be ridiculous of the British Government to change their policy just because a US study group has made certain recommendations? The US Government have not even given their response to those recommendations yet. In any case, surely it is this Government&#151;and this Parliament&#151;who should determine the policy of the British people in respect of Iraq.

 We continue to study the report, which is complex and substantial. It is a welcome piece of work, because it adds to the debate and to our consideration of these matters at an important period. We had discussions with the study group before the report was published, and found that its members&#146; thinking was broadly in line with our own. Clearly, we need to read and digest the report&#146;s formal recommendations, and we are doing so. However, as I said earlier, it is not obvious to me, in so far as they relate to the area for which we have specific responsibility, that those recommendations demand a change in strategy or policy on our part.</p>

 It is not for me to agree or disagree with assertions made by the author of the report. However, the report was not written by policy makers: it was written by people who make policy recommendations to the policy makers.

 Does my right hon. Friend accept that public support for the policy on Iraq is draining away simply because the elected Government there&#151;and there is no question but that they are elected&#151;seem totally impotent to stop the daily mass slaughter of totally innocent people? It is clear that the occupation troops in Baghdad cannot prevent that slaughter either, so does he agree that, in those circumstances, the loss of public support is hardly surprising?</p>

 If my hon. Friend is correct in what he says about the perception of what is happening in Iraq, the loss of public support is not surprising. An earlier question referred to the visit to the UK of a prominent Iraqi politician. That visit has given people here an opportunity to gauge the views of people in that country and to see whether the assessment given by my hon. Friend is correct. However, I remind him that the Iraqi Government have been in power for a few months only, in circumstances that are as difficult and demanding for a new Government as anyone could imagine. It is therefore very unfair to judge them against standards that we impose from many hundreds if not thousands of miles away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="61212-0005.htm_para3"><a name="06121262000212">There is compelling evidence in Iraq that, through central and local government, the country can run its own affairs. In 14 out of the 18 provinces, where 60 per cent. of the people live, there is relative stability and comparatively little violence. The murder rates in some of those areas are lower than those in many European countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="61212-0005.htm_para4"><a name="06121262000213">We have to recognise that there is appalling violence in Baghdad and other parts of the country and that it has to be addressed, but rather than blaming the people who have to deal with that in a very difficult political situation, sometimes some people in this country should put the blame where it lies: on the internal insurgency and on the interference from other countries to stir up that insurgency.</p>

 Baghdad may not be the whole of Iraq, but 25 per cent. of the population live there. In the other four provinces, 40 per cent. of the population are in the area of the highest insurgency. Does the Secretary of State accept that there is something improper and insensitive about the Prime Minister&#146;s enthusiasm to give evidence to an all-party congressional body appointed to make recommendations on the future of Iraq and his unwillingness to appoint any similar all-party group to advise the British Government or to seek any advice from outwith his own ranks on what is a disaster for British foreign policy?</p>

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman knows that I respect his forensic analysis. I do not think that the two points that he makes are connected in the way that he says they are. He is correct to point out that 40 per cent. of the people of Iraq live in the areas of the worst violence. However, he also has to recognise that there is another part to that equation: 60 per cent. of the people of Iraq do not live in those areas. They enjoy substantially the freedoms that we have won for them and are released from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein. That is a very important positive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="61212-0005.htm_para5"><a name="06121262000216">So far as my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister&#146;s position is concerned, he stands at the Dispatch Box every week, and sometimes more frequently than that, and is able to be questioned by hon. Members. The fact that another Administration appointed a committee to advise them in relation to their policy does not necessarily mean that we have to do exactly the same, particularly when there is no evidence that our strategic approach or our policy in relation to Iraq&#151;particularly the part that we have responsibility for&#151;is failing.</p>

 Did I understand my right hon. Friend correctly? Does he regard the Iraq Study Group as having absolutely no recommendations that could apply to the areas of British responsibility in Iraq? If the President of the United States accepts those recommendations in total, does that mean that the British Government will oppose that change in the strategy in Iraq? Is it not infinitely easier for a leading Iraqi politician to travel half way across the world to speak to British politicians than it is for him or her to travel in their own country to speak to their own constituents?</p>

 I do not necessarily accept my hon.

The meat of her contribution suggested that I was saying that there was nothing in the Iraq Study Group report for the British. That is entirely the opposite of what I was saying. I welcomed the report. Clearly, to the extent that it is consistent with the policy and the strategy that we already have, I welcome it even more. It makes some welcome recommendations and sets in the context of the broader middle east, in particular, the importance of the resolution of the challenges that we face in Iraq. When the US Administration get to the end of their process of considering the recommendations, I do not envisage being in a position where I think that their position has to be disowned or condemned. We will do this together, because we are both members of the same coalition, and we will also do it with the Iraqi Government.</p>

 The British Government&#146;s view of that recommendation, at present, is that we should look at and consider it, together with a number of the other recommendations. I should just say to the hon.

We should also take into account the fact that in many aspects, the Iraqi Government are working well. There are Ministries that are working well; an example is the Ministry of Water Resources, which has made a massive contribution to improving the conditions for the people in Iraq.

 I thank my hon. Friend for her support. I knew that there was a &#147;but&#148; coming, but it is not too difficult to deal with, as I agree with her analysis that the two-state solution is the way forward. It is only by accepting such a solution that we will achieve productive and progressive talks. That view is shared by both the United Kingdom and the US Government.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister cannot be accused of hiding, as he has been willing to answer questions at the Dispatch Box on a range of policies more often than any of his predecessors. The issue on which the hon. Gentleman seeks a debate was recently debated in the context of the Queen&#146;s Speech. In his preamble, he suggested why it may not be convenient to hold a debate at the drop of a hat every time something happens. Sometimes, mature reflection on developments rather than reacting to those developments leads to better debate. The hon. Gentleman said that the ISG was at odds with the Iraqi Government, but I do not think that that is the case. I entirely respect the observations of the Iraqi President, which were understandable, but the process of discussing recommendations and policy has not yet been gone through.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman knows that the disbanding of the Iraqi police was principally a function of the de-Ba&#146;athification of Iraq. That was at the heart of the repression of the Iraqi people and is an issue that they will have to address because, like the geography of the area, the people who live in that country will not go away, and they will have to learn to co-exist.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the Government&#146;s proposals to make it easier for more people to save for their retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para1"><a name="06121262000250">Despite the welcome fact that people are living longer, millions of employees are either not saving at all or not saving enough for their retirement. As the Pensions Commission noted in its second report, we must take steps now to tackle the problem of under-saving or face serious problems in the future. We have already acted to make sure that the state pension provides a solid platform on which people can save. The Pensions Bill published last month will create a simpler and more generous state pension. The restoration of the link to earnings will result in a basic state pension that by 2050 will be worth twice as much in real terms as it is today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para2"><a name="06121262000251">More generous qualifying conditions will, for the first time, properly treat social contributions on an equal footing with cash contributions, delivering fairer outcomes, especially for women and carers. These and other changes will reduce the extent of means-testing in the future, making sure that pension credit continues to be targeted at the people who would otherwise have been poor in retirement or who have only small savings. But we must build on this foundation by giving more people greater incentives and opportunities to save for their retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para3"><a name="06121262000252">Overall participation in occupational schemes has been falling since the late 1960s, and disproportionately high charges are making the personal pensions market uneconomical for those on moderate to low incomes, who often stop contributing to private schemes after a short time. We will therefore be bringing forward legislation to create new low-cost personal accounts as the catalyst for a new savings culture in our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para4"><a name="06121262000253">This White Paper sets out proposals to give every employee in Britain earning over &#163;5,000 the statutory right for the first time to receive a contribution from their employer towards an occupational pension. Provided that they take responsibility in turn by contributing to their pension from their own wages, employees will be entitled to an employer contribution of 3 per cent. of their salary in a band between approximately &#163;5,000 and &#163;33,500. We will fix the level of employer contributions in primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para5"><a name="06121262000254">From 2012, employers will automatically enrol their employees into personal accounts or into their own existing occupational pension scheme, as long at it meets the specified minimum standards. That simple but radical step will affect around 10 million employees in Britain, and it will be vital in overcoming the barriers that prevent many people from making the decision to save. There will be a compliance regime to protect the right of employees to be automatically enrolled and to receive an employer contribution. We will consult on the detail of this approach, but expect it to build on the light-touch model of the national minimum wage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para6"><a name="06121262000255">We intend to establish personal accounts along the lines proposed by the Pensions Commission. The current Pensions Bill provides for the creation of a  <br>

personal accounts delivery authority&#151;an independent body with financial sector expertise that will, in the first instance, advise Government on the design of the operational structure of the accounts and prepare to get the necessary contractual arrangements with the private sector in place. It will then be responsible for commissioning the infrastructure to deliver the scheme from the private sector. The authority will eventually be replaced by a new personal accounts board, which will be responsible for the live running of the accounts. Its decisions will be independent of Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para7"><a name="06121262000256">Evidence suggests that moderate to low earners prefer not to make a choice of pension scheme administrator. Our approach will offer greater simplicity for savers and maximise participation levels. There will be a choice of funds for those who want it, which we expect to include the option of social, environmental and ethical investments and branded products. For those who do not want a choice, there will be a default fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para8"><a name="06121262000257">Low charges are critical to ensuring that people build up the maximum pension fund from their savings. The Government estimate that the long-term costs for personal accounts will be in line with those set out by the Pensions Commission of around 0.3 per cent. of funds under management, or even lower. Together with reduced marketing costs, this approach is expected to be 20 to 25 per cent. cheaper than a system based on direct competition between firms for individuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para9"><a name="06121262000258">These reforms are designed to fill a gap in the existing market, and we want them to complement the existing market, not compete with it. So, alongside the creation of the new personal accounts, we will take action to support existing pension provision. There will be no transfers into or out of personal accounts from or to existing pension schemes, and an annual limit will restrict the level of contributions an individual can put into their account. The limit will be &#163;10,000 in the first year, to allow individuals currently without access to a good-quality occupational pension to save in other non-pension products before 2012 and then to move them to personal accounts. We propose a limit of &#163;5,000 for subsequent years, but we will consult on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para10"><a name="06121262000259">There will be a simple and self-certifying exemption test for employers who operate schemes of broadly equal value to personal accounts. Additionally, we are consulting on whether companies that offer higher value schemes should be allowed to have a reasonable waiting period before employees join the schemes. We are also interested to learn more about the National Association of Pension Funds&#146; proposal of a &#147;good pensions scheme&#148; quality mark to help employees identify companies that offer such pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para11"><a name="06121262000260">The Government are committed to minimising the burden of personal accounts on employers. Mandatory employer contributions will be phased in over at least three years. The reforms have to be simple to run for a small employer. The central clearing house will mean that employers need only have one point of contact for transferring contributions, and the Government will make minimising the administrative burden on employers a key task for the delivery authority and subsequent personal accounts board.</p>

some uncertainty, but thanks to our reforms those who work or care throughout their working lives can expect to be better off from having saved. Indeed, now someone need only work or care for 24 years to avoid pound-for-pound withdrawal; and under existing rules, even the tiny minority of pensioners who receive the guarantee credit only could still see a return from their saving by taking a lump sum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para14"><a name="06121262000263">I hope that these reforms set a sustainable and sensible course. They are in the long-term interests not only of this generation but of generations to come. I commend the White Paper to the House.</p>

 I thank the Secretary of State for his statement. We have already indicated our support for the state pension reform package and for the objective of providing workplace savings targeted at those who are least well served by the pensions industry&#151;largely lower-paid people outside employer schemes. We have made it clear that we will support the auto-enrolment proposals and the compulsory employer contributions. There is a large measure of consensus around the state pension reform proposals, but there are still important issues to be resolved as regards personal accounts. I hope that the Secretary of State will be able to confirm that the White Paper is a further step in the process and that he is willing to engage in further constructive dialogue. We are broadly comfortable with his proposed structure of a low-cost default fund with the option, for the more adventurous, of opting into branded funds that are more actively managed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para15"><a name="06121262000265">However, I want to draw three major areas of concern to the Secretary of State&#146;s attention. First, there is considerable concern in the industry and among commentators about the risk of levelling down, which he did not mention. Employers faced with the requirement to enrol the whole of their work force may seek to control increasing costs by reducing the level of contributions that they make. The right hon. Gentleman may say that that is a price worth paying for wider coverage, but that would be scant comfort to those who are already in more generous schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para16"><a name="06121262000266">Secondly, there is concern that with relatively high levels of residual means-testing, which is projected by the Pensions Policy Institute to affect up to 50 per cent. of pensioners by 2050, it may be difficult for many people who are on lower earnings and are likely to have broken work records to determine whether saving will pay for them. The last thing any of us want is to be here, or for our successors to be here, in 30 years&#146; time facing the equivalent of a pensions mis-selling scandal, with hundreds of thousands of people having saved but finding that they do not benefit from having done so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para17"><a name="06121262000267">Thirdly, the right hon. Gentleman spoke of personal accounts complementing rather than competing with the existing market. We support that targeted approach. However, in turning his back on Lord Turner&#146;s recommendation of a &#163;3,000 cap on contributions to personal accounts and setting it at &#163;5,000, as he said today&#151;or at least &#163;5,000, as it says in the White Paper&#151;he is hugely expanding the scope of personal accounts and reducing the focus on those who are being most failed by the existing marketplace. He will make it much more difficult to assess the extent to which he has succeeded in his principal objective of getting people on lower earnings into long-term savings, and he is running the risk of undermining the already battered private pension saving sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para18"><a name="06121262000268">Will the right hon. Gentleman assure the House that he is alert to, and willing to address, all those issues? In particular, will he commit the Government to focusing over the next couple of years on the deregulatory review of occupational pensions, to ensure that the occupational pensions sector is as robust as possible before personal accounts are introduced so that the temptation for employers to level down is minimised? Will he look again at the need to focus the scheme on the lower paid and therefore review the proposed cap of at least &#163;5,000?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para19"><a name="06121262000270">When the Government damage pension provision or confidence in our pension system&#151;for example, through their continuing &#163;5 billion a year raid on pension funds, U-turns on the tax treatment of pension schemes and the continued unresolved suffering of the victims of pension scheme failures&#151;we will continue to hold them to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para20"><a name="06121262000271">Similarly, when the Government have got it right, as in the state pension reforms, we will say so and actively support their proposals. When the general direction is right, but problems remain, as with personal accounts, so long as the Government are genuinely willing to engage in a continuing dialogue, we will try to work with them to build an agreed model because we believe that, on a long-term issue such as savings, seeking that cross-party consensus is in the interests of Britain and the British people. I hope that the Secretary of State will confirm that he intends to continue to try to reach that consensus in the next nine months.</p>

 I welcome what I believe to be the overall support that the hon. Gentleman continues to signal for the proposals.

Lord Turner&#146;s report earlier. He might like to know that, today, Lord Turner said of the proposals that he hoped that there would be widespread support for the way forward that the Government propose. If the hon. Gentleman wants to escape from the big tent that Lord Turner has been carefully constructing, he will find it difficult, given Lord Turner&#146;s support for the proposals. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para21"><a name="06121262000275">The hon. Gentleman has raised several important points and I shall try to deal with each of them. I hope that the White Paper will help sustain the consensus to which he has been a party because we want that to continue. The White Paper clearly signals that further consultation is required on several matters&#151;the hon. Gentleman referred to one or two of them. One is determining the personal contributions cap, and we are consulting about that. If people believe that &#163;5,000 is too high, they can present their arguments, to which we will listen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para22"><a name="06121262000276">There is further consultation to conduct about governance of the national pensions savings scheme. We shall do that in the open way in which we have set about the matter so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para23"><a name="06121262000277">The hon. Gentleman raised three or four more specific points. On levelling down, personal accounts are designed to complement, not compete with, existing employer provision. We can do four simple things to try to ring-fence and ensure that personal accounts work as we intend. One is to prohibit transfers&#151;I have dealt with that. The annual cap and contributions will help, too. The simple and straightforward employer exemption test will be helpful, and that also applies to the new quality mark proposal from the National Association of Pension Funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para24"><a name="06121262000278">It was widely argued when we introduced the national minimum wage that it would level down wages. That did not happen and I do not believe that it will happen to occupational pensions. It is important to understand that employers are levelling down contributions now&#151;there is currently no floor to the contributions that they offer. Personal accounts will, for the first time, set a minimum below which contributions cannot fall. Personal accounts will increase, not undermine, total levels of pension saving. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="61212-0006.htm_para25"><a name="06121262000279">The hon. Gentleman asked whether it was safe to auto-enrol and prayed in aid the Pensions Policy Institute. The Department and the institute basically draw the same overall conclusions about personal accounts. The Pensions Policy Institute says that they will help most people and are a big improvement. We agree. Our figures are similar. We have different assumptions about annuity rates from the PPI, and its analysis does not take into account the fact that some people may choose to take some or all of their pension pot as a lump sum, but we both agree that auto-enrolment is a good idea and that most will gain from it. Some might have low returns but the vast majority will need good information and we have work to do to put together the generic information that will go out with personal accounts. However, people can decide to opt out. That is the ultimate safety mechanism to ensure that people gain when they are enrolled&#151;it is a conscious choice.</p>

 Don&#146;t be ridiculous. We are trying to have a serious debate. The scope of NPSS remains exactly as proposed by Lord Turner: on a band of earnings between &#163;5,000 and &#163;33,000. There is no suggestion of extending the scope of personal accounts.</p>

He complained about the so-called tax raid on pensions and the &#163;2.5 billion that we have put into the financial assistance scheme to help those who lost out when their schemes went into insolvency. My understanding of his proposals is that he will not spend a penny more on the financial assistance scheme, and that he will not reverse on tax cuts. The less that we hear from him about that, the better.</p>

 Will my right hon.

In the light of that, will he comment further on what he will do to provide high-quality generic advice to prospective entrants into NPSS? Where will the consumer voice be in the delivery authority that he is establishing?</p>

 On my hon. Friend&#146;s last point, the Government have more work to do on establishing the arrangements, on which the White Paper proposes a series of consultations.

How much of the target audience does the Secretary of State estimate will get &#163;2 out for every &#163;1 put in? Does he agree that because of the extent of means testing, not just in the pensions system but in relation to housing benefit and council tax benefit, many people will not get that kind of return?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="61212-0007.htm_para5"><a name="06121262000291">Thirdly, will the Secretary of State confirm that he has now had to abandon his original ambition that nobody should be worse off through personal accounts? Will he confirm that he acknowledges in paragraph 79 of the executive summary that a small group of people&#151;probably about 10 per cent.&#151;will not see any benefit at all from saving? Does not he agree with the PPI analysis that that group might be bigger than 10 per cent., and that women with caring responsibilities, older people, the self-employed and those on housing benefit might find that they lose money&#151;in some cases, 85 per cent. of their savings&#151;in personal accounts?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="61212-0007.htm_para6"><a name="06121262000292">Is not there an enormous price to be paid for the consensus that the Government have secured, and the deal that the Secretary of State has done with the Chancellor of the Exchequer? Was the Secretary of State incorrect to say, in the early part of his statement, that he is building on a firm foundation in the basic state pension? Is not the flaw in all the proposals that he is building on too low a basic state pension with too much means testing and that, as a consequence, he might find it difficult to persuade many people on low incomes to save in personal accounts, and he or his successors might even be accused of state-sponsored mis-selling in future?</p>

Our reforms to the state pension will, for the first time, provide a genuinely robust platform on which people can save with confidence for the future. As for means testing, many people on income-related benefits in retirement can still expect to receive more than they contributed on the basis of personal accounts. As I made clear in my statement, even the very small minority of pensioners who could face a greater withdrawal of benefits during retirement might receive a positive payback from their saving by taking a lump  <br>

 Yes, the vast majority can expect to benefit from that or an equivalent scheme. Even people on savings credit can expect to get back more than they contribute, even when account has been taken of any pension credit offsets&#151;twice as much, in the case of long-term savers.</p>

Gentleman will want to reflect on what he has said today, and will not go about trying to undermine the personal accounts scheme as he has today. I think he is wrong in his basic analysis of the level and extent of means testing in the system. I have tried to respond to his points today, and I dare say I shall continue to do so; but I consider his proposed reform&#151;the universal state pension, which I think he believes would deal with all those points&#151;to be simply unaffordable. It would run up massive and unsustainable tax burdens for future generations, and that alone undermines his fundamental analysis.</p>

 I congratulate the Secretary of State on his scheme for low income earners who have been excluded from the savings market. He will recall the Treasury Committee report on the subject, which highlighted the need for low charges. The evidence that I have received from private companies to date suggests that they are thinking of management charges of 0.6 per cent. and above.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="61212-0007.htm_para10"><a name="06121262000302">Low charges are critical. Turner&#146;s comments are salutary. If we take the figure of 1.3 per cent. for stakeholder products, individuals&#146; income over the lifetime of a pension is 20 per cent. less. I want to hear a robust statement from the Secretary of State to indicate that the 0.3 per cent. management charges envisaged by Lord Turner and his colleagues will stick, for the sake of low income earners and their pension pot at the end of the day.</p>

One is the employer contribution, and the other is the low charges that will be associated with it. As I have said today, we believe that in the long term it will be possible to get down to 30 basis points for the delivery of personal accounts. It will, however, be the job and responsibility of, first, the delivery authority and then the personal accounts board to negotiate with pension providers and the industry to establish the right basis on which charges will be handled in the scheme. We are consulting on that, but let me repeat what we said when we responded to my noble Friend&#146;s report, and what I have said today. We believe that this system can be run within the funding band that Turner set out, and if we can achieve that it will be a huge boost to the pension incomes of many middle and low earners in this country.</p>

 I welcome some of the changes in the White Paper.

Is the Secretary of State aware that as matters stand, my constituents will receive some assistance from the financial assistance scheme, but that will give them only 50 per cent. of their original pension at retirement date?

 I welcome the announcement, but may I press my right hon. Friend a little further on who will gain and whether anybody will ultimately lose out? As he knows, one of the commonest complaints among people on modest incomes with modest occupational pensions is that when they retire they find that they are worse off, or not much better off, than people on benefits. How will this new personal account address that problem?</p>

 The account is part of a suite of reforms that include significant changes to the state pension system. The reforms will make it more generous and extend its coverage, taking most people who have a lifetime&#146;s worth of contributions and work well clear of the means-tested threshold, so they will be able to keep what they save in the national pension saving scheme. It is for that reason, and for others, that we are confident that the vast majority of savers will benefit from being a part of the personal account scheme.</p>

Will he tell us a little more about how this scheme will be presented to the general public? Will they receive a personal account from the delivery authority or a private provider?

 The Secretary of State rightly talks about restoring confidence in the future, which started to be eroded about 20 years ago when the Conservatives introduced personal pensions, which were mis-sold. Although the proposals are welcome in helping to restore confidence in the future, two things are needed. We do not need financial advice alone; we also need far better financial education, because many people do not understand the advice that they are given. Secondly, I say in the friendliest of terms that we would further our cause more if we were seen to be accepting the ombudsman&#146;s report as well.</p>

It is of vital long-term interest to the pension system that millions of people who are not saving start to do so. They will not be able to do that successfully unless we, the personal accounts board and the delivery board put considerable time and effort into communicating the benefits of these reforms and of pension saving.</p>

 The reforms that we are proposing for the state second pension will certainly aid simplicity and clarity and lead eventually, I hope, to a better understanding of pension entitlement.

A highly complicated formula is used to calculate eligibility and entitlement, and we are moving&#151;as the system itself inevitably is&#151;to a more flat-rate system by 2030.

Alongside that, we envisage a number of bulk-bought funds that might, for example, cover low, medium and high risk for people who want to exercise such a choice, and some branded products. The precise menu available to those who join personal accounts obviously needs to be worked out in detail between now and 2012 by the personal accounts delivery authority and, eventually, the personal accounts board.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="61212-0008.htm_para2"><a name="06121262000328">The Bill is about backing London, one of the greatest cities in the world. It is about devolution from the Government to London and also about helping Londoners to get things done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="61212-0008.htm_para3"><a name="06121262000329">London&#146;s economy alone is larger than that of many European countries. It is the driver of the UK economy, has world-beating financial and business service sectors, with a business climate that makes it a natural magnet for foreign investors. The capital has thriving and innovative arts, culture and entertainment industries. It is one of the most vibrant cities on the planet. Its ethnically diverse communities have close links across the globe. However, London faces challenges, which often stem from its very strength, in terms of transport, housing, skills and inequalities across the city.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="61212-0008.htm_para4"><a name="06121262000330">Already the restoration of city-wide government to the capital has made a powerful difference to London and to Londoners, but we need to go further and to build on the programme of reform so far. The Bill builds on the previous reforms introduced for London after 1997. Just as we delivered a Parliament in Scotland and an Assembly in Wales, so we introduced a directly elected Mayor and assembly in London. Londoners themselves wanted that change; every London borough voted overwhelmingly in favour of establishing the Greater London assembly in the referendum of 1998. The creation of the Mayor and the assembly restored democratic city-wide government, which the Conservatives had taken away in 1986 without asking the people of London. For 14 years, London was the only major city without city-wide government.</p>

 I shall not rise to such arrant nonsense. However, perhaps the Minister will admit that not only the people of London but the people of Great Britain and the United Kingdom were asked in the 1983 general election about the abolition of the Greater London council. Would the hon. Lady like to tell us the result of that election? It was conclusive evidence from the country that the then Conservative Government had a full mandate to abolish the GLC in 1986.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="61212-0008.htm_para5"><a name="06121262000335">Six years on, the strong mayoral model is working for London. The GLA has been a success story for London and for Londoners. The congestion charge has reduced congestion in London by more than 20 per cent. even at a time when car use has been increasing across the country. The charge has generated extra income to improve public transport across the capital. The number of people using buses has gone up by a third, thanks to improved investment and the service improvements that are part of a multi-billion pound programme of public transport investment in the capital. Police numbers have increased substantially and crime has fallen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="61212-0008.htm_para6"><a name="06121262000336">London has a strong voice, not just in this country but throughout the world. That is one of the reasons why we won the bid for the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics, something of which the whole nation can be proud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="61212-0008.htm_para7"><a name="06121262000337">London First, representing 300 of the capital&#146;s major businesses, has hailed those reforms as a success. The organisation now supports greater devolution to the Mayor and the strong strategic leadership set out in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="61212-0008.htm_para8"><a name="06121262000338">Significant challenges face the city as a whole, which justify further reforms and will require stronger leadership in future. The capital faces serious pressures on housing, for example; by 2026, there may be more than 1 million more Londoners to accommodate in sustainable communities in the capital. It is vital for London that badly needed new homes are built and that the London plan is delivered. We need planning improvements to support business development and delivery for the sake of the London economy, too. That is why London First supports the measures.</p>

 I shall come on to discuss housing and planning proposals in more detail shortly, but the hon. Gentleman should recognise that it is right for decisions about the priorities for housing investment across the capital to be set out by the Mayor rather than by the regional housing board, which previously made recommendations to the Secretary of State. We think that it is right to devolve that to the Mayor, who should set out the key priorities for the capital. As we know, housing decisions in one part of the capital can have a wider impact on the housing market and it is important to address the housing pressures that London faces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="61212-0008.htm_para10"><a name="06121262000342">We need to look at skills and the need to keep up with the knowledge-based economy. It is also important to deal with one of the most crucial global challenges of our generation&#151;climate change. London will face particular challenges adapting to climate change, whether in respect of heat or flooding risks, and we think it right that part of the Bill focuses on that issue.</p>

 The Minister emphasised the value of giving responsibilities for skills to London government, so why was it not possible to fight the resistance of officials in the Department for Education and Skills in respect of giving complete control of the Learning and Skills Council to London government, rather than putting it at arm&#146;s length from the Mayor?</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman knows, our proposals on skills are being taken forward in another Bill and there will be plenty of opportunity to debate the detail. We think it right that there should be a greater role for the Mayor as part of the focus for skills, but it is not just about skills: it is about locations for investment, wider economic, transport and housing strategies and the ability to link them together. We believe that the arrangements achieve that.</p>

 I am grateful. The Minister&#146;s reference to climate change is laudable, but why is there no reference to the Mayor&#146;s responsibilities for water, which would provide some tangible proof of commitment to dealing with climate change?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman may be aware that, later this week, we are publishing a planning policy statement around climate change. We are also publishing a revised code for sustainable homes, which takes particular account of the need to improve water efficiency right across the country. The planning system already takes account of the need to plan for water use, which is also included as part of the London plan, which the Mayor obviously leads. We believe that the Mayor already plays an important role, but that he needs further powers, particularly in relation to climate change, given that the issue is important not just for London, but for the whole country and across the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="61212-0008.htm_para11"><a name="06121262000349">We believe that the proposed reforms are needed to help Londoners get things done and to respond to the serious challenges facing the capital, but they are also about devolution&#151;handing power from central Government to London on a series of issues. The Greater London Authority Bill and the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill aim to devolve power to London boroughs as well as to the Mayor to do a better job for London.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. We want the Housing Corporation to deliver its funding in accordance with the strategy set out by the Mayor, in the way that it does at present for the strategy set out by the regional housing board. We also think that it is important that we link housing strategy with planning, because the planning system needs to do its bit to support new homes and development if we are to meet the needs of the future.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that it is regrettable that Westminster city council had to be forced to accept the 50 per cent. target for affordable housing provision? For that reason, people in housing need welcome the extension of the Mayor&#146;s powers. Does she also think that it is necessary to take action against those boroughs&#151;especially Conservative-held ones on the outskirts of London&#151;that are blocking attempts to make housing provision accessible to boroughs in central London, including their Conservative partner boroughs, through the sub-regional partnerships? Those outer boroughs are making it impossible for central London boroughs under housing pressure to meet their needs in partnership with other areas of the capital.</p>

 My hon. Friend raises an important point. Boroughs have an important role in responding to housing needs in their area, in terms of new build, affordable housing and housing allocation policies, including working in partnership. Every borough needs to accept that the decisions it takes have a knock-on impact on neighbouring boroughs. Housing markets across London do not fit into administrative boundaries and one borough&#146;s decision has much wider repercussions. That is why it is so important that the London plan should be delivered and the approach that some Conservative authorities have taken to housing should not be allowed to continue. It is right to have a proper approach to housing across the capital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="61212-0008.htm_para17"><a name="06121262000365">We think that it is important to make further changes to the planning system to ensure the delivery of the London plan. At present, the Mayor has the power to step in and turn down important strategic developments that have an impact on the London plan. That power is negative&#151;that is, it is anti-development. Given the crucial importance of housing and development in London, we think that there should be a more balanced approach and that the Mayor should be given the ability to act positively on certain major strategic developments that are important to the successful implementation of the London plan.</p>

We agree with London First, London Councils and the Mayor that it would be better for boroughs to make their decisions on an application before the Mayor decides whether the policy test is met and whether he wants to intervene. We believe that that will provide a better parallel to the Mayor&#146;s current powers and give the boroughs the clear central role in dealing with a planning application and its impact on a local area.

The concern of many of us who have looked at this matter closely is about definition. Without a clear and precise definition, there is a real risk of mission creep and of the Mayor extending the powers beyond those envisaged in what my hon. Friend has set out to the House. There is a possibility of wrangles and disputes between individual boroughs and the Mayor about the definition of strategic. Will she assure us that, very soon&#151;certainly before the Committee stage begins&#151;the detailed proposals will be published and there will be a full opportunity for Members and interested parties to consider them and respond to her on whether the precise definitions are workable and will achieve the objective that she sets out?</p>

It is important to do that through secondary legislation because that gives us a further opportunity to review the details and to have a process to amend the secondary legislation, should that prove necessary over time. One of the reasons why we have not yet published the detail for what the policy test should be is exactly that we have been undertaking detailed discussions with the London boroughs, the Mayor, London First and a series of regional organisations and stakeholders across London to try to build a consensus on the most effective way for the test to work.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman may be aware that some people have argued that the level of refusal of planning applications in London is higher than in other regions. There are certainly concerns from businesses and developers across London that inappropriate decisions are being taken, which is why so many cases go to appeal. There are also views across London, both within and across London government, about difficult decisions being taken by boroughs that might have an impact on the London plan. In practice, my view is that the measure should apply to a small number of cases and that only a small number of cases could be described as having strategic significance.</p>

We think that giving the boroughs the ability to take the first decision and to deal with the application will allow them to take the lead role in many cases.

There will be a benefit if local communities are involved at an early stage in not only the London plan, but the local development framework that is drawn up by their London borough. That will be critically important. The hon. Gentleman is right that transparency is needed in the way in which any mayoral decisions are taken. This goes further than simply being able to replicate the Mayor&#146;s existing negative power. When considering whether to use the positive power, it will be critical that there is proper transparency, so arrangements will need to be in place to allow people to see the exact way in which decisions are taken and to be aware of the involvement that they can have in the process.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. If there is to be a London plan, with a process of democratic engagement around the plan and an agreement that the plan is the right thing for the city, we will need to make sure that the delivery of the plan cannot be scuppered by major developments being refused in circumstances in which there would be no ability to address that decision, especially if they are important strategic developments that would have an impact on not one borough, but the delivery of the plan as a whole. That is why we need to recognise that the provisions are about allowing the Mayor to do his job. They are about allowing London to have proper leadership, while ensuring that proper safeguards are in place for local communities, so that London boroughs can do their job&#151;can do what they do best&#151;and can take the lead on the overwhelming majority of applications. The Mayor would need to intervene in a very small minority of cases. It is worth recognising that the Mayor has intervened and used his negative powers to turn down applications in a very small number of cases. The powers proposed in the Bill should be used in a similarly judicious way, limiting the number of cases that will be covered in future.</p>

 Opposition Members do not seem too bothered about the fact that when a borough wants to accept a planning application, the Mayor can step in and turn it down, if it is a major strategic application. They do not seem too fussed about the Mayor having negative, anti-development powers relating to major strategic applications. We are simply saying that there should be a balance, and that we should be able to approach matters positively, rather than taking a continually anti-development, anti-housing approach to the needs of London.

Clearly, the Mayor is already taking action on climate change, but it is important that it has a stronger focus, to consider measures to prevent and reduce carbon emissions, and to adapt to the challenge that climate change poses to London.

I cannot disagree. The unelected London Housing Board is being given to the Mayor. The Mayor is getting power to make planning decisions, as the Minister said at great length. Learning and skills are being ceded to the Mayor, so far without parliamentary approval. The Mayor is getting some responsibility for, but no power over, public health.</p>

Boroughs could find it hard to deliver local strategies if the Mayor&#146;s spending priorities differ and resources are not made available. That concentrates too much power and influence in the hands not just of the Mayor, but of central Government.</p>

It is crucial that &#147;strategic&#148; be technically and closely defined, because one person&#146;s simple plan can be strategic to somebody else. In February 2006, in response to the ODPM&#146;s original consultation paper, the Mayor identified some 25 schemes where he might have used the power to take over an application, suggesting that perhaps five schemes a year would come under his new power, and the Minister acknowledged that.

The Mayor would be judge and jury and his decisions would not be open to challenge. Surely the Minister can convince us that the statutory instrument will cover that.

It is unfortunate that Kate Barker did not consider the current position in London or the new proposals. The Government&#146;s target is that 60 per cent. of major planning applications should be decided in 13 weeks.

Will he also confirm that, if the Mayor wants to force changes to a proposed planning obligation, he can no longer take over a relevant planning application after the borough has granted planning permission but while the obligation is being negotiated?

The Mayor is obliged to produce a plethora of strategies, apart from those that he has devised off his own bat, and the Bill imposes more. I shall not weary the House with the detail, but boroughs are required to &#147;have regard to&#148; some, be &#147;in conformity with&#148; others and &#147;in general conformity with&#148; yet others.</p>

We will, therefore, try to amend the Bill so that the boroughs must &#147;have regard to&#148; the Mayor&#146;s strategies. That will ensure that whoever is Mayor takes the London boroughs with him on his strategies, and that borough councillors feel that they own the ideas. Acceptance in local communities will be easier and the resentment that is building about centrally imposed plans and strategies will be reduced.</p>

Of course, mistakes were made and lessons were learned. However, it is relevant to note that the membership of the board currently includes eight representatives from the boroughs. The Bill takes two borough representatives away to give the places to the Mayor to represent &#147;other interests&#148;&#151;perhaps friends of Ken&#151;but the saving grace are the many borough representatives, which ensures that decisions made by LFEPA are owned by the boroughs.</p>

I hesitate to describe the rest of the board as &#147;friends of Ken&#148;, but it does not contain a single representative of the London boroughs. The Bill removes the current ban on political representatives on the board, for which I offer much thanks, but it would allow the Mayor to appoint an assembly member or a member of a London borough&#151;doubtless a friend of Ken&#151;and the Transport for London board will not be any more responsive to the travelling public across the capital. I, for one, would still have no confidence that Transport for London would care a jot more about my constituents than it does now, when it is about as responsive as a slug.</p>

Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), waste disposal arrangements are not working, while in south London they are. London councils believe that the Government&#146;s proposed waste and recycling forum should be set up as soon as possible and be a partnership between the boroughs and the Mayor, with at least 50 per cent. borough membership. The Government have missed a trick, however, by not including water as well as waste disposal in the proposal. The disagreements over the issue should be aired at evidence-taking sessions by the Bill Committee to reach a balanced conclusion and amend the Bill if necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="61212-0011.htm_para1"><a name="06121266000045">We are rather puzzled by the handover to the Mayor of responsibility for public health. Clearly, the Government feel in something of a quandary, as the Bill envisages that as a double-hatted appointment for the current regional director of public health. Undoubtedly, it will be great fun for the Mayor to devise a health inequalities policy for London, but what will happen if his ideas are in direct contravention of the director&#146;s? Who will have the final say? Who will have control of the money to put any strategy into practice? What will be the involvement of the primary care trusts, as they, along with the hospitals, will have to act on vaccination campaigns, for instance? This matter should be another candidate for evidence-giving to allow the Committee to tease out exactly what power and responsibility the Mayor would have.</p>

We do not see the need for that change. We know that the City of London still has concerns and will be seeking reassurances about the City of London museum, a national museum of which I am particularly fond and which has done a magnificent job of uncovering and displaying some of London&#146;s real treasures. I am sure that the Committee will be interested in ensuring that those concerns are explored and met.</p>

In both, the Secretary of State retains some limited powers of direction, but again, the only involvement of the London boroughs is by consultation. The boroughs will almost certainly have to implement some of the strategies. Why do the boroughs have no real involvement? That is not devolution of power; it leaves the most responsive level of local government in London helpless.</p>

At the time, I was surprised at the confused and incoherent stance of the Conservative party on the issue. Of course, it could be excused its state at that time. It had suffered a massive election defeat and was shell-shocked by the total repudiation of its position on London and the clear support of Londoners, which was reinforced in a referendum a year later in every London borough, for the restoration of a city-wide authority on the new basis.</p>

At least it could claim, 10 years ago, that the GLA model was new: it was innovative and untested, and so I suppose that it could reserve judgment.

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="61212-0011.htm_para10"><a name="06121279000009">First, as is well understood, the GLA model was an innovative one, with a directly elected executive mayor for the first time in this country, a small scrutinising assembly, four functional bodies responsible, respectively, for transport, policing, economic development and fire and resilience, and a strategic remit unprecedented in British local government. Inevitably, with the passage of time, some of the initial decisions&#151;for example, on the eligibility of members to serve on Transport for London&#151;have appeared to be probably not optimal. Therefore, there is a case for change. With any innovative structure of such a nature, it is right that Parliament should have a chance to reconsider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="61212-0011.htm_para11"><a name="06121279000010">Secondly, the very success of the GLA has strengthened the case for devolving more powers to the Mayor. As a former local government Minister as well as a former London Minister, I am perfectly ready to admit that extracting powers from colleagues in other Departments to devolve to a new and untried model of city governance was not the easiest of tasks. My colleagues, who had spent 18 years in opposition, had only just managed to get their hands on the levers of power when along came another colleague saying that he wanted to take some of them away and devolve them to a new tier of government. Inevitably, it was not as full a package as might have been considered desirable. There was, for instance, a clear argument for an extension of the powers relating to housing.</p>

Beckenham (Mrs. Lait), the fear is that devolution will go the other way. Surely we can support this devolution, provided that the Mayor and the GLA devolve some of their authority and responsibility to the 33 London boroughs.</p>

<p><a name="st_o275"><a name="06121279000012"><a name="61212-0011.htm_spnew6"><a name="06121279000048"><b>Mr. Raynsford:</b>
 I do not entirely agree with that. When we set up the structure for London governance, I was very clear that the Mayor and the GLA should have a strategic remit to deal with matters that should be dealt with at London-wide level, and that the boroughs should continue to be responsible for local service delivery, because they are best placed for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="61212-0011.htm_para12"><a name="06121279000013">In the past, there was confusion between the strategic and operational functions of the Greater London council, and there was often conflict between the boroughs and the GLC. I am pleased to say that in general the new arrangements between the Mayor and the boroughs have worked reasonably well, although there have been some tensions, as there are bound to be between a strategic authority and more local operational authorities. I therefore do not consider it appropriate to talk of devolution from the one to the other. We should be talking about the proper definition of a strategic as opposed to a local service, and ensuring that wherever possible the balance remains correct.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="61212-0011.htm_para13"><a name="06121279000014">The case for devolution and localism has gained ground over the last 10 years, and the recent local government White Paper argued the case forcefully. It is perfectly proper now to suggest that more power should be given to the Mayor than was proposed in 1997. The next question that arises is this: is the current package the right one? Are the new powers that the Bill proposes for the Mayor and the assembly appropriate? Are the changes to the GLA&#146;s procedures correct, and do they ensure a proper balance between the interests of the Mayor and those of the assembly?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="61212-0011.htm_para14"><a name="06121279000015">My answer is that the Bill&#146;s proposals go very much in the right direction, and are appropriate. I will be happy to support those proposals in the Lobbies if the Opposition are unwise enough to repeat their gross misjudgment of nine years ago, when they voted against the restoration of city-wide governance in London. However, my support is not entirely unqualified. I feel that some aspects should be given more detailed consideration during the Bill&#146;s passage.</p>

Conservative Members advanced some extraordinary propositions. I seem to recall the proposal that there should be a Mayor but no assembly. The Liberal Democrats were equally foolish, proposing an assembly without a Mayor. The Opposition Benches were not a happy sight nine years ago, and I am afraid they look equally troubled tonight.</p>

 That rather farcical illustration was of about the same calibre as the hon.

 No, I do not agree with that. I believe that there is a balance between the powers that should be exercised at local level, at regional level and at national level. Getting that balance right is always difficult and there will always be tensions, but it is important that there should be a national overview of housing policy and measures to ensure that there is adequate provision in areas where otherwise there would probably be none, because of the resistance of some sections of the population and some political parties. The Government must be able to insist that housing needs are met. I do not agree with removing the reserved powers, but I am strongly in favour of giving the Mayor a much stronger role.</p>

I support the case for enabling the Mayor to ensure greater compliance with the London plan throughout Greater London. That includes both a stronger say in whether borough development plans conform with the London plan and, in limited circumstances, giving the Mayor power to direct approval of a development proposal of strategic importance which clearly conforms with the London plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="61212-0011.htm_para18"><a name="06121279000027">I know that some people are concerned about the implications of giving the Mayor power to direct approval, rather than just the current power to say no. Their argument hinges on the slightly suspect assumption that planning powers to refuse are acceptable because they are accompanied by a right of appeal to the Secretary of State, while powers to accept&#151;which are not subject to such an appeal&#151;should not be granted. In my view, it is right to permit the Mayor both to direct an acceptance and to direct a refusal, if there is clear evidence that the particular development application is clearly of strategic significance, and clearly not in conformity with the London plan. The definition must be drawn very carefully, however, to avoid the risk of mission creep, which I mentioned in an early intervention, and also the risk of conflict between the Mayor&#146;s economic development objectives and financial interests, as well as planning interests. It is a question of propriety, and also of ensuring that decisions are made in a transparent way.</p>

Does he accept that the logic of his argument should be that the thresholds for any matter that is referable to the Mayor should be raised rather than lowered, to ensure that they are truly strategic and to avoid any needless conflict between the strategic and the operational? Secondly, in terms of the general principle, if the Mayor is to be a planning authority, whether with positive or purely negative powers, on reflection after six years, can it possibly be desirable for a planning authority&#151;in effect, a one-person planning authority&#151;to be given those powers?

responsible for the London plan. That defines the planning objectives for London, and it would be very odd indeed if it is said that the person elected by the people of London to do that were not able to discharge that role. Therefore, I think that there is a logical inconsistency in the hon.

 I have to tell the hon.

All that is being proposed is an extension to the Mayor of the same power that can be exercised by an individual local authority when it considers a planning application. That change is to ensure that the Mayor has the ability to direct acceptance as well as refusal. I wholly agree with the hon. Gentleman about transparency, however, and I also wish to stress something that I said earlier: such a power of acceptance must be used in only a very limited number of strategic cases where it is clearly right that the decision be taken at the London-wide level, rather than a local level.</p>

Under that architecture, the Mayor is clearly, unequivocally, in the driving seat, with executive powers, while the role of the assembly is to scrutinise, to hold the Mayor to account and to test whether the Mayor&#146;s strategies are as effective and robust as they need to be to meet London&#146;s needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para1"><a name="06121279000037">The proposed changes do not seek to alter that, despite the pressures applied from some quarters to extend greater executive powers to the assembly. That would be confusing, and inconsistent with the &#147;strong mayor&#148; model that is at the heart of the GLA system of governance. The proposed changes respect the overall structure, but refine the way in which it operates, and they are generally sensible, modest and incremental reforms. The Mayor will rightly be required to have regard to the assembly&#146;s views before finalising his strategies, and he will be obliged to give reasons when rejecting assembly proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para2"><a name="06121279000038">On staffing matters, the assembly will be empowered to hold confirmation hearings for a limited number of senior posts, but it will not be able to veto appointments. In both of those respects, the assembly&#146;s scrutiny role is being strengthened without undermining the Mayor&#146;s executive powers. The head of paid service will take over responsibility for appointments, in line with normal public service patterns. However, in its representations the assembly makes a valid point when questioning whether that power should extend to changes in the overall establishment without such changes being subject to scrutiny. That question should be considered in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para3"><a name="06121279000039">On the budget, the Bill sensibly proposes a split to identify separately the proportion of the budget attributable to the assembly, as against the proportion necessary to meet the Mayor&#146;s requirements. The current proposals incorporate a rather complex formula to cap any increase in the budget attributable to the assembly, without any comparable mechanism to establish a floor below which the assembly&#146;s budget cannot be reduced. The assembly perfectly reasonably thinks that that is unfair and one-sided. I understand that it believes that the current Mayor has been generous in providing for the assembly&#146;s needs and it does not doubt that he will continue to be so, but it fears that under a different regime that might not be the case. It also argues that if it is necessary to provide safeguards against unreasonable increases in the level of the assembly budget, comparable safeguards should apply to ensure that no future Mayor could vengefully reduce the assembly&#146;s resources to prevent effective scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para4"><a name="06121279000040">With those reservations, I am happy to confirm my strong support for the proposals in the Bill, which will help the GLA continue to develop successfully and provide the effective city-wide leadership that our capital needs and deserves. I look forward to the Bill being enacted.</p>

much-needed London governance for London. He will know that my party wanted to go further, and in some respects&#151;in particular, rail&#151;we are going further along the lines for which we called.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para5"><a name="06121271000002">The Bill brings back fond memories of the Greater London Authority Bill of 1999, with its 425 clauses and 34 schedules, and of the first mayoral election and the shambolic selection of the Labour candidate. It reminds me of the debates about the congestion charge. I recall one that the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) and I attended at which all the parties except mine predicted that congestion charging would lead to gridlock and various disasters in London. That has not proved to be the case. Labour Members talk very positively now about the congestion charge, but before its introduction they were almost totally silent on the subject. Labour Members also now proudly proclaim that Ken Livingstone is their Labour Mayor, but that was not quite the case four or five years ago.</p>

<p><a name="st_o291"><a name="06121271000003"><a name="61212-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="06121271000076"><b>Kate Hoey:</b>
 My issue with the congestion charge was that the Mayor and those in authority would not acknowledge that it was dividing the community in Kennington, and the Mayor has still not listened or made any changes. People living in a single community were being treated very differently. That issue with the congestion charge still has not been solved for my constituents.</p>

<p><a name="st_o292"><a name="06121271000004"><a name="61212-0012.htm_spnew2"><a name="06121271000077"><b>Tom Brake:</b>
 I thank the hon. Lady for her intervention. I think that she used the word &#147;gridlock&#148; in a number of debates, but there has not been gridlock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para6"><a name="06121271000005">A highlight of our debates on the Bill was what became chapter VII on public-private partnerships. In debate after debate, we told the Government that PPP would be expensive, cumbersome and that it would not work. Just a couple of weeks ago in <i> The Guardian</i>, the PPP arbiter, Chris Bolt, criticised Metronet, one of the two consortiums, for a &#147;deficient&#148; management structure and poor performance. Metronet estimates that the contract faces a cost overrun of &#163;750 million by 2010. So we were right on that score.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para7"><a name="06121271000006">In 1999, we pressed for the Mayor to be given more powers to control rail. They were denied, and in his speech the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich explained why. It was clearly a rearguard action on the part of the then Transport Secretary to oppose any further shift of those powers. Of course, the Government are now moving in our direction and are seeking to give the Mayor greater powers over rail. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), who cannot be here today, will certainly be asking the Mayor to play a more active role in dealing with peak fares in his constituency, which are due to rise by more than a third in January. The Mayor needs to take firmer action on rail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para8"><a name="06121271000007">In spite of our reservations about the PPP, Liberal Democrats welcomed the creation of the Greater London authority, which devolved power from central Government to London government. Although we object strongly to some of the Bill&#146;s clauses&#151;particularly those on planning, to which I shall turn shortly&#151;its direction of travel is to be welcomed. It will enable the Mayor to draw up strategies for climate change, health and housing, to take over responsibility  <br>

from the Government for the Museum of London, to set up a separate budget for the assembly, to hold confirmation hearings for some appointments, and so on. I wonder, however, how fruitful the Mayor&#146;s setting up of a health strategy will be, given that so many of these decisions are being taken in and around London by unelected trusts. They are unlikely to listen to any of his concerns and will proceed with accident and emergency closures without his having much of a say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para9"><a name="06121271000008">Three tests for the Bill will determine whether it arrives at its destination in one piece. First, does it devolve greater powers to London; secondly, is there greater devolution within London; thirdly, is there more accountability for the Mayor? As the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait), who spoke for the official Opposition, said, greater devolution to London must spell the end of Whitehall&#146;s Government office for London. As the GLA&#146;s budget and staffing levels have grown in recent years, so have GOL&#146;s. It is an extra tier of bureaucracy that must now be scrapped. In a speech made just a couple of days ago, the Prime Minister talked about a bonfire of red tape, but I listened in vain for the announcement that GOL was for the chop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para10"><a name="06121271000009">Members could be forgiven for thinking that spending on GOL would decline as responsibilities and powers were passed to the Mayor and the GLA. That has not happened. A graph has been published that tells the story: since 2000, spending has continued to rise at a dramatic rate, year on year. Admittedly, there was a slight drop in 2000, but since then both spending on GOL and its staffing levels have increased. In addition to having a ballooning budget, it overlaps many of the functional bodies that have been established in legislation, in that it works in the same areas. For instance, according to GOL&#146;s website,</p>
<a name="61212-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="06121271000069"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;GOL provides advice on certain roads issues...on the development of the Mayor&#146;s Transport Strategy...extensions to traffic management orders and special event orders...advice on transport finance, major transport projects and buses.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para11"><a name="06121271000010">Why is that not the preserve of the Mayor and Transport for London?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para12"><a name="06121271000011">In addition to areas of overlap, there are matters for which GOL has sole responsibility that surely would sit more comfortably with the GLA and its functional bodies. Let us consider people and sustainable communities. According to its website, GOL is responsible for a wide range of activities to promote sustainable communities. It oversees the delivery of neighbourhood renewal policy, including local strategic partnerships, neighbourhood management, the new deal for communities, and so on. It also works with a wide range of voluntary sector and community organisations that are at the heart of regeneration and community cohesion in London. Surely such matters should be the responsibility of the Mayor and of the Greater London assembly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para13"><a name="06121271000012">On the second test, greater devolution within London must mean the Mayor taking powers from central Government, not grasping powers such as planning controls from local councils. We will oppose a planning controls smash-and-grab by the Mayor, who already has a rather unhealthy interest in planning applications that cannot be considered strategic. His comments about many planning applications are certainly not of a strategic nature. Let us take the example of a planning application in Carshalton, in my  <br>

constituency, that the hon. Member for Beckenham mentioned earlier. I do not want to go over the top, lest it leads to further delays to that project, but very significant delays arose as a result of the Mayor&#146;s intervention. The impact on the ground was that people living in Durand close&#151;a &#146;60s estate&#151;who had expected to move to new properties were unable to do so. As a result of the Mayor&#146;s intervention, the whole project was delayed and there was a knock-on effect on costs. Indeed, he has intervened in 1,200 applications since taking office, and it is clear that not all those interventions were of a strategic nature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para14"><a name="06121271000013">In dealing with people&#146;s concerns about the Mayor&#146;s taking responsibility for planning controls, the cure is simple. Deleting clauses 31 to 35 would restore the planning status quo and avoid the problem that would be created by having to define an application of potential strategic importance. That is what we will seek to achieve in Committee. If the Minister, as she mentioned in her opening statement, does manage to secure the agreement of the GLA, the Mayor, and the London councils and boroughs on a way forward&#151;if she finds something that satisfies all their concerns, and that does not impinge on the powers of local authorities&#151;we will of course reconsider. However, we need a fall-back position that assumes that the Minister or the bodies that she is liaising with will not be up to that very substantial challenge. If the Government decide to push through these proposals, the transparency issues that other Members have raised will have to be addressed. The Mayor will have to be much more transparent in his approach to planning; indeed, we would expect from him the same degree of transparency that prevails among local authorities.</p>

Member for Greenwich and Woolwich said that he does not support third-party representations, but it is my understanding that the Mayor is inclined to allow such representations in respect of planning applications that he decides to approve.</p>

 I was simply making the point that I did not support the principle of third-party rights of appeal. That is a very different matter from informal arrangements for representations, which can be introduced within the existing system.</p>

 I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that helpful clarification. It is important to note, however, that the Mayor is apparently offering an opportunity for third-party representations before a decision is taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para16"><a name="06121271000017">I turn to the third test that the Bill must pass&#151;greater accountability. It is clear that the Bill will grant the Mayor additional powers, and the trade-off must be that he must demonstrate greater accountability. In our view, the Bill must be changed to require the Mayor to secure the support of a majority of assembly members for his budget, rather than of the derisory third who can currently sign it off. We could then bring an end to his spending spree, which has seen his charge to London&#146;s taxpayers increase by more than 100 per cent. in just four years. Greater accountability will also require the Mayor to explain when and why he has accepted responses to his consultations, and when and why he has rejected them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para17"><a name="06121271000018">Finally, greater accountability will also require the Mayor to hold office for two terms only. Given that he is  <br>

being granted additional powers to appoint his representatives to various bodies, there is a risk that he will create a coterie of cronies&#151;a cabal of consorts. Restricting him to two terms in office would reduce that risk.</p>

The test for the Government will be to convert the Bill into a measure that devolves power to and within London, and delivers more mayoral accountability. We shall support the Bill&#146;s Second Reading, but our support is conditional. The Bill should complete the unfinished devolutionary work started in the 1999 Act. If it does so, it will receive our support during its later stages; if it does not, and merely replaces a benevolent but despotic regime, central Government, by giving another, Ken Livingstone, unchecked powers to ride roughshod over the wishes of local people, we shall oppose it.</p>

 I welcome the Bill and shall confine my comments to its housing and planning aspects. When my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning opened the debate, she was right to say that the aim of the Bill is to give strategic responsibility for housing and planning to a democratically elected London-wide government. However, Members on both sides of the House are also right to raise concerns about the possibility of over-interference by the mayoralty in local matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para19"><a name="06121271000021">I can best illustrate that by giving the example of a local case that I dealt with in my constituency. It relates to an area universally known as the Allied Carpets site, which is on a busy junction but in a residential area of Shepherd&#146;s Bush, overlooking a prominent park. A 10-storey block of flats was deemed suitable by a developer, although not by the then Labour-controlled local council, in what had previously been a purely residential area where buildings did not rise more than three storeys. At some point the Greater London authority expressed the view that the development was suitable, very much in line with the idea, which may be on the wane, that the higher the better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para20"><a name="06121271000022">I have no prejudice against tall buildings but to put what was, in essence, a tower block in an area of Victorian streets was deemed inappropriate, particularly by everybody who lived in the area. We all make mistakes, however, and I took comfort from the fact that the GLA chose not to appear at the planning inquiry and, indeed, seemed to withdraw. The planning inspector, faced by persuasive arguments from me and local Labour councillors and residents, turned down the appeal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="61212-0012.htm_para21"><a name="06121271000023">The case illustrates not whether the GLA was right or wrong, but that we need clear guidelines, which relates to what my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) referred to as mission creep. We need clear guidelines so that when matters are genuinely local there is no interference from the GLA. The case I described was a perfect example of that; the development was important for the locality but by no stretch of the imagination was it strategic for London.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that flexibility is needed for housing targets, especially in inner London? A strict 50 per cent. limit runs the risk that developers will simply sit on their hands and do nothing, which has been the story in London over the past few years.

They are now being told by the local authority that it is statutory overcrowding because the fifth child has reached one year of age, so they can move up one band in the choice-based letting scheme. That makes a bit of a mockery of the idea of choice-based lettings. Equally, people are living in temporary accommodation for several years&#151;a better quality of accommodation on the whole and certainly in comparison with the bed-and-breakfast accommodation that the Tory Government subjected people to, but it is not really suitable as a home. It can be former bed-sit accommodation, which people cannot settle into and which has, scandalously, been rented in my constituency for &#163;300 or &#163;400 a week for a one or two-bedroom flat. That makes a mockery of the housing market, producing not only human misery, but profiteering. That must be dealt with.</p>

 I hear another sedentary comment that it is not true, so I shall provide one or two examples. I was not going to do so, but now I shall. What possible motivation, other than one of extreme ideology or electoral manipulation, could there be for an inner-London council to go out of its way to cancel an affordable rented homes programme that had already received funding from the Housing Corporation and already had planning permission? I cannot see any justification for that. Departing slightly from my brief, I shall provide two examples, only one of which indicts a callous Tory council, as the other involves a housing association.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="61212-0013.htm_para4"><a name="06121271000046">I apologise for raising an issue that I have already raised at some length in an Adjournment debate, but I do so because further developments have taken place, which exemplify exactly why the Mayor needs extra powers. The largest single housing development in my constituency at the moment was originally a 75 per cent. affordable housing development. The incoming Conservative council, by way of agreeing small changes to the application, insisted that the percentage of affordable housing be reduced to 64 per cent. Nevertheless, it was still a good scheme: it was roughly a third market, a third shared ownership and a third social rented housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="61212-0013.htm_para5"><a name="06121271000047">On one clear working day before the planning committee made a decision, the leader of the council called in the developer and insisted that the rented housing be changed to shared ownership housing. That is a matter ultimately, as I have said previously, for the Standards Board for England. What happened then is an interesting development. The GLA was waiting expectantly for this scheme&#151;it was a large scheme of 450 homes&#151;to be referred to it, but the Conservative councils said that they were not ready and were not sure. Meanwhile, the Housing Corporation had withdrawn the &#163;30 million of public money because the scheme was no longer worthy of being funded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="61212-0013.htm_para6"><a name="06121271000048">What has happened since that time&#151;about six weeks ago&#151;is that in a Dutch auction the social housing developer, Genesis Housing Group, went to the Housing Corporation and asked what minimum amount of social rented housing could be put on the site in order to get public funding. It literally asked whether it was 70, 80, 90 or 91 units.</p>

Friend aware that that same housing association is the body that bought the Church Commissioners&#146; property through some sort of multi-deal and is now trying to sell as many off as possible, despite the fact that those homes were intended for people on lower incomes? Some of these housing associations get away with a lot of things, simply because they are housing associations, but in many cases they are not much better than some private developers.</p>

That has been done with the consent of the Housing Corporation. Given the lengths to which Labour councils, Labour councillors and the Government go to ensure the provision of more social rented units in London, it is a scandal that existing RSLs are selling good-quality homes on the open market.

strategic powers for housing and planning should pass to the strategic body, with the caveat that we must safeguard local decisions.

They are persuaded of it because they wish to build housing for sale&#151;not low-cost housing, but housing that will sell for &#163;200,000, &#163;300,000 and even &#163;400,000.

We must build either genuine low-cost housing for sale or affordable rented housing. Without those two parts of the equation we will not address the issue.

Local mayors have much to commend them and there are some interesting examples round the country. In many instances, therefore, I support the transfer of powers from central Government to mayors. The problem with the Bill, and its flawed psychology&#151;ably spelled out by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait)&#151;is that while it includes some transfers from central Government to the Mayor, it also includes crucial transfers of power from the boroughs to the Mayor. Although the Minister for Housing and Planning is a very logical woman, there is no logical way to defend the transfer of powers on housing and planning from the boroughs to the Mayor and espouse localism at the same time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="61212-0013.htm_para12"><a name="06121272000003">Much of the difficulty stems from the original conception behind the Mayor and the Greater London assembly. The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) went into the history of the issue, and we all remember that the Government essentially chose to avoid hard choices and fudged many of the issues by inserting a third tier of government between central Government and the existing boroughs. That inevitably requires a precise definition of what each layer of government will do. As the right hon. Gentleman pointed out, that leads to tensions, wrangling, the need to redefine the position in the light of experience&#151;which is what is happening this evening&#151;and increased complexity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="61212-0013.htm_para13"><a name="06121272000004">I submit that complexity is the enemy of democracy. My hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening) made an important point when she said that if we want people to participate in local democracy, to vote and be involved, we must keep it simple. Complexity of the sort that we have in London is inimical to real involvement. If it is over-complex, it becomes a matter for the experts, not the people who are not experts and do not understand, even though they wish to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="61212-0013.htm_para14"><a name="06121272000005">To take a local example from Orpington, one of my constituents, Mr. Vic Heasman, was concerned about large lorries going down a country lane. They were damaging the pavements and hedgerows and were a safety hazard for local residents and the children of a nearby school. He therefore tried to find out who gave the lorries permission to travel down that narrow country lane. He asked Bromley council, but it was nothing to do with it. He asked Transport for London, but it was nothing to do with it. He asked the Mayor&#146;s office, but it was nothing to do with him. He asked the police, but it was nothing to do with them. In fact, he discovered, after three months of trying, that the Association of Local Government issued the permits for those large lorries. It took three months of hard effort by that determined constituent to discover who was responsible before anything could be done about the issue. That exemplifies the problem, created by the Government, of a complicated system of local government in London.</p>

London could have adopted a similar model, with only two layers of government rather than three.

In the Select Committee the other day, the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality was asked whether he had looked into the effect of high levels of immigration on housing in London. He had no answer, but immigration is a factor. We all know that we benefit economically from high levels of immigration, but we must consider the implications for housing and public services.

 Earlier, my hon. Friend mentioned the economic impact of immigration. He might be interested in the evidence presented to the Work and Pensions Committee yesterday by Professor Paul Gregg, an economic adviser to the Chancellor, who said that the impact of immigration on housing was not yet clear. Apparently, one of the challenges arising from the expanding work force is that the economy will have to grow at around 3 per cent. if we are tobe able to continue to provide those employment opportunities. That in turn will arouse severe inflationary pressures that the Bank of England will have to consider&#151;</p>

For example, clause 30 gives him a power of intervention in respect of a local planning authority&#146;s local development scheme. It allows him to direct boroughs to prepare revisions to their local development schemes, and we all know what that is a recipe for: by general diktat, the Mayor will be able to overrule the well developed plans of boroughs such as Bromley.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para3"><a name="06121272000020">The other curious thing about the Bill is that it gives the Mayor powers in matters where they appear unnecessary.

 I welcome this Bill, and the fact that it will extend the powers of the Mayor in important areas. I also welcome the fact that, for once, we are able to have a debate on London. Ever since the annual debate on policing was abolished, we have been unable to debate London fully in the way that we are doing tonight.

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para6"><a name="06121272000024">Labour&#146;s creation of the London Mayor and assembly in 2000 corrected the democratic deficit inflicted by the Conservative Government when they abolished the Greater London council in 1986. Since the restoration of city-wide government six years ago, Londoners have seen real and significant improvements to many aspects of life in the capital. The Audit Commission&#146;s report on the GLA for last year said:</p>
<a name="61212-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="06121272000088"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Crime is at a five-year low, and local policing is now a reality in every ward in London. Investment in public transport is at its highest for sixty years.&#148;</p>

From 2008, the low-emission zone for London will cut pollution from road transport and improve air quality. The Mayor has been rightly praised for his strategies on climate change and affordable housing. The International Olympic Committee would not have awarded the 2012 Olympics to London without a city-wide government to oversee that great commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para8"><a name="06121272000026">The system of devolved government for London in the Greater London Authority Act 1999 has, on the whole, worked pretty well. It has enabled a strong executive Mayor to develop and implement strategies across a range of important policy areas. Some have suggested that the assembly&#146;s inability to block mayoral policies represents a weakness, but a shared electorate does not mean a shared mandate. The Mayor is elected with an executive mandate, while the assembly is elected to scrutinise, and those roles should not be confused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para9"><a name="06121272000027">For example, if the bar for assembly amendments to the Mayor&#146;s budget were to be lowered below the current two-thirds majority, London government could become gridlocked, with the GLA unable to set a legal budget. London government has been able to deliver, precisely because that sort of impasse is not possible.</p>

has the power only to refuse schemes. That negative and lopsided power severely limits his negotiating position with both boroughs and developers, and hampers the delivery of needed housing, especially affordable housing and housing for rent, as we have discussed already.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para13"><a name="06121272000031">In fact, over the past six years, the Mayor has directed refusal in fewer than 20 of the cases referred to him. Personally, I should have liked him to do so more often&#151;including in my own patch, where very poor council estate regeneration schemes proposed by Tory Barnet council are going ahead. Generally, I believe that a negotiated solution has been achieved. I cannot see the Mayor using a new power to approve an application any more frequently than so far he has used the power to refuse. I agree with the comments about the need to define &#147;strategic&#148; clearly, but the Mayor has shown that he has behaved responsibly in the past and there is no reason to suggest that he would do otherwise in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para14"><a name="06121272000032">We have heard that the Liberal Democrats oppose the extension of the Mayor&#146;s powers. Perhaps that is because of their own record and the way in which they have run authorities under their control. For example, the sort of case where the Mayor would have intervened to give approval was the St. Georges wharf scheme in then Liberal-Democrat-controlled Lambeth. The planning application was for hundreds of residential units, 40 per cent. of which were to be affordable, rising to 50 per cent. if funding from the Housing Corporation was made available. The scheme was supported by the Mayor and recommended for approval by Lambeth officers, but the Liberal Democrat council refused planning permission on the grounds that there was previous consent for a hotel.</p>

unreasonable misuse of the local planning system to stymie developments of London-wide significance cannot be acceptable, particularly for the 60,000 Londoners who remain homeless. Over the last six years, the Mayor has proved that he is judicious in the use of his existing powers. The Bill will ensure that he becomes involved only in genuinely strategic issues for the benefit of London and Londoners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para20"><a name="06121272000040">I have to disagree with the Government over one area in the Bill: waste disposal. The Bill falls well short of the necessary steps to address that London-wide problem. The Government&#146;s proposals do not deal with the fundamental challenge of the integrated and sustainable waste management that we need. The argument between a city-wide and a borough approach is not new. Twenty years ago, the Greater London council was responsible for co-ordinating and managing the disposal of London&#146;s municipal waste. Since its abolition, London has fallen well behind many international comparator cities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para21"><a name="06121272000041">There are a surprising number of similarities between the problems that we now face in London and those confronting Londoners before the GLC.

<a name="61212-0014.htm_brev7"><a name="06121272000093"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;carrying out their responsibilities for refuse disposal as efficiently as their present situation will allow,&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para23"><a name="06121272000043">That is as true today as it was more than 40 years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para24"><a name="06121272000044">The GLC&#146;s innovative approach turned the capital&#146;s waste management service into a world leader. Within five years, the Edmonton solid waste incinerator had been planned, designed and built. Pioneering rail and river transfer stations were developed. The GLC embarked on a comprehensive plan to upgrade London&#146;s waste management arrangements, many of which still reflected their Victorian origins. The GLC&#146;s department of public health engineering was a centre of excellence in the planning and delivery of high quality waste management infrastructure and services. That was all ended by the Conservative Government&#146;s abolition of the GLC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para25"><a name="06121272000045">London&#146;s municipal waste management arrangements reflect the stagnation of the post-GLC 1985 contractual arrangements. Of the 33 London boroughs, 12 are unitary waste collection and disposal authorities. The other 21 are arranged into four joint authorities. That means that there are a total of no fewer than 16 waste disposal authorities, none of which is charged to act in London&#146;s wider interests as a capital city. Although some boroughs perform well, others do not. Collectively, they fall well short of delivering what London needs.</p>

Twenty-nine of London&#146;s waste authorities failed to achieve their statutory household recycling targets in 2003-04. There have been only 25 planning applications for waste  <br>

management sites in London over the past five years: an average of only 0.15 per year per authority. London currently incinerates just under 20 per cent. of its waste. Despite the strongest regional policy supporting recycling and new technologies, that is set to rise to about 40 per cent. with current incineration plans. London would then account for almost half of England&#146;s share of incineration. As London boroughs have not prioritised waste planning and management, they are highly likely not to meet the requirements of the landfill directive, risking Government fines. The GLA estimates London&#146;s landfill allowance trading scheme liability to be &#163;1.7 billion from 2005 to 2020.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para27"><a name="06121272000047">The Corporation of London runs the London hazardous waste collection service on behalf of the boroughs. That service consists of only two vehicles for the whole of London&#151;one collecting chemicals, the other asbestos. From the 3 million homes in London in 2005, that service collected only 10 tonnes of asbestos and 1 tonne of chemicals a month&#151;a fraction of the estimated total. Hazardous materials in black bags inevitably end up in landfills outside London or being burned in incinerators, resulting in pollution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para28"><a name="06121272000048">It is hard to see how the cautious package of measures in the Bill addresses those serious problems. The proposed requirement for boroughs to be in &#147;general conformity&#148; with the Mayor&#146;s strategy will end in court disputes between the Mayor and the boroughs. The Mayor is not permitted to be proactive in bringing forward and implementing city-wide plans for recycling, tackling climate change, minimising transport movements and realising efficiency savings. No other global city has such fragmented and divisive arrangements. Although the Mayor may write policies to tackle litter into his municipal waste management strategy, the Government have decided to exempt local authorities&#146; litter duties from even their weak requirements of &#147;general conformity&#148;. That is despite London being the worst performing region for litter, with 86 per cent. of Londoners expressing dissatisfaction&#151;as we all know from our constituents&#146; complaints to us.</p>

Voluntary arrangements have failed London for the past 20 years, so there is no cause for optimism that they will suddenly start to work now. The proposed London waste and recycling fund will be financed by diverting money from the boroughs&#146; waste and performance efficiency grant. Gershon efficiencies that could be achieved through a single waste disposal authority&#151;estimated at &#163;40 million&#151;are not being realised. The Mayor&#146;s proposal for a single waste disposal authority offers a number of benefits. It provides strong and effective leadership through a mayoral-led functional body. It would improve the commercial attractiveness of London&#146;s waste market by reducing the number of decision makers and hurdles to clear, working with Transport for London, the London Development Agency, the energy sector and London boroughs to deliver solutions.</p>

16 different waste disposal authorities. The need for innovation and efficient delivery has not changed significantly since the GLC&#146;s abolition. When the Government gave the Mayor strategic responsibility for municipal waste in London through the formation of the Greater London authority, they conceded that existing arrangements were not delivering for London. It is now time for the Government to go one step further to ensure that they do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para31"><a name="06121272000051">I understand that the Government&#146;s concern is that collection and disposal should be carried out by one authority only, because they believe that to be somehow better or more efficient. However, that argument simply does not stand up to scrutiny. Two-tier authorities in London, where collection is carried out by the borough and disposal is carried out separately by the four joint authorities, perform as well&#151;or perhaps I should say, no worse&#151;as borough councils that do both, in terms of recycling. Outside London, district councils collect and shire counties dispose of waste. Some of the shires and districts, with that divided relationship, are among the best performers in the country. What is important is that the waste disposal authority has adequate powers to ensure that the collection authorities deliver their waste to disposal facilities in a specified manner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para32"><a name="06121272000052">Collection is fundamentally a local issue. It is dependent mainly on how far a rubbish truck can be driven in a day. Disposal requires significant investment in facilities and planning at a city-wide level, with the ability to co-ordinate the transfer points for collection authorities. It makes clear sense to do that on a city-wide basis to minimise transport movements, to ensure that facilities and contracts of the appropriate size are delivered, and to make full use of economies of scale and efficiencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para33"><a name="06121272000053">London&#146;s waste governance arrangements are failing. A step change is required if we are to show that we are serious about the environmental challenges that London faces. The measures proposed in the Bill shift money from the boroughs to the Mayor, create talking shops and invite planning disputes; they do not ensure efficient, sustainable co-ordinated waste management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para34"><a name="06121272000054">As my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House said in 1985, in his capacity as Environment spokesperson, when discussing the proposals for post-GLC waste management:</p>
<a name="61212-0014.htm_brev9"><a name="06121272000095"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The nettle should have been grasped and it should have been acknowledged that waste disposal, as opposed to waste collection, could not possibly be handled on a borough-by-borough basis.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 8 July 1985; Vol. 82, c. 808.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para35"><a name="06121272000055">I thus urge the Government to reconsider their position and to propose amendments to create a single waste disposal authority for London. This important matter remains to be resolved, so I hope that it will be considered in much more detail in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="61212-0014.htm_para36"><a name="06121272000056">With that caveat, the Bill represents a major step forward for the governance of London. It provides for further devolution that builds on the previous arrangements that we put forward to meet our manifesto commitment when we were first elected. The Bill shows the Government&#146;s commitment to London, to devolution and to ensuring that we have a proper city-wide administration. It is regrettable that Opposition parties do not intend to support the Bill wholeheartedly tonight. That shows that they care little about London and Londoners.</p>

 Order. We have approximately two hours for Back-Bench contributions and several Members wish to catch my eye. I leave it to hon. Members to do the mathematical calculations for themselves.</p>

 I start with a plea. The Bill that became the Greater London Authority Act 1999 was the second longest Bill in the history of Parliament, exceeded only by a Finance Bill. It had 26 Committee sittings, with the Committee stage lasting two and a half months. As the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake), who has just left the Chamber, reminded us, there were more than 1,000 amendments. That Bill received intense scrutiny in Committee, but when it came back to the House on Report, vast chunks of it were replaced without any debate whatsoever. Vast chunks of the Bill were then replaced in the Lords, and most of the Lords amendments that this House considered went through without debate because of a guillotine. Those amendments included measures on revenue-raising powers. I sincerely hope that this Greater London Authority Bill has a happier passage through the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="61212-0015.htm_para0"><a name="06121272000060">Conservative Members supported the Third Reading of the Greater London Authority Bill of 1999, but we tabled a reasoned amendment in which we accepted the principle of the authority, but expressed our reservations about the congestion charge, the nature of the assembly and the imbalance with the boroughs. As we come to review the workings of the 1999 Act, it seems we did not make a bad judgment at the time. The assembly&#146;s operations are restricted and the congestion charge has had its problems. This Bill will diminish the boroughs&#146; powers even further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="61212-0015.htm_para1"><a name="06121272000061">A voice for London is a good thing. The Mayor should speak for this major city on the world stage. However, the voice that we have at present has tarnished the image of London. The position of Mayor is one of not just responsibility, but integrity. The cheeky chappie stuff only goes so far; frankly we do not need the Nazi jibes, the scuffles outside parties and the cheap stunts, such as the trip to Venezuela where the Mayor was rebuffed to the embarrassment of the people of London. The people of London want a well run authority with no gimmicks. They want jobs, homes and security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="61212-0015.htm_para2"><a name="06121272000062">The Bill addresses the question of homes. As you will have been able to tell by the number of interventions, Madam Deputy Speaker, many hon. Members have spoken about the interaction between planning and housing, although I will not go into that matter in great depth, especially bearing in mind your strictures. However, I have reached the conclusion that as the Mayor gets more and more powers to set the level of affordable housing, developers will become more and more wary about the number of houses that they build. In my constituency, I believe that too many one-bedroom flats and insufficient three-bedroom family houses have been built, but that should be a matter for Croydon council to decide.</p>

have an even greater say on major developments, the borough of Croydon, which has several major developments in the pipeline, will find that developers will bypass the council and go straight to the Mayor. That will create a weakness in the system and diminish the powers of the authority. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) ably showed up the flaws in the Bill in her opening speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="61212-0015.htm_para4"><a name="06121272000064">I am still not sure of the direction in which the Government want the GLA to go. The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), who cleverly took the 1999 Bill through the House&#151;I was the Opposition spokesman at the time&#151;said that there would not be a GLC mark II. However, it is looking increasingly like that. After 10 years of Labour, London has the only regional government that has got off the ground. Part of the motive was to give back a voice to the people of London, but a lot of it was to correct the imbalanceof devolution to Scotland and Wales and the embarrassment of the unanswered West Lothian question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="61212-0015.htm_para5"><a name="06121272000065">There is a hotch-potch of responsibilities at present. The Government do not want London to have the same sort of powers as Scotland and Wales, but they do not want power to go down to the boroughs. Let me pick up a point made by the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) when he intervened about what my former colleague Steve Norris has said. In a way, Steve Norris is right. The Mayor wants more powers. We should give powers to either the boroughs, or the Mayor, but we should not have a rag-bag in the middle with the powers divided. The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich talked about the question of devolved powers or strategic powers. I do not think that the right balance has been achieved. The Bill misses many opportunities. Making the Mayor more accountable for his strategies should be at the heart of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="61212-0015.htm_para6"><a name="06121272000066">The assembly could effectively be reformed. Proportional representation has led to weaknesses in the way in which it operates. The assembly&#146;s only serious power is the ability to veto the budget, but two thirds of assembly members are needed to do so. As the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington said, the Mayor can thus get his budget through the assembly by using a one third blocking minority, which is most of the Labour group and the odd Green<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> A very odd Green. The combination of that blocking minority and proportional representation means that the Mayor is largely unfettered.</p>

Such an assembly would build better bridges with the boroughs than the existing structure. The GLA sits aloofly above the boroughs, looking down on them, which was also a weakness of the old GLC. I know that my proposal is not popular with the assembly. I do not intend to be critical, but I think that direct or indirect elections on a borough basis would improve relations. Accountability would also be improved, because assembly members would be elected by the people of the boroughs.</p>

The leader of an authority can be removed by his group. The First Ministers of Scotland and Wales can be removed, as can Prime Ministers. However, even if every psychiatrist in Harley street declared the Mayor of London to be criminally insane, there would be absolutely nothing that anyone could do about it. One of the weaknesses of the Bill is the lack of provision for a recall petition, as it is called in the United States. Under such a system, an agreed number of signatures would result in a referendum on the status of the Mayor and his record would be put to the test.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="61212-0015.htm_para9"><a name="06121272000069">There is a muddle of merging the powers of the executive and the legislature. Prime Ministers, First Ministers, MPs and councillors are all elected for a term of office in a legislature. However, if they move to the executive from the legislature, their roles in the executive are dependent on others. In countries in which the executive and the legislature are separate, checks and balances are installed in the system. For example, the mayor of New York can be removed by the Governor of New York, under certain criteria. The mayor of Paris can be removed by an Order in Council, under certain criteria. In my judgment, such a thing should be possible in London.</p>

 I am not sure what point the hon. Gentleman is making. The point is made that the ballot box provides accountability, and so it does, but I ask this quite genuinely: what happens if the Mayor goes bananas two years into his term of office, and sits there like some manic creature? That is a serious problem to consider, and powers ought to be put in the legislation to enable us to remove the Mayor, if we should want to do so.</p>

We have to address the problem of congestion, and there are a number of ways of dealing with it: we could close the roads, physically limit the number of cars going into London, or introduce road pricing. However, we Opposition Members have to accept that the die is cast&#151;contracts have been signed, all the equipment is in place, and the scheme is about to expand to west London in a few weeks&#146; time, so, in truth, there is no going back on it. Road pricing is to be introduced on motorways, too.</p>

It is proposed that there should be a &#163;25 charge for cars that emit a certain amount of CO2. I am glad we have moved away from making attacks on 4x4 cars, because plenty of cars with two-wheel drives emit more CO2 than many with four-wheel drives. Such exercises are not cases of joined-up government. Will the Mayor set the same CO2 emissions targets as, say, Richmond upon Thames council is to set, in order to restrict parking arrangements in Richmond? If cars are to be regulated according to their CO2 emissions, the matter should be dealt with nationally; otherwise, there will be  <br>

a patchwork of restraint. The hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) made a point about Kennington earlier, in a devastating intervention on the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington. People on one side of Kennington might emit the same amount of CO2 as those the other side of Kennington, but on one side, a person will have to pay &#163;25 to drive a car, and on the other side, it will be free.

The Mayor then ignored that consultation, but the question is whether that is right. What is the point of spending public money on a consultation exercise if there is a cavalier disregard for it? Indeed, there was never any intention of acting on what was suggested in the consultation, and the Minister only holds consultations because he is obliged to do so under legislation. There is a simple remedy for that: we should insert a one-line clause, saying that he should have due regard to any consultation. That would oblige him to take account of the people of London. The legislation could be improved, and my party&#146;s Front-Bench team are right to oppose it tonight. I wish my colleagues who are to serve on the Committee well in improving the Bill.</p>

 I shall be brief. Reference has been made to the fact that we used to have great London debates on policing, and it is true that whenever we discuss London, there is far more yah-boo and there are far more party political interventions than in other debates. I am slightly concerned, because really the issue is what we, collectively&#151;particularly us London MPs, who are proud to represent the city&#151;think is best for London, and how we think it should be governed. Difficult as it is, we should all start from the premise of deciding whether a measure is the right thing to do, whatever the politics of the Mayor. Sometimes, for us Labour Members, things are shaped by the fact that we have a Labour Mayor. Obviously, if there were a Conservative or a Liberal Democrat Mayor, which is highly unlikely, the chances are that some of us might think slightly differently about things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="61212-0015.htm_para13"><a name="06121272000076">I agree with a great deal of what is in the Bill, and given that we now have a Mayor, and given how the system works, I am happy for the Mayor to have certain powers. For example, he has been given powers on the museum of London. One of the most successful aspects of the Greater London council was its arts policy. The South Bank centre is in my constituency, and in theory it is run by the Arts Council and others, but it is actually an incredibly undemocratic body. The South Bank centre is one of London&#146;s big, cultural centres, and I should have thought that if the Mayor is to have a cultural policy, he should have more involvement in that, so that it is not run by people who are not necessarily accountable in any way to anyone&#151;certainly to no one in the local community.</p>

including perhaps the technical details, in Committee. However, the way in which we define &#147;strategic&#148; is of concern to me. That word can mean so many different things to different people. It is important that the Committee should have an absolute definition of what we mean by &#147;strategic&#148;, as has been promised by the Minister. If the Mayor himself decides what is strategic, most of the north of my constituency will presumably be seen as strategic, because it is along the river and is in central London. I do not see why the residents and the community in areas along the north of the river in my constituency should be treated any differently, in terms of their involvement in what will happen there, simply because their area has been defined as a strategic area of London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="61212-0015.htm_para15"><a name="06121272000078">Similarly, Waterloo station has been defined as an area in which it is likely that a cluster of tall buildings will be built, but an active local community lives there, and it must have some say in that. If there are to be bigger developments&#151;I know that it will mean that there will be section 106 money, so we will get more affordable housing&#151;it is crucial that we be clear about what we mean by &#147;strategic&#148;, and that we define it narrowly. The Mayor already has vast planning powers, and effectively those powers are not scrutinised. That is why I want to go back to the issue of transparency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="61212-0015.htm_para16"><a name="07020810000001">No matter how hard Greater London assembly members work, the membership does not have any teeth. It does not really have anything other than being able to say to the Mayor, &#147;We don&#146;t like this.&#148; If the Mayor does not like what they say, he simply says, &#147;Well, tough.&#148; If the Mayor is to be the planning authority, we must be able to deal with him in the same way as we deal with other planning authorities. At the moment, when it comes to how we will deal with the strategic decisions&#151;the Minister may be able to respond to this point in his closing remarks&#151;the public will not be entitled to make direct representations; they will have to make them to their local authority. No doubt, it will almost always be the case that the officers of that local authority will pass on to the Mayor whatever they want to pass on, wrapped up in some kind of misleading report, as we often see that in planning committees. The public will not be able to speak, the decision will not be taken in a public arena, and the report on which the decision will be based will not be challengeable. The considerations that will accompany the report at the point at which the decision is made will not be known. That, to me, means that it is not transparent.</p>

That is not to say that that is wrong in running a big city such as London, but we must be aware that if that is the case, we have to build in some safeguards; otherwise, the public will not feel that the system is fair. The idea seems to be that we will take critical decisions about major developments in central London, on London&#146;s future, without Londoners having direct access to those decisions. The Mayor&#146;s decisions should be based on published reports, which are open to scrutiny. Unless we deal with that in Committee, there will be serious problems with the way in which the measure operates. Will the Minister confirm whether the Government still propose that the Mayor should be able to take over the handling of applications on which he has not made any public  <br>

statements of support or opposition? It would be incredibly difficult for the Mayor to make a decision on any tall tower blocks in London, because he has repeatedly said that he wants to see tower blocks in different parts of the capital. In all honesty, how can he be seen to take an independent view if he has said such things?</p>

 Without wishing to do the Minister&#146;s work for him, I suspect that the provision refers to specific rather than general statements of support or otherwise. The position is similar for local councillors, as they are barred from making representations on behalf of residents associations if they serve on a committee considering a development in their ward. I therefore suspect that the provision deals with specific claims by the Mayor in favour of a development rather than the general statements which, as the hon. Lady points out, he has made about tall buildings.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman may be right, or he may be wrong. The Minister nodded at him, but he did so, too, when I raised the matter, so perhaps he can clarify at the end of our debate. The Mayor is not someone who fails to speak his mind, so he must be incredibly careful if the provision is accepted in its present form. We need to see the details to make sure that the huge power at his disposal will be properly exercised. I can speak only from my constituency experience, but the Mayor is happy to meet developers. Those meetings are not minuted, as the participants do not necessarily sit round the table&#151;it is sofa diplomacy&#151;and I am not sure that that is right. He meets representatives of community groups, but it very much depends on whether they succeed in gaining his ear. The special attention given to developers should not mean that people in the local community are ignored or pushed aside. Ultimately, if London is to be a cohesive city and if people are to believe that they have influence on the major planning decisions that affect their lives, they must believe that they can become involved. Unless the provision is changed to make clear the circumstances in which the Mayor can intervene and override local opinion, and when he cannot do so, I fear that we will be in great difficulty.</p>

 The hon.

Why are those powers to be increased? Who will benefit, and what will the costs be? From my own perspective, I might ask: what have the Mayor and the GLA done for Bexley since 2000? The Mayor has not visited the area very often&#151;I think that he has been to the borough only once in that period&#151;and he always appears uninterested in the residents of outer London. Has Bexley benefited from the establishment of the GLA and the Mayor? We had at least one benefit&#151;my hon. Friend who is now the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) was a superb GLA representative, who took up the issues in our area.</p>

 Indeed. If we are to increase participation and interest in local government, particularly among the young, we must make people feel that their views matter, and that when they have spoken, local politicians will act upon their suggestions and in their interest. My concern is that the more power we take away from the boroughs and give to the centre, the less participation, interest and involvement there will be.

the Government&#146;s proposals? With the new powers in the Bill, the people of Bexley will lose, Bexley council and other councils will lose, and London will be disadvantaged as power moves to the centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="61212-0016.htm_para3"><a name="06121286000014">Grave concern has been expressed from all parts of the House about housing and planning issues. There is great worry in our area that the new powers being given to the Mayor of London will allow him to overrule planning decisions, or direct decisions of strategic importance, against the wishes of the local planning committee and local people. We have had an example of that with the proposal to build the Thames Gateway bridge in our area, which the Mayor of London is very keen on. Locally, we are worried about environmental problems, transport and traffic through the borough, the emissions that that will cause, and so on. All political parties locally, community groups and residents groups have campaigned against the bridge. We have had a public inquiry, and I understand that the inspector&#146;s report is on the Minister&#146;s desk, awaiting a decision.</p>

If the Bill is on the statute book, the Mayor will in future make such strategic decisions and we will have no say at all. We will have nobody to whom to appeal or put local views. That is a great worry to me, and to the majority of people who live in our area.</p>

They are being asked to pay for an open-ended commitment, which the Mayor thinks will not be that much. He does not understand their concerns.

Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), who is on the Front Bench, listening and taking in all our comments.

 This is one of many debates that we have had over the years on London government. Since the 19th century there have been numerous debates about the demand for semi-autonomous local government in London, but there is a continuum, a thread, running through all of our history: every stage of the development of a centralised form of government in London has been opposed by the Tory party. The Tories opposed the establishment of the Metropolitan board of works. They opposed the establishment of the London county council. They opposed the establishment of the Greater London council. They had an aberration when they abolished the GLC, and we sat through hours of debate in the House while they destroyed a good form of government in London, which had much to commend it and achieved much for the people of London. Then they opposed the establishment of the current system of the London authority and the mayoralty. It is quite nice that we are proposing an extension of the Mayor&#146;s powers, but the Tories are unchanged in 130 years and are opposing still. We congratulate them on their consistency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="61212-0016.htm_para11"><a name="06121286000027">What I find slightly disturbing about the Bill is the large number of reserved powers held by the Secretary of State over London government. To an extent, there have always been reserved powers, but they are still considerable. If, for example, one reads through the clauses on housing, most of the proposals must be made by the Mayor to the Secretary of State before being put out to a form of consultation. I would be much happier if the Government showed far greater trust in the people of London to elect a London authority, which would then be able to do what it believed to be right for the people of London rather than having the Secretary of State hold all those reserved powers. The same degree of reserved powers do not apply in Scotland or Wales, and they were not envisaged in the regional proposals for London, either. That point needs to be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="61212-0016.htm_para12"><a name="06121286000028">Many hon. Members have already mentioned the housing needs of the people of London. We are in a massive housing crisis in London. My borough is a typical inner-city borough&#151;it is crowded, densely populated, multicultural and multi-ethnic&#151;and 80 per cent. of the population have no prospect whatsoever of being able to buy a property within it, unless they inherit money or win the lottery. The housing choices of those people are therefore limited to either getting on the council list and being nominated for a council or housing association place, or renting privately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="61212-0016.htm_para13"><a name="06121286000029">If people are put into private renting by the local authority, they find that they are forced to pay &#163;200 or &#163;300 a week&#151;I have heard about rents of &#163;400 a week&#151;for houses or flats in my area. If the family is in housing need, most of that rent is paid for by housing benefit, so such people are terrified of getting a job, because then they would lose their housing benefit. We have created a perverse benefit trap through the shortage of social housing in London, and we must take seriously the housing needs of the people whom we have been elected to represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="61212-0016.htm_para14"><a name="06121286000030">I shall give the House another example of the problems. The requirement to make a proportion of all housing sites available for social housing or council rented housing is very important. Until recently, my borough limited that requirement to new sites containing 14 units or more. Miraculously, all the building sites came in at 13 units, to make sure that the developers did not have to fulfil any social obligation whatever. The council has now reduced that figure to 10 units or more, which is a slight improvement. Nevertheless, a remarkable number of sites come in at eight or nine units in order to avoid the social obligation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="61212-0016.htm_para15"><a name="06121286000031">The result has been that in the past five years only 13 per cent. of all new developments in my borough have been for housing association social rented housing. In other words, 87 per cent. of all the new property has gone either to people who can afford to buy or, in some cases, to shared ownership schemes, which are &#147;affordable&#148;. Affordable for whom? If one looks at the prices, it is head teachers and above who can afford to buy into those places. We should end the use of the word &#147;affordable&#148; and start talking about the housing needs of people who are in a desperate situation.</p>

affordable rented housing, which should be provided by either the council or housing associations. That would enable us to start to tackle the desperate housing problem. If we do not tackle the problem, London will become more and more of a divided city. The city will be divided between people who are desperate enough, who have large enough families or sufficiently severe medical conditions, to be rehoused through the local authority system, those who are forced into private accommodation in which they can barely afford to stay, and those who are forced to leave London or move further away.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The preponderance of very small units is unfortunate. The former Arsenal stadium is now being developed for private housing in the form of 711 one-bedroom flats, which are no good whatsoever for the needs of the community, the family or anybody else.

In those days, the Mayor could only direct refusal. Since then, the mayoral nose has been poked into several places where it was not needed, not wanted or, more importantly, not strategic. His power was meant to be used only for strategic sites, strategic sizes of building or strategic locations. Decisions were made against the wishes of local people and of the local planning authority and were often overturned on appeal. I could not agree more with the remarks of the hon.

It was not right then, and there is no clarity about the proposed decision-making process to assuage my concern about it now. As many right hon. and hon.

Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), we are desperately short of housing. Hornsey and Wood Green is no different from Islington, North in that respect. There is a dichotomy as regards not only the way in which the Mayor&#146;s powers are used but the way in which his influence is used. Developers already use every word in favour of their development that falls from his mouth; they go to him to gain credibility. Their developments are not always about providing social or affordable housing&#151;more often than not they are luxury housing crammed into tiny spaces between gardens, and the Mayor&#146;s name should never be mentioned in relation to them. In cases in my constituency that have gone to appeal, fancy lawyers have used the Mayor&#146;s words or letters of support to get legitimate decisions of the local authority overturned. What the Mayor wants might be different from what he should have. In development control, there needs to be clear and consistent separation of those formulating planning strategies and those who make decisions on the ground, unless exceptional and defined circumstances arise. That is a genuine worry.</p>

It undermines not only local involvement but the role that the public are allowed to play in discussions about planning decisions. I was pleased that the Minister said that the Government are now moving at least towards consideration after the local authority has made an initial determination, but what role will local people play when the Mayor makes the determination? It is vital that local people have a role.</p>

The Mayor&#146;s response to those who fight for their local area, sustainable development and infrastructure&#151;schools, transport and health facilities that match the increased density&#151;is schoolboy name calling.</p>

My experience so far of the Mayor&#146;s interference is that he rides roughshod over local decisions and that the promised infrastructure&#151;schools, health facilities and transport&#151;does not arrive. The promises remain warm words. Without the infrastructure, there is a lack of social cohesion. When people scrabble over scarce public resources and battles take place about the entitlement of the already-heres against the needs of newcomers, all sorts of problems arise between people. We fear that from the Mayor&#146;s decision making when he has no grasp of the local position.</p>

That is the first problem. Secondly, if one overrides local decisions about the location of the required housing, what would motivate people to be councillors and active citizens when, at the end of the day, all the activity simply results in someone saying, &#147;I&#146;m sorry but we&#146;re going to overturn the decision and the housing will go where we want it, not where you as a community decide that you have to put it to meet your needs&#148;?</p>

Tenants of buildings with a mayoral granting of application could be interviewed one, two, five and 10 years after they had moved in.

It might be better if Mayor Livingstone were responsible for the enforcement and its costs, not the council&#151;in the case of Hornsey and Wood Green, a Labour council.

 I am talking about the effect across London, not just in an individual borough. The point of the Bill is for the Mayor to speed up the provision of affordable housing, and to provide more of it.

The hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway), for instance, talked of the Mayor&#146;s Venezuelan connection. The truth is, though, that the Mayor has a real record of achievement in London. He was very brave to introduce the congestion charge. There may still be congestion problems in London, but on the whole the charge is deemed to be a success. The Mayor has also invested a large amount in public transport and policing in London, which has benefited Londoners.

Member for Putney (Justine Greening) said in an intervention. I have to say that the Learning and Skills Council has not been effective in upgrading the skills of Londoners and in meeting job market demands. Also, who is the LSC accountable to? It is better that it comes within the ambit of the Mayor. He will have an overall role&#151;although a weak one&#151;in bringing it together with bodies such as Jobcentre Plus, but he will not have what is needed: some carrots and sticks, for example to make employers do their job properly in respect of improving training.

waste management functions as well. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), and with other interventions including by my hon.

I mentioned that there are a lot of people living in overcrowded and temporary homes, yet we will have population growth of 800,000 over the next 10 years so there is a great need to get on with building houses for families and others who need them. We must, however, be careful when we go on a big housing drive. We must not forget the need for quality&#151;the properties that are built must be of good quality&#151;and nor must we forget that London depends very much on its green spaces. If people are to have a decent environment to live in, the green spaces in many areas must be protected. Such considerations must be the counter to just pushing ahead&#151;to the market approach to housing. They must be built into the plans as well.</p>

She took certain major strategic planning applications to that court, and when the environment was taken into account in a fuller way by neutral judges&#151;or by judges with a concern for the environment, at least&#151;she won the day.

 The hon. Gentleman knows that I am very sympathetic to many of the things that he is saying, but the difficulty is that the judgments about national and regional interest are subjective ones. Rotherhithe has just had a great battle with the Secretary of State over a small planning application that went to inquiry. The inspector recommended that the local authority view be supported, but the Secretary of State has ignored that and supported the developer, presumably because she thinks that it is more than just a local matter. However, we are talking about a very small site that is not in a metropolitan centre. People fear that in such a case, a different judgment is applied and a perceived regional or national interest is imposed, when in fact, it should be an entirely local matter.</p>

 I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but in the few cases where the Government make it absolutely clear that a particular project is in the national interest, the rest of the existing planning process is irrelevant and costly. It should be shaped and modified according to our response to that national interest, and in the light of other issues.</p>

 Is not the answer to the point madeby the hon.

However, bearing in mind what my hon.

It would give third-party objections the right of appeal in the most serious cases in environmental terms, and the environment would have to be taken properly into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="61212-0018.htm_para4"><a name="06121286000091">I want to make two other brief points. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall that, in the main, section 106 money should go to areas in which development is taking place. However, getting section 106 money in the first place is an issue in itself. Given the push for affordable housing, approval for such housing could well be given at a local or mayoral level without the section 106 money that is so needed for the infrastructure being provided. I was not really convinced by the answer my hon. Friend the Minister gave from the Dispatch Box when I raised that point. She said that we had to balance affordable housing and infrastructure. We cannot have affordable housing without infrastructure; when that happens, developers just suck up the profits that should return to the community. We shall look closely at the guidelines my hon. Friend produces, but I impress on her the need to maximise the section 106 money and put it back into communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="61212-0018.htm_para5"><a name="06121286000092">My last point is about the London plan, which will be extremely important under the proposed arrangements. I know that it was put out for consultation, but it was done in a weak way. The consultation was not even as thorough as that for statutory district plans, yet the London plan will be of much greater importance. The consultation process for the plan should be strengthened and should include hearings on the most important issues both in London areas and in London as a whole. Londoners should have the chance to challenge aspects of the plan, perhaps before an independent judge of such matters&#151;perhaps even an environmental judge. The plan will have greater importance as the measure progresses, and there may even be a case for making the plan statutory, so that such factors can be built into it. However, none of that should detract from the provision of the affordable housing that Londoners very much need and want to be facilitated.</p>

Not long ago, at Prime Minister&#146;s questions, I asked the right hon. Gentleman whether the Government would fully fund the new primary schools needed to support the housing requirements of the London borough of Redbridge. Unfortunately, I received no assurances, but I am delighted to tell colleagues that we shall be building two new primary schools to meet the needs of children in the borough over the next two years, and that there will be a new secondary school by 2010.</p>

We should give them more power, not less. In my constituency, planning applications are often turned down locally but then approved nationally. That process benefits nobody. It is truly ridiculous and does not meet housing requirements or the needs of my constituents. The situation cannot continue.</p>

They have failed to achieve optimum accountability and transparency in terms of the delivery of services in the skills sector and in health. An enormous democratic deficit still remains in relation to health and skills in London, which the Government have not dealt with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="61212-0018.htm_para15"><a name="06121292000012">Secondly, the Government have remained wedded to a national template for the Government office for London, but that is not necessary. If there is a devolved system in London, it is not necessary for the Government office to take the same form as those elsewhere that currently administer some 30 schemes, worth many millions of pounds. I say that with no personal disrespect to the Minister, but the fact is that we have devolution, so we should follow its logic through and hand more powers from central Government down to Londoners, whether it be to the Mayor, the functional bodies or, indeed, in some cases, the London boroughs. The Government have, I am afraid, ducked that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="61212-0018.htm_para16"><a name="06121292000013">The Bill fails at the strategic level and, to make it worse, instead of giving the Mayor more strategic power, it takes power away from the boroughs in respect of important matters such as planning. My constituents in Bromley, an outer London borough, already find that the Mayor seeks to impose on them a one-size-fits-all planning policy. Planning policies and planning densities that are appropriate in inner London and even in suburban town centres are not appropriate in established residential suburbs, but the Mayor seeks to drive them through regardless. The Mayor, I am afraid, has not been a good advocate for giving his own office more powers. Perhaps it is his own erratic behaviour that has caused the Government to duck following the logic of their own devolution position. If that is the case, it is regrettable. It leaves my constituents with less service delivery, which is subject to less transparency, but with more burdens placed upon them.</p>

What he said has been proved right. The Mayor has changed his mind, of course, but he has changed it on so many things that it does not greatly surprise us. He was right the first time, which means that when the Mayor gets more powers, the London assembly should get more powers to hold him to account.</p>

The Deputy Prime Minister, when the original legislation was considered, recognised that the assembly should have that power, but he shied away from it before it became law.

 In the midst of considering an essentially parochial set of priorities for our capital, we should remind ourselves of a few more general considerations. First and foremost, London is a global city, an attribute that all of us London Members love greatly. Its outstanding success has been based on its unique diversity&#151;a rich mix of people, innovation and energy, which has served London so well over the 2,000 years since its foundation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="61212-0018.htm_para22"><a name="06121292000019">The overall strength and well-being of England and the UK depends on London&#146;s continued success. The strength of which I speak is not confined to the economic sphere: London is also a creative, cultural, administrative and political capital. London&#146;s success is plain to see. With one eighth of the UK&#146;s population, London contributes roughly one fifth of our GDP. In the course of this decade, 40 per cent. of the UK&#146;s crucial export growth has been fuelled from London. It is estimated that some &#163;20 billion of tax paid by Londoners every year is used to subsidise public spending in other parts of the country. London also leads the way in the all-important area of productivity, which has increased by some 27 per cent. in this decade. </p>

In my view, London&#146;s future prosperity can be assured only if our capital city remains a cradle for capitalism. Indeed, I would contend that the reason that Londoners have these past six years been able to tolerate Ken Livingstone&#151;a maverick Mayor who has shown himself incapable of efficient, competent administration&#151;is that he has so few effective powers. As a result, the damage that he has been able to inflict upon London&#146;s engine of economic growth has been thankfully limited.</p>

To do so would be making the same mistake as the Government made at the outset.

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="61212-0018.htm_para25"><a name="06121292000023">I have been lobbied by several local residents groups, including the Knightsbridge Association and Paddington Residents Active Concern on Transport, about the strategic dimension that this devolution brings in to play. Those groups feel that the present system allows decisions to be taken openly in the full knowledge of the local context. While no one would deny that a case can be made for a wider range of planning applications to be treated as genuinely strategic and left for referral to the Mayor, it is not clear how such a referral would be made. Above all, the Mayor, whoever it is, should not be given carte blanche in the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="61212-0018.htm_para26"><a name="06121292000024">Frankly, no London Mayor is likely to have the depth of intimate local knowledge that would justify his interfering in planning applications refused by local councils, yet the proposal is that he be given more power to reverse a locally made decision. Furthermore, the notion that any Mayor should be able to direct boroughs to amend their local development schemes surely runs counter to the very devolutionary principles on which the Bill is supposed to be based.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="61212-0018.htm_para27"><a name="06121292000025">I am also very much opposed to the idea of the Mayor of London being a signatory to section 106 agreements so that they can be treated as a potential source of revenue for housing or improved transport schemes. The purpose of a section 106 agreement is to provide ring-fenced benefits to offset the disadvantages that a development might bring to its immediate neighbourhood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="61212-0018.htm_para28"><a name="06121292000026">I accept that controversy already surrounds section 106 agreements, even under the present scheme, but it has always been easier to make the case for them when local councillors are able to identify specific projects to enhance a locality that is plainly losing out as a result of a development. Handing that power to the Mayor of London will mean that section 106 agreements will be regarded as no more than an additional development tax, and that in turn can only further corrupt, in the eyes of the general public, the transparency and openness of planning decision making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="61212-0018.htm_para29"><a name="06121292000027">I also fear that, given his track record, the Mayor&#146;s intentions in planning matters are not likely to be limited to strategic issues. Paradoxically, the potential grandstanding that the Bill will make possible is likely to add a further layer of bureaucracy, complexity and delay to the planning process, at precisely the time when the Government want to streamline it. I very much agree with Sir Simon Milton, the leader of Westminster city council, who has asserted that the number of cases in which the Mayor needs to intervene should be minimised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="61212-0018.htm_para30"><a name="06121292000028">It is easy to see how developers and other interested parties might use the Mayor as an additional means of delay and a way to mess up the system further. If we are to make improvements in housing and focus on our targets, we need to minimise the potential new layer of bureaucracy.</p>

As I said, I suspect that my constituency contains more listed buildings than any other in the UK. I do not want to defend a nimby charter: one has only to look at the superbly designed new buildings that have gone up in central London over the past decade to see that a balance can be struck between protecting heritage and encouraging innovation.

 First, I draw the House&#146;s attention to my entry in the Register of Members&#146; Interests. I am a member of the GLA, and have a particular interest in clause 1, which deals with compensation for retiring GLA members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para0"><a name="06121292000032">It is important to be positive in this debate, and to recognise the GLA&#146;s success. By bringing consistent strategies together with different partners, it has secured a great deal for London. The GLA has been able to represent London&#146;s interests, through its ability to pose questions to the Mayor for two and half hours every month&#151;a grilling longer than anything faced by many Ministers. In addition, the Mayor is represented as an advocate for London, and that is another reason to commend the GLA on its work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para1"><a name="06121292000033">The hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen) was right to say that the Bill is very timid. There should be a much more significant improvement in the powers coming down from Government to the GLA. In parallel legislation, it is very disappointing that the Learning and Skills Council responsibility has not been passed to the Mayor, given that the London Development Agency, as part of the regional development agency family, has been a principal deliverer under the GLA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para2"><a name="06121292000034">It strikes me that there is much talk of cognisance of health inequalities in relation to the proposed legislation, but the Mayor is not given the power to deliver directly on health issues. I agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam) said about the obvious clash between the role the Mayor will be given and the continuing role of NHS London. The GLA should be the place for the strategic health authority. Perhaps the Government could have been even more radical and given PCT powers to successful and well performing councils, and therefore improved democratic accountability in relation to health.</p>

thought that it would be worth while to give to the GLA some of the crime and disorder grants that GOL currently provides. That would fit in much more appropriately with the policing powers that are there. All that would leave GOL as a small strategic unit with important roles in areas such as resilience and in relation to being a gateway to Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para4"><a name="06121292000036">There is a lack of a radical approach to the assembly. As other Members suggested, the two-thirds rule has left the assembly as a toothless wonder. One example of real action would be to require the assembly&#151;within the resources provided&#151;to set up a budget and performance office. That would work much more effectively in analysing the performance of the GLA as a whole. In many ways, the assembly benefited from what has already been described in the debate as a generous settlement by the Mayor when it was set up. In many ways, it has been placed in a gilded cage. There is a certain sense of bedevilment about the Mayor, and perhaps even the Government, in terms of having a separate budget for the assembly, which will show just how expensive a project it is. If there were an obligation on the assembly to direct its resources towards a budget performance office, that would be good news.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para5"><a name="06121292000037">There also could have been powers for a call-in provision for looking at some of the mayoral decisions, as is provided for in local government. Perhaps we could have looked at the idea of separate billing for the GLA tax. That would go down extremely well with local boroughs that feel that their lower increases in tax are hidden by the GLA&#146;s large increases. It was announced today that there will be another 5.6 per cent. increase above the capping level that the Mayor is proposing.</p>

 Various myths about the Bill have been put around by both the Government and the Mayor of London. In my view, the Bill is not a devolutionary measure. Almost all the new powers will come from the London boroughs, not the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para9"><a name="06121292000044">I represent a part of London in which the Mayor is deeply unpopular, although I do not have sufficient time to go through the reasons why. I have always believed that when considering such constitutional changes, it is important to try to separate the personality and the position. In that regard, it is slightly unfortunate that we are talking about a new set of powers when we have had only one Mayor so far. Without having seen Mayors with different personalities and from different political parties over a period of time, it is difficult to determine how the mayoral position will work. It would have been more helpful if the debate had been held in four years&#146; time. Although my view on constitutional change is that personality should be slightly divorced from position, it is, unfortunately, rather difficult to do so. The <i> Evening Standard</i>, London&#146;s major print media, has said that the debate is about whether people are for or against &#147;More powers for Ken&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para10"><a name="06121292000045">The launch of the consultation in November 2005, which led to the Bill, has been an example of poor government. The process straddled either side of the May borough council elections. If Labour had won dozens of London councils in May, I cannot imagine that the Government would be proposing to shift powers from the boroughs, most of which were run by relatively new Labour authorities, to the present Mayor of London, who is largely out of sync with the Labour leadership. To a large extent, the Bill is a result of headlines such as that in the <i> Evening Standard</i> on 5 May: &#147;Blue is the colour&#151;jubilant Tories crush Labour in London.&#148; Given the timing of the Bill, one cannot help but think that there is a connection. The huge movement of powers from the London boroughs is a blatant attempt to override the results of May&#146;s elections and to deny local democratic choice on matters such as housing and planning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para11"><a name="06121292000046">It is notable that when the GLA was created in 2000, Labour controlled 18 of the 32 London boroughs&#151;just more than half. Today, it controls just eight, or a quarter. Moreover, when one looks at the three layers of government in London, it is the London Mayor who has the most questionable democratic mandate. Turnout in London in the 2005 general election was 58 per cent. The turnout for the 2006 borough elections was 38 per cent. The Mayor was elected in the election with the lowest turnout of the three. The Member who was elected with a share of registered electors nearest to that of the Mayor was the Minister with responsibility for London, the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick). The Bill takes away powers from those with a stronger and more legitimate electoral mandate and gives it to those with a weaker mandate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para12"><a name="06121292000047">My hon. Friends have spoken eloquently about planning. However, a specific point must be made about those who are in charge of regeneration. I strongly object to the same person or committee being responsible for  <br>

both regeneration and planning decisions. I have direct experience of that. In the last eight years of Labour&#146;s control of Hammersmith and Fulham council, the cabinet member for regeneration was also on the planning committee. She was so influential that the administration majority on the planning committee would follow almost her every move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para13"><a name="06121292000048">Why is that important? It is like merging the Executive and the judiciary. Planning is a quasi-judicial function, while regeneration is an executive function. It is extremely difficult to envisage how the Mayor could combine his existing role of promoting economic and social development and that of making decisions on individual planning applications to such an extent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para14"><a name="06121292000049">As I said in an earlier intervention, the Bill misses an opportunity by not fixing the grave problem caused by the Mayor&#146;s powers on consultation. The Mayor carries out an enormous number of consultations, which gives rise both to poor government and to expensive government. It is poor government to ignore routinely the results of consultations, as the Mayor does, and it is expensive government when those consultations simply add to the cost of a scheme. For example, part of the reason why the costs of the west London tram have escalated is the extensive consultation on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para15"><a name="06121292000050">There are various reasons why the Bill should be opposed. I look forward to its being opposed, or at least amended in Committee.</p>

 I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate, at long last. I have two regrets: the first is that I do not have more time to speak before handing over to the Minister for his closing remarks, and the second is that I am the sole Member representing Wandsworth residents to make any substantive contribution in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para16"><a name="06121292000052">This is an important Bill for London as a whole, and I want to add my voice to those of hon. Members from all parties who have tonight expressed concerns about the changes to the planning process. Like many Londoners, when I first saw the proposals in the Bill, I wondered why on earth the Mayor wanted more powers, when so many current problems fall within his remit. I only have to come to work every day on the District line to experience one of them. I notice that many male hon. Members extolled the virtues of the congestion charge, but from a female perspective, one of its downsides is that now that it has priced women off the roads, it is not much fun going home late at night after a late vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para17"><a name="06121292000053">On the planning issues, I have genuine concerns about the transferral of powers from London boroughs to the Mayor. Ironically, planning is the one local authority process in which many local residents will ever get involved, and they do so because planning issues are important to them. The impact of planning is felt strongly locally, not only outside the borough, but right at home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para18"><a name="06121292000054">I have another concern about giving the Mayor more powers, because London is a dynamic city that changes all the time. We heard my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett) say that it  <br>

had been several years since the Mayor had the chance to visit his part of London. In many respects, that is understandable, as there are 30-plus London boroughs&#151;in fact, the City of London makes it 33. My concern is that the Mayor will simply not have the local knowledge base that he needs to enable him to take an informed decision, when he is presented with a matter on which he will have to take a view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para19"><a name="06121292000055">We risk undermining one of the best processes used by residents, by tinkering with it in a fundamental way. Increasingly, in this internet age, Londoners are using the internet to input into the planning process in a way that is easier than ever before. It worries me that we are proposing to take those powers further away from local communities. A huge regeneration project is taking place in my constituency in Roehampton, and if we can make sure that it works for our local community, it will be extremely welcome. It causes me concern that at a time when we are encouraging residents to say what they want, so that we can make the regeneration exactly right for my area, we may bring about a situation in which the Mayor can torpedo such plans for some ulterior motive that may or may not be in the best interest of local residents. It should be up to us to take a view on what we think is best for us, locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para20"><a name="06121292000056">There is a danger that we will give the Mayor a planning sledgehammer, which he may use unwittingly and inappropriately. I urge Ministers to pause for thought. Much concern has been expressed about the planning aspects of the Bill, and it is unusual how cross-party that concern is. I urge the Minister to pause and think about the matter when the Bill is in Committee, and to really consider whether its provisions are the best way of approaching the subject.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening) who, as ever, spoke with commendable pithiness and authority. We have had a lively and well-informed debate, and I pay tribute to all hon. Members who spoke. From among Labour Members, we heard contributions from the right hon.

Green (Lynne Featherstone). They rubbished a central plank of the legislation, but they nevertheless support the Bill. I thought that letting it be known that one opposes the central plank of a Government proposal but voting for it anyway was the prerogative of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but I am delighted that the Liberal Democrats have maintained their stance of organised hypocrisy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para23"><a name="06121293000004">I wish to single out my hon.

They were effective advocates for their communities, which the Bill will rob of the powers that local people want to be exercised locally. At the heart of the debate is the question of accountability and the principle of devolution. Our approach to the Bill is straightforward and coherent, unlike the Government&#146;s. When the Government cede power to the Mayor of London&#151;however inept some of the Bill&#146;s provisions, that is what they are partly seeking to do&#151;we will support them. When devolution occurs we are in favour, but unfortunately, much of the Bill is devoted to sucking power up from local councils and the boroughs that comprise London&#146;s rich and diverse democratic culture. It is those provisions that we wholeheartedly oppose. Because much of the Bill depends on taking power up instead of devolving it down, the measure is not at all devolutionary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para24"><a name="06121293000005">The Minister for Housing and Planning said that the Bill would result in power being devolved to the boroughs, but there is not a single clause that devolves powers down to London boroughs, so she made a deliberately misleading attempt to sell a flawed measure. She said, too, that she was delighted that Greater London authority legislation had given London a Mayor who provided a strong voice for the city. It is remarkable that she should try to take the credit for that, as her party tried to strangle that voice by denying Mayor Livingstone the chance to be elected under a Labour banner, only to clasp him to its bosom once he had proved that he was a winner&#151;a flip-flop typical of the Government&#146;s approach to local government.</p>

New housing powers are needed in London because there are problems with overcrowding and lack of supply, which were highlighted in my hon. Friends&#146; eloquent contributions. If we are to increase the housing supply in London, we must look at which boroughs have delivered on the ground and exceeded their housing target. Wandsworth has exceeded it by 168 per cent., Westminster by 124 per cent., Bromley by 124 per cent., and Bexley by 205 per cent. Those councils are all united by the fact that they are Conservative-controlled: they deliver housing, they exceed their targets, and they deliver for their voters.</p>

All those councils are united by the fact that until recently they were Labour-led. There is a record of Labour failure to deliver housing to the people of London. The answer to the question of what we can do to increase housing supply in London is clear&#151;vote Conservative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para27"><a name="06121293000010">The Bill&#146;s planning powers were criticised by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, and by the hon. Member for Vauxhall, who rightly pointed out that the Mayor exercises his powers in secret and that there is a lack of transparency. As the right hon. Gentleman pointed out, there are serious questions about whether the extension of his powers will lead to a conflict of interest and allegations of impropriety. We have heard about the bureaucratic nature of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para28"><a name="06121293000011">The Minister said that the Mayor interfered in very few planning applications.</p>

Excluding high days and holy days, he has intervened for every day that he has been in power. Under the current powers, he was not able to get his way, but the Minister wants the Mayor to have his way. She would open the door to the Mayor&#146;s interfering in more and more decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="61212-0019.htm_para31"><a name="06121293000014">That interference would lead to the system becoming more bureaucratic and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) observed, that would lead to greater delays. Westminster council manages to process 75 per cent. of its planning applications within 13 weeks. The Government&#146;s target is 60 per cent. of planning applications. Once again, a Conservative council is delivering a better service for its residents, and in consequence more housing. Under the provisions of the Bill, the Mayor would intervene nine weeks after the planning application was received&#151;a recipe for further confusion, delay and bureaucracy, and the frustration of residents&#146; demand for speedy processing of planning applications and better housing.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is a logical man. Will he please address this issue: if he believes the new powers will cause delay in the delivery of new housing, will he explain how an intervention by the Mayor to require an authority that was going to refuse housing to agree it will delay the provision of housing?</p>

 As I was explaining, the Mayor&#146;s powers to intervene will spin out the process to an interminable extent. It is important that we recognise that the most effective way of delivering the local housing that Londoners need is through Conservative councils delivering in tune with their voters&#146; wishes. As the historical record shows, when Conservatives are in power planning applications are processed more quickly, and more housing is delivered. When Labour councils are in power, or when a Labour Mayor is in power, unfortunately the wishes of local people, and housing delivery, are frustrated.</p>

But the Secretary of State, speaking in Lewisham, said:</p>

After all, they know their patch and its people best. They know which problems are top of the priority list. And, more often than not, they have a pretty good idea of what is needed to resolve them.&#148;</p>

I was also pleased to serve on the Greater London Authority Act 1999, which restored London&#146;s government. It was very disappointing to hear that Conservative Members will vote against the Bill tonight&#151;I was disappointed, but not surprised.</p>

Members have catalogued their attitude to strategic London government, and I shall try to respond to a number of those points. The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) asked for an evidence-taking session before the Bill begins its parliamentary scrutiny. However, she knows that we had extensive consultation over many months on our manifesto proposals for additional powers and responsibilities. As my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has outlined, further discussions are still taking place and reports will be given to the Committee in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="61212-0020.htm_para14"><a name="06121295000004">The hon. Lady raised specific points about mayoral planning powers. She said that the Mayor would not consult the boroughs on the London housing strategy. Section 41 of the Greater London Authority Act requires the Mayor to consult boroughs on drafts or revisions to his statutory strategies. On call-ins, the powers of the Secretary of State are unchanged. The Secretary of State will not have the power to overturn a decision by the Mayor to take over an application but will retain a power to call in the application for his or her own decision. The changes do not do away with the role of the planning inspectorate. Inspectors will continue to consider appeals where applications are refused by the Mayor or by the boroughs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="61212-0020.htm_para15"><a name="06121295000005">My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) drew on his considerable experience, especially from the passage of the original GLA Bill, on which he led. He effectively dispatched as nitpicking many of the points raised by Opposition Front Benchers. He perfectly described how and why the original proposals were so modest and why this Bill should be welcomed. He entertained us with his reference to the Tories&#146; disarray on the Bill and the similarity to their position in 1999&#151;his own version of &#147;Groundhog Day&#148;.</p>

Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) challenged the continuing existence of the Government office for London. GOL has an important role to play. It represents central Government across the capital, delivering polices and programmes for 10 Departments in a joined-up way&#151;and it is here to stay. The recent review of the Government office network by the Treasury and the Department for Communities and Local Government confirmed the important role that it plays, but it needs to be leaner and more strategic. GOL is responding to that challenge. Its staff numbers have fallen by more than 27 per cent. since October 2004, and its budget has decreased. I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to its director, Liz Meek, and her colleagues for all that they do for London.</p>

thresholds. That is in line with original expectations, and it does not mean that he has intervened. He has directed refusal in very few cases. GLA figures show that he did so in only four cases in 2004-05.</p>

Many of the determinants of poor health among Londoners are non-health issues such as poor housing and transport, emissions and accidents, which often have a disproportionate impact on disadvantaged and black and minority ethnic communities. The Mayor, working with the London strategic health authority, is best placed to tackle the health determinants within his control and to work with other stakeholders to identify and tackle lifestyle choices such as smoking and participation in sports. His role is to promote a reduction in health inequalities, not to take a direct role in the delivery of health services.</p>

Section 106 rules clearly state that there must be a close relationship between the section 106 agreement and the proposed development and that the agreement is necessary for the development to proceed. We are clear that the boroughs should be fully involved in section 106 issues and propose that they will decide applications in the first instance and will be consulted by the Mayor when he takes on this responsibility.</p>

Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway) said that the requirement for 50 per cent. affordable housing puts developers off. The London plan states that the 50 per cent. affordable housing target is a strategic target for London as a whole. It does not require each housing proposal to achieve 50 per cent., and the individual circumstances of each site will be taken into account. He also said that the Mayor should not be allowed to discourage high carbon-emitting cars by using policies such as those of the London borough of Richmond. The Government welcome initiatives such as those undertaken by Richmond to limit emissions from cars. We encourage innovative local initiatives to tackle increasing emissions from road transport and believe that the Mayor has an important role to play in that.</p>

points that they both made, not agreeing with either, let alone both of them. She asked several specific questions. She raised concerns that the Mayor would not be required to hear representations from those affected by development proposals.

There is no inherent conflict, but each planning application must be judged on its merits. I agree that the Mayor must act and be seen to act in a way that does not prejudge the outcome of an application. He will need to take particular care about his public statements and behaviour in relation to planning applications, especially when one of his functional bodies has an interest in an application. We will encourage the GLA standards committee to draw up a code of conduct to cover the Mayor&#146;s new role in planning applications.</p>

It is therefore only sensible that the Mayor&#146;s powers are subject to the Secretary of State&#146;s reserved powers and that his housing strategy and recommendations on funding must be consistent with national policies.

The hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst sadly managed to drag in the problems of West Ham United. I suggest to him that, by the time we successfully conclude Committee proceedings, he and I will happily be singing, &#147;I&#146;m Forever Blowing Bubbles&#148; together again. It is instructive, however, that the two London assembly members who sit on the Conservative Benches have indicated that they are voting against the Bill as it does not go far enough and is not bold enough, in contrast to their right hon. and hon. Friends who all believe that it goes too far. I suggest that those two hon. Gentlemen are going in the wrong direction and should join us in the Lobby tonight.</p>

Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), winding up for the Opposition, raised the issue of flip-flops: a fair point. Given the recent policy reverses from the Conservative party, it was made with the authority of real experience. He spoke of the failure in housing policy, which, I would point out, goes back decades. It is a policy failure that we are now starting to put right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="61212-0020.htm_para31"><a name="06121295000023">The question of the GLA&#146;s budget was raised by several Members. In 2006-07, 73 per cent. of the GLA precept went to the Metropolitan Police Authority. The precept also contributes to other key London services, such as fire and emergency planning. Only 3 per cent. goes to fund the core GLA, while 7 per cent. goes to fund the Olympics. The GLA precept has helped to fund a substantial increase in the number of police officers since the creation of the GLA: 5,658 more, a 22.7 per cent. increase between March 2001 and March 2006. That compares with an increase of about 10 per cent. for all other forces in England and Wales. It also supports the roll-out of neighbourhood policing across the capital: three quarters of the policing precept increase for 2006-07 is related to neighbourhood policing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="61212-0020.htm_para32"><a name="06121295000024">Furthermore, the Mayor does not have an unfettered power in setting the precept. The assembly has the power to amend the precept by a two thirds majority, which has provided an important constraint on the Mayor&#146;s ability to set the GLA group budget. As the House knows, the Government are prepared to take capping action to deal with excessive council tax increases. We would take such action in relation to all authorities if necessary, including the GLA.</p>

the Mayor and the assembly. We are determined that decisions should be taken at the right level of governance. In London, for many decisions, that means the strategic, city-wide level, and the Bill gives the Mayor the powers to take those decisions. The Bill provides the Mayor with new roles in housing and tackling climate change, and a strengthened role in planning and managing London&#146;s waste.

 You will understand, Mr. Speaker, that although I am usually keen on Adjournment debates, I would rather not have to speak about this subject. I am sure that those sentiments are shared by my neighbour, the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry), whose constituency has also been touched by this tragedy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="61212-0022.htm_para8"><a name="0612132000027">The terrible events of nine days ago led to an awful fire at the Ringmer depot. I was at a carol concert in the village and saw the fire engines go past, but I never dreamed that the consequences of the fire would be so desperate. Eventually, two firefighters&#151;Geoff Wicker and Brian Wembridge&#151;lost their lives, and nine other firefighters, one police officer and two members of the public were injured. The fire was the worst tragedy of its kind in living memory in east Sussex, and I think that I am right in saying that it was the first time this year that firefighters anywhere in England have been killed carrying out their duties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="61212-0022.htm_para9"><a name="0612132000028">This debate is at least an opportunity to put on record my deepest sympathies, on behalf of the local community in my constituency, for the firefighters&#146; families and friends. I also want to pay tribute to firefighters nationally, as they form a family across the nation. Many firefighters a long way from Ringmer have felt the loss very deeply, just as people in the area have.</p>

<p><a name="st_o412"><a name="0612132000029"><a name="61212-0022.htm_spnew3"><a name="0612132000089"><b>Charles Hendry (Wealden) (Con):</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Brian Wembridge and Geoff Wicker were both constituents of mine. Does he agree that, essentially, they were doing what firefighters do every day&#151;putting their lives at risk to protect the public and our interests? Will he pay great tribute to the incredible bravery that the two men showed? They thought not of themselves in those moments, but of the wider community.</p>

<p><a name="st_o413"><a name="0612132000030"><a name="61212-0022.htm_spnew4"><a name="0612132000090"><b>Norman Baker:</b>
 I am very happy to share that sentiment with the hon. Gentleman. Firefighters and members of the emergency services in general put their lives on the line for us. We take that for granted on many occasions and it is very sad that those men paid the ultimate price for their service to the public.</p>

<p><a name="st_o414"><a name="0612132000031"><a name="61212-0022.htm_spnew5"><a name="0612132000091"><b>Mike Penning (Hemel Hempstead) (Con):</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. People in my community suffered something similar almost exactly a year ago, and on their behalf I should like to send my commiserations to the families and loved ones of the two firefighters who died. I also wish a speedy recovery to the other people who were injured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="61212-0022.htm_para10"><a name="0612132000032">I used to be a fireman myself, and I notice that the Minister for Consumer Affairs and Competition Policy, who used to have ministerial responsibility for the fire service, is present for the debate. The disaster at Ringmer will affect the whole fire service community in this country. Firemen have wonderful bravado, and they are there for us when push comes to shove. Our thoughts and prayers today are with the community represented by the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker).</p>

 I am very grateful for that intervention. In making his comments, the hon. Gentleman speaks for the whole House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="61212-0022.htm_para11"><a name="0612132000034">I hope that it is some comfort to the friends and families of the men who died that the public have shown so much concern and sympathy in this matter. People locally have contributed to memorial funds and have signed their names in the books of condolence available at stations in Lewes, Brighton, Hove and Portslade. Most fire services privately held two minutes&#146; silence on Sunday, at the time of the blast a week earlier. Fire officers collected memorial funds from the generous crowd at Brighton and Hove Albion&#146;s Saturday evening match. At least it is some comfort, I hope, that the community feels strongly and deeply about the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="61212-0022.htm_para12"><a name="0612132000035">An inquiry is under way. I am happy to say that, as far as I can tell, the police, the Health and Safety Executive and the fire and rescue service are all co-operating in that inquiry and are determined to get to the bottom of what happened. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela E. Smith), will agree that it is important that the inquiry be thorough and open, and that, if problems are identified, they are honestly revealed so that we can learn lessons from them for the future. It is, of course, too early to give details of what has been discovered and I would not expect her to do that in her reply, but there are points that need to be raised. I raise them neutrally, just to ensure that they are covered by the inquiry. Obviously, we will find out in due course whether they are the basis for concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="61212-0022.htm_para13"><a name="0612132000036">It is worth remarking that the business in question, Festival Fireworks&#151;formerly, Sussex Fireworks&#151;has been long established. It is 57 years old. It has had many high-profile customers, including the Prince&#146;s Trust, Coca-Cola and Glyndebourne opera house, which is not far away. It organises displays anywhere in the world. It is a well established company.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="61212-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0612132000037">There have been licences for three storage buildings on site. According to the <i> Sussex Express</i>, our local paper, which has excelled itself in its sensitive and thorough reporting of the matter, one building was allowed to store 20 tonnes of explosives, the second 600 kg and the third 100 kg. I am also told that the building had been subject to an HSE inspection two months before. I wonder whether the Minister can confirm that and say something generally about the inspection regimes that apply to those sorts of facilities. I am keen to learn, for example, what involvement the local authority and the fire and rescue service have in inspecting such premises, and whether the licensing regime and the approval regime for this sort of activity are sufficient, or whether there need to be changes to the licensing regime.</p>

<p><a name="st_o416"><a name="0612132000038"><a name="61212-0022.htm_spnew7"><a name="0612132000093"><b>Charles Hendry:</b>
 I support the way in which the hon. Gentleman is conducting the debate. Does he agree that it is one thing to have a licence for a fireworks factory, but that one also has to look at what is in the buildings and premises that are adjacent to it? The nature of this explosion was totally different from that of fires in fireworks factories in the past&#151;as a result of the juxtaposition of the factory and some highly explosive gases.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman neatly leads me on to my next point. As the Minister will be aware by now, there was a steel fabrication plant next door. As far as I can tell from reports so far, it contained acetylene gas cylinders. Having such cylinders in close proximity to fireworks is not a helpful or sensible idea. The presence of those cylinders may well not have been known about. The inspection and licensing regime may simply have dealt with the fireworks depot and failed&#151;naturally perhaps&#151;to take into account what might be in the building next door. If that is the case&#151;I do not know whether it is&#151;that clearly needs to be resolved when it comes to future consideration of licences. That is borne out to some degree by the thrust of the Manufacture and Storage of Explosives Regulations 2005, which have just come in. They refer to separation distances. There is obviously recognition that there needs to be some sort of exclusion zone around the explosives. I certainly agree with that concept. I wonder whether that was taken into account in considering what was stored in the steel fabrication plant next door.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="61212-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0612132000040">Were the requirements on the depot sufficient? If they were sufficient, were they adhered to? When were the premises last inspected by the HSE? Was it two months ago? There is also the question of when they were inspected by the fire service and the local authority&#151;if they do inspect the premises. Was there knowledge of the steel fabrication plant next door and its contents? Most obviously, what caused the fire? We still do not know that, and I imagine that we will not until there has been a proper investigation.</p>

<a name="61212-0022.htm_brev14"><a name="0612132000082"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the information available did not indicate that an evacuation or cordon was required&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="61212-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0612132000042">The consequence of that was that people were in the close-by Wok Inn restaurant when windows were shattered and chunks of plaster fell from the ceiling. I am led to believe by the <i> Sussex Express </i>that a nine-month-old girl narrowly escaped serious injury owing to that problem in the restaurant. Should the evacuation and cordoning arrangements have been different? Was the situation entirely unforeseen and unpredictable, meaning that nothing could have been done about it? Alternatively, in retrospect, should different arrangements be in place for the evacuation and cordoning off of such depots and plants when an incident occurs? In a sense, what level of activity is triggered by an incident somewhere such as a fireworks depot, which obviously contains explosives, and what automatic responses occur? Is evacuation one of those responses&#151;if not, perhaps it should be? Perhaps most obviously, were firefighters sent into a situation into which they really should not have been sent, with the tragic consequences about which we know?</p>

we spread the risk, in a sense, or is it better for strategic and safety reasons to concentrate it in one area where it can be properly looked after? I do not know the answer to that question, but it should be considered as part of the investigation.</p>

 I thank the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) and all hon. Members who have spoken for the way in which the debate has been conducted. None of us would wish to be having the debate. We all have difficulty coming to terms with what happened during the tragic incident that took place at the Festival Fireworks depot in the hon.

East Sussex fire and rescue service received the initial call reporting an incident at the Festival Fireworks depot at 1.49 pm. That initial call was followed by 24 further calls from members of the public. The first crews in attendance arrived at the site at 1.59 pm and were faced with a rapidly developing fire in the depot, which was igniting fireworks. They made a request for further fire appliances to attend the scene on their arrival.</p>

fire and rescue service mobilising centre. He had served the ESFRS for more than 30 years, having joined in 1975 as a retained duty system firefighter. Brian Wembridge was 63 years old and was employed by the ESFRS as a media and administration co-ordinator. He attended the incident in his capacity as video technician for the service. Mr. Wembridge had given 45 years&#146; service to East Sussex, and he spent much of that time as a firefighter. He was appointed to the media and administration co-ordinator role in 2003.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="61212-0023.htm_para1"><a name="0612132000050">I shall say something more about the incident. At approximately 2.45 pm, an explosion was reported. A roll-call of all personnel at the scene was conducted, and two fire and rescue service personnel were found to be missing. A quick search revealed the location of the bodies of Mr. Wicker and Mr. Wembridge. The injuries sustained by the other 12 people ranged from cuts and bruises to concussion, and all the injured have been discharged from hospital. At the time of the reported explosion, approximately 60 firefighters were at the scene. The Health and Safety Executive was informed of the incident at about 4.30 pm that day. Contact was made, and maintained throughout the next four hours, with the principal police officer at the site and with the Sussex police firearms and explosives licensing officers, who were also on site. A 200 m hazard zone was established, enclosing a builder&#146;s fabrication yard where flame-cutting gas cylinders were thought to be on site. Following the reported explosion, the fire was monitored and was allowed to burn itself out. The first HSE inspector arrived on site the following morning, on Monday 4 December.</p>

Member for Lewes mentioned my interest in the case, and he will know that I have been in regular contact with the fire and rescue service. The site is currently cordoned off, so I have not been able to visit it, but I can tell him that I am in regular contact with the fire and rescue service. I have spoken to the police, too, and I intend to visit the site shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="61212-0023.htm_para3"><a name="0612132000053">The hon. Gentleman raised a number of questions about the investigation. I shall say what I can about it, but he will understand if there are things that I cannot say, because I do not want to jeopardise the investigation in any way. An investigation is necessary if we are to get to the absolute truth, so it is appropriate that we should hold such a full investigation. It is being led by Sussex police, and experts from the HSE and ESFRS are assisting. In addition, technical expertise is being provided by my Department, as was requested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="61212-0023.htm_para4"><a name="0612132000054">I shall try to address some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific points. He asked why the HSE licensed an explosives site near a place where gas cylinders were kept. Licences have to take account of hazardous materials and the foreseeable usage of any flammable gases that may be present on, or near, a licensed explosives site. If a licence is issued, a separation distance must be judged between the storage site of the flammable gases and the site of the explosives building. Distances are proportionate to the type and quantity of explosives permitted by the licence, and so are proportionate to the hazard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="61212-0023.htm_para5"><a name="0612132000055">The acetylene cylinders to which the hon. Gentleman referred were on adjacent premises, and the ESFRS was aware that the cylinders were there, but the cylinders were not involved until after the reported explosion. The cylinders were then subject to heat and shock, which meant that, under standing operating procedures, an exclusion zone had to be put in place. He asked me whether I could confirm the date of the last inspection, and I can: there was a site visit by an HSE inspector on 11 October 2006. The hon. Gentleman mentioned reports and concerns that had been raised with the HSE about the site. I shall not go into all the details, but although a letter was passed to the explosives inspector responsible for the site, there was no specific evidence of wrongdoing. Nevertheless, an investigation followed at a later date in October.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="61212-0023.htm_para6"><a name="0612132000056">I can confirm to the hon. Gentleman that the focus of the investigation is to establish the cause and all the events leading up to the fire and the reported explosion, and to establish all the circumstances leading up to the tragic deaths of Mr. Wembridge and Mr. Wicker and the injury of others. On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s other questions about the involvement of firefighters, the matter is subject to the investigation, so I cannot give him answers until after the investigation has taken place. It is not that I am reluctant to provide full information&#151;I simply think that it is inappropriate to do so until there has been full investigation. I give him an assurance that it will be full, thorough, and transparent. The purpose of any investigation is to find out what exactly happened, and to learn from the investigation&#146;s results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="61212-0023.htm_para7"><a name="0612132000057">That is probably all that I can say specifically about the investigation into the fire at Festival Fireworks, but more generally, there are strong controls on the manufacture and storage of explosives. The Manufacture and Storage of Explosives Regulations 2005 update earlier controls under the Explosives Act 1875. Anyone who stores more than a small quantity of fireworks, even for a short period, must apply for a licence or registration. As I said, separation distances for explosive stores are important to protect people in the neighbourhood. The local authority is the licensing authority for smaller-scale storage of less than 2 tonnes&#151;it is the trading standards department in East Sussex&#151;but in some areas, the fire and rescue service is the licensing authority. The Health and Safety Executive is the licensing authority for manufacturing operations and the storage of fireworks over 2 tonnes. Before HSE licences are granted, the applicant must obtain local authority assent, which gives local people the opportunity to comment. Councillors and emergency services, for example, can feed into local decision making, or object to the licence at a public hearing. The regulations place a duty on anyone who manufactures or stores explosives to take appropriate measures to prevent fire or explosion; to limit the extent of any fire or explosion; and to protect people in the event of fire or explosion. There are regular inspection visits.</p>

who served as firefighters&#151;and the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) made that very point. We should take every opportunity to remind ourselves of the commitment, professionalism and dedication shown by fire service personnel throughout the country, as they play an enormous part in ensuring the safety of our communities. The many years of dedicated service given by Mr. Wembridge and Mr. Wicker made a huge contribution to the protection of the people of East Sussex. I am sure I speak for all hon. Members when I say how grateful we are for their commitment, which is shared by many of their colleagues across the country, and for which they paid the ultimate price. As the hon. Member for Lewes said, responses and letters have come from across the country, including from many people in the fire and rescue services, expressing sadness about the tragic end to the lives of two men whose entire careers were spent trying to save people&#146;s lives and protect others.</p>

 Does the Minister agree that it is very much the role of firefighters to save lives?

 I think that everyone is aware of that. Indeed, the East Sussex fire and rescue service is aware of it. The operation was clearly not intended to put lives at risk at any stage.

However distressing it is for people to lose property, we must protect lives, including those of firefighters at all time. We should not expose firefighters to unnecessary risk.</p>
