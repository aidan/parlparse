university research and teaching of science while, on the other hand,
he is handing out &#163;1.5 billion of taxpayers&#146; money every

Conservatives, we are catching up and hope to lead the world. I hope
that he also supports the money that we are putting into universities.

fooling when he boasts about extra investment in science, given that
the permanent secretary at the Department for Education and Skills told

we came into power, spending on university students had been falling
under the Conservative Government. It is now rising as a result of what
we are doing. We have set the ambition that we will increase spending

200 companies are spun off from universities every year. That is three
times what was achieved under the Conservative Government before us.
There are 20 companies now listed on the stock exchange&#151;this is

suggested by the shadow Chancellor, in high technology and

The climate change levy is playing a crucial role in enabling the
UK to meet its Kyoto targets.An independent valuation
conducted recently by Cambridge Econometrics has examined the levy. It
concluded that the levy would, by 2010, deliver annual carbon savings
of 3.5 million tonnes. That is far in advance of the forecast of 2
million tonnes of carbon when we introduced the

that the climate change levy package has reduced emissions of carbon by
16.5 million tonnes and is a vital part of meeting our Kyoto
commitments, how does the UK&#146;s progress on meeting these
commitments compare with our international
colleagues?</p><p><a name="06061538000055"><b><a name="06061538000696">John

introducing the climate change levy, and now it is the sort of measure
that is required throughout the European Union. We led the way in
introducing an emissions trading scheme, and we led the way also in
setting up and strengthening the European Commission&#146;s scheme.
We are leading as well with our commitment to the Kyoto commitment.
Along with the Netherlands and Sweden, we are one of only three EU
member states, of 15 countries, in being on track to meet our Kyoto
targets.</p><p><a name="06061538000056">On climate

aware of the launch of a new campaign by the Carbon Trust, which is
linked to the climate change levy. British businesses will waste more
than &#163;500 million over the summer if they fail to adopt energy
efficiency failures, and the campaign demonstrates that the trust can
help them by delivering an average 15 per cent. saving in energy
efficiency and business costs. Clearly, the climate change levy package
can help business and the environment, so I hope that it receives
support from Members on both sides of the

period?</p><p><a name="06061538000060"><b><a name="06061538000700">John

rates on all significant microgeneration technologies that are
installed professionally in domestic or charitable buildings. That is
the extent of the action that we can take under existing VAT rules, but
he will know that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in the
Budget extra support to try to boost microgeneration technologies and
build the market in Britain. Demand is still too low for the technology
to take off, but we want that to change. As a Government, we are

simplistic view. I have two things to say to her. First, the point of
environmental taxation is not, contrary to the Liberals&#146; view,
taxation for taxation&#146;s sake: it is about the change in
behaviour and opinion that those taxes can achieve. It is wrong to look
at taxation simply in terms of the total tax receipts, because
environmental taxes can influence behaviour and lead to a reduction in
receipts. Environmental taxes can be used, as can discounts for
biofuels and climate change agreements, to achieve significant
environmental ends without raising the environmental tax take.
Secondly, as the hon. Lady looks at the big black hole in her spending
and tax plans and the &#163;8 billion of environmental taxes that she
would impose on people, I urge her to take a more sophisticated view,

We are on course to meet our targets for international development
spending. World development aid is increasing. We have signed the
agreements that make it possible to write off multilateral debt, so in
total we expect up to&#163;170 billion of debt to be written
off. The condition of that is that the money will go to education,
health and anti-poverty programmes in the developing countries. At next
month&#146;s meeting of the G8, we are determined to push forward so
that every country agrees that the commitments that we made for the
millennium development goals on poverty, education and health are met.

We are below the OECD average, below the G7 average, behind the EU 25

this year and will be faster in the second half of the year than in the
first half. Growth since 1997 is far faster than it was in
the18 years before 1997, and we are the country that has low

that that was her income, but was then overpaid because the Inland
Revenue was unable to take account of what she had reported to them.

families received tax credits. In 2004-05, that figure rose to 60,000,
and some of those families, because of their income, benefited to the

Gloucestershire and everywhere else are contributing to lifting
children out of poverty and assisting families and parents to return to
work.</p>

high oil prices around the world. An energy review, which will report
in a few months time, will be a Government report and will set out
exactly how we can have an energy policy that meets our climate change

for 42 sectors and have since added five more. We are looking to
legislate for those five more, building on an extra nine that we added
previously. We are trying to strike an essential balance with a package

people to save for retirement. We want more rather than fewer people to
use the tax reliefs by saving for their pensions, and that is why the

thousands of cases are still stuck in the system. The new IT system for
the passport agency was delayed and over budget, and led to more than
500,000 people waiting for passports. The Criminal Records
Bureau&#146;s new computer system was delivered six months late and
&#163;145 million over budget, built up a backlog of 30,000 cases,

we have seen yet another example of the Home Secretary trying to blame
everyone but the Government for the problems in our criminal justice
system; if he is not blaming the civil servants, he is blaming the
judges. Does the Leader of the House agree that what the public want is
honest sentencing? They want to know that when someone is told that
they will be in prison for 18 years, they will be in prison for 18
years and will not be let out halfway through or, worse still, when
they have served only a third of their sentence. May we have a debate
on sentencing policy? Then we can discuss why the Government&#146;s
action on sentencing means that a man who kidnapped and sexually
assaulted a three-year-old girl can be let out of prison after less
than six years.</p><p><a name="06061538000181">Let us

about the NHS and said what is needed is to 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 905</b><br>concentrate on what is delivered rather than what is reported. I am
delighted to concentrate on what is delivered, because the facts of the
improvements in the national health service speak for themselves, in
terms of huge increases in the number of staff&#151;an increase of
85,000 nurses, 30,000 doctors and 10,000 consultants. There have been
improvements in staff levels in every constituency and they are
paralleled by improvements in health care for every constituent across
the country.</p><p><a name="06061538000183">Secondly,
the right hon. Lady referred to co-parenting and the proposals before
the House next week. I shall certainly pass her comments on to my right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. Thirdly,
she asked about the report in today&#146;s <i> Financial Times
</i>about the comprehensive spending

the right hon. Lady asked for a debate because she wants to find out
about education spending now&#151;by comparison, I assume, with 1997
and the Conservative years. We do not need a debate on the improvements
in education spending. All that the right hon. Lady needs to do is to
look at the website or to ask in the Library for the figures, which
show a dramatic improvement in spending on the service, moving
education spending year by year&#151;yes&#151;up towards the level
in private schools. That dramatic improvement in spending, along with a
significant increase of 33,000 in the number of teachers and an
increase of more than 250,000 in the number of teachers&#146;
assistants, is leading to dramatic improvements in the educational
attainment of pupils in every constituency. I am surprised that the
right hon. Lady is not celebrating the achievement of schools and
hospitals in her constituency, instead of denigrating the record of
good public servants and the effectiveness of public
investment.</p><p><a name="06061538000187">The right
hon. Lady asked about Home Office matters and said that we need debates
on sentencing. We have had plenty of debates on sentencing. They have
occurred in the context of many of the Bills that she is now
complaining about in respect of law and order. As the Prime Minister so
effectively pointed out yesterday, it is striking that, more often than
not, when we bring forward proposals to strengthen sentencing and to
toughen up the judicial system, Conservative Members vote against them.
<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Someone who has probably not
checked the facts of even his own voting record said, &#147;Not
so,&#148; from a sedentary position. The Conservatives voted against
abolishing the double jeopardy rule to allow suspected rapists and
murderers to be retried when important new evidence&#151;for example,
DNA evidence&#151;came to light. They thought that that was a bad
idea and that guilty rapists and murderers should go free. They voted
against powers for the prosecution to ask for trial without jury where
there was a danger of jury tampering. They voted against extending
police powers to detain without charge&#151;from 24 to 36 hours. They

<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 906</b><br>voted against giving the prosecution a right of appeal against
terminating rulings by judges before a case is complete. They even
voted against restricting the range of evidence of an offender&#146;s
bad character that could be admitted in
court.</p><p><a name="06061538000188"><b><a name="06061538000800">Mrs.

Straw:</b> I hear the word &#147;sentencing&#148; being
parroted. The difference is that, as a result of those changes, which
we had to force through against Conservative opposition, many more
guilty criminals are being convicted and sentenced. There was no
opportunity before for the courts to convict them because of the
inadequacy of the criminal justice system that the Conservatives left.
I recall&#151;it is worth us all recalling&#151;that when the
Conservatives last had charge of the criminal justice system, police
numbers were cut and crime doubled. Under this Government, police
numbers have risen by 15,000, and according to the British crime
survey, crime has gone down on every measure. That is also the case
with recorded crime.</p><p><a name="06061538000190"><b><a name="06061538000802">Mr.

programme, barring a late flurry of criminal justice Bills. That being
the case, may I ask the Leader of the House not to bring forward the
date of the Queen&#146;s Speech and not to extend the already
over-long summer recess, but to forswear for the rest of this Session
the use of guillotine motions on Report stages of Bills, so that we can
adequately scrutinise the legislation that is before us and perhaps
make sure that some of it stands the test of
time?</p><p><a name="06061538000191">May I ask again
for a debate on nuclear power? Every time the Prime Minister opens his
mouth on the subject, it creates the need for a further debate.
Yesterday, the Prime Minister
said:</p><a name="06061538000624"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the new generation

Leader of the House agree to a debate in Government time on the plight
of Zimbabwean refugees? There are many engineers, doctors, teachers,
nurses and other people in this country whose skills could be put to
good use for our country&#146;s benefit, which would maintain those
skills for the future. There are also people&#151;including my
constituent, Ashleigh McMaster, who, outrageously, has had her
application for asylum turned down&#151;who are in limbo because they
are unable to study, work, or contribute. Owing to the languishing

some of whom I have in my constituency. His question illustrates
precisely why the asylum system is complex. There are people around the
country making similar representations about every single unfounded
asylum application. The hon. Gentleman believes that decisions about
Zimbabwe are &#147;outrageous&#148;, but others believe that
decisions about other countries, even safe countries, are outrageous,
and, like the hon. Gentleman, continue to make representation upon
representation. I understand that, but it does not lie in the hon.

order, Madam Deputy Speaker. The tenfold increase in the disregard is
the key element of the package to put right the tax credit problems
announced in the pre-Budget report last December. There has been a
great deal of controversy about the cost, which the Government have
consistently refused to give to the House and to the public. If it has
now been made available, it is a serious matter, because it could be
well over &#163;1 billion. The Paymaster General appears to have said
that it is available, but we cannot ascertain that that is definitely
the case. Will you arrange for her to come to the House today, Madam
Deputy Speaker, and make a statement to clear the matter up once and
for all?</p><p><a name="06061538000287"><b><a name="06061538000877">David

move, That the Bill be now read a Second
time.</p><p><a name="06061538000293">The Bill enables
the National Assembly to set up an independent champion for older
people. The position will be the first of its kind in the UK and,
indeed, possibly in the world. It is modelled on the highly successful
post of children&#146;s commissioner&#151;another first for Wales.
The post was a key commitment in Labour&#146;s 2003 manifesto for the
last Assembly elections, and the Bill delivers that
commitment.</p><p><a name="06061538000294">The Bill
is the latest milestone in our commitment to older people in Wales. It
will provide a platform for further progress, building on what we have
already achieved. When we took office in 1997, one in four pensioners
were living in poverty, and pensioner inequality was wider than it had
been for 30 years. That is why, for the past nine years, our No.1
priority for older people has been to tackle the scourge of pensioner
poverty.</p><p><a name="06061538000295"><b><a name="06061538000882">Albert
Owen (Ynys M&#244;n) (Lab):</b> I very much welcome the Bill
and the partnership between the National Assembly for Wales and this
Parliament. Does my right hon. Friend envisage that the
commissioner&#146;s role should include raising awareness, as many
pensioners do not apply for means-tested benefits? I accept that we are
moving away from means testing, but I am concerned that when we apply
the earnings link many of those poorer pensioners will be left behind.
Does he believe that the commissioner should assist pensioners in those
circumstances?</p><p><a name="06061538000296"><b><a name="06061538000883">Mr.
Hain:</b> Indeed I do, and my hon. Friend makes a very
important point, which is as applicable in his Ynys M&#244;n
constituency as it is in mine. A proportion of pensioners have not
taken advantage of pension credit, which has lifted literally millions
of pensioners across the UK and tens of thousands in Wales out of
poverty. Yes, the commissioner for older people could have an important
role in championing the opportunities that are available, perhaps
putting greater pressure on the bureaucracy to deliver more.</p><p><a name="06061538000297">We have also made huge strides
in reversing the terrible legacy of pensioner poverty that we inherited
from the Tory Government, lifting nearly 2 million pensioners out of
absolute poverty and 1 million out of relative poverty. As a result of
the measures that we have introduced, the average pensioner household
is &#163;1,400 a year better off than it would have been under the
Conservative Government, and the poorest pensioners are &#163;1,900 a
year better off.</p><p><a name="06061538000298">We
are now spending on pensioners &#163;10.5 billion more in real terms
than when we took office. We are spending on the minimum income
guarantee, the pension credit, the &#163;200 winter fuel payment and
increases in the basic state pension. Those are just a few 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 922</b><br>of the measures that have boosted the quality of life for hundreds of
thousands of older people right across Wales, with a massive 160,000
pensioner households receiving the pension credit and more than 460,000
households benefiting from the winter fuel
payment.</p><p><a name="06061538000299"><b><a name="06061538000884">Mr.
Philip Hollobone (Kettering) (Con):</b> Those figures do not
take account of the huge increases in council tax that many vulnerable
older people have had to pay since this Administration came to
power?</p><p><a name="06061538000300"><b><a name="06061538000885">Mr.
Hain:</b> As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, there is
generous council tax benefit for the lowest income pensioners, which
helps them to avoid the large council tax bills that they would
otherwise face. The council tax was introduced, especially in Wales,
after local government reorganisation by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
party. In my own constituency, a discriminatory settlement was imposed
on the borough of Neath Port Talbot in comparison with Swansea when the
right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) set up local government
and imposed the council tax structure on
Wales.</p><p><a name="06061538000301"><b><a name="06061538000886">Mr.
Roger Williams (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD):</b> The
Secretary of State fails to mention the &#163;200 given to pensioners
to mitigate council tax increases before the general election, which
was withdrawn the following year.</p><p><a name="06061538000302"><b><a name="06061538000887">Mr.
Hain:</b> When it was introduced, the Chancellor made it clear
that it was intended to deal with the particular problem of high
council tax bills at that time. It was welcomed and I think that the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s own party welcomed it. We have since kept
council tax rises very low, especially in Labour-controlled areas and
under Labour councils, in comparison with Conservative and, even more,
with Liberal Democrat councils, so I am surprised that the hon.
Gentleman raised that matter.</p><p><a name="06061538000303"><b><a name="06061538000888">David
Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I am
grateful to my right hon. Friend, not least because three years ago
almost to the day I introduced a private Member&#146;s Bill to set up
an older people&#146;s rights commissioner, which embraced similar
issues. Can the Secretary of State reassure me that, in promoting and
safeguarding the rights and dignity of older people and tackling
poverty in Wales, some aspects of the Bill will allow investigations
and enforcement to take place over the English border? Will it not
create anomalies unless and until we have an older persons&#146;
rights commissioner covering England as
well?</p><p><a name="06061538000304"><b><a name="06061538000889">Mr.
Hain:</b> I intend to deal with that matter later in my
speech, but I can point out to my hon. Friend that the focus of the UK
Government is on a Cabinet Sub-Committee on ageing policy, which is
chaired by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions. That is driving forward a UK-wide strategy, obviously
including England and my hon. Friend&#146;s own constituency.
Devolution allows for, as it were, a policy laboratory to take place
right across the UK and to great effect. The Children&#146;s
Commissioner 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 923</b><br>for Wales was, because of its very success, subsequently copied in
England. Likewise, policy on driving down waiting times was more
successful in England than in Wales until similar policies were adopted
in Wales. I believe that devolution has brought great benefits in that
respect.</p><p><a name="06061538000305"><b><a name="06061538000890">Mrs.
Cheryl Gillan (Chesham and Amersham) (Con):</b> The Secretary
of State forgets that Wales has been used by the Labour Government as a
laboratory because Wales had the revaluation, which badly affected
pensioners, and we have yet to have the revaluation in England. We will
take no lessons from the Secretary of State on what the Government have
done for pensioners, when those I talk to have been so badly affected
by the revaluation in Wales.</p><p><a name="06061538000306"><b><a name="06061538000891">Mr.
Hain:</b> In that case, why did the Welsh Conservatives, along
with the Liberal Democrats, support that revaluation when the Assembly
decided to conduct it? Under the new touchy-feely Conservative party,
are we not entitled at least to a bit of repentance or consistency from
the hon. Lady when she
intervenes?</p><p><a name="06061538000307">The
Government have also taken action to protect people who are let down by
the private pensions market&#151;people such as the workers at Allied
Steel and Wire in a scandalous case&#151;by setting up the Pension
Protection Fund and the pensions regulator and by increasing the
financial assistance scheme from &#163;400 million to
&#163;2.3 billion. At the Assembly, too, Labour has shown that it is
the party best placed to improve the lives of older people in Wales.
Many of the Assembly&#146;s most ground-breaking and innovative
policies have been aimed at older people, including free swimming,
health promotion, the strategy for older people and the independent
national partnership forum for older
people.</p><p><a name="06061538000308"><b><a name="06061538000892">Julie
Morgan (Cardiff, North) (Lab):</b> On the ASW case, in
welcoming the huge increase that has gone into the financial assistance
scheme, which will increase the number of ASW pensioners who benefit,
does my right hon. Friend also accept that some of my constituents,
because they started their working lives young and do not fall within
the 15 years before retirement criterion, will not benefit at all? Will
he do all he can to extend the provision to those
people?</p><p><a name="06061538000309"><b><a name="06061538000893">Mr.
Hain:</b> Indeed. The former workers of ASW and their families
are grateful to my hon. Friend for championing their interests so well.
It is a scandalous case and one of the worst examples of how the
pensions market can collapse. The abuses that followed affected some
workers who had spent all their adult working lives with the company,
in some cases leaving them with absolutely nothing. At least we have
taken an important step along the road. The fivefold increase in
available funding will mean that even more of my hon. Friend&#146;s
constituents will benefit, but I accept that some have been left high
and dry by the collapse.</p><p><a name="06061538000310"><b><a name="06061538000894">Adam
Price (Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr) (PC):</b> In the ASW
case, the Government completely disregarded the conclusions and
recommendations of the independent parliamentary ombudsman. What 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 924</b><br>guarantee do older people in Wales have that the UK Government will not
show equal disregard for the recommendations of the commissioner for
older
people?</p><p><a name="06061538000311"><b><a name="06061538000895">Mr.
Hain:</b> We would not set up the commissioner for older
people only to take no notice, would we? I am sure that the hon.
Gentleman will welcome our proposal with his characteristic generosity.
I acknowledge, to be fair, that his party has supported it in
principle. Indeed, as I shall argue later, there is all-party support
for the Bill. I believe that the Government deserve credit for
introducing the fund and for providing &#163;2.3 billion. I agree
that ASW workers were treated scandalously, but at least we are the
first Government to try to provide some assistance where we
can.</p><p><a name="06061538000312"><b><a name="06061538000896">Mr.
David Evennett (Bexleyheath and Crayford) (Con):</b> I am
listening with great interest to the Secretary of State&#146;s speech
and Conservative Members support the measure. He has concentrated on
pensioners, but the Bill refers to a commissioner for older people. How
does he define older people? At what age do people become old? Surely
that is an important issue.</p><p><a name="06061538000313"><b><a name="06061538000897">Mr.
Hain:</b> Of course it is. If the hon. Gentleman had taken the
trouble to inquire into the Bill, he would know that the age of 60 is
the one that
applies.</p><p><a name="06061538000314">Just like the
Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales, many of the policies that I
have been explaining have blazed a trail right across the United
Kingdom. Policies such as free bus travel for older people that were
pioneered in Wales are now being copied in England. The recent pensions
White Paper, published last month, shows that only Labour is capable of
helping older people to respond to the challenges of the
future.</p><p><a name="06061538000315">We live in an
ageing society. By 2050, the number of pensioners will have risen by 50
per cent. At the same time, as many as 12 million people are failing to
save enough to guarantee a decent income in retirement. Unless we take
action now and plan for the long term, millions of people face an
uncertain future. That is why we are building a national consensus
around pension reform, and the Bill is part of that. For example, our
recent White Paper includes a number of important, far-sighted
proposals to help us to meet the pensions challenge and provide for
tomorrow&#146;s pensioners, as well as
today&#146;s.</p><p><a name="06061538000316">A new
national savings scheme with compulsory contributions from employers
and auto-enrolment for employees will boost savings rates for the
future. A higher, fairer state pension re-linked to earnings&#151;the
earnings link was broken by the Conservatives&#151;will provide a
foundation for further saving. A higher retirement age will help us to
meet the challenge of an ageing society, and the least well-off will
continue to be helped by a guarantee credit linked to
earnings.</p><p><a name="06061538000317"><b><a name="06061538000898">Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I understood that the Bill related to establishing
a commissioner for older people and devolved matters. Is the Secretary
of State now telling us that he is planning to devolve pensions to the
Welsh 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 925</b><br>Assembly? Obviously, if he is making such a fuss about the
Government&#146;s pensions arrangements, they must be passing them to
down to the Assembly, because they have nothing to do with the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06061538000318"><b><a name="06061538000899">Mr.
Hain:</b> Dream on. The pensioners of Wales will benefit from
this pioneering Bill&#151;probably one of the first such Bills in the
world&#151;and I am setting the context for this very important
initiative. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The hon. Lady finds it
embarrassing to have to listen to the incredible record of success of
our Labour Government in protecting our senior citizens and lifting
millions out of poverty. She does not like to recognise that, bearing
mind the miserable record that she was part of under the Conservative
Government. Against that backdrop, however, in the way that I have been
describing it patiently and
carefully&#151;</p><p><a name="06061538000319"><b><a name="06061538000900">Mrs.

way?</p><p><a name="06061538000320"><b><a name="06061538000901">Mr.

itself.</p><p><a name="06061538000321"><b><a name="06061538000902">Julie
Morgan:</b> I thank my right hon. Friend for giving way, while
he is still considering the Bill&#146;s background. Does he agree
that the Government are the first Government to recognise the problem
of poverty for women in old age? Does he not applaud the
Government&#146;s proposals that will lift so many women out of
poverty?</p><p><a name="06061538000322"><b><a name="06061538000903">Mr.

of women have been discriminated against in not being able to get the
full basic retirement entitlement that men have is now being addressed
under our new
policy.</p><p><a name="06061538000323"><b><a name="06061538000904">Mrs.

opportunity to do so when he returns to the Dispatch Box. He does me an
injustice because I am very happy to listen to an older worker telling
me what he is planning to do from the other side of the Dispatch Box. I
should just like to remind him that when I was a very junior Minister,
I had responsibility for older workers and introduced a campaign to get
older people back into work and to try to stop discrimination against
older workers, so at least I have a proud record of dealing with that
problem&#151;not a record that the right hon. Gentleman probably ever
wants to admit to.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 926</b><br><p><a name="06061538000328"><b><a name="06061538000909">Madam
Deputy Speaker (Sylvia Heal):</b> Order. I remind all hon.
Members that we are discussing a Bill that relates to
Wales.</p><p><a name="06061538000329"><b><a name="06061538000910">Mr.
Hain:</b> I thought, Madam Deputy Speaker, that you were going
to remind all Members that there is a World cup match coming up; but to
respond specifically to the hon. Lady&#146;s rather graceless jibe, I
will, of course, be supporting England with enthusiasm. I am flying an
England flag, not out of my house in Wales, but out of my flat in
London. Of course several Chelsea players are playing for the England
team, and I will be watching them with enthusiasm if she allows me to
do so and if hon. Members are co-operative on this matter. Of course
the match starts at 5 pm&#151;I just remind the
House.</p><p><a name="06061538000330">By the way, I
acknowledge the hon. Lady&#146;s contribution; it is just a shame
that the rest of the pension support was so terrible and that so many
pensioners in Wales were plunged into poverty. If we ever have to face
the iniquity of a Conservative Government again in decades to come, let
us hope that we have an older person&#146;s commissioner who can
fight against the merciless assault on pensioners&#146; rights that
the Conservatives will doubtless be responsible for in the future, as
they were in the
past.</p><p><a name="06061538000331"><b><a name="06061538000911">Mr.
Roger Williams:</b> Surely the Secretary of State highlights
the weaknesses of the Bill? The commissioner&#146;s proposed powers
will not allow that person to speak directly to Westminster Ministers
on issues such as pensions, which are so important to the elderly in
Wales. Our noble Friends tried to put that weakness right in the other
place, and we will try to put it right in the
House.</p><p><a name="06061538000332"><b><a name="06061538000912">Mr.
Hain:</b> I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is not
recognising the devolution settlement. The devolution
settlement&#151;for which the people of Wales voted, albeit narrowly,
in a referendum in which he and I were on the same side in campaigning
for a yes vote&#151;did not include the devolution of pensions. Of
course it did not. Nor did it include tax and social security policy
and a lot of other things. Therefore, it would be entirely wrong to
give the older person&#146;s commissioner for Wales powers and duties
in respect of non-devolved
matters</p><p><a name="06061538000333">Equally,
however, the commissioner will be able to make representations to me,
as the Secretary of State, or to the hon. Gentleman, as a local Member
of Parliament, and Westminster Members and Ministers can take up those
matters. For example, if a patient is placed by a Welsh commissioning
authority&#151;a local council or health authority&#151;across the
border in an old persons&#146; home or perhaps a hospital and
complaints arise, the older person&#146;s commissioner will also be
able to make representations to the Welsh commissioning body for it to
take up with the provider across the border in England. It is
interesting that the children&#146;s commissioner for England and the
Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales have worked out satisfactory
co-operation arrangements, and all those sorts of things will be
possible in future, on a common-sense
basis.</p>

Wales&#151;of course I have; I am a Welsh Member of Parliament, like
the hon. Gentleman&#151;and of course he can write to me, as the
Secretary of State, although he has no formal power to make
representations. It is important that we do not undermine the
devolution settlement and that we recognise that common-sense
arrangements apply. I can assure the House that, if the commissioner
identifies concerns about pensioner poverty in Wales, he or she will be
able to take action to fight for older people&#146;s rights and to
fight their corner with the
Government.</p><p><a name="06061538000336">Against
that backdrop of Labour achievement and forward thinking, the proposals
for a commissioner for older people should be seen, and by establishing
a commissioner, Welsh Labour is, once again, leading the way in
responding to the challenges that face older people. Over the next 20
years, the concentration of older people in Wales will increase, with
over-60s forming nearly one third of the population. Over the same
period, the number of people aged 85 and over will increase by a third.
Changing family living patterns, fewer children and the increasing
number of single people will also change the shape of our society in
Wales.</p><p><a name="06061538000337"><b><a name="06061538000915">Mrs.
Betty Williams (Conwy) (Lab):</b> My right hon. Friend may be
aware that the UK charity Counsel and Care has expressed concern that
the Government&#146;s social exclusion agenda fails to address the
needs of the elderly. I understand what the commissioner&#146;s role
will be, as far as we know it before we debate it today, but will my
right hon. Friend ensure that the role specifically includes assessing
the needs of the elderly and banishing their social exclusion where it
occurs? I appreciate that the charity is UK-based and is speaking on
behalf of all UK senior citizens, but will he take the advantage of the
Bill to ensure that the commissioner has that role in
Wales?</p><p><a name="06061538000338"><b><a name="06061538000916">Mr.
Hain:</b> Indeed. The commissioner will certainly be able to
take into account that important agenda and any issues that my hon.
Friend might raise with the commissioner on behalf of her constituents,
or that that charity might raise in respect of Welsh pensioners, and
the wider
implications.</p><p><a name="06061538000339">The
demographic changes that I have described mean we must adapt our ways
of working to engage older people fully and plan for the significant
social and other changes that we face. At present, many older people in
Wales are unable to live the lives that they want or deserve because
they feel marginalised and discriminated against, with too many
barriers preventing them from making a full contribution. Those
barriers prevent older people from using their knowledge and skills for
the benefit of our economy and everyone in our
society.</p><p><a name="06061538000340">It is
therefore essential that we enable older people to play the fullest
possible role by establishing an 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 928</b><br>independent champion for all older people in Wales. Furthermore, older
people are as diverse as any other group in our society, with the needs
of one varying widely from the needs of another. The vital role that
older people play therefore needs to encompass a wide range of issues,
from employment, housing, and transport, to education and sport, as
well as health, social services, pensions and long-term
care.</p><p><a name="06061538000341">Here again, the
commissioner will have a vital role to play, ensuring that our public
services are able to provide the best possible service to all older
people, helping them live as full a life as possible and making sure
that they have access to all the resources they need.
</p><p><a name="06061538000342">Older people today
are more likely to be healthy, to be working, to be better off, and to
be contributing to society as a volunteer, school governor or carer,
for example. Nevertheless, there are still many older people who suffer
ill health, poor housing, lack of access to services or some other
disadvantage. That is particularly true in Wales, with our industrial
heritage, our significant rural population, and our greater number of
older people, compared with the rest of the United Kingdom. A
commissioner will be a powerful advocate for those people in Wales,
ensuring that their voices are
heard.</p><p><a name="06061538000343">The idea for a
commissioner was one of the recommendations of the advisory group on a
strategy for older people in Wales. The idea was then translated into a
firm commitment to establish a commissioner, made in the Welsh Labour
manifesto for the 2003 Assembly elections. An advisory group
subsequently chaired by the Assembly Deputy Minister with
responsibility for older people, John Griffiths, and involving key
stakeholders, older people and experts from across Wales, produced a
report on the role and responsibilities of a commissioner. That was
published for public consultation in May 2004 and contained 17
recommendations.</p><p><a name="06061538000344">The
responses to the consultation showed that respondents were
overwhelmingly in favour of the concept of an independent commissioner
and the functions proposed for the office. Help the Aged said that the
establishment of a commissioner for older people</p><a name="06061538000627"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will place Wales at the forefront
of achieving equality and justice for older
people&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061538000345">and</p><a name="06061538000628"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will
aid the good practice across sectors by engendering a culture of
equality and dignity for older
people&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06061538000346">The
Bill has already been the subject of consideration in the other place.
As a result, it has benefited from a number of amendments that clarify
and strengthen the powers of the commissioner. Important changes have
been made to enable the commissioner to work jointly with other
commissioners and ombudsmen and to establish an internal complaints
procedure.</p><p><a name="06061538000347">My hon.
Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales gave evidence to the
Welsh Affairs Committee on the draft Bill last year, and it was also
considered by the Health and Social Services Committee of the Assembly.
Although its members raised a small number of issues for further
consideration, the Assembly Committee was generally supportive of the
Bill and its provisions.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 929</b><br><p><a name="06061538000348">The Bill proposes the
establishment of a commissioner who will be independent of Government
and of the Assembly, and who will be able to speak on behalf of older
people in Wales, helping to raise their profile and increase awareness
of their needs. The Bill is firmly based on the model of the
Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales and provides for a
commissioner for older people with a similar set of
powers.</p><p><a name="06061538000349">The
commissioner will be able to review the effect on older people in Wales
of the discharge, or proposed discharge, of functions of public bodies,
such as the Assembly, local authorities, local health boards, NHS
trusts and further or higher education organisations in Wales. That
will ensure that the work of public bodies has a positive impact on,
and takes full account of, the needs of older people. For example,
where the commissioner suspects the occurrence of elder abuse, as well
as working with the police and local authorities, the commissioner will
also be able to review the way a local authority has implemented its
policies and procedures for dealing with abuse, and to make
recommendations for the
future.</p><p><a name="06061538000350">Today is world
elder abuse awareness day, and I am proud that we are able, through
this debate, to send a very clear message that elder abuse, wherever
and however it occurs, is indefensible and unacceptable. The
commissioner will have an important role in projecting this message and
improving existing
protection.</p><p><a name="06061538000351">The Bill
also gives the commissioner a power to help to ensure that
organisations that provide certain services to older people have
arrangements for whistle-blowing and complaints that safeguard and
promote the interests of older people. The commissioner will also have
the power to check up on advocacy services provided in
Wales.</p><p><a name="06061538000352">Another
important element of the Bill is the power that it gives to the
Assembly to enable the commissioner to examine individual cases and to
require information, explanations or assistance from persons about the
case&#151;powers equivalent to those of the High Court. That will
enable the commissioner to help individuals experiencing service
failure to gather the evidence they need to press for charges or to
press for change.</p><p><a name="06061538000353">The
Bill also enables the commissioner to work jointly with other
commissioners and ombudsmen where they may both be entitled to examine
individual cases. That will prevent duplication and ensure a joined-up
approach to any examination. At present, the power extends to the
public services ombudsman for Wales, and there is provision for the
Assembly by order to apply it to other commissioners and ombudsmen in
the future. For example, the Assembly might want to add the Commission
for Equality and Human Rights. That would then clarify on the face of
the Bill the powers of the commissioners to act together, to share
information and to prepare joint reports. Furthermore, we envisage that
the working relationship between the commissioner and those other
commissioners and ombudsmen will be formalised by a memorandum of
understanding.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 930</b><br><p><a name="06061538000354">Other powers in the Bill include
the discretion to assist an individual in making a complaint or
representation, to undertake research or educational activities, to
issue guidance on best practice and to make reports to the Assembly on
the exercise of the commissioner&#146;s
functions.</p><p><a name="06061538000355">The Bill
also provides for the commissioner to consider and make representations
to the Assembly about any matter&#151;this was the point raised by
the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam
Price)&#151;relating to the interests of older people in Wales. This
will allow the commissioner to raise non-devolved issues relating to
the interests of older people with the Assembly, which could then take
them up with the UK Government. In fact, Assembly Ministers and the
Under-Secretary have already corresponded on the matter and we are
committed to ensuring that the process of responding to representations
made by the commissioner works as effectively and efficiently as
possible and in a common-sense way, as the children&#146;s
commissioner has
pioneered.</p><p><a name="06061538000356">In
addition, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I will invite the
commissioner to approach us, as UK Ministers responsible for Wales,
about any non-devolved matter affecting older people in Wales, just as
we have done in the case of the children&#146;s commissioner&#151;a
point also raised by the hon. Gentleman. However, it is important to
note that the commissioner will not be able to exercise his or her
functions directly in relation to non-devolved issues. Those matters
are properly the responsibility of the UK Government and it would not
be appropriate for a commissioner established by the Assembly and for
Wales to have such a remit. The provisions of the Bill therefore
preserve these clear lines of democratic accountability. That is
important.</p><p><a name="06061538000357">The
geography of Wales means that issues affecting older people often cross
local authority boundaries, as we have heard, and sometimes national
boundaries, too. We have paid particular attention to ensuring that the
commissioner is able to assist an older person in Wales with issues
that cross the border&#151;for example, the commissioning of care
services in England by Welsh local
authorities.</p><p><a name="06061538000358">The Bill
defines an older person as someone aged 60 or over. That includes
people who are entitled to receive winter fuel and pension credit
benefits, women aged 60 receiving the state pension, and those covered
by the Assembly&#146;s free swimming and bus pass schemes, which also
start at 60. This age limit strikes exactly the right balance. If it
were any lower&#151;there were demands for that&#151;it would have
significant implications for the commissioner&#146;s potential work
load. If it were any higher it would miss an important and growing
section of older people. By setting the limit at 60, we will ensure
that the commissioner is able to play the most effective role possible
in championing the interests of older
people.</p><p><a name="06061538000359">This important
Bill has attracted a good deal of support in Wales from older people
and their representatives and all the parties in the National Assembly.
I hope that it will receive a similar degree of support on both sides
of the House today in the 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 931</b><br>interests of not only senior citizens in Wales, but hon. Members who
want to watch England win their World cup match at 5
o&#146;clock.</p><p><a name="06061538000360">The
commissioner will provide a vital step forward in addressing ageism and
discrimination against older people. The Bill provides the necessary
powers to enable the commissioner to play an effective role in turning
the tide against such attitudes, and it will improve the quality of
life for many older people. It will deliver a real champion for the
rights and interests of Welsh senior citizens, to whom Wales owes so
much, and I commend it to the
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061538000666">1
pm</h5><p><a name="06061538000361"><b><a name="06061538000917">Mrs.
Cheryl Gillan (Chesham and Amersham) (Con):</b> I am grateful
to the Secretary of State for taking the House through the details of
the Bill&#151;never before have I seen a man so desperate to escape
from the Dispatch Box to get to the television
box!</p><p><a name="06061538000362">I commend the
Government&#146;s choice of date, because this is international elder
abuse day, which is apposite. International elder abuse day is being
marked by the Conservative party in Wales&#151;the leader of the
Conservative group in the Assembly, Nick Bourne, is going to county
hall in Monmouthshire with our older people&#146;s champion, Nick
Ramsay, who, at age 31, is a fine example of a young man who is taking
on the responsibilities and concerns of older people in our
community.</p><p><a name="06061538000363">I am
delighted to be joined on the Front Bench by my hon. Friend the Member
for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones) who will make the winding-up speech, and I
hope that the House will give him a warm welcome. I apologise to the
House, because I shall be leaving before the winding-up speeches. I
have informed the Secretary of State about the situation, which depends
not on a football match but a train time&#151;I do not have the
advantage of a chauffeur-driven car to take me to Wales, so I must rely
on the excellent train service this
afternoon.</p><p><a name="06061538000364">I broadly
welcome the Bill, but there are points of detail that it will be
helpful to explore in Committee. The Bill has already been subject to
detailed scrutiny in another place, and I want to place on record
Conservative Members&#146; gratitude for the sterling work of my
noble Friend Lord Roberts of Conwy. In another place, he intimated that
he has a vested interest in the creation of a commissioner for older
people, but, notwithstanding that personal interest, I hope that he
remains a champion of Welsh people, young and old, for many years to
come.</p><p><a name="06061538000365">Regrettably, I
need to inject a note of disharmony into proceedings. I cannot help
contrasting the proper scrutiny that this Bill, which has widespread
support, is receiving with what will happen to future legislation for
Wales. If the Secretary of State gets his way, this Bill is likely to
be the last of its kind, because the procedures set out in part 3 of
the Government of Wales Bill will reduce scrutiny in this House to a
one and a half hour debate on a Order in Council, which we will simply
be invited to rubber-stamp. Although future provisions may be more
complex and controversial than this Bill, they will receive less
scrutiny on the Floor of the House here in Westminster. As the
Secretary of State is all too aware, the House will return to that
issue shortly.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 932</b><br><p><a name="06061538000366">The Bill is relatively
non-contentious. The proposal to appoint a commissioner for older
people, the first anywhere in the United Kingdom, has attracted
widespread support. I have read many of the contributions that have
been sent in during the passage of the legislation, and it is good to
see the level of support right across the board. Indeed, the idea is so
good that I do not understand why the Government are not applying it
uniformly across the United Kingdom, because the commissioner will not
have the ability to scrutinise matters that are not delegated. Some
probing will therefore be necessary in Committee to explore the
Government&#146;s thinking and the reasons for not covering, for
example, the whole of England and
Wales.</p><p><a name="06061538000367"><b><a name="06061538000918">Mr.
Hain:</b> I have mentioned common-sense arrangements. The
Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales already has informal relations
with the police and the Prison Service, although those functions are
not devolved, and I foresee similar opportunities for the commissioner
for older people to do the job that they want to do in the way in which
they want to do it. However, it would not be right to include
non-devolved matters within the remit of the commissioner for older
people in Wales.</p><p><a name="06061538000368"><b><a name="06061538000919">Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I understand that point, which prompts the
question why there will not be a commissioner for England and Wales,
because someone who lives 2 yd across the border in England will not
have the same protection as their neighbour. I appreciate that the
matter concerns devolution, but devolution does not have to act to the
detriment of people on one side of the border. It would be interesting
to know why the appointment of a commissioner for England was not
considered.</p><p><a name="06061538000369"><b><a name="06061538000920">Mr.
Hain:</b> This is one of many pioneering bright ideas from
Wales and from Welsh Labour. Who knows what might happen in the future,
because the children&#146;s commissioner, which was another bright
idea from Welsh Labour, was transposed across the border to England?
The Conservative party has not been an enthusiastic advocate of
devolution, but we need to adopt a common-sense
approach.</p><p><a name="06061538000370"><b><a name="06061538000921">Mrs.
Gillan:</b> Methinks that I have given the Secretary of State
an opportunity to make a little party political broadcast, which was
not my intention. Many of the organisations that have contributed to
the thinking behind the Bill would resent the Labour
label.</p><p><a name="06061538000371">Conservative
Members would normally look sceptically at a proposal to establish yet
another commissioner&#151;there is a commissioner for everything
these days. In this instance, however, I shall leave aside my natural
scepticism, because it is possible to make a convincing case for this
commissioner. As the Secretary of State has said, Wales has a growing
proportion of older people compared with other parts of the United
Kingdom. Currently, just more than 22 per cent. of the population of
Wales&#151;about 600,000 people&#151;is aged over 60 compared with
20 per cent. of the population in the United Kingdom as a whole, and
more than17 per cent. of the Welsh population is aged over 64
compared with just under 16 per cent. of the UK 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 933</b><br>population. Looking ahead, demographic changes in the next 20 years are
expected significantly to alter the balance of the population, with the
proportion of people aged 60 or over expected to reach 28 per
cent.</p><p><a name="06061538000372">According to
research carried out for the Welsh Assembly Government, 430,000
households in Wales&#151;one in three&#151;will include someone
aged 65 or older by 2017. In the same year, nearly 150,000 households
will be headed by a person aged 75 or older, and about 50,000
households will be headed by a person aged 85 or older, which would be
an increase of 56 per cent. on current
figures.</p><p><a name="06061538000373"><b><a name="06061538000922">Mr.
Hollobone:</b> One significant point about those figures is
that if the United Kingdom as a whole contained the same proportion of
older people, there would be another 900,000 older people in the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06061538000374"><b><a name="06061538000923">Mrs.
Gillan:</b> That point is valid. The Government should be
thinking about how they will cope with the pensioner households in
England as well as in Wales. They should be thinking outside the box
and not only inside the
territory.</p><p><a name="06061538000375">Many people
in Wales aged 50 and over suffer from problems associated with poor
housing, poor nutrition, lack of opportunity for employment, and
inadequate transport services. I know from personal experience as a
junior Minister in the last Conservative Administration that age
discrimination in employment is often rife, especially when someone has
been made redundant in their 40s or 50s. Older people also suffer from
being denied pay rises or proper training opportunities on account of
their age. Several organisations&#151;Action on Elder Abuse, Help the
Aged, Age Concern, the British Institute of Human Rights, and public
bodies such as the Commission for Health Improvement&#151;have cited
examples of older people&#146;s basic rights being
violated.</p><p><a name="06061538000376"><b><a name="06061538000924">Angela
Watkinson (Upminster) (Con):</b> What relationship does my
hon. Friend predict that the new commissioner will have with the
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which recently
decided not to approve quality of life improving drugs for people
suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer&#146;s disease?
Increasing numbers of people are in need of those drugs, which also
benefit their carers. People often suffer for many years because
although their general health is good, those particular drugs have not
been approved by NICE. Does my hon. Friend foresee that the
commissioner will continue the campaign to try to get them
approved?</p><p><a name="06061538000377"><b><a name="06061538000925">Mrs.
Gillan:</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. It will
be interesting to see exactly what the commissioner can achieve over
and above Members of Parliament and Ministers, and other
representatives of older people. We shall be expecting rather a lot of
this commissioner, and I am afraid that they will be expected to
deliver. There is a very strong feeling, no matter where one&#146;s
constituency is, that there is discrimination against older people in
terms of the way 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 934</b><br>in which drugs are approved for handing out and the demands made on the
health service. It will be interesting to hear what the Minister has to
say when we probe these issues further during the passage of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06061538000378">Because of the
problems that older people have experienced and reported over the
years, and because many of them are reluctant to complain about bad
service or poor treatment, several organisations have argued for a
dedicated commissioner who can stand up to defend and enforce older
people&#146;s rights and promote age equality in service provision
across the board. However, we should be under no illusions, and we
certainly should not try to kid the people of Wales into believing that
the commissioner will be a panacea for every problem faced by older
people. Several people have rightly argued that the commissioner will
be no substitute for improvements such as a better basic state pension
or improved personal care. Indeed, when the Bill was published, Help
the Aged warned
that</p><a name="06061538000629"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;pensions reform and
an end to means-tested pensions would do more to improve the lives of
pensioner
households&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06061538000379">Nor will the
commissioner do much to alleviate the swingeing 94 per cent.&#151;or
&#163;467&#151;increase in band D council tax that has hammered
many older people in Wales, or to sort out the chronic problems of the
health service in Wales, where older people are reckoned to account for
about 60 per cent. of spending. Moreover, legislation alone will not
eradicate discrimination overnight. That requires a change of
attitudes, which will, unfortunately, take time. However, anything that
the newly appointed commissioner can do to speed up the process will be
welcome.</p><p><a name="06061538000380">The
Secretary of State outlined the various stages through which the Bill
has passed, but rather than dwell on those I want to touch on some of
the issues that arose as it made its way through the other place and
which we may wish to explore in Committee. I am still not entirely
clear about the precise role that the Government envisage for the
commissioner or what is the primary function of that office. Is the
commissioner a kind of Ofwat or Ofcom for the elderly, or something
more? I am interested in what the Secretary of State said about the
practical and common-sense operation of the system. How does he
envisage that working?</p><p><a name="06061538000381">The Government call the
commissioner an &#147;independent champion&#148; of older people
and have given him a wide range of quasi-judicial powers. For example,
clause 13 provides him with sweeping powers of entry, while clauses 9
and 11 confer on him, in carrying out some of his duties, the same
powers as the High Court. In other words, in certain cases he, or she,
may have the power to act as investigator, judge and jury. We will want
to examine the circumstances in which those powers are to be exercised,
as well as the extent of the envisaged operations of the
commissioner&#146;s staff. Another of the commissioner&#146;s
principal functions will be to make representations to the National
Assembly on matters affecting the interests of older
people&#151;almost, in effect, usurping at worst, or duplicating at
best, the role of Ministers. We will seek clarification on those areas
and on the way in which the commissioner and his staff will work with,
or across, the Welsh Assembly Government, the Welsh Assembly and other
organisations.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 935</b><br><p><a name="06061538000382">The Bill predates by some months
the publication of the Government of Wales Bill, which formally ends
the corporate Assembly and establishes the executive and legislative
functions by establishing a Welsh Assembly Government as a distinctive
entity. Does the Secretary of State envisage that the
commissioner&#146;s main representations will be made to the relevant
Minister in the Assembly Government or to the Assembly itself, and how
will that relationship
work?</p><p><a name="06061538000383">Finance is
another matter of concern. The office of the commissioner will be
funded by the National Assembly out of money that has already been
allocated to it under the block grant from Westminster. Start-up costs
are estimated at &#163;500,000, with annual running costs for the
commissioner and a predicted staff of about 30 estimated at &#163;1.5
million. We will want to know exactly what limits will be placed on
that expenditure, how the office will operate, and what limits will be
placed on the number of staff that the commissioner can employ. What
discussions have been held with the First Minister and Members of the
Welsh Assembly Government to establish where the money to run this
operation will come from, and which areas of expenditure in Wales will
be cut or sacrificed in order to find it? What could have been done
with that money if it had been spent directly on older people and their
needs? What other Departments in the Assembly will make cuts in their
services to the elderly to pay for the new operation? Will they face
some reductions in order to accommodate the large amount of money that
has to be found in the budget for the
commissioner?</p><p><a name="06061538000384">We
believe that the commissioner should be independent and should make
representations about the effectiveness of the operations of the Welsh
Assembly Government and Ministers. But how can that happen if he is
funded directly by the same Welsh Ministers upon whose performance he
will be delivering a critical analysis? That is the scenario as a
consequence of schedule 1 of the Bill and schedule 11 of the Government
of Wales Bill. Responsibility for funding the commissioner will be
transferred from the Assembly to Welsh Ministers, as it will in respect
of the children&#146;s commissioner. As my noble Friend Baroness
Noakes pointed out in the other place, the result is that in future the
commissioner&#146;s funding is to be transferred to the very people
from whom they are supposed to be independent. I am sure the Secretary
of State will agree that that is illogical and undermines the
Government&#146;s argument that the commissioner will be an
&#147;independent champion&#148; of older people. We should explore
that in Committee.</p><p><a name="06061538000385">It
is particularly relevant to repeat that the work of the commissioner
will not act as a panacea given that under clause 2 the
commissioner&#146;s powers to make representations on behalf of older
people will, as the Secretary of State confirmed, be confined to
matters that are devolved to the National Assembly. He must be aware
that a great many of the issues that affect older people in Wales will
still be decided here in Westminster&#151;pensions and benefits being
two obvious examples. In addition, the limitation on the
commissioner&#146;s exercise of powers to devolved areas only is
unrealistic as, in the words of my noble Friend Lord Roberts,</p><a name="06061538000630"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Individual cases do
not...fall neatly into devolved or non-devolved

experience of political life in Wales, both as a long-serving Member of
this House and as a Minister.</p><p><a name="06061538000387">Rather than simply making
representations to the Assembly, which will then decide what, if any,
action to take, would not it make sense to adopt a more pragmatic
approach? I sense that the Secretary of State is considering that.
Could not we amend the Bill so that, in some circumstances, the
commissioner could have direct access to the relevant Secretary of
State if he or she deems it necessary? I hope such an amendment will be
considered in Committee without the Government appearing to lose face.
We hope that we can work together constructively to get the measure
right before it reaches the statute
book.</p><p><a name="06061538000388"><b><a name="06061538000926">Mr.
Hain:</b> Perhaps I can help the hon. Lady. It is important
that we do not blur channels of accountability. The commissioner is
appointed by the Welsh Assembly Government through the normal,
independent Nolan-type procedures. He or she is not a puppet of that
Government but an independent figure, as the hon. Lady acknowledged.
However, one cannot serve and be accountable to two
authorities&#151;the United Kingdom Government and the Welsh
Assembly&#151;at the same time. However, as I said, that has not been
a problem for the children&#146;s commissioner and it will not be a
problem for the commissioner for older people in championing the rights
of senior
citizens.</p><p><a name="06061538000389"><b><a name="06061538000927">Mrs.
Gillan:</b> I appreciate that intervention. However, we need
to examine that independence carefully, especially when we consider
schedule 1(3)(3), which provides for amounts to be payable at the
Assembly&#146;s discretion. We need to explore details, perhaps to
satisfy my understanding rather than to be dogmatic about anything. I
still maintain that access to the relevant Secretary of State would not
blur lines of communication but deal holistically with pensioners and
senior citizens in Wales because older people in Wales come under two
regimes. We need to have a debate about that in
Committee.</p>

Hollobone:</b> Those of us with some limited experience of
local government know that the trend is increasingly to provide a
one-stop-shop service for our constituents. In Kettering, anyone who
wants to complain about the county council goes to the borough council
offices and there is an agreement between the authorities that the
complaint will be taken up. People in Wales will become confused and
disappointed if the commissioner cannot advance their
cause.</p><p><a name="06061538000391"><b><a name="06061538000929">Mrs.
Gillan:</b> My hon. Friend is right that there is a danger of
that. There is a question about points of access to the system for
individual citizens. It appears as though there may still be an
opportunity for confusion and the role is not as cohesive as we
envisaged when we first considered the matter. The devil is in the
detail and the Government must have the opportunity to assure us that
what we fear is not the case or show us that there will be a cohesive
point of entry into the system for older people rather than the divided
one that an initial reading of the Bill suggests.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 937</b><br><p><a name="06061538000392">The Secretary of State mentioned
that, under the Bill as drafted, an older person is defined as someone
who is 60 or older. When reading the valuable contributions that such a
wide variety of organisations made to the consultation process, it is
clear that many people wanted the age limit to be reconsidered. I
appreciate that there was not general agreement and that proposals
ranged from 50 years of age to 55, 60 and 65. However, many problems
that face older people, especially discrimination in employment, occur
at a younger age than 60.</p><p><a name="06061538000393">The Government&#146;s
consultation document, &#147;Opportunity Age: Meeting the challenges
of ageing in the 21st century&#148;, referred to several problems
that face people over 50. They have not changed since the time when I
dealt with such issues. In Committee in the Lords, my noble Friend Lord
Roberts called for the definition of an older person to be reduced to
50. The Government responded by saying that that would automatically
extend the commissioner&#146;s remit from approximately 600,000
people to more than 1 million. Ministers in the other place also argued
that 60 is the age at which people become entitled to numerous
benefits, such as winter fuel payments and, in the case of
women&#151;for now at least&#151;the state pension.</p><p><a name="06061538000394">Again, I wonder whether there
is not some case for flexibility by enabling the commissioner to take
action to help those over 50 when he or she deems it appropriate. I
hope that the Government will take a pragmatic approach so that we can
explore whether the age limit in some instances could be loosened
instead of sticking rigidly to an age limit of 60.</p><p><a name="06061538000395">The Bill is welcome but it is
something of a vehicle for Ministers&#146; party political broadcasts
so that, at the next Assembly elections, they can say, &#147;Look at
what we've done for older people in Wales&#151;we&#146;ve given you
a
commissioner.&#148;</p><p><a name="06061538000396"><b><a name="06061538000930">Chris

as I told him when he asked my age behind the Chair earlier.</p><p><a name="06061538000400">Despite the Government&#146;s
best intentions, older people in Wales will face the same problems and
the Bill will not address, let alone, resolve many of them. Many
problems have been created by a Labour regime in Wales that has been
unable to bring itself to embark on the reforms necessary to deliver
the improved public services on which so many disadvantaged and
vulnerable people depend.</p><p><a name="06061538000401">Although the measure has a
great deal of merit, it should not pass through the House without
detailed scrutiny. I want to ensure that the establishment of a
commissioner for older people in Wales does not 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 938</b><br>replace the work of Assembly Members or Ministers in this House or the
Assembly. I hope that we can produce a good Bill that will, in turn,
establish something beneficial for older people in
Wales.</p><p><a name="06061538000402">The Bill is not
perfect and requires more work. However, with that proviso, I am
pleased to wish it well. The Secretary of State and all hon. Members
who are looking forward to the football match will be happy to know
that I have no intention of opposing Second
Reading.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061538000667">1.27

Griffith (Llanelli) (Lab):</b> Thank you, Madam Deputy
Speaker, for allowing me to speak in the important debate on
establishing a commissioner for older people in Wales, and especially
for letting me do so early, because I need to resume my duties in
Committee this
afternoon.</p><p><a name="06061538000404">I am sure
that we are all aware of the way in which older people make an
extremely valuable contribution to our communities. Many older people
provide support for their sons and daughters, many help with the
grandchildren and many are carers for their parents or other elderly
relatives. Many help to fill the skills gap by continuing to work.
Older people are the backbone of many of our voluntary organisations
and cultural groups.</p><p><a name="06061538000405">When I go to
any groups of pensioners or retired people, I always find that we have
a lively debate, which covers a range of issues. When older people get
into campaigning mode, they can be a formidable force and will not take
no for an answer. Recently, users of St. Paul&#146;s day
centre in my constituency got wind of the fact that the county council
was considering the possibility of closing it. They immediately set to
work, organising a petition, enlisting the support of local
councillors, Catherine Thomas&#151;the local Assembly
Member&#151;and me. They organised a coach so that the day centre
users could go to lobby councillors at county hall and arranged to
address the full council. I was proud to be there with them and proud
to be sitting by Mary Williams when she gave a speech, which was well
argued and came straight from the heart. It could not have failed to
move every councillor there. The result was that a decision was taken
to keep the centre open five days a week.</p><p><a name="06061538000406">Things do not always work out
so well, however. Older people do encounter difficulties, come up
against discrimination and get pushed to the bottom of the pile. That
is why it is so important that we establish a commissioner for older
people who will, among other things, scrutinise public services and
public bodies in Wales to ensure that they are discharging their
functions properly in relation to older people, and who will provide
help to older people when they make complaints against the health
service or a local authority in Wales. The commissioner should also
issue best practice guidance to the public bodies and public services
in Wales, to help to promote and safeguard the interests of older
people. It is for those reasons that I am pleased to support the Bill,
which represents a significant step forward in implementing our
manifesto commitment to security and dignity for all in old
age.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061538000668">1.30

Roger Williams (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD):</b> Welsh
Liberal Democrats also welcome the Bill and 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 939</b><br>will not oppose its Second Reading. However, we shall raise a number of
points in Committee because we believe that the Bill could be
strengthened to protect older people in
Wales.</p><p><a name="06061538000408">I
would like to acknowledge the long hours and hard work that the noble
Lords have put in on the Bill in the other place. I particularly want
to pay tribute to the dedication and tenacity of Lord Roberts, Lord
Livsey and Lord Thomas, who performed their duties with great energy
and enthusiasm.</p><p><a name="06061538000409">When
the Government revealed their White Paper last year, the Secretary of
State described it in his usual understated way as a
&#147;trailblazing&#148; Bill for Wales, and I think that he used
the term again this afternoon. I wish that we could share his
excitement. However, we must question exactly what kind of a trail the
Bill is blazing for Wales. The Prime Minister has famously said that
his greatest political regret was not going far enough with his
policies on reform. In my opinion, the Bill comes close to falling into
that trap. Like the Government of Wales Bill, it moves us in the right
direction but falls well short of where it should be. This is progress
by pigeon step rather than a great leap forward. I think that it was
the Prime Minister who also said that the Labour Government were at
their best when they were at their boldest. The Bill does not show the
Government being bold; it shows them at their most timid.</p><p><a name="06061538000410">Wales has a large and growing
population of older people. More than 20 per cent. of the population in
Wales are over 60, with that population likely to rise in the next 20
years. By 2021, nearly 500,000 households in Wales will contain at
least one person over the age of 65. Policies directed at helping to
improve the lives of this large sector of Welsh society are very
welcome, not least because many older people in Wales are vulnerable,
financially and socially. We applaud the Government&#146;s intentions
with this policy, but we have some serious reservations about the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06061538000411">For the
commissioner to be effective, he must have a sufficiently broad remit
and sufficiently tough powers, and he must be given a voice in the
relevant corridors of power. The most pressing failure of the Bill is
the commissioner&#146;s relatively weak powers in relation to
non-devolved matters. At present, the commissioner&#146;s input on
issues such as pensions, benefits and employment is significantly
compromised. Let us imagine that the commissioner had been in place
last November, and had seen the Turner report, the Government&#146;s
response and the new pensions White Paper all come and go. According to
the Bill, the commissioner would have had no right to communicate
directly with the Ministers responsible for an enormously influential
step-change in pensions policy. His voice would have been limited on an
issue of seismic importance for the people he was paid to represent. I
still find it incredible that a pensioner in Wales will be able to
write to the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Secretary of State for
Work and Pensions, yet the commissioner will not be allowed make any
such input to them
directly.</p><p><a name="06061538000412"><b><a name="06061538000936">Mrs.

to help the hon. Gentleman, and possibly the hon. Lady, by saying that
I made it clear earlier that the commissioner would be able to write to
me or to the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friend the
Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire (Nick Ainger). That
is our job; as Secretary of State for Wales and Minister in the Wales
Office, we are the gateway to the rest of Whitehall. That has long been
an established practice, and it has been widely used by many
independent bodies and individuals across
Wales.</p><p><a name="06061538000417"><b><a name="06061538000940">Mr.
Williams:</b> We understand what the Secretary of State is
saying, but we wish that the Bill were able to improve and increase the
devolved settlement, and to enable it to become more mature. We wish
that it would allow the commissioner, who will necessarily be an
independent officer, to have more powers.</p><p><a name="06061538000418"><b><a name="06061538000941">Mrs.
Gillan:</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will agree that a reply
often comes from the Secretary of State for Wales saying, &#147;This
is not my responsibility.&#148; In response to a question on prisons,
for example, he would say that it was a matter for the Home Secretary.
There will be issues over access to the commissioner. The Safeguarding
Vulnerable Groups Bill, which started in the House of Lords, is coming
to this House on Monday. I wonder how the commissioner will relate to
the independent barring board that that Bill introduces. This will be
of great concern, because the measure involves people being barred from
working with vulnerable adults. There is such complexity to these
issues, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that they are
not addressed by this
Bill.</p><p><a name="06061538000419"><b><a name="06061538000942">Mr.
Williams:</b> I agree with the hon. Lady, and I am sure that
we will raise these points in Committee. Our constituents in Wales want
the commissioner to have direct access to the person who is likely to
be able to achieve a result, either for themselves on a personal basis
or for a group of people involved in a particular issue. The hon. Lady
has pointed out one of the issues involved, namely the barring of
people from working with vulnerable persons.</p><p><a name="06061538000420">Figures obtained by the Welsh
Liberal Democrats suggest that, of all the complaints made by older
people to citizen&#146;s advice bureaux, 80 per cent. are concerned
with pensions and tax credits. Needless to say, neither of these
subjects is devolved. As well as being unable to meet directly with
Ministers on these issues, the commissioner will be unable to take up
individual cases on non-devolved matters. On the basis of those
figures, and of the information from the citizen&#146;s advice
bureaux, the commissioner would be able to help with only one in five
of the cases brought to
him.</p><p><a name="06061538000421">Giving the
commissioner the power to make direct representations to UK Ministers
would give greater support to elderly people in Wales. Because of that,
we would like the commissioner to have the ability to make direct
representations to Westminster Ministers. He will be paid and employed
by the Assembly and have 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 941</b><br>the right to comment on the implications for older people of actions
taken by a whole range of bodies, including the Assembly, the
Environment Agency, and local health boards and trusts. Why should he
not have the right to give direct feedback to the one body that will
arguably have a greater effect on the lives of pensioners in Wales than
any other: the UK
Government?</p><p><a name="06061538000422">We are
slightly concerned to note the number of amendments tabled by the
Government in the other place, and the fact that the Assembly plenary
debate on this issue took place on the day after the Bill&#146;s
Second Reading in the House of Lords. That could lead people to suppose
that the Government were rushing the Bill through, or that they had got
their procedure mixed up. Confusion will arise, because people in Wales
will not know what the commissioner&#146;s role is in relation to
devolved and non-devolved matters. It needs to be absolutely clear, not
only to us and to the Lords, but to the older people in Wales who will
be using this service, what the commissioner can and cannot do. We in
this place usually know the difference between what is devolved and
what is not, although I sometimes have difficulty when constituents ask
me a question about a particular issue. I do not have the Government of
Wales Act 1998 ingrained on my soul at the moment.</p><p><a name="06061538000423">People will assume that an
older people&#146;s commissioner will deal with all issues affecting
older people. I imagine that there will be a great deal of surprise in
Llandrindod when they learn that the commissioner for older people will
not be able to speak to the Government about pensions, for example. The
issue of clarity is paramount, and I would grateful if the Minister
expanded on how he envisages the older persons&#146; commissioner
working alongside similar posts, such as the public services ombudsman
and the parliamentary ombudsman. The Secretary of State touched on that
issue, which is a significant one. We are all aware of the dangers of
excessive bureaucracy and service duplication, and it is important that
the Bill should not create further confusion and complication for
service users.</p><p><a name="06061538000424">There
are other limitations in the Bill that could seriously affect the
commissioner&#146;s ability to do his job successfully. As has been
mentioned, today is world elder abuse awareness day, and I am sure the
whole House will join me in congratulating its organisers on their
great work in highlighting what is a very serious problem. The Action
on Elder Abuse helpline tells us that, in 2003-04, 22,000 people in
Wales aged over 65 resided in care homes. Some 45 per cent. of those
care homes were independently funded, 34 per cent. were run by local
authorities and provided nursing care, and 21 per cent. were run by
local authorities with no nursing care
provided.</p><p><a name="06061538000425">In 2004, the
Action on Elder Abuse helpline received 280 calls reporting 428
instances of alleged abuse,37 per cent. of which related to
psychological abuse,21 per cent. to financial abuse, 16 per
cent. to physical abuse, 12 per cent. to neglect and 2 per cent. to
sexual abuse. Some 20 per cent. of such abuse occurred in care homes,
and 36 per cent. of those suffering abuse in care homes who complained
of such abuse identified paid workers as their abusers. Help the Aged
has noted that 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 942</b><br>residents in any care home funded or owned by a local authority can
exercise their human rights. However, those in privately run care
homes, or those who are placed in local authority-run care homes but
who pay for their care, are not legally protected by the Human Rights
Act 1998. As many as nine out of 10 care homes in the UK are operated
by private organisations. Two thirds of people living in those homes
are paid for by local councils. This is an issue for the 1998 Act, but
it also raises the question of where the commissioner will fit in with
dealing with it. He needs to contribute to a change in the law; if he
does not, he will be nothing but a toothless
tiger.</p><p><a name="06061538000426"><b><a name="06061538000943">Julie
Morgan:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not welcome the clause
allowing the commissioner to enter homes such as those that he
describes?</p><p><a name="06061538000427"><b><a name="06061538000944">Mr.
Williams:</b> Help the Aged has expressed concern about the
question of the commissioner&#146;s having power to enter such homes.
We will get back to Help the Aged on this issue, because it is still
voicing some concerns. We will have to examine the relevant clause in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06061538000428">Is this
Bill the right way forward for the Government to improve the lives of
older people in Wales? There is much that the Government should be
doing to aid older people. Scrapping council tax would be a start, as
that regressive and unfair tax hits Welsh pensioners harder than anyone
else. When the Lyons report concludes later this year, I hope that the
Government will review their reactionary approach and radically reform
that punitive Tory tax
policy.</p><p><a name="06061538000429">I shall now
make mention of a constituency issue relating to the elderly. People
who live in park homes&#151;most Members have park homes in their
constituencies&#151;are often very vulnerable. The council tax
revaluation hit park home owners hard. A number of sites where there
were no park homes in any band other than band A now have homes in
bands A, B, C and D, which has led to huge increases in the council tax
paid. Many people move into park homes later in life to get some
capital out of their bricks-and-mortar homes and to have a cheaper
lifestyle. The legislation that sets out how council tax valuation
should be done covers England and Wales, yet it seems to be implemented
differently in Wales from how it is in England. If the commissioner
looks into that issue, that will be of great benefit to elderly people
living in park homes.</p><p><a name="06061538000430">On pensions, many of the
Government&#146;s new proposals are welcome and in line with Liberal
Democrat policy. But those new proposals will still lean heavily on the
broken crutch of means testing, which is failing Welsh pensioners.
Currently, as many as 150,000 Welsh pensioners are not getting the
pensions that they need and are entitled to because of failures in
means-testing. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny
Willott) has highlighted how many pensioners in Wales are not applying
for the pension credit. As a body, Welsh pensioners are probably losing
almost &#163;200 million a
year.</p><p><a name="06061538000431">Labour&#146;s
Government in the Welsh Assembly promised free personal care for the
disabled, but they have reneged on that manifesto pledge, refusing to
help 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 943</b><br>many of those who are unable to help themselves. In Scotland, where the
Liberal Democrats are in power with the Labour party, all older people
get free personal care, thus easing the burden on hospital services and
granting to some of the most vulnerable people in our society quality
care in their own homes, and removing the threat of having to sell
their homes to fund their
care.</p><p><a name="06061538000432">I make those
points because they raise further questions about the role of the
commissioner for older people. We know, by and large, what problems
older people in Wales face. They face disproportionate tax burdens, an
inefficient tax credits system and an unhelpful health system. The
commissioner can help to raise the profile of these issues, but his
appointment cannot be a substitute for direct and progressive policy
changes on pensions, benefits, housing and welfare. An old
people&#146;s commissioner who cannot give direct feedback to
Ministers on a matter as important as pensions is like a transport
commissioner who cannot speak directly to the Secretary of State for
Transport. Unless the commissioner can pass direct judgment on the
primary issues affecting older people, his ability to represent older
people in Wales will be
compromised.</p><p><a name="06061538000433">The Bill
has potential. A commissioner with teeth, and with a broad mandate and
an expanded field of vision, could play an important role in
representing the one in five people in Wales who are over 60 years old.
We will support the Bill today and we will table amendments in
Committee to enhance the scope of the commissioner&#146;s role. If
implemented in the right way, the new role could have a genuinely
beneficial impact on older people in Wales; if it is not, the
commissioner is in danger of being a classic new Labour
project&#151;one of surface over substance, publicity over reform,
and symbolism over action. Unless we lend due clarity and muscle to the
commissioner&#146;s role, we risk making him a toothless tiger who is
unable to exert any significant influence on devolved issues such as
pensions, benefits and employment, all of which are vital to pensioners
in
Wales.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061538000669">1.47

for Wales in protecting vulnerable individuals. It will not weaken one
iota the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill that we will consider on
Monday&#151;I hope to be called to speak on that Bill, too&#151;if
anything, it will strengthen
it.</p><p><a name="06061538000438">I have considered
the Bill as someone with a background of work in raising standards and
awareness of the problems people face. We need people with tenacity,
and a willingness to look for problems and find solutions. It is a sad
fact that too many people, especially on issues of abuse, do not want
to accept what happens. They would prefer to find a way not to look for
or find such problems. That is why I welcome the general functions
outlined in clause 2(1)(a) to (d), which are wide ranging. The review
arrangements outlined in clause 5 are also
comprehensive.</p><p><a name="06061538000439">Advocacy
is a much underrated function and when I was an inspector, care home
owners had not really begun to appreciate how vital it is. I welcome
the commissioner&#146;s role in tackling the issue and the fact that
he or she will be able to consider the availability of advocacy and the
training for those working as advocates. The job requires specific
training and the capacity to undertake the role. The competency of
those working as advocates must be examined and the commissioner will
have the opportunity to do so. The functioning of advocacy services and
their general availability across Wales will also come under the
purview of the commissioner, and we should all welcome
that.</p><p><a name="06061538000440">The commissioner
will also be able to consider complaints. When I was an inspector I
used to tell care home owners, who do not like receiving complaints,
that they were their best friend. A complaint tells them what they can
improve, what should be changed and what is not working. Unfortunately,
too many people see a complaint as a threat.</p><p><a name="06061538000441">Complaints can also be a way of
discovering underlying abuse. For example, I inspected a care home and
the complaints book said that a service user had complained that her
bath water was cold. Alongside was the handwritten report of the
investigation of the complaint by the staff at the care home, which
said, &#147;Add more hot water.&#148; That seems a simple solution,
but I asked the owner of the home to bring me her monitoring records
for the water temperatures in the home. The records revealed that water
temperatures were incredibly low&#151;little above tepid. I pointed
out to the owner that it would not have mattered how many hours the hot
tap had been run for, the bath water would still have been cold. The
handyman for the home said that he thought that as long as water
temperatures were below the required maximum temperature they were all
right. The staff had not checked and a doubly incontinent service user,
who needed frequent bathing, had been forced to suffer the indignity of
cold baths. That is the sort of abusive and neglectful treatment that
can be picked up through casual examination of complaints. I am glad
that the commissioner will also 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 945</b><br>have the ability to examine complaints, because that will help to raise
standards and support service
users.</p><p><a name="06061538000442">Whistleblowing
will also come under the commissioner&#146;s purview and it is, all
too often, the way abuse is revealed. It is often the capacity to
retain anonymity that allows someone to come forward with information
on something about which they are not happy, so that something can be
done. I agree with the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire that the
commissioner will have a vital role in considering how best to assess
people to determine who should be excluded from working in care
settings, so that Wales has the most robust system possible. I have had
experience of whistleblowing on hours worked by staff, some of whom
worked for more than 90 hours a week caring for vulnerable people,
including those who were aggressive and difficult to manage. When staff
are that tired, they do not provide the best quality of
care.</p><p><a name="06061538000443">Why do we need a
commissioner? After all, we already have care standards inspectors,
protection of vulnerable adults procedures, an ombudsman and complaints
procedures. The question can best be answered by giving an example of
why we needed the children&#146;s commissioner. It is a case that I
deal with personally and shows how the necessary change would not have
been made without the involvement of the children&#146;s
commissioner. I was leaving the House one Thursday to travel back to my
constituency when I received a telephone call from a constituent,
asking me to call back as a matter of urgency. I was in a taxi, which
was not the right place for the call, so I asked my office to deal with
it. The caller was a gentleman whose father-in-law had died more than a
year previously and who, six years before his death, had worked as a
support worker taking vulnerable young children to school. When
clearing the deceased man&#146;s house, the family discovered that,
only a few days earlier, he had been sent a full report of every child
with a disability and who needed to attend school in my constituency
and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies).
The list included the children&#146;s names, addresses, dates of
birth, schools attended, details of their disabilities and the times of
collection from home and return from school. Imagine if such
information had got into the hands of someone who wanted to abuse
children.</p><p><a name="06061538000444">I went to
the local authority&#146;s chief executive, but he did nothing and
passed it on to the department responsible for sending out the tender.
It said that it was merely following standard industry practice. I went
to the local authority&#146;s leader&#151;who is, I have to say, a
Liberal Democrat&#151;who was initially very concerned, but then
discovered that it had happened under the Labour administration so was
less concerned because she could not be held accountable for it. No
action was taken. The director of personal services was unable to carry
out an investigation because it was August and people were on holiday.
I went to the information commissioner, who was also unable to do
anything.</p><p><a name="06061538000445">Then I
wrote to the children&#146;s commissioner. In fairness, he initially
thought that it could not be happening. He could not believe that such
information was being sent to taxi companies, some of which had gone
out of business or changed address. In the 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 946</b><br>example of my constituent&#146;s father-in-law, he had been dead for
more than a year and had not been not involved in school transport work
for six years before that. The information was lying around in the
public realm. Once the children&#146;s commissioner appreciated the
risk, it took him two minutes to make the commitment to change the
situation. He was the only person who did and that is reason enough to
have an older people&#146;s commissioner in Wales to perform a
similar function on their behalf. That is the sort of person we need as
commissioner&#151;someone who wants to take the bull by the horns,
grapple with problems and insist on change taking place. Incidentally,
the children&#146;s commissioner found that Bridgend was not the only
local authority in Wales operating that policy. It was happening in
other local authorities and the commissioner was able to ensure that
children in other areas were
protected.</p>

<p><a name="06061538000446">Clause 16
provides for the commissioner for older people to work with the public
services ombudsman for Wales. Some might claim that that is duplication
and that I could have gone to the public services
ombudsman.</p><p><a name="06061538000447">I also
welcome clause 8 on assistance and clause 10 on the examination of
cases. It will be necessary to examine closely the regulations on those
functions, but I welcome the provision of assistance to older people in
making complaints, because that will make a big difference. Those
clauses also mean that the commissioner will assist older people and
that they will not be required to find their way through a difficult
and complex process on their own. The local government ombudsman
focuses on maladministration and personal injustice, but is passive
rather than proactive.</p><p><a name="06061538000448">I shall illustrate that with
another constituency case of mine. I sent a complaint to a highly
respected voluntary organisation about the way in which my local
authority had dealt with a particular matter. The local government
ombudsman had been sent a number of papers and appropriate information,
but the only proactive step that he took before he decided that he
needed to do nothing was to ring up a local authority officer. The
officer said that the authority had been worried about the matter for
ages and that everything was fine&#151;and that was it. One telephone
call was made, and no further action was taken. I spoke to the
ombudsman on the telephone, and got the impression that he did not
think that it was vital that he got a letter of confirmation from the
local authority officer about the actions that the authority had
taken.</p><p><a name="06061538000449">In contrast,
the commissioner will be proactive rather than passive. He will support
people who make complaints, and help them to put the evidence together.
He will seek information and mount challenges on older people&#146;s
behalf. That is the big strength of the role, and it is something that
we have been
missing.</p><p><a name="06061538000450">However, I
have some concerns about schedules 2 and 3, which list those persons
whose functions are subject to review under clause 3, and to review and
monitoring under clause 5. Neither schedule mentions the Care Standards
Inspectorate for Wales. Other bodies that have recently been absorbed
into the Assembly&#146;s functions&#151;such as the Wales Tourist
Board and the Welsh Development Agency&#151;are 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 947</b><br>included in schedule 3, so why is the CSIW missing? I hope that the
Government accept that it should be included.</p><p><a name="06061538000451">I raise that point for two
reasons. First, clause 3(1)(c) refers to</p><a name="06061538000631"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the discharge or
proposed discharge in relation to Wales of a relevant function of a
person mentioned in schedule
2&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06061538000452">I am worried that
that would exclude the CSIW, as it is not mentioned there. Secondly,
clause 3 (2)(c) defines a relevant function as</p><a name="06061538000632"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;any other person
mentioned in schedule
2&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06061538000453">Again, the CSIW is
not mentioned in schedule 2. I recognise that clause 4 will allow the
Assembly to add it at a later date, but it would be better to include
it before the Bill leaves this House.</p><p><a name="06061538000454">The reason why I want the CSIW
to be included in schedule 2 is best explained by reference to an
Adjournment debate held in June last year, just after I came to the
House. I shall not mention the specific case involved, as it is still
under consideration, but I want to refer to the general concept
highlighted in that debate.</p><p><a name="06061538000455">The Registered Homes Act 1984
set out the procedure when a registration authority wanted to remove a
care home&#146;s registration. It said that, at tribunal, the
decision would be based on the situation in the home at the time that
the authority made its decision to withdraw registration. Under the
Care Standards Act 2000, however, the care standards tribunal must make
a decision based on the situation at the time of the tribunal hearing
itself.</p><p><a name="06061538000456">That would
appear to mean that care homes are able to do nothing and make no
changes until the tribunal hearing. When the tribunal sits, they can
make a few changes and demonstrate that they will make improvements,
with the result that they can no longer be deregistered.</p><p><a name="06061538000457">We must find ways to change
that requirement. Some homes play the game and do not protect
vulnerable people&#151;they do not meet required care standards or
they use legal niceties to avoid their responsibilities to older
people. Such homes must be challenged. I hope that the older
people&#146;s commissioner will use clause 2(1)(d)&#151;which
requires him
to</p><a name="06061538000633"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;keep under
review the adequacy and effectiveness of law affecting the interests of
older people&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06061538000458">to
tackle the problems posed by the Care Standards Act 2000 and make the
changes needed to protect those who live in old people&#146;s homes
in Wales.</p><p><a name="06061538000459">The older
people&#146;s commissioner will have 30 staff. Start-up costs are
estimated at &#163;0.5 million, and running costs in the first full
year of operation at&#163;1.5 million. I assume that the
funding will come from the Assembly, and Opposition Members have asked
about the services that will have to be cut to meetthe cost.
That is an appalling question, given that&#163;1.5 million
is a drop in the ocean when compared with the need to protect older
people. The commissioner and his 30 staff members will proactively
fight for older people and represent their needs. They will make sure
that the necessary services provided to older people are of the
requisite standard.</p><p><a name="06061538000460">With this Bill, the Government
are recognising that Wales is a small country with a high percentage of
older people. They are giving those people priority, and 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 948</b><br>making it clear that they are valued members of the Welsh community. We
must insist that older people&#151;in this generation and in times to
come&#151;get the best quality services. Establishing a commissioner
for older people is the way to ensure that that
happens.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061538000670">2.6

Price (Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr) (PC):</b> In the
interests of Anglo-Welsh relations&#151;and of any Wrexham supporters
who might be in our midst&#151;I too shall try to keep my comments
fairly brief.</p><p><a name="06061538000462">I and
my party support the principle behind this important Bill, and the
model of the commissioner that is emerging is worth celebrating.
Indeed, my party is calling for a language commissioner as
well.</p><p><a name="06061538000463">There
is a difference between an ombudsman and a commissioner. The ombudsman
model was developed in Scandinavia around the beginning of the 20th
century, and was designed to provide a complaints procedure in cases of
maladministration. The commissioner will not be a quango; the post has
no role in delivery and is therefore entirely independent of the
Executive, whose policies are to be investigated. The commissioner
model includes elements of the traditional ombudsman role, but it has a
much wider remit to investigate general matters of public policy, and I
am sure that the Assembly will apply the commissioner model to other
policy areas in the
future.</p><p><a name="06061538000464">It is great to
see Wales engaging in such an important form of social innovation, and
on a global scale. There are ombudsmen for older people in other
jurisdictions, but the commissioner for older people in Wales will be
the first post of its kind to be created in the world, and that is a
credit to the Assembly Government.</p><p><a name="06061538000465">The proposal to establish a
commissioner for older people has all-party support. It was a Labour
party manifesto commitment&#151;one of the few that the Labour
Government in Cardiff Bay are on course to deliver.</p><p><a name="06061538000466">I want to echo the comments
made by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams). By
and large, my party supports the principle behind the Bill, although we
have some concerns about the responsibility for non-devolved areas.
Moreover, I bristled a little when the hon. Gentleman called for the
commissioner to have teeth. In this context, that is slightly
insensitive and might fall foul of anti-discrimination
measures&#151;[<i> Laughter.</i>]&#151;but I think we got the
point.</p><p><a name="06061538000467">We are
revisiting a problem that arose in our debates on the children&#146;s
commissioner: in these post-devolutionary times, how do we ensure
accountability when there is some blurring of the lines of
responsibility? Given the still complex nature of the devolution
settlement in Wales, we&#151;let alone our constituents&#151;often
struggle to get our minds around such issues. The children&#146;s
commissioner does not have full powers to investigate where a child is
placed in care through the courts, but has such powers in relation to a
sibling who is in care voluntarily. That is the type of problem that
will arise if the Bill&#146;s provisions on non-devolved matters
remain as they
are.</p><p><a name="06061538000468">Clause 2(2)
states that the powers of the
commissioner</p><a name="06061538000634"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;are
exercisable only in relation to fields in which the Assembly has
functions&#148;.</p></ul><br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 949</b><br><p><a name="06061538000469">That is clear. The commissioner will not
have those powers in relation to anything that is non-devolved. There
will be no power to promote awareness or provision, to encourage best
practice or to keep under review any non-devolved matter. On
non-devolved matters, the commissioner will have only the right to make
representations, under subsection (3); there will be no power to
investigate. That is the key
issue.</p><p><a name="06061538000470">Indeed, clause
10(2) makes it clear that the commissioner will have no power to
investigate individual complaints relating to non-devolved matters.
Under clause 15(2) the commissioner will have no power to make reports
on non-devolved matters. Another clause provides that the commissioner
will have no power to initiate research in relation to non-devolved
matters. Those are critical points. The commissioner will of course
have the right&#151;like the3 million people of
Wales&#151;to make representations by writing a letter to the
Secretary of State or the Minister, but the key issue is the basis for
such representations. If the commissioner has no power to review a
non-devolved policy area, no power to commission or conduct research on
a non-devolved power relating to older people in Wales and no power to
investigate individual complaints, on what basis will the
representations be
made?</p><p><a name="06061538000471">The Government
rightly support the principle of evidence-based policy making. Without
those statutory powers the commissioner for older people in Wales will
be open to legal challenge. The commissioner will be acting ultra vires
if he or she initiates research or undertakes a review of non-devolved
policy. If the commissioner merely writes to the Secretary of State,
the Secretary of State will have the perfect right to say,
&#147;Well, what&#146;s your proof?&#148; There will be no proof
because the commissioner has no power to investigate. That is the key
issue.</p><p><a name="06061538000472">Of course, as
the Secretary of State said, representations can be made informally. I
am sure that the door of the Wales Office is always open, even to
members of my party from time to time, when we behave ourselves. The
key issue is not the right to write a letter or to go to see the
Secretary of State; it is whether the commissioner has the right to
investigate and the power to make a report, which will give a formal
basis for a structured discussion with Westminster
Ministers.</p><p><a name="06061538000473">The
commissioner will have the power to make representations to the
Assembly, but there is no requirement for the Assembly to respond, nor
for it to pass such representations to the Westminster Government and
thus, at the end of that rather circumlocutory process, for the
Westminster Government to respond at all. The key problem is that the
Bill gives us no confidence about non-devolved matters, many of which
have been mentioned. Some aspects of health and education have been
devolved but others are non-devolved. Under the Bill, there is no clear
process whereby the commissioner will be able to consider those matters
comprehensively, which seriously weakens the Government&#146;s stated
intent for the measure. It weakens the independence of the
commissioner. If he or she has no right to communicate directly with
the Government but has to 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 950</b><br>go via the Assembly Government, not only will there be questions about
the commissioner&#146;s independence from the Assembly Government,
but the comprehensiveness of the commissioner&#146;s role as champion
and advocate will be
weakened.</p><p><a name="06061538000474">Older
people, like younger and middle-aged people in Wales, are not
necessarily constitutional experts and might not understand the
intricacies of the devolution settlement. They see
services&#151;whoever provides them&#151;and they want the older
people&#146;s commissioner to take up their problems, regardless of
whether Westminster or Cardiff Bay is accountable according to the
settlement. That is the problem facing the Government under the Bill as
currently drafted. Indeed, it is line with what the people of Wales are
saying.</p><p><a name="06061538000475">One of the
questions in the consultation exercise conducted by the National
Assembly for Wales
was:</p><a name="06061538000635"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Do you
agree that the new powers establishing the Commission should include
the power to make representations directly to the UK Government on
issues of importance to older people in
Wales?&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061538000476">One hundred and
thirty-nine respondents agreed that the commissioner should have the
formal power to make direct representations; only two disagreed. It is
absolutely clear that stakeholder and representative organisations,
including Age Concern and Help the Aged, support the principle that the
commissioner be given formal powers on non-devolved matters. That was
the position of the Welsh Assembly&#146;s advisory group on setting
up the older people&#146;s commissioner and it was also taken by a
majority of the Assembly&#146;s Health and Social Services Committee,
including its Labour members. There is wide consensus in Wales that the
commissioner should have the power to initiate research and make
reports on areas of non-devolved policy. That would be the basis for
the fireside chats down the road at Gwydyr House.</p><p><a name="06061538000477">Finally, I want to touch on the
definition of age, on which the shadow Secretary of State for Wales
expounded. It is an important issue. In the consultation, the majority
of the consultees came out in favour of the principle of flexibility
and supported giving the commissioner the right to look at issues
involving people aged 50-plus, although accepting the general
definition of 60, which has not changed since the Bill was in draft
form. There should be some flexibility, especially in
employment-related matters where age discrimination is as serious, if
not more serious, in Wales, due to our demographic. It is likely that
the commissioner for older people in Wales will be up and running
before the UK commission for equality and human rights, so I urge the
Minister to look again at flexibility, possibly through regulation, in
terms of age-related issues that affect people at 50 plus. That is the
age for the starting-point of the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s
welcome and innovative older people&#146;s strategy, so there should
be some flexibility under the Bill, too. Clearly, as has been
mentioned, there are also health issues for the 50-plus cohort,
particularly in relation to Alzheimer&#146;s and other
dementia-related diseases. I appeal to the Minister for flexibility in
the definition of the age, if possible.</p><p><a name="06061538000478">May we please give the older
people&#146;s commissioner the power to investigate quite
legitimately areas of 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 951</b><br>policy that traverse non-devolved and devolved matters? Clearly, they
will be of concern to older people in
Wales.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061538000671">2.20

Morgan (Cardiff, North) (Lab):</b> It is a pleasure to speak
in this debate and to follow the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and
Dinefwr (Adam Price). I welcome the Bill and see it as part of the
Labour Government in Wales and the Labour Government in Westminster
delivering for older people in Wales. I welcome the fact that there is
all-party support for the Bill. I was heavily involved in setting up
the children&#146;s commissioner. I was on the Committee for the Care
Standards Bill and then the Bill to set up the children&#146;s
commissioner. I welcome the fact that the commissioner for older people
has been modelled on the Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales. As
the previous speaker said, the role includes taking up complaints and
fighting against injustice, but it also encompasses the power to
advocate things in relation to wider issues.</p><p><a name="06061538000480">In Wales, the children&#146;s
commissioner has generally been regarded as a success. The commissioner
has been independent and the body has succeeded in influencing the
Assembly. It has been highly critical of the Assembly over certain
issues and has had a response. Peter Clarke has been seen as a champion
for children and I hope that the person who holds the post that we are
discussing will be seen as a champion for older people. I hope that the
appointment process will draw in older people in the way that the
appointment process for the children&#146;s commissioner drew in
children. Children played a vital role in the appointment of the
commissioner.</p><p><a name="06061538000481">We need
a champion for older people in Wales, because the elderly suffer from
discrimination in many ways. A recent report by Age Concern said that
29 per cent. of people reported suffering age discrimination. That is
more than any other type of discrimination. We are all living longer,
which is a matter for rejoicing, but it does cause issues for society,
particularly in relation to health and pensions. I am pleased that the
Assembly&#146;s policies have emphasised keeping older people active
and healthy. The free bus travel, which was pioneered by the Assembly
Member for my seat, Sue Essex, has been a huge success. My constituents
have told me that it has enabled many of them to travel around, be
active and get out in a way that they have not been able to do before.
In the same way, the free swimming for older people is a positive
affirmation of how older people can keep active and play a valuable
role in society. The appointment of an commissioner for older people
will emphasise the positive, valued contribution that older people make
to society, as well as looking at all the problems that can arise in
the health care service and the points that my hon. Friend the Member
for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) mentioned.</p><p><a name="06061538000482">I want to raise a few specific
points about the Bill with the Minister. Some of them have been covered
already by several speakers and by the Secretary of State in his
introduction. One of the main concerns for elderly people is finance in
old age. We know that Wales, on the whole, is a poor country and many
elderly people live in poverty. I strongly support the
Government&#146;s White Paper. It is a good basis on which 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 952</b><br>to move forward for the future. It is important to recognise what a big
step that White Paper is. If we look at the situation of women, we see
that they have fared badly with pensions. We all know why that is: they
have been looking after children or elderly people and have not been
able to build up a pension contribution record.</p><p><a name="06061538000483">It is difficult to separate the
different strands in people&#146;s lives&#151;finance, caring and
health needs. As other speakers have said, some of those issues are
devolved and some are not. It would be helpful if, when he responds,
the Minister could again spell out the routes by which those different
aspects of people&#146;s lives can be dealt with by the different
people who are taking responsibility for them. We went through the
debate about devolved and non-devolved issues when the
children&#146;s commissioner was set up and I do not want to go on
about it any more today. However, the reason these different problems
have surfaced when setting up the children&#146;s commissioner, and
now this commissioner, is linked to the devolution settlement. We have
to find practical ways forward and the children&#146;s commissioner
has done that, but I would be grateful if the Minister could go over
what mechanisms are going to be used.</p><p><a name="06061538000484">The other point that I wanted
to raise was about how the commissioner will relate to similar posts,
such as the ombudsman who is in post at the moment and, in particular,
the new equality and human rights commission, which is not mentioned in
the Billbecause it has not been set up yet. Given that that
commission will have a specific responsibility for age discrimination,
it is important that clear links are established between the two
bodies. I assume that thought has been given to how they will relate to
each other.</p><p><a name="06061538000485">There is
also the issue of support for the commissioner. As other speakers have
said, this is the first post of its kind in the UK and possibly in the
world. I hope that the other countries in the UK will follow, as
happened with the children&#146;s commissioner. However, when the
children&#146;s commissioner took up his post, there was an
established network of children&#146;s commissioners and ombudsmen
throughout Europe and the world. Long before the children&#146;s
commissioner was appointed, I can remember an inspirational meeting in
Cardiff with the Danish children&#146;s ombudsman, at which the idea
of a children&#146;s commissioner in Wales was raised. When the
appointment was made, the children&#146;s commissioner had a network
to relate to immediately and he was able to link in to the sort of
issues that were being discussed on that network. He was able to get
support from that organisation. He also relates to the
children&#146;s commissioners who have been appointed in all the
other devolved bodies in the UK and now in England. It is quite
important to think about where the commissioner for older people will
fit in. Who will he relate to, who will support him, who will raise the
issues and what will there be agreement on?</p><p><a name="06061538000486">It is important that the
commissioner makes links with elderly people in the different ethnic
communities in Wales. I know that, older people in many of those
communities are isolated, particularly if they cannot 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 953</b><br>speak the language. It is important that the commissioner is for
everybody in Wales, including the ethnic
communities.</p><p><a name="06061538000487">I hope
that the commissioner will campaign on general issues, as well as
dealing with problems in care homes and things that have to be put
right. I hope that he will be able to campaign for a general
improvement in the community and society. I know that one of the main
issues that came up when Peter Clarke was going round talking to
children about what was most important to them was the state of school
toilets. He has campaigned about toilets and, in my area, there has
been a considerable improvement in the toilets for children. I hope
that the same thing will happen with elderly people.</p><p><a name="06061538000488">One of the issues that elderly
people bring up a lot with me is the lack of local facilities. As do
many other people in the community, they bemoan the loss of small
corner shops and the demise of small local shopping centres. I attended
a packed meeting in the week before last in Birchgrove, which is in the
Heath area of my constituency. Many of the people at the meeting were
elderly, and they were protesting about another Tesco Extra coming to a
street in the Heath outside the main shopping area. They fear that the
local corner shops that they can get to easily will disappear because
those shops will not be able to compete. They thus worry that they will
lose the personal service that they receive. A lot of the worry about
post offices came from elderly people who depended on being able to get
to their local
facilities.</p><p><a name="06061538000489">I hope
that the commissioner for older people will take up such issues because
they affect the quality of life of many elderly people. Many such
people have a good pattern to their lives. They go down to the local
shop to get a newspaper and groceries, but that pattern of life has
been disrupted in our area by the demise of some of the local shopping
centres.</p><p><a name="06061538000490">The Bill is
good. We need to discuss aspects of it further, but they really relate
to the fact that devolution has happened and we have an Assembly in
Wales. We need to try to work out a way of dealing with devolved and
non-devolved matters. I support the
Bill.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061538000672">2.31
pm</h5><p><a name="06061538000491"><b><a name="06061538000948">Mr.
David Jones (Clwyd, West) (Con):</b> As the father of two
extremely avid Wrexham supporters, I assure the Secretary of State and
everyone else in the Chamber that I will not detain the House any
longer than is absolutely
necessary.</p><p><a name="06061538000492">We have had
an interesting debate. It is clear that the Bill has received a broad
welcome from hon. Members on both sides of the House. Indeed, it would
be strange if that was not the case. The problems faced by older people
in Wales and, indeed, the whole of the United Kingdom are well known
and have been touched on by many hon. Members. Poor housing, poor
nutrition, inadequate transport services and employment discrimination
are but a few of the problems faced by older people, yet older people
can&#151;and do&#151;play an important role in our national life.
Indeed, as the hon. Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith) pointed out,
many 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 954</b><br>of them are extremely active and run businesses well beyond what would
otherwise be their retirement
age.</p><p><a name="06061538000493">If the
commissioner can make a difference that will improve the lives of older
people, the role will be greatly welcomed in Wales. The proposal of
appointing a champion for older people is thus broadly welcomed among
Conservative Members, but I have to echo the note of caution and
concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and
Amersham(Mrs. Gillan). Such caution was also expressed in the
other place by my noble Friend Lord Roberts of Conwy and by the hon.
Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price) in the Chamber
today. The note of caution is that we must not expect the commissioner
to be able to achieve too
much.</p><p><a name="06061538000494">As
the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr eloquently pointed
out, the commissioner&#146;s functions will be confined to devolved
matters. That is the significant weakness of the Bill because the
commissioner will effectively be able to do nothing whatever to
intervene formally in respect of many aspects of life that are of
specific concern to older people, two prime examples of which are crime
and pensions. Indeed, the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr.
Williams) pointed out that under the Bill as drafted, it would not be
possible for the commissioner to make any meaningful response to the
recommendations of the Turner
commission.</p><p><a name="06061538000495">Although
pensioner poverty is a blight on the life of our nation, the
commissioner will be virtually helpless to address concerns such as the
consequences of the collapse of the Allied Steel and Wire pension fund,
which the Secretary of State mentioned in his speech. I understand that
informal channels will be opened up whereby the commissioner will be
able to express concerns and advance the cases of pensioners such as
those affected in that case, but it is perhaps surprising that the
Government did not consider appointing a UK-wide commissioner, or at
least, as the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr suggested,
formalising the route by which the commissioner could approach UK
Ministers. In the light of that, we should not be too ambitious. We
must not expect the commissioner to be the ultimate answer to the
ultimate question for older people in Wales. We must be realistic about
the benefits that his appointment will
bring.</p><p><a name="06061538000496">The
commissioner will, however, be able to inquire into the effect on
pensioners in Wales of the rising levels of council tax, so I hope that
he will do that at the earliest possible moment. That matter was
mentioned by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire. We must not
forget that Wales, uniquely, has experienced rebanding and the
revaluation of dwelling houses, although pensioners in England have
been spared
that.</p><p><a name="06061538000497"><b><a name="06061538000949">Julie

point.</p><p><a name="06061538000504"><b><a name="06061538000956">Mr.
Jones:</b> We could to and fro on the point ad nauseam, but in
my part of Wales, certainly, pensioners are paying significantly more
as a result of revaluation and rebanding than would otherwise have been
the case.</p><p><a name="06061538000505">I echo the
concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham by
querying the powers that the commissioner will have. Clause 10 of the
Bill sets up sweeping inquisitorial and quasi-judicial powers that will
be backed up by a panoply of legal weapons, including the reference of
individual cases to theHigh Court with the possible ultimate
sanction of committing individuals to prison for contempt. Such weapons
are very powerful and should not&#151;and will not, I am
sure&#151;be used capriciously or lightly. We will thus probe in
Committee how the powers will be used and in what circumstances that
will happen. Indeed, those powers are not possessed by Ministers.
Although it might be appropriate for the commissioner to have them, we
will want reassurances from the Government about the manner and
circumstances in which they may be
deployed.</p><p><a name="06061538000506">My hon.
Friend has already referred to the powers of entry in clause 13. Again,
we will want clarification on how the powers may be used. There is
specific worry about how the powers will interface with those that are
currently vested in the Care Standards Inspectorate for Wales. That was
mentioned by the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon), who has some
experience of these matters.</p><p><a name="06061538000507">We can envisage circumstances
in which both the commissioner and the inspectorate might be concerned
about what was going on in a particular care home. It would be
extraordinary and, indeed, ridiculous if both the commissioner and the
inspectorate decided to exercise their comparable powers at the same
time. We shall want to explore the matter further in Committee, but the
Government may wish to consider whether, in cases in which the
inspector is concerned about the activities of a care home, he should
have power to call for an investigation by the care standards
inspectorate. I see that the Minister is nodding. Presumably that is
why the CSI is not among the organisations mentioned in schedule
1.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060615/debtext/60615-0500.htm"/>


<p><a name="06061538000508">We also have
concerns about the staffing and funding of the commissioner&#146;s
office. The Bill, when enacted, will establish a fairly sizeable
bureaucracy. We will wish to know whether the size of that bureaucracy
is justified. For example, paragraph 4 of schedule 1 provides that the
commissioner must appoint a deputy commissioner. Why is that provision
mandatory rather than permissive? Why does the commissioner need a 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 956</b><br>deputy? Will he not already be adequately supported by the remaining, no
doubt sizeable, staff who will be provided from his &#163;1.5 million
per annum budget? Does he really need a deputy who will no doubt be
furnished with a sizeable support staff of his own? What added value
will the deputy provide?</p><p><a name="06061538000509">Similarly, the commissioner is
to be paid from ministerial budgets. Given that one of the
commissioner&#146;s primary duties will be to scrutinise the actions
and activities of Welsh Assembly Ministers, is it right that Ministers
should be responsible for paying his salary and those of the members of
his team? What safeguards does the Government propose to ensure that
the suspicion does not arise that he who pays the piper calls the
tune?</p><p><a name="06061538000510">Questions also
arise over the commissioner&#146;s period of tenure. Paragraph 2 of
schedule 1 states that that will be a matter for regulations that will
be made at some time in the future. The use of secondary legislation is
something of an addiction of the Government&#146;s. One must ask why
the period of tenure could not and should not be stated in the Bill.
There seems to be no good reason for that, and we shall invite the
Government&#146;s observations.</p><p><a name="06061538000511">There are other matters that
concern us. For example, clause 19 establishes statutory defences of
absolute and qualified privilege to actions for defamation in respect
of many of the commissioner&#146;s activities. We will need to know
why the commissioner should have such protection in every such case. He
may, for example, make damaging criticisms of the activities of care
home proprietors and staff while exercising his duties. Why should he
have a defence of privilege if, as a result of his making allegations
that subsequently turn out to be false, the lives and livelihoods of
those people are blighted? With power comes responsibility, and, given
the sweeping powers that are to be conferred on the
commissioner&#151;I must beg to differ from the hon. Member for
Brecon and Radnorshire: this is not a toothless tiger, but a tiger with
very sharp teeth&#151;it is only right that he should be called to
account if he causes damage in exercising those powers. Indeed, I see
no reason why he should not be subject to an action for
defamation.</p><p><a name="06061538000512">We share
the broad welcome given to the Bill by Members, but we do not do so
uncritically. We fear that from the &#147;bonfire of the
quangos&#148; of which we have heard so much there has risen a new
bureaucratic phoenix in the form of commissioners. Once the accusation
was that Wales was quangoland; now it may fairly be suggested that it
is rapidly becoming the fiefdom of commissioners. The more cynical
might suggest that an important role of the commissioners would be to
shoulder responsibilities that would otherwise fall on Ministers. We do
not believe that that should happen. While it is welcome that Wales
should have a commissioner who will champion the interests of older
people, we would expect Ministers to act as champions for older people
as well. If Ministers, whether here or in the Welsh Assembly, see that
the interests of older people are being compromised, they should
intervene and not simply leave it to the commissioner to take action.
We, and the people of Wales, expect Ministers to be proactive and not
just to await the criticism that may emanate from the
commissioner.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 957</b><br><p><a name="06061538000513">As I have said, we broadly
support the Bill, but we do not do so uncritically. In Committee we
will seek answers to the questions that I have asked and, no doubt, to
others.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061538000673">2.44

House for its general support for the Bill. A number of important
issues have been raised, and I am sure that they will be discussed in
Committee. I shall respond to some of the larger themes aired in the
debate, particularly those related to non-devolved matters.</p><p><a name="06061538000515">The hon. Member for Chesham and
Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) asked what role the commissioner would have in
relation to NICE reports&#151;for example, its report on drugs used
to treat Alzheimer&#146;s disease. The commissioner would not be able
to make direct representations to NICE, but would certainly be able to
take up such matters if a Welsh health board either allowed, or, more
likely, did not allow drugs on which NICE had made recommendations to
be prescribed. The commissioner would be able to raise matters relating
to a NICE decision via that channel.</p><p><a name="06061538000516">The hon. Lady and others,
including the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones), whom I welcome
to the Front Bench&#151;I apologise for not having doneso
earlier&#151;questioned the independence of the commissioner, given
that the funding for the post would come directly from the Assembly,
but in many cases the commissioner would be examining the policies and
actions of the Assembly. The basic argument was that he who pays the
piper calls the tune. However, the same arrangement applies to the
Children&#146;s Commissioner and, as my hon. Friends the Members for
Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan) and for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) pointed out,
where necessary the Children&#146;s Commissioner has acted in a
forthright way when dealing directly with Assembly actions and
policies. I therefore do not think that the independence of the new
commissioner will be fettered by the way in which his office is
funded.</p><p><a name="06061538000517"><b><a name="06061538000958">Mr.
David Jones:</b> I hear what the Minister says, but there will
be a difference. At present, the Assembly is a body corporate and is
responsible for paying the Children&#146;s Commissioner, but if the
Government of Wales Bill is enacted that will cease to be the case. The
Welsh Assembly Government will have their own budgets and the new
commissioner will be paid from those ministerial
budgets.</p><p><a name="06061538000518"><b><a name="06061538000959">Nick
Ainger:</b> The hon. Gentleman is correct, but it would be an
unwise Minister who cut the budget of a commissioner because he or she
did not like a report that that commissioner had produced. I am sure
that the commissioner will make that perfectly clear and that the
Assembly would call a Minister who acted in 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 958</b><br>that way to account. I believe that there are sufficient checks and
balances to guarantee the independence of the
commissioner.</p><p><a name="06061538000519">The hon.
Member for Chesham and Amersham asked whether the commissioner&#146;s
role would be similar to Ofwat&#146;s. The answer is no, it would
not. Ofwat exists directly to protect the interests of water customers,
whereas the role of the commissioner is to help and safeguard
vulnerable older people and to improve the quality of life of all older
people in Wales. That very different remit is clearly set out in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06061538000520">Another
question raised by the hon. Lady, which was taken up by the hon. Member
for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price), was why the Bill set the
age threshold at 60. Both hon. Members spoke about age discrimination
in work and said that, for many people, such discrimination starts
before 60. The House should be aware that regulations on age
discrimination in employment and training are being introduced, with
effect from October 2006. Those regulations will be enforced by the new
commission for equality and human rights. That is already being
addressed. A limit must be set somewhere. If not, the number of people
whom the commissioner would be covering would involve not only old or
older people but younger people as well. I understand the idea of
having flexibility, for example, but the real issue of age
discrimination at work will be addressed by the commission for equality
and human rights in terms of the regulations that it will be
enforcing.</p><p><a name="06061538000521">The
main issue raised by the hon. Members for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr.
Williams) and for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr, my hon.
Friend for Cardiff, North and the Member for Clwyd, West was
that of the role of the commission in relation to non-devolved matters,
which clearly affect older people in Wales, whether these issues
involve pensions or even the Care Standards Act 2000, whatever it may
be. There are issues in which older people will clearly be
interested.</p><p><a name="06061538000522">The hon.
Member for Brecon and Radnorshire asked about the pensions White Paper
and other matters. He went on to ask about the role that the
commissioner would play in that context. He will be able to give his
view on the proposals set out in the White Paper. Given who he is, and
under clause 9, it would be possible to carry out research. That would
lead to an authoritative contribution to the White Paper. He, like
anyone else in the United Kingdom, will be able to make a direct and
authoritative response to the White Paper. His position would clearly
carry weight.</p><p><a name="06061538000523">Clause 9
would allow, as I have said, research to be carried out, even in areas
where the issue was non-devolved. A report would be made to the
Assembly, which it could take up directly with the relevant UK
Department. Alternatively, as we have said in relation to the
Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales, if he wanted to report to my
right hon. Friend or myself, we could take up the matter. The important
thing is that he is not fettered from carrying out research if there is
a real issue affecting pensioners in Wales because of the actions or
legislation that are currently reserved. Representations could still be
made, and those representations would carry a great deal of weight. I
am sure that this is an issue to which we will return in
Committee.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 959</b><br><p><a name="06061538000524">My hon. Friend the Member for
Bridgend made an extremely well informed speech, given her long
professional involvement in these matters. She cited some excellent
examples of how the Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales had been
effective, and far more effective than the local authority or the
ombudsman, for example, because he is seen as an advocate and someone
genuinely representing children with particular problems.</p><p><a name="06061538000525">I am confident that when the
older persons commissioner is appointed, he will be in exactly that
position and will be seen as a great advocate for issues relating to
older people.</p><p><a name="06061538000526">My hon.
Friend the Member for Bridgend asked some specific questions,
particularly in relation to the Care Standards Inspectorate for Wales.
That name does not appear in the Bill and my hon. Friend is concerned
that therefore the commissioner would not be able to investigate the
actions of the CSIW. May I reassure her that, in fact, he can do so,
because the Care Standards Inspectorate for Wales is accountable to the
Assembly, which is covered by clause 3. If the commissioner is
concerned about the actions of the CSIW, he can carry out
investigations or make direct representations to the Assembly on behalf
of any older person. I cannot comment directly on the Holly House case
that my hon. Friend raised because, as she said, an appeal has been
lodged with the tribunal. The commissioner could look at such issues,
and if he found that the workings of the regulations under the Care
Standards Act 2000 affected the welfare of individual residents, he
could make representations to the Assembly. If the regulations were not
working he could ask the Assembly to change them, or he could make
representations to the relevant Department through the Assembly, my
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State or myself, so there are
several channels to address those issues. I hope that my hon. Friend is
happy with that explanation, but we can explore the matter in greater
detail in Committee.</p><p><a name="06061538000527">My hon. Friend the Member for
Cardiff, North and the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire raised
the issue of joint working, and they were concerned about the working
relationship between the public services ombudsman for Wales and the
new equality and human rights commission. Those bodies must work
together, because the new commission will have responsibility for
tackling age discrimination and so on. The children&#146;s
commissioner has a good relationship with other commissioners and the
public services ombudsman, so I expect those bodies to develop links to
avoid duplication and ensure that the new commission and the commission
for older people are effective in exercising the powers given to them
by the Government.</p><p><a name="06061538000528">May I assure my hon. Friend the
Member for Cardiff, North that although the post of commissioner for
older people is a new one, the commissioner will learn from the
experience of the children&#146;s commissioner, whose work has
received great support? No one has made any serious criticisms of the
work that he has done, and the post is regarded as a huge step forward.
As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, it has been copied
in England.</p><p><a name="06061538000529"><b><a name="06061538000960">Mr.

will he act in such cases?</p><p><a name="06061538000530"><b><a name="06061538000961">Nick

is wrong, that would be an issue for the Department for Work and
Pensions,and ultimately, if there was no satisfaction, the
parliamentary ombudsman. However, if the complaint is about more
general issues, perhaps affecting more than one individual, although
the commissioner would need to receive a complaint initially from at
least one pensioner or their representative, as I explained to the hon.
Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr, the commissioner could carry
out whatever research he feels is reasonable and then make
representations either through my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State or me to the relevant Department or directly to the Assembly for
it to make direct representation to the relevant body. That is the
route that has come
about.</p><p><a name="06061538000531">The hon.

has taken place, if the commissioner had been in place then, he could
have made direct representations to the
Assembly.</p><p><a name="06061538000532">The Bill to
establish a commissioner for older people represents a landmark
development in promoting policies for older people and is another
example of how Wales is able to set an example, not only to the United
Kingdom, but to the rest of Europe and possibly the wider world. The
commissioner, as an ambassador and authority on older people&#146;s
issues, is part of an overall strategy to ensure that the interests of
older people are fully integrated into the mainstream policies of the
Welsh Assembly Government. I look forward to the House&#146;s
continuing support for this groundbreaking proposal, and I commend the

made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now
adjourn.<i> &#151;[Mr. Roy.]</i></p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061538000674">3.2
pm</h5><p><a name="06061538000541"><b><a name="06061538000962">Mr.
Jeremy Browne (Taunton) (LD):</b> On a day when the nation
holds its breath and hopes to become a world beater, it is particularly
appropriate that we have the opportunity over the next half hour or so
to debate an aspect of Britain in which we are already world beaters. I
refer to the Hydyrographic Office, which is based in Taunton.</p><p><a name="06061538000542">It may be helpful to start by
explaining what the Hydrographic Office is, as some people do not know.
What it does&#151;I put it in layman&#146;s terms, claiming no
scientific expertise myself&#151;is chart the oceans, seas and
coastlines of the world. If we imagine an Ordnance Survey-style map
with contours showing the relief and lie of the land, that is what the
Hydrographic Office produces, but for underwater regions. It is a
constantly evolving task, as significant movements constantly occur
through sandbanks, pebbles and other underwater changes. A good topical
example is the tsunami, which had a dramatic impact on the ocean floor
in that part of the world. Some areas need to be mapped because the
water is particularly shallow or there may be rocks just under the
surface that pose a danger to shipping.</p><p><a name="06061538000543">The Hydrographic Office was set
up by George III in 1795. Britain was losing too many ships at sea, and
the Hydrographic Office was seen as a necessary response. The first
chart was produced in 1800 and the office has gone from strength to
strength ever since. Anyone who visits the Hydrographic Office&#151;I
hope that you,Mr. Deputy Speaker, and the Minister will have
that opportunity&#151;will see some fascinating artefacts. For
example, the first ever map of New Zealand, drawn by Captain Cook, can
be seen there. It was drawn before satellite technology and other
devices made it so much easier to produce maps to such a high standard.
It is a remarkable historical document, which puts into perspective the
long service of the Hydrographic Office&#151;now a world
beater.</p><p><a name="06061538000544">In using the
term &#147;world beater&#148;, I do not exaggerate because few
countries aspire to chart the world&#146;s oceans. Most countries
with a coastline cover the miles close to their own coasts and
particularly concentrate on areas with heavy shipping such as the
entrances to ports. However, there are very few countries across the
world that aspire to perform the task with excellence&#151;the United
States, Russia and France to some extent, and the United Kingdom. Most
people in the United States, Russia and France would accept that the
United Kingdom has the most eminent and professionally drawn charts.
Commercial practices bear that out. Shipping companies throughout the
world, many of which have no direct link with the UK, buy the charts
for their shipping from the Hydrographic Office based in
Taunton.</p><p><a name="06061538000545">At the last
general election, the Hydrographic Office loomed fairly large as an
election issue in Taunton. The James review commissioned by the
previous leader of the Conservative party recommended, as one of the
proposals adopted and accepted by the leader of the 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 963</b><br>Conservative party at that time, that the Hydrographic Office should be
privatised.</p><p><a name="06061538000546">There are
many compelling reasons why that would not be a wise course of action.
I do not intend to dwell on them at length, but there are issues in
relation to reciprocal arrangements with other countries, and possible
problems with insurance liabilities which are potentially enormous for
the Hydrographic Office. The service is so successful and so popular
that it makes money, so the case for privatising it on efficiency
grounds is less attractive than in other parts of the public sector.
Others may wish to contribute their thoughts on the ownership issue,
but I shall not dwell on
it.</p><p><a name="06061538000547">Instead, I shall
focus on the possibility that the Hydrographic Office will be moved
from Taunton to a proposed new site next to the Met Office in Exeter. I
shall suggest three reasons why I hope that the Government and the
Ministry of Defence will give much thought to that proposal and reject
it. The first relates to jobs and the economy of Taunton. People often
ask me who are the big employers in my constituency. We have some
fairly large private sector employers&#151;for example, Relyon, a bed
making company in Wellington in my constituency, and Swallowfield, a
company that makes aerosols, also located in Wellington, both of which
employ hundreds of people. If either of those were to close or move,
that would be extremely damaging to our local economy.</p><p><a name="06061538000548">In Taunton, interestingly,
there is no single big private sector employer. There are lots of
smaller service-type jobs, but because it is the county town for
Somerset, most of the jobs in Taunton reflect that status. The county
council is a significant employer. Musgrove Park hospital, which serves
most of Somerset and some parts of Devon as well, is a big employer,
and the UK Hydrographic Office is a very large and significant
employer. It employs around 1,000 people in the town and those jobs are
extremely
varied.</p><p><a name="06061538000549"><b><a name="06061538000963">David
Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I visit
Taunton frequently. My daughter lives there, is an accountant and works
in the area. A member of my family circle works at the Hydrographic
Office. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the key
characteristics that indicates that Taunton benefits significantly from
the presence of the Hydrographic Office is not just the number of jobs,
but the range of high skilled jobs that it provides? That lifts the
otherwise middling levels of income available from many other employers
in the
area.</p><p><a name="06061538000550"><b><a name="06061538000964">Mr.
Browne:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention is not
only extremely helpful, but extremely well informed. I was about to
make that point. A large number of the jobs at the Hydrographic Office
are high skilled jobs. It is a problem in an area like Somerset to keep
such skills and such levels of pay in our area. We have many jobs.
Compared to other parts of the country, we do not have a particular
problem with unemployment. We have a bigger problem offering the career
levels that mean that educated people with good qualifications do not
have to go and live in Bristol or London, but can stay in Taunton and
bring up their families there because suitable jobs are available in
the 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 964</b><br>locality. There are hundreds of jobs of that type at the Hydrographic
Office, which has a beneficial knock-on effect on shopping and other
services in Taunton.</p><p><a name="06061538000551"><b><a name="06061538000965">Mr.
Kevan Jones (North Durham) (Lab):</b> As a member of the
Defence Committee, I am impressed by the work of the Hydrographic
Office. However, if savings could be made by, for example, merging the
Hydrographic Office with the Met Office and moving the Hydrographic
Office from Taunton, why should my constituents in North Durham pay a
premium for keeping employment in
Taunton?</p><p><a name="06061538000552"><b><a name="06061538000966">Mr.
Browne:</b> That is a good point. I am vigilant in terms of
trying to ensure that public spending is as efficient as possible. If
the hon. Gentleman does not mind, I hope to cover that point later in
my speech.</p><p><a name="06061538000553">The
Hydrographic Office provides not only hundreds of skilled jobs, but a
wide variety of jobs. Most hon. Members would accept that those who
hold the maintenance and cleaning positions will not want to relocate
or to commute a long distance. Furthermore, the Hydrographic Office is
based in east Taunton, where it is surrounded by estates such as
Halcon, Lambrook and the Lane, which are some of the poorest parts of
Somerset. For those jobs to be available within walking distance of
those people&#146;s homes is an important stimulus to wealth creation
in east Taunton.</p><p><a name="06061538000554">It
has been suggested that people who live in Taunton will be able to
commute, because Exeter is only 35 miles down the M5. I accept that a
lot of the senior people would choose to commute in those
circumstances, but a lot of the junior people would not. A lot of the
people in the lower paid jobs at the Hydrographic Office would not
think a 70-mile round trip each day either affordable or desirable, so
those jobs would be filled by people who live in Exeter rather than by
people who live in Taunton. Furthermore, the commuters would eventually
retire and be replaced by people who would move not to Taunton, but to
Exeter. Over time, those 1,000 jobs would be whittled away until
Taunton derives no economic benefit from having previously had the
Hydrographic
Office.</p><p><a name="06061538000555">We are hearing
more from the Government about global warming and the need to reduce
car use, which is sensible, so it seems perverse that one of the
arguments for moving the service is that people will be able to drive
considerable distances to get
there.</p><p><a name="06061538000556"><b><a name="06061538000967">David
Taylor:</b> I was happy to co-sponsor the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s early-day motion 2328 last week, which is an
admirable pr&#233;cis of the case that he is making. Will he say a
word or two in the next three or four hours before the House rises on
how the news broke? Were employees or the local MP given any early
indication of the news, or did the news drop out of the blue sky and
into the weekly
paper?</p><p><a name="06061538000557"><b><a name="06061538000968">Mr.
Browne:</b> The hon. Gentleman has touched a raw nerve. Nobody
formally notified me of the process.</p><p><a name="06061538000558">I have discussed how 1,000
people in Taunton are employed directly by the Hydrographic Office,
which has a knock-on economic effect, but those are not any old 1,000
jobs. If 1,000 jobs were lost across the board, 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 965</b><br>it would have a serious impact on the economy of our area, but its
emotional effect on people in Taunton would be less profound than
moving the Hydrographic Office, because the Hydrographic Office has
been in Taunton for many years.</p><p><a name="06061538000559">The Hydrographic Office was
partly moved to Taunton during the second world war, and it was moved
in its entirety in the 1960s. Some families have worked there for
generations, and people have an attachment and affinity to it. They
have a great sense of pride in the fact that in Taunton we have not
only a national but an international institution&#151;a centre of
world renown and excellence. I should like to think&#151;and I
believe that most people in Taunton would accept this&#151;that there
is a real affinity and link between the town and the service. If one of
us went out into a street in London and said, &#147;What&#146;s the
Hydrographic Office and what does it do?&#148;, I suspect that the
person we chose to ask would not know the answer, but if we asked the
same question of anybody in the street in Taunton, they would know,
because everyone has a very clear sense of connection to
it.</p><p><a name="06061538000560">When I was first
shown round a few years ago, I asked what struck me as an obvious, if
possibly slightly rude, question&#151;&#147;Why on earth is the
Hydrographic Office based in Taunton?&#148; The person who was
showing me round said that one of the reasons why it was put there is
that it is roughly equidistant between Plymouth and Portsmouth. I had
never thought of it in those terms before. The other reason is that it
has very good communication links. It is now on the M5 motorway and on
an intercity train line. All those reasons apply just as much today, in
fact even more so, as they did when the decision was taken to move the
service from London to Taunton for security reasons during the second
world war.</p><p><a name="06061538000561">The last
of my three points is a slightly wider economic one. The Government
have decided that it is necessary for there to be a large expansion in
the number of houses in the south-west, with about a million extra
houses. We hear a lot, in this House and elsewhere, about population
growth in the south-east, but the south-west is another region that is
growing very quickly, much of it as a result of inward migration from
other parts of the United Kingdom. I accept the Government&#146;s
argument that it would probably not be desirable to have those 1
million houses scattered in a random fashion across what is
predominantly a rural region, and that it makes sense, in terms of
building communities and economically, for them to be concentrated in
hubs. One of the places that has been identified as a hub for extra
housing and development is Taunton, largely because of the excellent
communication links and geographical positioning that I
mentioned.</p><p><a name="06061538000562">As a
consequence, Taunton has been assigned more than 20,000 extra houses.
Although there is a need for extra house-building, many associated
issues and problems may arise from that extra development in terms of
traffic congestion and extra pressure on amenities such as schools and
the hospital, which has a very limited site and might have difficulty
expanding to cope with those extra numbers. Furthermore, the character
of what is essentially a county town will be 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 966</b><br>changed, some may think for the better, some may think for the worse, by
being expanded to that extent. Some people are uncomfortable about it,
but by and large they accept that it will happen. However, the quid pro
quo for the extra congestion and extra pressure on public services
should be that it will mean more jobs, more prosperity, and more
opportunities for people living in the town. If we are to get all the
downsides of expansion without the upsides, people in Taunton have a
right to say, &#147;Wait a second&#151;this isn&#146;t treating
us fairly or even-handedly.&#148;</p><p><a name="06061538000563">If a private company was taking
such a decision to relocate its jobs, I could have strong views about
that, but my powers of influence, and those of the Government, would be
limited. However, that is not so in this case. The Government are at
risk of running two completely contrary policies in two Departments.
One Department is earmarking Taunton for extra expansion, extra
development and extra jobs, thereby making it an economic centre, while
another Department, the Ministry of Defence, runs the risk of taking
away precisely the sort of high-value jobs that it is envisaged that
the people living in all these extra houses will be
doing.</p><p><a name="06061538000564"><b><a name="06061538000969">Mr.
Kevan Jones: </b>As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Defence
Committee has been conducting an inquiry about the Met Office and I
have attended the evidence sittings. Unless I have missed anything that
he or my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David
Taylor) have picked up about an immediate plan to move the Hydrographic
Office, the only evidence that we have taken so far about that and the
only reference to it came from a former chief executive who left the
Met Office under a bit of a cloud. Can the hon. Gentleman provide
evidence that, for example, the Minister deliberately did not tell the
Select Committee when he appeared before us a few weeks ago that an
announcement had been made? Clearly, the Minister did not say anything
about that when he appeared before us.</p><p><a name="06061538000565"><b><a name="06061538000970">Mr.
Browne:</b> I fear that the hon. Gentleman is being, perhaps
unintentionally, far more of a conspiracy theorist and more political
about the matter than I am trying to be. All I know is that no one
informed me, as Member of Parliament for Taunton, that moving the
service was being considered.</p><p><a name="06061538000566"><b><a name="06061538000971">Mr.
Jones:</b> I am not aware that any such consideration has
taken place. At the Select Committee meeting a few weeks ago, only a
former chief executive mentioned it. He referred to some plans that
were made several years ago when the Met Office moved from Bracknell to
Exeter. There were possible plans to move the Hydrographic Office. When
the Minister and civil servants gave evidence to the Select Committee,
there was no new announcement. The headlines may have been grabbed by a
former chief executive who said that he believed that it was a good
idea, but he clearly no longer speaks on behalf of the
Ministry.</p><p><a name="06061538000567"><b><a name="06061538000972">Mr.
Browne:</b> I am grateful for that intervention because no one
would be happier than me if the Minister got to his feet in a few
moments and said, &#147;No fuss is necessary and you should have no
worries. This 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 967</b><br>is a wild goose chase. It&#146;s not going to happen.&#148; We could
then all go home and I would be happy. People have asked me, &#147;Is
this a done deal? Is the move to Exeter set in stone?&#148; I have
said no. However, I understand&#151;and people at the Hydrographic
Office have confirmed it&#151;that the option is being considered.
</p><p><a name="06061538000568">If that is the case,
it is important that the Minister and other hon. Members appreciate
that, when one is sitting in Westminster or Whitehall, it may not
appear to make much difference whether the jobs and the office are
based in Taunton or Exeter. After all, they are both a long way west
and people here probably go down there only when they are on holiday.
On a map of Britain, there is only an inch or two between Taunton and
Exeter, so why should it matter that much in Whitehall? The purpose of
the debate is to explain that, in Taunton, it matters a great deal, for
the economic reasons and the emotional link that I outlined and because
of the importance of conducting the town&#146;s expansion coherently
and in a way that does not mean conflict between one part of Government
and another. </p><p><a name="06061538000569">That
brings me to the way forward and what I hope can be done.
Representatives of the Met Office who are based in Exeter appear keen
to make the case for locating the Hydrographic Office next to the Met
Office, to which one could use the immortal political phrase,
&#147;They would say that, wouldn&#146;t they?&#148; The instinct
of most people, in business and the public sector, is to try to expand
their domain. Having a bigger set-up in Exeter may feel more
prestigious to the people who are based in the Met Office at the
moment. </p><p><a name="06061538000570">However, I
would argue that not only is the effect of such a move on Taunton
potentially devastating, but it is not necessary in an era of global
communications when people can exchange information by e-mail rapidly.
If there is ever any need for people to meet face to face, that
opportunity exists because Taunton and Exeter are fairly close to each
other. The evidence suggests that it is not necessary to move because
an excellent service is being provided at a profit at the moment,
drawing on a pool of labour and good will in Taunton that is not
available anywhere else in the country.</p><p><a name="06061538000571">I accept that most of the
buildings where the Hydrographic Office is located are out of date. It
has had one new building recently. The buildings are not dysfunctional
but they are, in the current political phrase, not entirely fit for
purpose. Doubtless the office could perform to an even higher standard
if it were located in superior premises. I support that idea. Given
that the Hydrographic Office is in not only a prestigious but an
economically successful part of the Ministry of Defence, the case for
investment in new buildings is compelling.</p><p><a name="06061538000572">I am open minded about
relocating the Hydrographic Office within Taunton and about it being
the centrepiece of another development elsewhere in the town. However,
I would prefer it to stay in its current location in the eastern part
of Taunton, not least because, according to most indicators, that is
the poorest part of the town. Having the service and magnet for job
creation in that part of town is a valuable consideration for those who
live in Taunton.</p><p><a name="06061538000573">There
is a need to invest in the service to improve in its physical
facilities. There is not, however, a need to 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 968</b><br>throw the baby out with the bathwater by relocating the service in its
entirety. It has been in Taunton in its entirety for almost 40 years,
and has had some presence there since the second world war. It has
consistently performed to the highest standard; there are very few
features of government that can be seen to have performed with such
routine excellence over the years as the Hydrographic Office. The town
has a huge emotional attachment to the office that goes back over the
generations, and it has stood by the office, served it and been proud
of it for many decades. The nation&#146;s interests, as well as those
of Somerset and Taunton, would be well served by giving the town the
opportunity to stand by, serve and have people working at the
Hydrographic Office in Taunton for many more decades to
come.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061538000675">3.25

must say to him, however, that although he has made a great entrance
into the Chamber, he has not yet learned all the ropes. Last week, when
he applied for an Adjournment debate, he should have known that there
was a possibility that he would be on his feet while England were
playing in the World cup. However, older hands seem to have let him off
the hook this afternoon. I thank our friends from Wales who concluded
their business early so that the true-blooded Englishmen in the House
can conclude their affairs as well as taking on the serious issues of
the UK Hydrographic Office. I say to them, &#147;Diolch i
Gymru&#148;&#151; &#147;Thank you, Wales&#148;.</p><p><a name="06061538000576">Let me begin by agreeing
wholeheartedly with the hon. Gentleman that the Hydrographic Office is
a huge national asset. I did not expect, when I became Minister for
Veterans, that I would find myself responsible for safety of life at
sea as well. But, on a personal level, I am immensely proud to have
responsibility for what is, by common international consent, the best
hydrographic authority in the world, bar none. The hon. Gentleman paid
tribute to the other countries that have noted that. Its reputation has
been carefully built up over 200 years through the dedication and
talent of its
people.</p><p><a name="06061538000577">The need for a
national hydrographic office arose at the end of the 18th century, when
the Royal Navy required more reliable charts, as the hon. Gentleman
pointed out. He failed to mention, however, that in 1795, Alexander
Dalrymple was appointed the first hydrographer of the
Navy&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;A fine
man!&#148;] He was indeed. He was tasked with collecting, sorting and
cataloguing charts and surveys and with producing the charts needed by
the fleet. Since then, the Hydrographic Office has carved out its role
as a world authority and the provider of data essential to safe marine
navigation.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 969</b><br><p><a name="06061538000578">The Hydrographic Office supplies
most of the world&#146;s merchant fleet with charts and publications,
and it is the UK&#146;s national hydrographic authority. Its mission
is to meet national, defence and civil needs for charts and other
hydrographic information in support of safe navigation. The
Hydrographic Office also discharges the Government&#146;s
responsibility under the UN convention on the safety of life at sea.
This includes providing round-the-clock radio navigational warnings as
part of an international network. Through all those endeavours, the
Hydrographic Office is instrumental in keeping safe the lives of
millions of
mariners.</p><p><a name="06061538000579"><b><a name="06061538000974">David
Taylor:</b> Would the Minister say, in his encomium to the
Hydrographic Office, that it is indeed fit for purpose? Will
he&#151;a young, talented and aspiring Minister&#151;resist the
ministerial merger mania that seems to affect other people of his
category when they get their hands of the levers of state? Will he lay
to rest, at least for the time being, the rumours to which the hon.
Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)
referred?</p><p><a name="06061538000580"><b><a name="06061538000975">Mr.
Watson:</b> What a pleasant surprise it is to discover that,
and how lucky I am that, my hon. Friend&#146;s daughter works for the
UK Hydrographic
Office.</p><p><a name="06061538000581"><b><a name="06061538000976">David
Taylor:</b> No, she works near Taunton; it is a colleague of
hers who works
there.</p><p><a name="06061538000582"><b><a name="06061538000977">Mr.
Watson:</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s daughter&#146;s friend
works for the UK Hydrographic Office and has apprised him of the
excellent work it does. If my hon. Friend allows me to develop my
argument a little further, he might get the answer that he is looking
for; then again, he might
not.</p><p><a name="06061538000583">With about 1,000
staff, including many highly skilled cartographers and geographic
information specialists, the Hydrographic Office is one of the largest
employers in Somerset, so the point that the hon. Member for Taunton
makes about its importance to his constituency is well made; I
understand that argument. The Hydrographic Office is an organisation
with an international outlook, in keeping with the international nature
of the world merchant fleet that it supports, yet it has still been
working to raise its profile and become more involved in the local
community. Judging by the response to speculation in the local press,
that has obviously been very successful.
<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> That story has even found its way
to Leicestershire and brought Members to the Chamber from as far away
as the north-east to discuss the UKHO&#146;s
future.</p><p><a name="06061538000584">By any
standards, therefore, the UKHO has been a huge success, and I am
determined that my Department build on that. However, for my Department
to do so, the organisation needs to face new challenges, including
stronger international competition and the growing market for digital,
rather than paper, products. Given those challenges, we are thinking
carefully about the future of the UKHO, and whether its status as a
trading fund continues to be the best way of building a positive and
successful future. It 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 970</b><br>is right that we should think about such issues, especially at a time
when the Government are carrying out the comprehensive spending
review.</p><p><a name="06061538000585"><b><a name="06061538000978">Mr.
Fraser Kemp (Houghton and Washington, East) (Lab):</b> I
understand the emphasis on moving toward digital, but does my hon.
Friend agree that paper charts and knowing how to read them remain
essential, and that we should not go the whole way towards electronic
methods, because there are dangers in doing so? I speak as someone who,
during the parliamentary recess, navigated Loch Teacuis&#151;one of
the remotest lochs in the UK&#151;using a 1934 paper chart. It is
important that paper charts continue to play a significant part in the
nation&#146;s seafaring ways.</p><p><a name="06061538000586"><b><a name="06061538000979">Mr.
Watson:</b> As you know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, my hon. Friend
has a reputation for being a salty sea dog; he is a great seafarer and
mariner and I pay tribute to his skills. When I tested the argument for
moving to digital technology with the chief executive of the UK
Hydrographic Office, he told me that&#151;unlike in the case of
ordnance survey mapping, where there has been a transition to digital
mapping&#151;mariners still place a traditional value on maps, and
that many still prefer them to digital ones. So my hon. Friend&#146;s
point is a good one well
made.</p><p><a name="06061538000587">As I was saying,
it is right that we think about these issues, especially at a time when
the Government are carrying out the comprehensive spending review. For
that reason, my Department is considering the future of all its trading
funds as part of a wider examination of defence support functions, in
order to maximise the resources that we can make available to the front
line. The consideration that we are giving to the future of the UKHO is
thus not only our duty to the organisation and its staff, but is part
of a wider obligation to the taxpayer that I hope all hon. Members
recognise.</p><p><a name="06061538000588">In view of
the points made by the hon. Member for Taunton, it might help if I
disentangle some of the facts from the speculation. To begin with, in
effect, we are carrying out some
pre-thinking<i> &#151;[Interruption.]</i> Bear with me. We are
carrying out such thinking to determine whether it is worth instituting
a formal review, and, if so, what ground it should cover. As I have
said, the basic issue is whether trading fund status is the best status
to enable the UKHO to succeed as a provider of key Government services
and as a successful commercial
concern.</p><p><a name="06061538000589"><b><a name="06061538000980">Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> Two issues arise from the Minister&#146;s
remarks. How long will the pre-thinking&#151;and, indeed, the
post-thinking&#151;take, and is he saying that what is at issue is
the structure and that the location is not in question and will remain
in Taunton regardless of the conclusions of the pre-thinking
process?</p><p><a name="06061538000590"><b><a name="06061538000981">Mr.

question in a little
while.</p><p><a name="06061538000591">The
outcome of that work has not yet been presented to me, although I
expect to see it in the next few weeks. When I do, I will weigh the
arguments presented and decide for myself what steps to take
next.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 971</b><br><p><a name="06061538000592"><b><a name="06061538000982">Mr.

comment on the issue? I would not want him to make decisions before the
result of our deliberations over the past few months on this issue and
the Met Office&#146;s

<p><a name="06061538000593"><b><a name="06061538000983">Mr.
Watson:</b> I can certainly give my hon. Friend that
assurance. I am awaiting the report with some
excitement.</p><p><a name="06061538000594"><b><a name="06061538000984">David
Taylor:</b> My hon. Friend has introduced a fascinating new
concept, but can he reassure us that pre-thinking and post-thinking are
not substitute words for instinct and emotion? This decision has to be
taken on rational grounds, and I am sure that with my hon. Friend at
the helm and others charting the course, we will be able to find safe
haven at the end of the
day.</p><p><a name="06061538000595"><b><a name="06061538000985">Mr.
Watson:</b> I can assure my hon. Friend that my pre-thinking
will be rational. I will of course write to the hon. Member for Taunton
to let him know my conclusion. He mentioned being kept informed and I
will ensure that that happens at all stages. If he needs to come and
speak to me or officials about it, I make him the offer to do so,
because I would like him to be involved in the
process.</p><p><a name="06061538000596"><b><a name="06061538000986">Mr.
Browne:</b> I am grateful for that offer. I also have a
meeting with the outgoing chief executive of UKHO tomorrow. His
replacement starts in a month&#146;s time and I intend to keep in
close touch with him as well. Through the Minister, may I make an offer
to all the members of the Defence Committee to come down to Taunton,
before they start making recommendations, and spend an induction day at
UKHO so that they can see the expertise and the standards of service?
Members of the Committee might also be able to speak to some of the
people in Taunton who do not work at UKHO to gain an understanding of
the affection for and affinity with the service that the town
has.</p><p><a name="06061538000597"><b><a name="06061538000987">Mr.
Watson:</b> The best way to answer that is to undertake to
send a copy of <i> Hansard </i>to the Chairman of the Defence
Committee.</p><p><a name="06061538000598">Let me
also take this opportunity to give a categorical assurance that no
secret decisions are involved. There is no hidden agenda and I am clear
that trading fund status has brought many benefits to UKHO, to the
Ministry of Defence and to the taxpayer more widely. I would therefore
need to be convinced by evidence and facts that there was a case to
tinker with what historically has been a successful structure. Against
that, however, I can see a potential argument that a status closer to
the private sector might give greater assurance of commercial success
in an increasingly competitive international marketplace. It is right
therefore that we examine that idea a little further. That is what we
are now doing. A compelling case for change would have to be made, and
so far I have not seen the evidence to make that
case.</p><br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 972</b><br><p><a name="06061538000599">The hon. Member also raised the
separate question of the possible relocation of the Hydrographic
Office. The Hydrographic Office has indeed identified that its current
premises are ageing and coming to the end of their useful life. It is,
therefore, examining options for the future. In order to ensure the
best overall outcome, it is rightly looking at a range of options,
including both redevelopment of its current site&#151;as the hon.
Gentleman mentioned&#151;and relocation. The work will take a few
months to complete. Again, no conclusions have been reached. The final
decision will be taken by me, as the ministerial &#147;owner&#148;,
but I hope that the hon. Member for Taunton will contribute to the
consultation process. As the House would expect, my decision will be
based on what will provide the most effective and efficient solution,
and deliver best value for money to the
taxpayer.</p><p><a name="06061538000600">The hon.
Member for Taunton highlighted the possibility of co-locating UKHO with
the Met Office in Exeter. That is one of the possibilities being looked
at, since it is obviously logical to explore relocation to an existing
MOD site in the same broad geographic area. I take his point about
motorway journeys, and I understand Taunton&#146;s geography, but
colleagues would rightly be surprised if we were not considering the
possibility as part of our overall examination of the current
facilities. As I made clear to the Defence Committee, I shall reach a
decision based on the evidence and the business case when they are
complete and presented to
me.</p><p><a name="06061538000601"><b><a name="06061538000988">Mr.
Jones:</b> Will my hon. Friend the Minister confirm that
neither he nor his officials have ever mentioned the co-location
possibility in evidence to the Defence Committee? Does he agree that
the only person who thought it a good idea was a previous chief
executive, who gave evidence when neither my hon. Friend nor his
officials were
present?</p><p><a name="06061538000602"><b><a name="06061538000989">Mr.
Watson:</b> I shall have to check the transcript, but I am
sure that I said that I needed to see a compelling case for change in
respect of the UKHO, and I reiterate that
now.</p><p><a name="06061538000603">I assure the hon.
Member for Taunton that I will not be blind to his views or those of
his constituents on the matter, and that I shall weigh very carefully
the points that he has put to me so fully and forthrightly this
afternoon. I give him an undertaking that I shall listen equally
closely to any further representations that he or other hon. Members
wish to make nearer the time of a
decision.</p><p><a name="06061538000604">Let me also
clarify that the issue of possible relocation to Exeter is one matter,
but that an organisational merger with the Met Office is quite another.
Again, the Defence Committee has heard evidence in favour of that
reorganisation from some quarters, and has urged that it be considered.
As I confirmed to the Committee, we are looking at that option as part
of our high-level consideration of the future of both the UKHO and the
Met Office, but I repeat that no compelling case has been made to me in
that respect either. Any decision in that regard will be based on the
evidence provided by officials.</p><p><a name="06061538000605">In conclusion, I hope that my
remarks this evening have clarified matters, and given the hon. Member
for 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 973</b><br>Taunton the assurances that he sought. For the longer term, we must
await the outcome of the work that I have described, but I remain open
to any further representations on the matter that he would like to
make.</p><p><a name="06061538000606"><b><a name="06061538000990">Mr.

response to the debate, but I seek one further clarification. He said
that the pre-thinking phase would last only a few weeks, but my
constituents might ask about the date by which a firm decision about
the UKHO&#146;s location and exact ownership status will be made.
What should I tell them? The most important matter is the
office&#146;s location: will a firm decision be 
<br><notus-date day="15" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>15 Jun 2006 : Column 974</b><br>made in a month, two months, next year or the year after that, or will
the process drag on for a very long
time?</p><p><a name="06061538000607"><b><a name="06061538000991">Mr.

will write to him about
it.</p><p><a name="06061538000608">We all share the
same goals for the Hydrographic Office: continued vibrancy, continued
vitality and, above all, continued success. By working together, I know
that we can secure a prosperous future for the office for the next 200
