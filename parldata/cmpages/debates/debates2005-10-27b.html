 (Lab): How she expects proposals in the &quot;Youth Matters&quot; Green Paper will provide incentives for young people to engage in positive activities. [22041]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="51027-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Children and Families  (Beverley Hughes): </b> 
 We want to put more power into the hands of young people to give them more say. We will support local authorities to pilot opportunity cards to enable young people to take part in more positive activities, and we will provide a local opportunity fund, backed by a capital fund, to be spent in conjunction with young people. We will ensure that provision meets national standards and responds to local demand by placing a statutory duty on local authorities to secure access for young people to positive activities.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="51027-01_spnew0"><b> Stephen Hesford: </b> 
 I am obliged to my right hon. Friend for that answer. I welcome the Green Paper &quot;Youth Matters&quot;, but more importantly students in my constituency welcome it. As she may know, I have carried out a consultation in four schools in my constituency, three of which I have visited and one of which has made a written submission. In the light of the enthusiasm that they have shown for the questions posed by this enlightened Green Paper, will she assure me that the avalanche of responses that she will have from my students will be fully taken into account?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="51027-01_spnew1"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 Indeed I can. I thank my hon. Friend and colleagues throughout the House who did a great deal during the summer months to talk to young people and to give them the young people&#039;s version of the questionnaire, which I am sure has made a big difference to the number of responses. We have had about 3,000&nbsp;responses so far from young people alone,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I expect that to double by the end of the consultation. Young people are broadly very positive about the proposals in the Green Paper and we shall certainly take their views into account when we give our response.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 436</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Green&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paper can play in engaging young people in services? The all-party group on youth affairs met for the first time in this Parliament yesterday and had a lively and interesting discussion with the young people who attended. One of the points that they raised was their hope that the Government&#039;s vision included not just demand-side subsidies through the opportunity card, but a commitment to supply-side investment in young people&#039;s services. Will my right hon. Friend reassure me that in the years ahead the Government will be making more of a priority of investment in young people&#039;s services?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="51027-01_spnew3"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 The supply-side mechanisms that we have included in the Green Paper are important, precisely because they will require local authorities and others to take account of which activities young people decide to take up. So that has been an important ingredient. However, I take my hon. Friend&#039;s point that the supply side is also important. It is encouraging to note that during 2003&#150;04&nbsp;and 2005&#150;06&nbsp;local authorities increased their funding by 12&nbsp;per cent. and the out-turn for 2003&#150;04&nbsp;was considerably higher even than the budget requirement. There is a growing recognition that more needs to be done to invest in activities and opportunities for young people, and local authorities are taking that very seriously.

 (LD): What does the Minister think that it says about the Government&#039;s commitment to young people&#039;s participation in democracy that we invest in giving citizenship education to young people up to the age of 16, but deny them the right to use a vote until they are 18?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="51027-01_spnew5"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 Clearly, there are many views on the issue. I spent some time discussing it with young people&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;during the consultation process and there is considerable support for a vote at 16, but I do not think that anyone would want to introduce that until we could ensure that young people would use it in significant numbers. As we know, there are tremendous pressures on young people, and that is not top of the list for many 16&nbsp;and 17-year-olds, although I accept that it is an issue for some. We will have to go down that route when we are sure that that is what the majority of young people would not only want but use.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="51027-01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Phil Hope): </b> 
 Involving young people in decision making is essential if we are to ensure that services meet their needs, and local authorities are required to consult young people while developing their&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children and young people&#039;s plan. As my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children and Families has just been saying, the new youth opportunity card, announced in the &quot;Youth Matters&quot; Green Paper, will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;develop that involvement further. I urge all hon. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 437</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Members to encourage their local authorities to involve young people in decision making. I draw attention to the participation works initiative, launched only yesterday, which provides online useful services to help young people involved in participation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="51027-01_spnew6"><b> Rosie Cooper: </b> 
 In West Lancashire, there are 118&nbsp;unemployed 16&nbsp;to 18-year-olds and just 20&nbsp;live vacancies. I want the local authority and various organisations and partnerships to be very much involved in planning services that best meet their training, education and employment needs. How can the Minister help me to do that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="51027-01_spnew7"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 As my hon. Friend will know, young people become disengaged for a wide variety of reasons. They often need individual personal support to work out their needs and to gain access to opportunities such as education, training and jobs. My hon. Friend is right to suggest that local partnerships such as children&#039;s trusts should provide opportunities for young people to access those services at the best time and in the best place. She might like to consider ways in which young people can be involved in planning such services by taking part in discussion and working groups with youth workers and others to find out what their needs are and how to meet them. In Lancashire, some of those&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;partners are setting up an internet TV project to generate views about such issues so that services can be responsive to their needs.

 (Con): Is the Minister aware that in the City of Westminster the council recently threw open swimming pools across the borough for young people between the ages of 11&nbsp;and 18&nbsp;to use them after school free of charge? Is not that exactly the type of provision that should be available under opportunity cards, and will the Minister commend it to other excellent authorities around the country?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="51027-01_spnew9"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 I am glad that some of our policies are making a splash at last. We often identify examples of good practice where local authorities and partners listen to the needs of young people and open up opportunities for them to participate. That is a great thing to do. I only wish that in the Tories&#039; manifesto at the last election they had bothered to mention the participation of young people&#151;an absence that spoke volumes about the priority that they give to young people&#039;s needs.
</p>

 (Lab): In light of what my hon. Friend says about the importance of involving young people, will he join me in welcoming an initiative in Northfield, where a young people&#039;s forum has been set up and given a budget top-sliced from money devolved from the city council? Does he agree that putting in such material resources can help, but that the challenge of reaching hard-to-reach young people involves more resources going into young people&#039;s services globally?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="51027-01_spnew11"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. It is good to hear of another example of local authorities devolving budgets to young people to enable them to take responsibility for resources and to work with other

<a name="stpa_o1">Another scheme that has been set up in various parts of the country is that of youth banks, whereby young people control resources and have to decide which grants should go to other groups of young people in the community.

<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="51027-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Ruth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelly): </b> 
 Provisional results for 2005&nbsp;show that 55.7&nbsp;per cent. of 15-year-olds achieved five or more GCSEs or equivalent at grades A* to C. That is an increase of two percentage points on last year&#151;the biggest year-on-year rise for more than a decade. It means that more than 63,000&nbsp;more pupils are now achieving five good GCSEs or equivalent than did so in 1997. I congratulate pupils, teachers and their schools on that tremendous achievement.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="51027-02_spnew0"><b> Kerry McCarthy: </b> 
 Although GCSE results have improved across Bristol, we know that there is still some way to go. The same could be said of staying-on rates in full-time education for 16&nbsp;and 17-year-olds, which stand at 74&nbsp;per cent. and 58&nbsp;per cent. respectively. Will the Secretary of State comment on how the proposals in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Paper will help to address that situation?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="51027-02_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right to draw attention to the scandalously low staying-on rates in this country. Britain has one of the lowest staying-on rates in the entire industrialised world, and Bristol has one of the lowest staying-on rates in Britain. We have to transform that. We have a target for improving staying-on rates from an average of 75&nbsp;per cent. to 90&nbsp;per cent. over the next 10&nbsp;years. We will do that by introducing specialised diplomas that mix vocational and academic education and allow people to study subjects that interest them in the places that interest them in the ways that interest them.

 Will the Secretary of State join me in congratulating College high school in my constituency? This year, its GCSE results improved by a phenomenal 200&nbsp;per cent. to 34&nbsp;per cent. good passes from a disastrous 11&nbsp;per cent. last year. Will my right hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend reflect on the fact that the school is now finally fully staffed, successfully federated and making massive strides mainly because it has its third head in little more than two years? Schools should not trundle along in special measures while another generation of working-class kids gets written off. A failing school is not only a tragedy but an emergency. We cannot all go to Eton, can we?

<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="51027-02_spnew3"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I send my personal congratulations to all the pupils and teachers at the school in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency. It is a tremendous achievement, although I hope that it is only the first step on a long journey to securing even better results. My hon. Friend is right: in rare but nevertheless too many cases schools have languished in special measures, not only for one or two years but sometimes for five or six. That must come to an end. That is why I proposed in the education White Paper that if a school had not made rapid progress within a year of being put into special measures, something radical should be considered, including federating with a more successful school, which my hon. Friend gave as an example.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="51027-02_spnew4"><b> Mark Pritchard  (The Wrekin)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Secretary of State share my concern that many of those who attain five GCSEs do not study languages? Will she&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give an undertaking to review the languages that are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taught in our schools? In the context of global competition, will she consider adding Chinese and Urdu to the curriculum? Let me stress that there are some working-class kids on the Conservative Benches, too.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="51027-02_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to the need to promote modern foreign language teaching in our schools. Chinese is one of the fastest-growing modern languages in schools, with more and more opting to teach it as a specialism. Perhaps the best way to make our children enthusiastic about modern foreign languages is to teach them at primary school. That is why we have made a commitment that, by 2010, every child over the age of seven should learn at least one foreign language at primary school.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="51027-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Andrew Mackay  (Bracknell)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Secretary of State accept that her first duty is to protect the integrity of the GCSE examinations? Does she further accept that results should never be massaged so that schools appear to be doing better than they are? That does a huge disservice to the pupils.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="51027-02_spnew7"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I completely agree with the right hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentleman that we should preserve the integrity of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GCSEs. Recently, the director of education at the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reviewed our system for preserving the integrity of GCSEs and said that he knew of no more robust system in the world.

It almost doubled its GCSE results from 26&nbsp;per cent. in 2004&#150;05&nbsp;to just under 50&nbsp;per cent. this year. Will she reassure me and my constituents that the Government will continue to support and promote with employers and parents vocational GCSEs as an equal alternative to traditional GCSE courses? That is what they want and value.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="51027-02_spnew9"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I certainly send congratulations to Churchfields school on its remarkable success in improving its GCSE results. My hon. Friend is right; vocational qualifications are hugely important and they have been undervalued in this country for generations. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 440</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>We need to start taking them seriously. That is why, later this autumn, I shall publish a delivery plan for implementing our 14 to 19-year-old specialised diplomas. They will, for the first time, give our young people genuine chances to study vocational qualifications of a high quality, which lead on to the next qualification and can even take students into higher education.
</p>

 (Con): Does the Secretary of State agree with last week&#039;s BBC research, which showed that not enough young people in our most improving schools were achieving A* to C grades in English and maths? Does she accept that the foundations of numeracy and literacy are laid at primary school, yet 44&nbsp;per cent. of children leaving primary school are unable to read, write or count to the desired standard?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="51027-02_spnew11"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman should study the record a bit more closely. Fifty-seven per cent. of our young people achieve the expected standard in reading, writing and arithmetic by the time they leave primary school. If we turn the clock back eight years, we find that figure reversed to 43&nbsp;per cent. That achievement has been made after 50&nbsp;years of no progress at all in raising primary school standards. Yes, I agree that we have to go further with English and maths, but I do not accept that schools have been downgrading their emphasis on those subjects because they are promoting vocational qualifications. Of course they must do more with English and maths; that is why we are making the GCSEs harder and why we are changing the league tables to ensure that schools reflect English and maths qualifications in the five GCSE results.

 (Lab/Co-op): Sadly, earlier this week the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced her plans to enfeeble and marginalise local education authorities. While she still has the opportunity, would she care to pay tribute to the county of Leicestershire&#151;which is not Labour controlled&#151;for successively achieving record GCSE results despite persistently being the worst funded shire county authority under both the previous Conservative Administration and our own?

 I have a lot of respect for my hon. Friend, who I know takes these issues extremely seriously. I pay tribute to the work that has been done in Leicestershire to achieve this year&#039;s record results and I hope that the county will move from strength to strength. I should like to reassure my hon. Friend that there is a real role for local authorities in the education White Paper. I should also like to cite the view of the Local Government Association, which stated that it welcomes the new strategic role that has been given to local authorities.

 In Wellingborough, the Government have allowed a secondary school to be demolished, resulting in the overcrowding of all the other secondary schools, children being bussed out of the county for their education and others being left at home receiving no education at all.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o31"><a name="51027-02_spnew15"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Our first duty is to ensure that every school is a good school. We have already halved the number of failing schools over the past eight years. GCSE results are at record levels this year, and we have seen their biggest rise for more than a decade. However, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to suggest that we have to go further. We have to enable schools to develop their own ethos, to link up with an external partner and to drive their results even higher. That is how we are going to promote choice in the system&#151;by ensuring that every school is a good school and that all parents have the opportunity to choose between them.

There is no question that she and the Prime Minister have the best interests of young people at heart, but many of us fear that the proposals could be damaging to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many young people in Tyne Bridge and similar constituencies up and down the country. Will she undertake to enter into meaningful discussions with colleagues, particularly on the Labour Benches, before she pins her colours too firmly to the mast in this White Paper?

<p><a name="st_o33"><a name="51027-02_spnew17"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I can certainly give my hon. Friend that assurance. The proposals in the White Paper are about driving up standards across the board, but they are particularly about meeting the needs of the most disadvantaged pupils in our schools in the most disadvantaged areas. We will do that by ensuring that those schools have the opportunity to get really professional help, to federate with successful schools, and to develop a sense of purpose and mission. If we combine those measures with really good choice for all parents and with the extension of free school transport rights, we will serve the needs not only of the nation but of disadvantaged pupils in particular.

 My hon. Friend makes the important point that when schools set their own admissions framework it ought to be within a national system that ensures fairness for everybody.

I have said that I will shortly lay regulations before the House that will ensure that when looked-after children are considered, for example, they have top priority when it comes to determining admissions for any particular school. When a child has special educational needs, that child will have automatic right to the school that is named in their statement.

The situation is getting worse because of Government housing targets. The high school, which is in a new building, simply cannot expand; the girls and boys grammar schools could.

He is absolutely right that I do not want grammar schools to expand. I said it clearly in this House and I will continue to affirm it at every opportunity in this House. Nor can I understand why the expansion of grammar schools in his constituency is the best way to meet need. If there is space at those grammar schools, there should be non-selective education built to meet the needs of children in that area.

 (Lab): My right hon. Friend knows that I wrote to her when she was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appointed to express my concerns over the choice agenda, particularly regarding the schools in her constituency and mine, and in Bolton&#039;s third parliamentary constituency. She is, of course, to allow good schools to expand. That will be detrimental to the schools in my constituency of Bolton, South-East. How does she define a good school?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o41"><a name="51027-02_spnew25"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to have concerns about his constituency, but those concerns are not substantiated in the White Paper. Indeed, in Bolton we have good leadership capacity expanding throughout the system, with the head teacher of Rivington and Blackrod high school becoming executive principal of Labybridge school&#151;a new school that was in special measures over a number of years&#151;and driving up standards, including a 5&nbsp;per cent. rise in GCSE results this year. It is now able to help other schools to improve as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-02_para2">
<a name="stpa_o4">That is the system that I would like to be much more easily available to all schools in the country so that good leadership can expand, we can bring up the capacity of underperforming schools and every pupil has the opportunity to share in that success.

 (LD): Will the Secretary of State confirm that under the White Paper she is not proposing to make the admissions code legally binding on schools? Will she also confirm that under the White Paper every school in the country could become its own admissions authority and be able to set its own policy with her as the ultimate arbiter? If that is all true, how can we be confident about fair admissions, given her recent ruling on the Oratory school in which she backed selection by parental interview&#151;against her own admissions code?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o43"><a name="51027-02_spnew27"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The White Paper introduces no change on admissions apart from toughening up the admissions procedures. The hon. Gentleman points to the current situation for foundation schools whereby rather than the local authority setting the catchment area or determining admissions, the school does. It does that within a fair admissions code, however, which is backed up on a statutory basis by the adjudicator. The adjudicator can rule on whether that admissions code has been preserved or whether there was a very good reason why the school could not abide by the admissions code, in which case it is referred to the Secretary of State. In the case to which he refers, the advice that I was given was completely unequivocal&#151;there was no room whatever for discretion for the particular circumstances that pertained at that school. I hope that he will accept that our proposals are based on fair admissions, unlike those of the Conservative party, which would return us to a system of selection.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>procedures does she intend to put in place to protect those children in schools whose numbers might be falling?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o45"><a name="51027-02_spnew29"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I must disagree with my hon. Friend, even though she raises an interesting point. The freedom that we are granting for schools is to set their own admissions arrangements, within the fair code of admissions, and to manage their own assets and employ their own staff, but to work in collaboration with other schools. That is what divides us from the Conservative party. Our framework has local authorities as the strategic leaders of the system, rather than the system being run directly from Whitehall, with every school fighting for its own survival&#151;the survival of the fittest. As to what will replace the school organisation committee in the process, local authorities will do so, because that is what they need to perform a fully strategic role, which they have requested.

 (Con): What automatic additional freedoms will an individual school opting for trust status have compared with a school currently opting for foundation status?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o47"><a name="51027-02_spnew31"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The White Paper sets out to make the freedoms for self-governing foundation schools much more easily available to trust schools. Those trust schools will negotiate with the Department for Education and Skills, using the power to innovate, which is already in the curriculum, to enable them to set the educational model for their school. That might mean greater vocational programmes, linking up with a local employer, or the sort of situation that we see in Knowsley, for instance. Once that is negotiated for one such school, however, it can be quickly applied to all the schools under its trust.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o48"><a name="51027-02_spnew32"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b> 
 What is interesting about that reply is that the real answer is none&#151;there are no automatic extra freedoms, and none of them apply to individual schools. If the differences are not significant, is it not hard to believe that this limited trust status will prove that popular? Will the Secretary of State tell us how she&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plans to measure progress? In particular, what proportion of schools does she expect to take up trust status by the end of 2007?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o49"><a name="51027-02_spnew33"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I expect that many schools will want to take up trust status&#151;over time, perhaps the majority. Success will be determined, however, by how far trusts are able to raise performance in our school system. The hon. Gentleman is right that this has not just been dreamed up in the Department for Education and Skills; it is already working on the ground, in many parts of the country, to raise standards. For schools that want to go down that route, we want to make it as easily available as possible. That is the idea behind a trust school; it is about bringing in expert governance, linking to an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;external provider, enabling collaboration within a system in which such schools have freedom to manage their own assets and employ their own staff, and driving improvement throughout the system&#151;unlike the old grant-maintained system in which schools were bribed to opt out of the system, to define themselves against other schools in the system and to opt for academic selection.

 The Government are broadly maintaining overall public spending to support adult learning, on average, until 2007&#150;08, but we are shifting priorities in line with the national skills strategy to provide more longer and expensive courses to equip adults for employability. Less public funding will be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;available for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leisure and recreation, so adults in non-priority areas will need to pay more, but at an average hourly cost of &#163;1.94 by 2008, I think that is still a very good deal.

 Last Friday the Learning and Skills Council announced that there would be 230,000&nbsp;fewer adults in education by 2007&#150;08. Surely that contradicts our commitment to lifelong learning. Will the Minister look again, seriously, at funding for adult education?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o52"><a name="51027-03_spnew1"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 That figure relates to publicly funded adult education. Part of the strategy means that if adults&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value the provision, we must ask them to pay a little more. Faced with a choice between supporting adult skills for the purpose of employability and to drive up productivity, and supporting adult leisure and recreation, I am convinced of which is the higher priority and where the money should go.

Where is the freedom for further education colleges when they are forced to remove half a million places&#151;half a million people&#039;s chances to learn skills that, in today&#039;s world, the country desperately needs in order to meet the demands of local businesses? Is the Minister proud of the fact that he is scrapping courses leading to, for instance, a certificate in care skills, a foundation certificate in meat and poultry hygiene, a Red Cross qualification in preparing for an emergency, the award in providing a healthier school meals service, or the St. John&#039;s Ambulance lifesaver for babies and children?

 There is no reason why our funding announcement should mean that those courses will go, but I will take no lectures from the Conservative party about further education funding.

However, we still have to do more. My hon. Friend referred to children on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the at-risk register, not all of whom would be looked-after children. There is no doubt that such very vulnerable children can face far more obstacles in ensuring that they progress as well as other children during their school years. The increasing emphasis that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we are placing on targeted and personalised support&#151;not only for the gifted and talented, but for the vulnerable&#151;should ensure that such children get the proper support that they need when they need it, in order to overcome the extra obstacles that they face.

That often presents difficulties, making it more likely that such children miss more chunks of their schooling than others. We need to do more and we have a target to try to ensure greater stability in placement, which the Department is currently striving hard to reach. The further effort that we are going to put into targeted and personalised support&#151;identifying the needs of these children through the children&#039;s trust arrangements, which will ensure that every child has more support at an earlier stage&#151;will be an important step forward and help to ensure that these children are not left behind, languishing at the bottom of the pile, as too many of them currently do.

<p><a name="st_o79"><a name="51027-04_spmin2"><b>The Solicitor-General  (Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien): </b> 
 The prosecutor&#039;s pledge announced by the Attorney-General on 21&nbsp;October reinforces the Government&#039;s commitment to victims. Under it, prosecutors commit themselves to improved contact with victims about the progress of a case. Also, the &quot;No Witness, No Justice&quot; programme, a joint initiative with the police, ensures that victims are kept informed about a case through local witness care units.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o80"><a name="51027-04_spnew4"><b> Dr. Naysmith: </b> 
 I thank my hon. and learned Friend for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that interesting reply. Does he believe that the prosecution can prevent publication and inappropriate reporting about victims in the media?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o81"><a name="51027-04_spmin3"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 For vulnerable witnesses, it is possible for the prosecution to make an application under section 46&nbsp;of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. Such witnesses may be eligible for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reporting restrictions, but the court must be satisfied that the quality of their evidence or their level of co-operation are likely to be diminished by fear or distress at being identified by members of the public.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-04_para1">
<a name="stpa_o9">In addition, there are obvious obligations in respect of the application of the sub judice rules, which ensure that media reporting of particular cases is restricted. However, those rules apply only while a case is in progress.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o82"><a name="51027-04_spnew5"><b> Mr. Nigel Dodds  (Belfast, North)</b> 
 (DUP): Sometimes a difficulty arises with the manner in which victims are informed about the progress of a case. In one instance in my constituency, the police caused great distress when they called at the home of a victim&#039;s family, who would have been happier if the information had been conveyed in a more sensitive way. Does the hon. and learned Gentleman agree that it might be worth looking at how such information is sometimes conveyed?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o83"><a name="51027-04_spmin4"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 Certainly, how information is conveyed to people is important. For instance, a crime victim who is asked to give evidence in court can be distressed if the police visit is conducted insensitively. Obviously, police officers try to do their best, but they are human and therefore imperfect, and matters are not always handled properly. Increasingly, we are trying to get the CPS to take on much of that role, and we hope that it can be done in a way that enables the witness to have contact with witness care units, which provide not only that initial contact is made more sensitively but also&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that if a witness is nervous about having to give evidence, they have the opportunity to visit the court for a familiarisation tour. They can also be provided with help with child care, transport and other facilities to ensure that they are able to give their evidence, which is always a difficult thing to do, with the least possible trauma.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o84"><a name="51027-04_spnew6"><b> Mr. Brian Jenkins  (Tamworth)</b> 
 (Lab): Will my hon. and learned Friend inform the House what special provision is given in the area where more victims withdraw before going to court than any other and where there is more intimidation and distress&#151;domestic violence?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 452</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o85"><a name="51027-04_spmin5"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 My hon. Friend is right; domestic violence accounts for 16&nbsp;per cent. of violent crime and involves 13&nbsp;million women victims and 3&nbsp;million male victims each year. It is a serious matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPS has launched a major drive against domestic violence and there is now a national network of co-ordinators who work with various agencies to support the victims of domestic violence. Specialist courts, piloted in Caerphilly and Croydon, have shown that pulling together the various agencies to provide support for victims can improve conviction rates, as victims do not so often withdraw their evidence. In one of those courts, for example, there has been a dramatic fall in the number of retractions of victims&#039; statements, from 53&nbsp;per cent. to 17&nbsp;per cent., as a result of such&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;support to victims of domestic violence. The Government aim to create 25&nbsp;specialist domestic violence courts and we have invested &#163;1&nbsp;million to do so.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o86"><a name="51027-04_spnew7"><b> Mr. Dominic Grieve  (Beaconsfield)</b> 
 (Con): The Solicitor-General has confirmed that hitherto the main point of contact between a victim and authority on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;progress of a case has been the police, and there are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numerous examples of the breakdown of communication. He says that we shall move towards a new system in which the CPS will take the lead. Could he amplify that point? When will the crown prosecutor&#039;s office be the contact point for a victim rather than the police station, if that is the intention? How will that programme of change be rolled out?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o87"><a name="51027-04_spmin6"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 From the point of charge up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appeal, the aim is to achieve better direct communication between the victim and the CPS. The police will still have much contact, especially with witnesses and victims, so both the police and the CPS will be engaged in the process. Previously, as the hon. Gentleman says, it was primarily the responsibility of the police to make and maintain those contacts and to issue warnings, but as a result of the prosecutor&#039;s pledge and the way in which the CPS has developed in recent years, the CPS is taking on much more of that role. As it is the focal point of the prosecution case during court proceedings it offers a far better contact, rather than the prosecutor having to ring the police station each time they know something and hoping that the police officer will be able to inform the victim. Direct communication, which is being rolled out across the country and to which the prosecutor&#039;s pledge will give real impetus, will lead to victims receiving a much better service in the criminal justice system.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o88"><a name="51027-04_spnew8"><b> Simon Hughes  (North Southwark and Bermondsey)</b> 
 (LD): The Solicitor-General will know that many victims, like other witnesses, are told that, for their personal safety they need to move from their home or move their business during a case. Many people affected say that such protection is still unsatisfactory; they cannot happily live their lives somewhere else while the case is going on and certainly cannot carry on a business, so will he and his colleagues from other Departments look into the issue?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o89"><a name="51027-04_spmin7"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman speaks from personal knowledge, given the courage that he displayed in giving evidence in a particular case. He is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 453</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>right that some witnesses fear intimidation and, sadly, some have good cause to do so because of the nature of the criminals about whom they are giving evidence. The aim of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service is to provide the maximum reasonable safeguard and protection. It is always difficult to make the right judgment, particularly when dealing with criminals who are very effective at getting at witnesses. I will talk to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service about ways in which we can continue to strengthen the support that we provide for witnesses. The hon. Gentleman had the courage to give evidence, as do many other witnesses. However, some witnesses withdraw their evidence&#151;we must change that and provide them with greater protection.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o90"><a name="51027-05_spmin0"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service is committed to ensuring that victims are kept informed wherever it is aware of new developments in a case. That can be done either through witness care units or by direct contact with victims. The prosecutor&#039;s pledge aims to learn from past mistakes to provide an improved communication with victims.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o91"><a name="51027-05_spnew0"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 I am glad that the Solicitor-General referred to past mistakes, because he will know the case&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of my constituent, Robert Payling, whose son was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;murdered in Manchester by someone who was subsequently deported by the immigration and nationality directorate without proper reference to the CPS or the police. That was a complete shambles, as one part of the criminal justice system was unaware of what another part was doing. The CPS did not even inform the family of the victim of the crime. What steps is my hon. and learned Friend taking to ensure that that incompetence is not repeated?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o92"><a name="51027-05_spmin1"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 The Yin case has, I hope, taught us a valuable lesson about the need for better contacts between the CPS and the IND. A lack of

<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 454</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>information led the IND to deport a Chinese national who was on bail pending trial following the death of James Bishop, a pedestrian who was hit by a care driven by Mr. Yin. From 1&nbsp;August 2005, under the direct access protocol, new information links were set up between the IND and the CPS to improve the exchange of information. At present, however, there is no duty on the IND to inform the police or the CPS about deportations. More work needs to be done on that. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regret that at present I cannot give my hon. Friend the assurance that the Yin case will never be repeated, but we are working to try to improve information exchange between the organisations.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o93"><a name="51027-05_spmin2"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 The new Crown prosecutor in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northamptonshire has been appointed to tackle concern about the performance of the CPS. The area has restructured from four to two units, mirroring the police structure in the county. That will provide the necessary resilience, we hope, to service police charging centres as well, and it has freed prosecutors to service additional courts.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o94"><a name="51027-05_spnew1"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering)</b> 
 (Con): Victims of crime in Kettering and Northamptonshire would like an assurance from the Minister that all cases involving persistent young offenders will be brought to court within the 71-day target set by the Government.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o95"><a name="51027-05_spmin3"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 The average time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders in the area was reduced from 112&nbsp;days in April 2005&nbsp;to 85&nbsp;days in July 2005, which is a significant shift in a short period of time. The CPS is working closely with the magistrates court to reduce those time scales further by prioritising the listing of young offender cases as soon as they are trial ready. We must make those cases trial ready, which is why the restructuring of the CPS is important, as it will enable it to link up much more effectively with the local police.

My father served in the far east and I recognise that that was a particularly brutal and nasty aspect of conflict that affected many people. It is necessary that these decisions are subject to rules, and I assure him that a great deal of thought and care was given to drawing them up. This was a matter not of looking at the cost, but of trying to ensure that the rules were fair. The hon. Gentleman referred to 700&nbsp;people. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope that he will take it from me that drawing in another group will not necessarily solve the problem to which he refers, because by adjusting the rules to take account of a further group, another larger group may well become eligible. These matters have also been subject to litigation. I assure him that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence and other relevant Ministers look at these issues with as much compassion and sensitivity as possible. Bearing in mind that no previous Government had taken such a decision, we brought forward the scheme because we felt that the country owed a debt of honour to those people who suffered in that way in the course of the second world war. But it is not possible simply to provide an unlimited scheme. The scheme has to be subject to certain rules, and those rules necessarily unfortunately exclude some people from participation.

 May I press the case for an early statement on the Government&#039;s position on smoking in public places? The figures are well known and very alarming. Passive smoking kills 30&nbsp;people every day and kills two employed people every working day. The figures are very alarming and we should acknowledge them. We are told in the press that the Government believe that a partial ban is feasible and a total ban is not easily policed.

 I have already made it clear that these are difficult issues that require a balance to be struck. When making such judgments, it is always the case that the place where the line is drawn will provoke different reactions from different parts of the community. It is therefore the Government&#039;s job, after proper and serious debate, to reach a conclusion. That conclusion has been reached. I remind my hon. Friend, in the politest way possible, that the judgment has been reached on the basis of the manifesto on which she and I were elected and that we argued before the country as a reason for voting for us.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_35">At the time of the pre-Budget report on 2&nbsp;December 2004, I made a statement to the House that outlined how, despite the best efforts of successive Governments since 1994, we continued to be presented with ever more complex and contrived arrangements designed to avoid income tax and national insurance on the rewards from employment. I made it clear that we intended to close down such activity permanently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para1">
<a name="stpa_36">In my statement, I recalled that earlier attempts at such avoidance took the form of paying bonuses and salaries in gold bullion, diamonds and fine wine. When those routes were closed, employers started to pay bonuses through ever more sophisticated financial instruments and securities to reduce the amount of national insurance that they had to pay, to avoid their obligation to operate pay-as-you-earn and to reduce employees&#039; tax bills.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_37">The tax avoidance disclosure rules that were introduced in the Finance Act 2004 brought to light many&#151;more than 100&#151;examples of such schemes that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had been devised or marketed by promoters. That showed that a significant minority of employers and their advisers were continuing to devise, operate and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;market ever more contrived avoidance schemes to disguise what is, in effect, remuneration. Without prompt and decisive action, there was a genuine possibility of tax and national insurance contributions avoidance schemes continuing, to the detriment of the Exchequer and the many employers and employees&#151;the majority&#151;who pay their fair share of tax and national insurance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_38">I gave notice of our intention to deal with any similar arrangements that emerged in future that were designed to frustrate our intention that employers and employees should pay their fair share of tax and national insurance on the rewards from employment. When we become aware of arrangements that attempt to frustrate that intention, we will introduce legislation to close them down and, when necessary, with effect from 2&nbsp;December 2004.

<p><a name="st_67"><a name="51027-10_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mark Field  (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con):</b> 
 Does the Paymaster General accept that one of the problems is the complication of the tax system since 1997? It means that it is inevitably in the interests of employers and some employees that income should not be regarded as such but regarded as capital for lower taxation. How many of the 100&nbsp;schemes that she mentioned are straightforwardly designed to turn what might be described as income, and therefore in a somewhat grey area, into capital that is thus subject to a capital gains tax levy, which is generated at a lower level?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 472</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_68"><a name="51027-10_spnew5"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman may know the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answer from discussions during the proceedings on the Finance Act 2005. However, let me provide a short list of the sort of schemes that have been operating in relation to bonuses that are payment for employment. In 1991, such schemes used unit trusts to shield bonuses and the previous Government closed them down. In 1993, gold bullion and tradeable commodities were used and subsequently closed down. However, the schemes returned in 1994, using diamonds and fine wine. They were closed down but another type of scheme returned again in 1995&nbsp;with grants of options in third-party companies. In 1996, own-company share awards and options were offered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_39">All those schemes reveal a systematic and continued attempt to use contrived schemes for payment for employment, which should come within the PAYE system. The issue is whether tax and national insurance are paid on the relevant forms of income. The Bill tries to provide for that. I hope that, as I go through the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provisions, the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the measure is specifically targeted and that it includes the necessary safeguards to ensure that. I hope that he will agree that the Bill is a proportionate and relevant way to tackle the problem.
</p>








<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51027-10_spnew6"><b> Mr. Field: </b> 
 The Paymaster General has made a good case for dealing with some contrived schemes that operated for over a decade, but I suspect that the previous Government closed them all down. However, given the complexity of the tax system, which creates an obvious incentive in a grey area to characterise what might have been described as income in the past as capital because of the lower tax rates, how many of the 100&nbsp;schemes that were being marketed on 2&nbsp;December 2004&nbsp;are straightforward rather than the extreme contrivances that we all agree should have been closed down?
</p>








<p><a name="st_70"><a name="51027-10_spnew7"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 My advice is that they are all contrived schemes of the same convoluted nature as their predecessors. The hon. Gentleman spoke of complexity, and overcoming that has been a frustrating problem for hon. Members, especially those of us who serve on Finance Bill Committees, and for those who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to implement the legislation. To close down a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complex and sophisticated scheme, we need a sophisticated and complex measure. Our measures make a clear and unambiguous statement: do not undertake contrived schemes. They will be closed down&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whenever they are identified. Closure could be backdated to the December 2004&nbsp;statement.
</p>








<p><a name="st_71"><a name="51027-10_spnew8"><b> Rob Marris  (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab):</b> 
 Am I right that we are not discussing peanuts? Without the Bill, the schemes would cost Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs approximately &#163;240&nbsp;million. That is not small beer.
</p>








<p><a name="st_72"><a name="51027-10_spnew9"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 Indeed, it is not an insignificant amount of money and it should have been paid. The vast majority of taxpayers pay, but non-payment has direct effects not only on the tax collected but on the money that goes into the national insurance fund.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_41">If some people think that the Government&#039;s resolve has weakened, my statement stands today as strongly as it did on 2&nbsp;December 2004. We are closely examining what has happened since that date. I want employers and their advisers to be in no doubt. If they continue to avoid their responsibilities, or are thinking of doing so in future, we will not hesitate to introduce further legislation to close down their schemes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_42">As a first step towards demonstrating our commitment to taking action, schedule 2 to the Finance (No. 2) Act 2005 was introduced to strengthen the income tax rules dealing with employment-related securities back to 2 December 2004. The Government had already published a draft technical note alongside the pre-Budget report last year, explaining our proposals, followed by draft legislation in February 2005. Interested parties have therefore had an extensive period in which to scrutinise and comment on the detail of the provisions, which were then fully debated during the Committee stage of that Act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_43">The Bill before us is the second legislative step that demonstrates our commitment to taking action against avoidance. It is key to achieving the Government&#039;s objectives of fairness and opportunity by ensuring that all pay their fair share of tax and national insurance. It is also an essential element in building a serious and credible deterrent against future avoidance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_44">As the tax disclosure provisions have demonstrated, and as we and the previous Conservative Government have discovered, it is not always possible to anticipate the range and complexity of those extremely contrived arrangements. The Government intend to close down such avoidance schemes permanently. The Bill will ensure that the Government can deal with any arrangements designed to frustrate their intentions. That will ensure that the tax and national insurance that should rightly be paid on rewards for employment are paid. There is no annual equivalent of the Finance Bill for national insurance, so the Bill provides the necessary powers to apply national insurance to payments from such schemes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para10">
<a name="stpa_45">When the Government become aware of arrangements that attempt to avoid national insurance contributions as well as tax, we will introduce regulations to close them down, where necessary from 2&nbsp;December 2004. This action will not affect the vast majority of employers and employees, who organise their affairs in a straightforward and transparent way. In particular, genuine employee share schemes and share option plans will not be affected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para11">
<a name="stpa_46">The Bill provides for a power to make regulations in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; respect of national insurance that reflect backdated tax&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changes that take effect on or after 2 December 2004 and which may be outside the scope of existing national&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insurance legislation. The power will allow for national insurance liability to be charged starting from 2 December 2004, if necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para12">
<a name="stpa_47">The Bill is needed to extend existing regulation-making powers and to make it possible to impose a national insurance charge on disguised remuneration that is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 474</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>capable of taking effect from 2&nbsp;December 2004, where necessary. Currently, a national insurance liability can usually be charged only from the date on which the national insurance regulations are made, except in limited circumstances in which the regulations can be backdated to the beginning of the tax year in which the regulations are made. This is in contrast to tax, where liability can, if the legislation so provides, be applied retrospectively to the date of an announcement made before the legislation receives Royal Assent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para13">
<a name="stpa_48">Provisions in the Bill also allow for consequential changes for the purposes of contributions, contributory benefits and statutory payments where appropriate. For instance, a national insurance charge might be levied back to 2&nbsp;December 2004&nbsp;to align with the start date of anti-avoidance tax measures. In such a case, the provisions of the Bill, and the regulations made under the powers in the Bill, would ensure that those contributions would count for the purposes of contributory benefit and statutory payments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para14">
<a name="stpa_49">The Bill also provides a power to extend the avoidance arrangement disclosure rules to national insurance that currently apply to income tax. Finally, it provides a power to prevent the use of national insurance contribution elections and agreements over shares and securities that have been targeted by backdated national insurance regulations made under the Bill. This will mean that employers cannot pass on to their employees their own national insurance liabilities that they have tried to avoid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para15">
<a name="stpa_50">Significantly, the Government have ensured that the Bill contains important safeguards to ensure that regulations made under it take full account of human rights considerations. This is in addition to the Government&#039;s existing duty to make regulations that are compatible with the European convention on human rights. Furthermore, the power to make regulations altering liability is restricted to reflect, so far as is possible, employment remuneration measures in tax legislation&#151;normally Finance Acts&#151;and is intended to be used only to reflect tax anti-avoidance measures. So when such regulations are made, the House will already have had the chance to consider any relevant human rights issues on backdated tax legislation during the passage of the relevant Finance Bill or other legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para16">
<a name="stpa_51">The Bill also includes a specific provision to ensure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that when, for instance, as part of a package of anti-avoidance measures there is exceptionally a reduction of national insurance liability for past periods, any existing or future benefit entitlement will not be affected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para17">
<a name="stpa_52">We will publish the draft regulations a minimum of 12&nbsp;weeks before they are made, so that employers and their representatives will have an opportunity to comment on the technical content of any proposed national insurance changes. Once the Bill has received Royal Assent, any national insurance legislation will have to be laid within 12&nbsp;months of the corresponding retrospective tax legislation. Furthermore, to ensure that there is adequate parliamentary scrutiny when regulations are made, such regulations will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="stpa_53">The powers in the Bill will be used, in the first instance, to make regulations to reflect the employment-related securities anti-avoidance provisions included in schedule 2&nbsp;to the Finance (No. 2) Act 2005, which received Royal Assent in July 2005, but which took effect from 2&nbsp;December 2004.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-10_para19">
<a name="stpa_54">In conclusion, the Bill is important and necessary to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ensure fairness. It will not affect the vast majority of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employers, who do not seek to avoid their tax and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;national insurance liabilities through avoidance schemes. However, I have explained how, unfortunately, a small minority continue to try to avoid their obligations, at substantial cost to all other taxpayers. The Bill is therefore an appropriate, proportionate and effective response to national insurance avoidance, and I commend it to the House.

<a name="stpa_55">In an age in which consecutive Finance Acts create and then abolish new-fangled tax instruments, national insurance contributions have proved remarkably resilient.

Back in 1948, all those at work except married women paid the princely weekly sum of 4s 11d&#151;that is 24.5p for all those Members of the House younger than me&#151;in a flat-rate compulsory contribution. How times have changed! The only thing that is flat about national insurance today is the spin in which the Government find themselves when trying to raise as much money as possible in their frantic attempt to balance their books.

Those amendments have retrospective effect, as the Paymaster General rightly pointed out, going back to 2&nbsp;December 2004. It is not currently possible to extend retrospective income tax provisions to national insurance contributions, because liability for NICs can be charged, as the Paymaster General mentioned, only from the date on which NICs regulations are made, except in limited circumstances in which the regulations can be backdated to the beginning of the tax year.

<a name="stpa_62">The key issue, however, is whether the importance of protecting tax revenues outweighs the need for certainty in commercial forward planning, because the threat of retrospection came as a great surprise to many tax professionals, as it falls foul of one of the great canons of taxation&#151;that of certainty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_63">Arguably, retrospection is also unconstitutional, and if not it should be regarded as acceptable only when couched in unambiguous terms. The Government&#039;s admirably comprehensive explanatory notes make much of what they regard as the position under the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human Rights Act 1998. In spite of the characteristically robust protestations of human rights compatibility from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, his is a position of an interested party, for the reasons I have set out. These measures will obviously bring in more money&#151;perhaps as much as &#163;240&nbsp;million during this year and years to come.

<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51027-11_spnew2"><b> Mr. Field: </b> 
 Let me answer the second point first, if I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may. On the certainty issue, in any one year we do not know how many people will be in the employment market, as we have gathered from the constantly changing growth figures that have been published since the autumn review last year. For that reason, there will never be complete certainty for any Government at any time. What we are looking for here is commercial certainty. Surely it is the entitlement of individuals and companies to have that level of certainty. After all, tax is not a voluntary regime; it is imposed by a Government on their people. Such an imposition gives any Government of any day great power. The certainty that is therefore required is commercial certainty for those who could suffer from a tax.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-11_para14">
<a name="stpa_69">On the Paymaster General&#039;s first point, our concern is the law of unintended consequences. We never quite know how things will unravel. I am not looking necessarily to stand up for those tax advisers and employee benefits remuneration people whose ingenuity allows new schemes to be developed at any one time; but equally, it is not the duty either of an employee or an employer, or of a company, to maximise the tax paid. They are quite entitled, where they can, to find what might be regarded as loopholes. It is obviously the Treasury&#039;s job, where there are unintended loopholes, to close those for the future.

 I am intrigued by the tense the Paymaster General uses. She refers to legislation that the House &quot;has passed&quot;. Our concern is not with legislation where there is a clear intention from the Government. The issue here is retrospection. That is our great anxiety. Where legislation has been passed, and there is clarity and certainty, that is fine, but the point of the Bill is to sweep back as far as 2&nbsp;December 2004.

 I am following the hon. Gentleman&#039;s remarks closely. First, perhaps he can explain how the retrospection for NICs will be different from that which we already have for tax. Secondly, may I point out to him that not many people on minimum wage in my constituency have been getting paid in platinum sponges or any such device? I would expect most people, if not all, who will be caught by this legislation to have had specialist tax advice, quite possibly through their employer. That specialist tax adviser should have told them that anything after 2&nbsp;December 2004&nbsp;is at risk. If the tax adviser failed to do so, he or she is at risk in respect of negligence.

<p>
<a name="51027-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_70">On the hon. Gentleman&#039;s serious point, we are concerned about retrospection, particularly in relation to national insurance, because of the potential double whammy for many employers. While one can entirely understand the protection given to employees, which we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will discuss later or in Committee, one of the great&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;differences between the national insurance contributions regime and the regime under the Finance Act for income tax is that employers run the risk of not only paying their own 12.8 per cent. but their employees&#039; national insurance part. They might be able to go back and sue their tax adviser, but that might not be a practical solution. While we still have grave concerns about retrospection, which were articulated in the Finance Bill Committee, equally we want to articulate those now and consider the other ways in which the legislation applies.

<br>&nbsp;<br>General&#039;s broad-brush assertion in her statement of 2&nbsp;December, how can we be sure that the scope of these retrospective powers will only be used sparingly? Ultimately, the crux of the question is: who judges whether something is to be regarded as unacceptable avoidance?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_73">Most of the Bill&#039;s provisions have retrospective effect. The Government are becoming increasingly open about passing such provisions. Previously, such provisions were only described as retroactive, whereas now the word &quot;retrospective&quot; is openly used in the Bill. While most of the Bill&#039;s provisions cannot take effect before 2&nbsp;December 2004, the effect of sections 5&nbsp;and 6&nbsp;is potentially unlimited, as any past agreements and joint elections to transfer secondary liability to national insurance contributions to employees can be disapplied. Under those elections, employees were able to pass the national insurance cost risk to employees without limit as to when the election was entered into.

<a name="stpa_78">Ideally, we need Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs to set out its thinking on the principles guiding its intended implementation of this policy announcement. During consideration of the Finance (No.2) Act 2005, we called repeatedly for more attention to be paid to the pre-clearance procedure. The spectre of retrospection, and with it uncertainty, makes a pre-clearance process ever more important; otherwise, the Treasury seems to be relying on making any such schemes of arrangement so commercially unattractive that the need for retrospective legislation will be rendered redundant. That is more or less the nub of what the Paymaster General said in our exchanges a few minutes or go.

<a name="stpa_79">That is not a sensible way to run commercial business. We need to encourage dynamism, flair and innovation.

A heavily regulated economy in every way will not be good news for this country. Flair and innovation are qualities not just of our tax advisers but of many inventors and people throughout industry. That has been one of the great strengths of this country over the past 300&nbsp;or 400&nbsp;years, and is one of the reasons why we are such an important trading nation.

<a name="stpa_81">The Bill highlights once again the problem of having two taxes that basically cover earnings.

That is an expensive fiction that costs businesses millions of pounds in administration each and every year. Perhaps things have now got to the point where it is necessary to consider a single stand-alone income tax with a basic rate of 33&nbsp;per cent. and an employers&#039; portion of 12.8&nbsp;per cent.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_82">I want to touch on three other aspects. First, there is the regulatory impact assessment in which the Government attempted to assess the Bill&#039;s potential impact. They concluded that the combined impact of the measures

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_83">However, it should be remembered that small businesses are most dependent on attracting quality personnel, and therefore need to be able to offer tax-efficient employee incentive schemes. As the Government have already announced, the powers in the new Bill will be used first&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and foremost to tackle NIC avoidance through employment-related schemes. It is suggested that that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will disproportionately affect businesses that the Government originally intended to promote by introducing tax-efficient employee incentive schemes. The position is made worse by the fact that employers cannot share any new unexpected liability to NICs with their employees.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_84">Secondly, there is the issue of disclosure, which the Paymaster General mentioned. Clause 7&nbsp;suggests that the regime for NICs and income tax will be similar. It would be useful to hear from the Treasury how it will work alongside taxation specialists to ensure a smoothly operating system. Twelve weeks seems a relatively short period, given the importance of the work that must be done, and the differences between this regime and the income tax regime introduced in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2005. Naturally all sides would like as long a lead-in time frame as is practical.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_85">Much hinges in the future implementation of the intentions set out in this enabling legislation on regulation-making powers. The Bill brings NICs into the world of tax avoidance disclosure, and opens the way to retrospection. However, its operation, achieved by specific regulations that are highly technical and complex, will not be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny. Let us be honest: without significant outside expert help, there is little headway that any Opposition spokesman can forge even in Second Reading debates such as this. However, if such technical legislation with its retrospective element is brought in only via regulation, even when it is approved by statutory instrument, we run a real risk of adding to the statute book a series of poorly thought-through laws. My biggest worry is that that will result in employers and employees alike running the risk of being deprived of their property in an arbitrary manner.

<a name="stpa_93">The problem is that in talking generally about tax avoidance it is very easy to get into a moralistic mindset&#151;a mindset that crept a little into the Paymaster 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 484</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>General&#039;s speech. Frankly, this area is an ethical quagmire. The Government were helped by a question posed by the Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee a few months ago. He asked what the difference was between legitimate and illegitimate tax avoidance, and the Paymaster General produced a reply that is well worth quoting because it provides a framework for this discussion. She said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;The Government take steps to close down tax avoidance schemes as they become aware of them, particularly where they create economic distortions, provide commercial advantages over compliant taxpayers, redistribute tax revenues in an unfair and arbitrary manner, or represent an abuse that conflicts with or defeats the will of Parliament.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 1&nbsp;April 2004; Vol.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;419, c. 1697W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_94">That seems a good working definition of the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate tax avoidance and, so far as it goes, perfectly sensible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_95">However, on reflecting a little more, I concluded that what we are dealing with is not a simple, stark, clear-cut division between legitimacy and illegitimacy. There is a continuity or spectrum of behaviour, and at one extreme there are cynical and manipulative schemes. But at the other end of the spectrum, there are forms of tax avoidance that we all regard as perfectly legitimate and,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed, that the Government encourage. As I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand it, part of the Financial Secretary&#039;s job is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to encourage tax avoidance. He introduces environmental taxes that, if successful, stop people doing certain things and therefore reduce Government revenue. That is the will of Parliament and it is sensible, good economics and good for the environment; but it is promoting tax avoidance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_96">At the other end of the spectrum are these fancy avoidance schemes, but somewhere in the middle is the kind of behaviour that we all get up to in our private lives as we try to organise our affairs in such a way that we pay as little tax as possible, within the law. A few weeks ago, I was talking to my grown-up children, who live in London and are having horrendous problems dealing with their mortgages. I am considering making a gift from my modest savings in order to help them, and it occurred to me&#151;it certainly occurred to them&#151;that if I manage to organise my affairs in such a way that I do not die in the next seven years, I will help them to avoid paying inheritance tax. That is tax avoidance. Of course, it does not fall within the Paymaster General&#039;s definition of illegitimacy because it does not constitute an organised scheme. But if instead of simply doing a back-of-the-envelope exercise, I did things properly and went to a financial adviser, an accountant or a solicitor, such a course of action would, I think, be illegitimate under the terms of the definition given. Certainly, the definition is hazy, so it is probably useful to approach it not in a moralistic way but in a practical way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_97">The practical issue is how the Government can reduce tax avoidance. We are dealing with a very big area: in respect of this source of leakage, the figure of &#163;300&nbsp;million has been quoted. The Inland Revenue has estimated that it suffers itself from tax avoidance losses of some &#163;2.5&nbsp;billion to &#163;3&nbsp;billion in VAT, and probably &#163;10&nbsp;billion in direct taxation, so the Bill deals with only one corner of a much bigger problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_98">I turn to an interesting and important aspect of the Bill that is at the heart of some of the criticisms offered by the hon. Member for Cities of London and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 485</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Westminster. The point was summed up by the Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, when he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;What is new is the declaration that future schemes, not yet devised or which have not yet come to the Inland Revenue&#039;s attention, may be stopped as from 2&nbsp;December 2004. This amounts to a general anti-avoidance rule in this area of taxation of income and rewards&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_99">That is not necessarily good or bad, but it does break important new ground by embedding in the legislation the principle of retrospective action. As the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster suggested, that could create problems in respect of one of the basic principles of taxation: certainty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_100">In Committee, we shall doubtless confront a question that will be at the heart of public debate on this issue: whether the principle that the Government are introducing conflicts with fundamental principles in law as we understand them. The Institute of Chartered Accountants, which has looked at this Bill in some detail, questions whether this new principle is compatible with European law. I do not know&#151;I am not a lawyer and certainly not a constitutional lawyer&#151;but I draw the House&#039;s attention to a very important legal ruling that dates from April, through which the European Court of Justice is trying to tackle head-on the question of whether a measure such as the one before us is legitimate in terms of European law principles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_101">One paragraph of that ruling appears to suggest that what the Government are doing is not compatible with European law principles, but another paragraph appears to constitute the Government&#039;s defence. It is worth quoting both, because they will prove central as this legislation proceeds. The first paragraph states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;The principles of the protection of legitimate expectation and legal certainty form a part of the Community legal order. They must accordingly be observed . . . by the Member States&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_102">If it is correct that this legislation diminishes legal certainty, it may well violate European justice as it applies to tax law. The following paragraph, however, is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more qualified. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;Although in general the principle of legal certainty precludes a Community measure from taking effect from a point in time before its publication&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para10">
<a name="stpa_103">in other words, retrospectively&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;it may exceptionally be otherwise where the purpose to be achieved so demands and where the legitimate expectations of those concerned arc duly respected&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para11">
<a name="stpa_104">A key issue will be whether the legitimate expectations of those introducing such schemes have been respected. It is a fairly narrow point and it is not clear to me who is right and who is wrong, but as the Bill proceeds we will need proper clarification of whether its legal basis has been thought through in terms of those wider principles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para12">
<a name="stpa_105">There are two other practical problems that the ICA and others have thought through, and on which the hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Cities of London and Westminster touched. The first concerns a legislative principle and the way in which this House proceeds. As I understand it, one consequence of the manner of the Bill&#039;s introduction is that secondary legislation will be introduced at the same time as primary legislation, so&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there will not be the traditional opportunity for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 486</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12-month period of consultation of those affected by such legislation. I am not sure that I fully understand the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problem here, but it has been highlighted by the practitioners and it would be useful if the Government commented on it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para13">
<a name="stpa_106">The other practical problem, which the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster also mentioned, is the question of what happens to those employers who, although they are clearly party to such schemes, may not have prompted them. What happens if such an employer finds that, because the legislation is invoked retrospectively, in practice they cannot claw back concessions already made to the employee? Such an employer is the piggy in the middle who has been stuck with the liability. What is their position?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para14">
<a name="stpa_107">In conclusion, I would like to summarise my argument by making two wider points. First, although&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is right and I fully support the idea of pursuing anti-avoidance as far as is possible and practical within the law, it is not always clear that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treasury&#039;s emphasis should be on anti-avoidance. It should reflect further on the problems created by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over-complexity. One of the leading authorities on British tax law&#151;Edward Troup, who happens to be one&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of my constituents and who frequently appears before the Treasury Committee&#151;summarised the problem elegantly:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;The aim of Government should be to . . . do its best to ensure that the &#039;return&#039; from tax planning is as low as possible . . . a simpler tax system with fewer reliefs, exemptions and discontinuities would, in the long term, frustrate most of the tax evaders&#039; ploys . . . Management has to decide between whether &#163;10,000&nbsp;of tax planners&#039; fees is likely to give a better post-tax return than the amount spent on, say, advertising. This judgement is not immoral, it is inevitable&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para15">
<a name="stpa_108">That is why I and my colleagues, as well as the Conservatives, are looking further into the whole principle of tax simplification. Our commission got going a little quicker than theirs, but whether it will end up recommending some version of a flat tax, I do not know. I have an open mind on that matter. The underlying principle of pursuing simplicity is clearly very desirable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para16">
<a name="stpa_109">Finally, it is not a question of simplification alone. We&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also need to focus more on the question of tax&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;administration and the competence of the tax administration authorities. I do not have many people in Twickenham running around with gold bullion, but I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have do have many people who work in the computer industry. They often send me e-mails from their occasional employer, the Inland Revenue, with positively hair-raising tales of computer breakdowns involving something called ERIC and management failures in the Revenue that are costing billions as a result of weak, unsatisfactory and badly managed revenue-collection systems. I do not know the truth in that matter: I am not part of it, but I see the fragments shown to me by people who are witness to it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-14_para17">
<a name="stpa_110">I believe that more revenue could be realised by the Treasury through better tax administration and tax simplification than through the pursuit of anti-avoidance measures. As far as the Bill goes, the principles behind what the Government are seeking to achieve seem sensible, subject to the various specific legal and practical steps that we shall pursue in Committee.

<p><a name="st_96"><a name="51027-15_spnew0"><b> Mr. Iain Wright  (Hartlepool) (Lab):</b> 
 I begin by declaring an interest: I am a chartered accountant and before my time in the House I was employed by one of the big four accountancy firms. I worked in the noble art of corporate governance and risk management, rather than the possibly shady dealings of tax avoidance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_111">I welcome the Bill enormously and sincerely hope that Conservative Members will not divide the House on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It continues the theme introduced by previous Governments of clamping down on tax-avoidance schemes, and it is right and proper that Governments of all political persuasions work to ensure that all businesses and employees pay the correct amount of tax&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and national insurance contributions at the appropriate time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_112">As my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General said in her opening remarks, the Bill advances the work that was started by the Conservative Administration. The right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilley), who is not in his place, looked into the problem when he was Secretary of State for Social Security in the John Major Administration. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flello) mentioned, the right hon. Gentleman announced in 1995&nbsp;measures designed to stop a national insurance dodge of paying employees in tradable assets. In the following year, he announced further powers to stop the latest dodge of avoiding national insurance when employees were paid in their company&#039;s own shares. The Labour Government have continued&#151;and, indeed, accelerated&#151;the trend, with measures such as bringing under PAYE assets readily convertible into cash in 1998, and dealing with employment-related shares in 2003.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_113">I therefore believe that there is a political consensus on this matter, and rightly so. However, over the past 20&nbsp;years the fight against avoidance has been undertaken in an environment in which the schemes, or scams, have become ever more ingenious and imaginative. The Government have been sharp in closing loopholes, but rather like a fairground game where little squirrel heads pop up at random and have to be hit with a hammer, the Government spot one scam and then another pops up somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_114">It is extremely lucrative for tax advisers to come up with ever-more imaginative schemes to avoid tax and national insurance, largely because the benefits&#151;the tax and NICs saved through avoidance&#151;far outweigh the potential risks of fines and possibly having to pay interest on the tax. Some of the inventive scams to avoid NICs are far-fetched to the point of being comical. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South mentioned oriental carpets, and when I was researching for my speech, I discovered a City worker who had been paid a bonus of oriental carpets worth about &#163;100,000. The carpets were held in storage and then seemed to become magical, as they never materialised and were never seen in the home.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_115">Platinum sponges are another example. I have not done as much research on them as my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South, so I do not have a clue what they are. I do know three things, though: platinum sponges are not platinum jewellery; they are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 488</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>not sponges for washing; and, most importantly, they are in reality a scam to avoid paying rightful levels of national insurance contributions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_116">It seems to me that an enormous amount of energy and resources from the Government are devoted towards ensuring that a small majority of highly paid earners pay the proper amount of tax and national insurance like the rest of us. Those resources could be redeployed towards services that are of real benefit to the country, such as improving public services and tackling family poverty. That is why I welcome the moves that the Labour Government have made&#151;further than any other Administration, in my view&#151;in combating tax-avoidance schemes. The need for promoters of schemes to notify Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs of them is extremely welcome and long overdue. Rather than playing the squirrel game, the squirrels now have to tell the Government where and when their heads will be appearing. That may be less fun, but it is certainly a lot fairer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_117">Yet this Bill goes one step further. I think that its&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;best&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feature is the power to close down and backdate avoidance arrangements, where necessary, to 2&nbsp;December 2004. I strongly believe that advisers, companies and workers were given adequate notice of the Government&#039;s intentions in the 2004&nbsp;pre-Budget report. Reviews in the press this week seem to suggest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Government&#039;s objective will be achieved. Mike&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warburton, senior tax partner at Grant Thornton, was quoted this week in <i>Accountancy Age</i> as saying that the Bill


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;makes it very debatable whether it&#039;s worth anybody&#039;s while doing things that are seen as aggressive by HMRC&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_118">Quite right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para8">
<a name="stpa_119">I want to end on the central theme of why I welcome the Bill most of all. Much as I love technical accountancy jargon, the Bill is not purely about rectifying technical inconsistencies and loopholes in the tax regime. First and foremost, it is all about fairness&#151;fairness for all those who pay income tax and national insurance contributions. Why should a privileged few&#151;mostly in the City of London&#151;be allowed to cheat the vast majority of hard-working taxpayers and users of public services by not paying the rightful amount? It borders on the immoral. Why should hard-working families in Hartlepool, who pay tax and national insurance contributions through the PAYE system and have no control over the manner in which they are paid, subsidise the avoidance efforts of a wealthy elite?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para9">
<a name="stpa_120">I hold weekly surgeries and I have to confess that no constituent has ever expressed concern that we are restricting the use of platinum sponges as a means of rewarding employment. That is what this Bill is about&#151;fairness for all taxpayers, not favouritism for a few.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para10">
<a name="stpa_121">This is not a Bill that takes the food out of the mouths of hard-working families who are struggling to make ends meet. I have no doubt that the people whom the Bill will affect most are hard working, but they are, after all, paid handsomely for what they do and their remuneration is getting better. Only this week in the<i> Financial Times</i>, in an article entitled &quot;Bank staff do best as City pay increases&quot;, I was informed that, before the payment of winter bonuses, directors, senior analysts, corporate financiers and fund managers have seen their basic pay rise by 9.2&nbsp;per cent. since this time last year, to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 489</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>an average basic salary of &#163;76,950&#151;and bonuses are expected to be larger than last year, too, after a buoyant summer with lots of mergers and acquisitions. The media also reported this week that as many as 3,000&nbsp;bankers and brokers will earn about &#163;1&nbsp;million each in bonuses alone after the best City performance for years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para11">
<a name="stpa_122">Those figures are hardly typical of a financial sector on the bones of its backside. I do not begrudge those bonuses at all, although I should like some of the City pension fund managers who might receive them to have a word with my constituents in the Expomet and Roxby companies who face missing out on the final salary schemes that they have paid into for years. It is only right that the very small number of taxpayers involved should pay the correct amount of tax and national insurance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para12">
<a name="stpa_123">I hope that I have made it clear that I strongly believe that the Bill is all about fairness. I fully support its objective, and urge the House to give it a Second Reading.

 The hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) said that he did not begrudge the fantastic bonuses earned by people in the City of London, but he seemed unhappy at the City&#039;s success in promoting income for the UK. I find it hard to understand what he meant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para13">
<a name="stpa_124">It is fair to say that for a long time there has been a great deal of invention when it comes to payment. The practice started in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use for payment purposes of gold bars or red wine. That was an extreme attempt to abuse the tax system, and the Paymaster General has said that the Bill is designed to deter such behaviour. It may be inevitable that such deterrence must be continually reinforced when a tax system is complicated and encourages the former colleagues of the hon. Member for Hartlepool to indulge in yet more invention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para14">
<a name="stpa_125">I listened carefully to the hon.

Although I approve of the Bill&#039;s proposals to bring NICs into line with the income tax avoidance regime, it is a pity that the House should have to devote so much effort to simplifying the tax system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para15">
<a name="stpa_126">The complication of the tax system has been compounded by the imposition of many regulations since 1997, which has served to fuel the further growth of the tax avoidance industry. The implementation of a general anti-avoidance rule in a one-sided, broad-brush attempt to simplify matters for the Treasury is unreasonable, given that it maintains a web of bureaucracy for business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para16">
<a name="stpa_127">I also listened carefully to the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), who asked whether the aim should be to have a correct level of taxation&#151;as the hon. Member for Hartlepool maintained&#151;or a fair one. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 490</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;too, shall quote Edmund Troup of Simmons and Simmons, who said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;Faith in general anti-avoidance provision is based on a lack of understanding of the real nature of tax avoidance. The popular idea is too often confused with the claim that &#039;tax avoiders are paying less than they should&#039;, even though there is no objective way of determining how much they &#039;should&#039; be paying.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para17">
<a name="stpa_128">The balanced way to reduce tax avoidance is to simplify the system and cut down the number of limits and exemptions. As has been noted, the shadow Chancellor&#039;s tax reform commission is a step in the right direction. A flat taxation system would be likely to promote the payment of more tax, rather than less, and would certainly discourage avoidance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para18">
<a name="stpa_129">The Paymaster General has said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;The Exchequer is entitled to certainty on behalf of the taxpayer&#151;certainty that taxpayers will pay their fair share&#151;and, similarly, that taxpayers who contribute their fair share have a right to expect others to do so.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 21&nbsp;June 2005; c. 57.]</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-15_para19">
<a name="stpa_130">That is reasonable, but any assessment of what constitutes a fair share must be subjective when it is made in the context of a tax structure as complicated as ours. Simplifying the system would remove the motivation for tax avoidance. As my hon.

In opposition, the Paymaster General said of value-added tax:

 I share the concerns about the Bill expressed by my hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling) and for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field), especially about the Bill&#039;s retrospective nature.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_134">I understand the desire expressed by the Chancellor, the Paymaster General and other Opposition Members to minimise the scope for remuneration contrivances to escape the tax and national insurance net. Indeed, I have considerable sympathy with the objective of dealing with the imaginative but essentially contrived schemes about which we have heard. I confess that the use of platinum sponge is a new one on me, too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_135">However, my concerns go beyond the specific provisions of the Bill. This country has rightly earned great respect in the international business community for the probity of our laws and customs. Indeed, even the HMRC has commanded respect&#151;if little love&#151;for the certainty, if not always the clarity, of its decisions. As&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have heard, companies, individuals and their&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advisers have long enjoyed the ability to base their commercial decisions on a principle of certainty in respect of the tax laws at the time those decisions were made. The law has always been open to interpretation, which has enabled the entire tax advice industry to flourish, but commercial decisions could be made according to the law prevailing at the time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_136">Unfortunately, the Bill reinforces a very unwelcome principle that has been introduced into our tax law&#151;the ability to change the rules as the Government choose. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has expressed concern about that, as the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) noted. In its briefing paper, the ICA said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;Retrospective legislation is not a satisfactory solution: not only does it make for uncertainty for employers but there is a real probability that it is ultra vires European Law&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_137">My views on Europe may not be well known in this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;House, but they are to my constituents and it is extremely rare for me to find comfort in pronouncements from Europe. However, as we have heard from the Liberal Democrat spokesman, there is some case law that needs to be explored in Committee, not least because the Institute of Chartered Accountants states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;We do not think that anyone reading the Paymaster General&#039;s 2&nbsp;December 2004&nbsp;statement could have expected the content of this Bill.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_138">Labour Members have focused much of their enthusiasm for the Bill on the impact it may have on fat cats in the City, and reference has been made to the large sums that many people earn there. The issue is not confined to the City of London, however. In my constituency, there is an individual who sells millions of pounds-worth of perfume to the far east, on which he earns substantial commission. That gentleman could take his business anywhere in the world, and I should like to focus on that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_139">The Prime Minister appears to have woken up only relatively recently to the challenges of globalisation, but the economy has been at the forefront of global trade for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;centuries. Since 1979, as economic liberalisation has been successively introduced, mostly under the previous&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservative Government, increased inward 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 492</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>investment to the UK has provided a major boost to economic growth and productivity. The scale of that investment is well illustrated. The Paymaster General has unfortunately left the Chamber so we cannot confirm whether her regular morning reading includes <i>The Daily Telegraph,</i> but I shall quote a brief extract to illustrate my point:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;Overseas investors own more than a third of the 100&nbsp;blue chip companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, 10&nbsp;of those aren&#039;t even British, 250&nbsp;of the 1,066&nbsp;top flight directors are foreigners and some of our most important industries&#151;such as energy and banking&#151;are largely controlled by European and US&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;companies.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_140">We can thus see that a significant proportion of senior executives in leading companies across industrial sectors, as well as many of those sustaining the City of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;London&#039;s global position in financial services, are foreign nationals, often working for foreign firms. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak with some authority as a few years ago, before I came to this place, I worked for a foreign-owned bank.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-16_para8">
<a name="stpa_141">The relevance of those points to the debate is twofold. First, from an individual point of view, a large number of highly skilled and highly rewarded individuals currently choose to work in the UK in roles that they could also undertake overseas. It is not beyond their wit to try to weight their remuneration away from the higher tax jurisdiction. With modern technology and working practices, especially in the service sector, there is a real risk that by introducing retrospection to our tax system for individuals, doubt will be cast over our personal taxation system, which will encourage income to be earned overseas and, perversely, may reduce rather than increase the return to HMRC.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-16_para9">
<a name="stpa_142">Secondly, from a corporate perspective, the more worrying implication is the doubt that retrospective tax legislation introduces in the fairness of the tax system operating in this country. In a global market, companies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can choose where to operate. Businesses are highly flexible and many can move their operations to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jurisdictions where they perceive commercial advantage. We are increasingly used to the advantages of China and India, about which we hear so much from the Chancellor, in relation to labour-intensive activities, but the capital-intensive sector, where many of these proposals are directed, is highly mobile. A good example is reinsurance, a completely mobile activity, much of which has moved to Bermuda over the last 10&nbsp;years. Such sectors often remunerate their employees very well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-16_para10">
<a name="stpa_143">My concern is that when HMRC is both judge and jury and tax legislation is introduced with retrospective effect, it could seriously erode confidence in the fairness of our tax system. The Government need to take great care. I am not sure whether the Economic Secretary is aware that the last time retrospective tax measures were introduced was under the last Labour Chancellor, Chancellor Healey, and look what happened to him. The serious point is that if companies lose confidence in the tax system, those that are not in this country will think carefully before they choose whether to come to the UK or locate elsewhere. Those already in this country, especially if the breach in the dyke were to be widened with further retrospective proposals, might eventually consider moving away. That would damage the economy, damage confidence in our tax system and damage the Government&#039;s tax revenues.

<a name="51027-16_para11">
<a name="stpa_144">The Paymaster General left us in no doubt that the Bill was designed to stop evasion of national insurance contributions by introducing powers that enable the Treasury to make regulations to prohibit the use of avoidance schemes with retrospective effect from 2&nbsp;December 2004. When the Economic Secretary winds up the debate, I am sure that he will make the valid point that such an intention was set out by the Paymaster General on 2&nbsp;December 2004&nbsp;and that the Bill merely brings the national insurance regime into line with what the Government enacted in the Finance Bill this year, so I understand the right hon. Lady&#039;s comment that she regards the legislation as non-controversial.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-16_para12">
<a name="stpa_145">There are four aspects of the measure that we need to consider, however. Much has already been made of the retrospective nature of the Bill, but we should also consider possible use of the powers beyond that for which they were intended; the whole issue of avoidance, evasion and tax-planning; the introduction of an anti-avoidance rule, to which the Liberal Democrat spokesman referred; and the potential cost to business. I want briefly to examine those issues.
</p>

<a name="51027-16_para13">
<a name="stpa_146">I had the privilege to speak on Second Reading of the Finance Bill and served on its Committee, where luckily the hon.

<a name="stpa_147">The hon. Member for Hartlepool seemed to question the position of Conservative Members. My hon.

That is our position and it extends to national insurance contributions as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-16_para15">
<a name="stpa_148">The Bill, as I understand it, contains three measures: the power to make regulations to create a retrospective liability for national insurance contributions; to allow the disclosure of national insurance contribution avoidance schemes and arrangements; and the voiding of those arrangements and elections. Much has been made of retrospection by my hon. Friends. Any legislation that introduces retrospective powers must be regarded with caution. Understandably, taxpayers are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instinctively nervous, for with the prospect of retrospection they also face the prospect of uncertainty and unfairness. Furthermore, and more important, it creates uncertainty for business and especially for business investment. Certainty is a key component in the environment for business investment and one criterion on which business undoubtedly bases its decisions is the

<br>&nbsp;<br>existing tax and national insurance burden it is likely to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;face, or the likely burden when a decision is made. If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Government constantly introduce legislation with retrospective effect, it will undoubtedly create uncertainty for business and will affect business investment. An inevitable consequence of the Bill will be some undermining of business investment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-16_para16">
<a name="stpa_149">The power to create regulations for retrospective liability is enacted in clauses 1&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;and although those clauses confer that power on the Treasury, the Bill also supposedly constrains the power to the extent that such regulations can be made only to reflect in national insurance regulations previous retrospective changes to the income tax Acts, only where the Treasury considers it expedient for national insurance contribution regulations to have that retrospective effect, and only back to 2&nbsp;December. However, in all those cases the Treasury is acting as its own constraint, so we need reassurance from the Treasury about the scope of the powers, the exact nature of the constraints and the way in which they will be used. The explanatory notes state that the powers will be used only in anti-avoidance measures. That is not helpful, reassuring or terribly explanatory. The Government will want to reassure the House that those powers will be proportionate to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mischief that they aim to tackle, and that they are sufficient only to catch tax avoidance schemes. They should not be so wide that they are disproportionate, and taxpayers&#039; legitimate expectations to be taxed in accordance with the law when the transaction is carried out should not be abused.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-16_para17">
<a name="stpa_150">Clauses 1&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;will be used to bring national insurance contributions regulations in line with regulations imposed by schedule 2&nbsp;of the Finance Act 2005, especially in relation to employee securities for taxation purposes. If I understand clause 1&nbsp;correctly, the powers will be used to ensure that, where possible, NIC and income tax PAYE legislation are changed in parallel. If that is the Treasury&#039;s intention, it would be useful to know that the process will be managed. It is desirable that NIC and income tax disclosure rules be made in parallel. Clauses 1&nbsp;to 7&nbsp;suggest that that is the intention behind the Bill, but I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary answered some practical concerns. If the rules are included in regulations as secondary powers, as the Bill suggests, when will the draft regulations be available? Will the Economic Secretary confirm that they will be subject to proper scrutiny and that the disclosure rules for national insurance and income tax will be similar?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-16_para18">
<a name="stpa_151">The Government&#039;s attitude to tax planning, as opposed to tax avoidance, has been subject to a great deal of criticism, and the issue was raised several times in the Finance Bill Committee. It bears repetition that planning tax liabilities is entirely lawful, but in the Bill the Government appear to maintain their stance that any tax planning is avoidance. Taxpayers have the right to organise their affairs in accordance with the law&#151;that is tax planning. If the Government deem that law inappropriate, that is not the taxpayer&#039;s fault. Tax planning should not be confused with tax avoidance.

<br>&nbsp;<br>widely drawn and tax authorities are given wide discretionary powers, so the Government are effectively introducing the general anti-avoidance rule that they first sought to introduce in 1997. In 1997, the Chancellor asked the Inland Revenue to investigate the impact of a general anti-avoidance rule, but, following objections, the Government pursued the disclosure regime route. However, if disclosure legislation is too widely drawn its powers extend beyond those of anti-avoidance or appropriate disclosure regimes, as wide-ranging and arbitrary powers are introduced for tax authorities that go well beyond the mischief that they are intended to address.

<a name="stpa_159">It is not clear which schemes will be allowed and which prohibited when they are left unspecified by a general catch-all. By contrast, specific laws would aim to define abuse and avoidance. Discretion has been granted to the authorities over NICs and income tax but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster said, that should go hand in hand with binding tax and NIC clearance granted by the HMRC when its opinion or advice is sought about a tax scheme by a taxpayer prior to making certain decisions about the structure of their financial affairs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_160">HMRC has resisted that proposal, and undoubtedly the Paymaster-General will repeat that it is not in the business of giving free tax advice. That argument falls, because she has changed the rules, and if a specific proposal is taken to HMRC on a matter of tax or NIC policy in which the authority has acknowledged and increased discretion, it is wholly appropriate that it should have a duty to give a ruling about how it will exercise those powers prior to the implementation of a scheme.
</p>








<p><a name="st_108"><a name="51027-17_spnew2"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument is based on a fundamental misunderstanding. The Bill does not give discretion to HMRC. The House will decide whether avoidance schemes are to be closed down as a result of the proposal in both the Finance Bill, which introduces primary legislation on income tax, and in national insurance regulations, which are subject to the affirmative procedure. It is the House that takes the decision and no one else.

<p><a name="st_109"><a name="51027-17_spnew3"><b> Stephen Hammond: </b> 
 None the less, if discretionary powers are to be increased overall&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> There is obviously a dispute about whether the Government are increasing discretionary powers.

<a name="stpa_161">Finally, what are cost implications of the Bill for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;business? The regulatory appraisal says that employers who have engaged in avoidance must submit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supplementary end-of-year returns for NICs. According to the explanatory notes, that will affect only 500 employers and will not cost more than &#163;3,000 per employer. Does the fact that the number of affected employers is small show that the previous regime was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;working? Who calculated the &#163;3,000 cost? The regulatory appraisal says that 21,000 small businesses and a further 90,000 self-employed people will incur small familiarisation costs, which is a big extra burden on business. Who made that estimate and who judged the costs to be negligible? The explanatory notes say that the measure will generate an additional &#163;95 million in NICs in 2004&#150;05, and &#163;240 million per annum thereafter. The HMRC website, however, states that the Bill will secure tax and NIC yields of &#163;200 million in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2004&#150;05 and &#163;500 million thereafter. It will be interesting for the House to know which of those is correct.

 Nobody could dispute the important principle that illegitimate tax avoidance must be dealt with, but as we heard in our debate today, there are issues concerning certainty, which means that we must consider legislation such as the Bill with great care and sensitivity.

<a name="51027-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_163">I have two general points to make. First, simplifying the tax system as a whole would, over time, reduce the desire to avoid tax by complicated schemes, NIC schemes or other forms of avoidance. However, as emerged clearly today, retrospection should be used very sparingly indeed. I fear we risk moving away from that principle as the Government desperately try to fill their black hole. Secondly, the increasing burden on small businesses from filling in extra forms and providing even more information to the Treasury as a result of the Bill must be considered in the context of the ever increasing weight of bureaucracy.

That requires clarification. I do not expect the Minister to comment specifically on the scheme this afternoon, but it would be useful if he could write to me explaining how such a scheme is likely to operate in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-17_para18">
<a name="stpa_176">The enterprise management incentive scheme was introduced in the Finance Act 2000&nbsp;and it neatly demonstrates the conflicting and contradictory aims that may be the result of complicating the tax system and over-regulating the business community. The scheme was designed to help small, growing companies to recruit and retain high-calibre individuals who would otherwise be attracted by more established businesses offering better salaries. A qualifying company is allowed to grant share options worth up to &#163;3&nbsp;million to any number of its employees. No tax or NICs are payable on the grant of the share options, provided that they are capable of being exercised&#151;and are exercised&#151;within 10&nbsp;years. If, on the exercise of the share option, the price at which the employee can exercise the option is at least equal to the market value of the shares when the option was granted, no tax or NICs are charged.

<a name="stpa_177">While such schemes are welcome for trying to help&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smaller, entrepreneurial companies to attract and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recruit high-quality individuals, the Bill might disproportionately affect the very companies that the Government are trying to help to implement similar schemes, for similar purposes, by mitigating the amount of NICs that they pay. I am thus citing a practical example of what we are talking about, so I would like the Minister to shine some light on how the system is likely to work in practice.

<a name="stpa_178">We have seen huge growth in the size of the Red Book over the past few years, and our tax system is now very complex.

<p><a name="st_113"><a name="51027-18_spmin0"><b>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury  (Mr. Ivan Lewis): </b> 
 This has undoubtedly been an interesting debate about an important Bill that is absolutely central to the Government&#039;s aim of deterring tax and NICs avoidance. Before I address some of the specific points raised during the debate in a little detail, I shall reiterate the Bill&#039;s purpose.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_184">The Bill demonstrates our continuing commitment to take action against avoidance. It is key to achieving the Treasury and Government&#039;s objectives of fairness and opportunity by ensuring that all pay the correct amount of tax and national insurance. It is an essential element in building a serious and credible deterrent against future avoidance activity, and is needed to secure a total tax and national insurance yield of &#163;200 million in 2004&#150;05 and &#163;500 million a year thereafter. As the income tax disclosure provisions have demonstrated, it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not possible to anticipate the range and complexity of such extremely contrived arrangements. The 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 501</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Government intend to close down such activity permanently. The Bill will ensure that the Government can deal with any arrangements that emerge in future that are designed to frustrate their intention that employers and employees should pay the proper amount of national insurance on the rewards of employment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_185">I now come to specific points raised during the debate. The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) made a typically reasoned and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fair speech. Indeed, it was based in the real world to a large extent, but when he talked about sitting on this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;side of the House and visiting the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) one day, it began to reach the realms of fantasy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_186">The hon. Gentleman seemed to advocate the virtues of a flat tax. I tell him that we will make it absolutely clear to the British people at every opportunity that if the Conservative party were ever to govern this country, it would impose on the people a flat tax that would be both unfair and impractical. The people of this country will make judgments about the nature of such policies when the time comes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_187">The hon. Gentleman used the phrase &quot;desperate Treasury&quot; and that sentiment was echoed by several Conservative Members. That desperate Treasury has delivered to this country low inflation, low interest rates,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;million new jobs and the lowest unemployment in living memory. Let us be clear what the business community asks of any Government&#151;that they deliver&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stability. If a Government deliver economic stability, businesses will grow and prosper. No Government since the war in this country have delivered such macro-economic stability as ours, so let us stop the nonsense of labelling the Treasury as desperate, or of saying that measures such as the Bill somehow undermine business competitiveness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_188">The hon. Gentleman talked about bona fide avoidance schemes, although I am sure that he did not mean to do so. There is no such thing as a bona fide avoidance scheme, although his comment colours several contributions made by Conservative Members. Avoiding taxation is not a demonstration of flair and innovation. If we gave people the impression that we will incentivise, reward and encourage flair and innovation in the context of avoiding tax responsibilities, what kind of message would we be sending to the private sector in this country?
</p>








<p><a name="st_114"><a name="51027-18_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mark Field: </b> 
 I think that the Economic Secretary will find that the record shows that I referred to bona fide remuneration schemes earlier on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_189">The hon. Gentleman makes an important point about flair and innovation. I tried to make as balanced a point as possible about that in my speech. Flair and innovation mean not just the flair and innovation of the brightest tax and employment benefit remuneration scheme advisers, who try to find small differences between their schemes and those proposed by the Government so that they can avoid taxes. Flair and innovation have a far more important part to play. My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) and

<p><a name="st_115"><a name="51027-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lewis: </b> 
 I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. I shall read out the recent result of a survey. It reads:

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_191">That is what the latest <i>European Cities Monitor</i> shows. London came top in five of the 12&nbsp;categories questioned in the survey, including the quality of staff. Any suggestion that there is any undermining of flair and innovation by the Government&#039;s policies, economic or social, is arrant nonsense.
</p>








<p><a name="st_116"><a name="51027-18_spnew4"><b> Mr. Field: </b> 
 I will not take any personal credit for London&#039;s great name in this regard. There is an important point in relation to flair and innovation, in that we are talking of a global market. We are quite happy with and proud of our record against other European countries, but we are inward looking if we believe that our success against Paris, Hamburg or Munich is enough. There are 23&nbsp;cities with a population of 2&nbsp;million or more. Cities are fast growing In China. There are cities growing up from Delhi to Bangalore. There are other such cities in India. We exist in a global market and it shows a paucity of aspiration simply to make reference to our success in competitiveness, flair and innovation by comparison with our European neighbours.
</p>








<p><a name="st_117"><a name="51027-18_spnew5"><b> Mr. Lewis: </b> 
 By any international comparison this country is doing well economically. Having said that, we have a long way to go. There are many other countries that would die to have low inflation, low interest rates and the levels of unemployment that this country has, as well as, alongside that, our level of investment in the public good and in public services. There are so many countries that would aspire to achieve the combination of economic stability and economic success alongside social justice, which arguably has been uniquely the success of this Government. That is in the context of the global challenges that lie ahead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_192">We are not complacent. We recognise that the challenges that will come at us in future from India and China require us to raise our national game even further in skills, innovation, long-term planning and in sensible and active regional policy. We recognise also that there&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a constant need for the Government to be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encouraging the country to be dynamic and to be accelerating the pace of change. It is necessary to recognise the real challenges that come as a consequence of globalisation.

<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 503</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the issue here is the importance of fairness and equity and the idea that all taxpayers should fulfil their proper responsibilities as equal citizens of this country, wherever they live, whatever their income levels and whatever sector they work in. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-18_para13">
<a name="stpa_195">I am pleased that the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) said up front that he supports the objectives that are set out in the Bill. He was right to talk about a spectrum of behaviour. However, I challenge the hon. Gentleman on one of his points. He said that this is not a moralistic issue, but entirely a practical one. I believe that people paying proper and fair levels of taxation is a moral issue in terms of the sort of society and economy that we want to be encouraging. The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that we cannot just have a moral approach. I accept that we must be very careful about the practical consequences. However, it is my view that we are dealing with a moral issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-18_para14">
<a name="stpa_196">The hon. Gentleman and others spoke about the retrospective nature of the proposed measures. Probably the best justification for retrospection is for me quickly to remind the House of what has happened year after year. In 1991, we had unit trusts. In 1993, there were gold bullion and tradable commodities. In 1994, there were diamonds and fine wine. In 1995, we had grants of options in third party companies. In 1996, there were own company share awards and options. In 1997, we had trade debt and restricted covenants. In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1998, there were conditional shares. In 1998&nbsp;there were also readily convertible assets. In 1999, we had the exercise of options. In 2003, there were employee benefit trusts. There were also adjustable options. Also in 2003&nbsp;there was national insurance contributions alignment to schedule 22&nbsp;to the Finance Act 2003. In 2004&nbsp;there was national insurance contributions alignment to sections 86&nbsp;to 95&nbsp;of the Finance Act 2004.

<a name="stpa_197">All those examples reinforce the need to move in the direction in which the Bill takes us.

 We have just heard for the second time from Ministers a list of the previous mischievous attempts to get around the tax and national insurance regime. However, that fails to deal with the issue of&nbsp;retrospection, about which my hon. Friends and I were arguing.

Arguably, Germany has experienced some of those difficulties, yes, because of unification&#151;we must be fair about that, and a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people are unfair when they forget to mention the unification of Germany&#151;but also because it has been slow in some ways to face up to the realities of global economic change, and our economic policies have been based entirely on facing up to them.

<p><a name="st_129"><a name="51027-20_spnew1"><b> Tim Farron  (Westmorland and Lonsdale) (LD):</b> 
 I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to address the House on the subject of affordable housing in Cumbria. My constituents in Westmorland and Lonsdale have average incomes of around &#163;16,000&nbsp;per annum, with average house prices at about &#163;200,000. According to the Government&#039;s assessment of an affordable home&#151;a home valued at three and a half times one&#039;s income&#151;my constituents would need to earn more than three times the local average in order to own a home in their area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_210">For most local people in south Cumbria, buying a home is simply out of the question, but now a decent rented home is getting beyond the reach of most people. Last year, the local authority sold over 250&nbsp;council properties, and at the same time roughly 130&nbsp;new social houses for rent were made available by local housing associations. That is a net loss of 120&nbsp;social houses&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;during the last 12&nbsp;months, and that is the lowest net loss for many years, partly because the council is simply running out of council houses to sell.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_211">People who, had they been first-time buyers a decade ago, would have been able to afford a mortgage for a starter home, have absolutely no chance of doing so now. Those people do one of two things: they either leave the area or they enter the rented market, both of which have seriously damaging effects on our local communities. South lakeland currently loses 27&nbsp;per cent. of its young people, never to return. Not only is that heart-breaking for local families, it is also disastrous for the economy and for society, stripping our towns and villages of talent and energy, reducing the skills base, reducing the birth rate, leading to falling school rolls and leaching the lifeblood from our communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_212">Those who stay and decide to rent find themselves joining a pressurised market. As the pressure on the market and the private rented sector grows, rents go up, pushing many more families into the social rented sector. But the amount of social housing is shrinking each year and the consequences of that are appalling. Families who, a decade ago, would have qualified comfortably for a council or housing association property are now dumped in substandard or inappropriate accommodation, waiting on a housing list for an eternity. In Kendal, the council is forced to offer young families hostel accommodation for months on end because there are simply no homes available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_213">The human misery caused by this situation is immense. The impact on the physical and mental health of people caught in the trap is vast, and the effect on the children involved is unacceptable in any civilised society, and yet, of the 42,000&nbsp;properties in my constituency, roughly 7,000&nbsp;are not lived in. Some of those are holiday lets, which provide a valuable tourist income to our area, but most are second homes and are left vacant for much of the year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_214">Excessive second home ownership pushes house prices even further beyond the means of local people and removes homes that would otherwise be, and indeed once were, in the hands of local families. The impact on 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 509</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>our community of excessive second home ownership is crippling, because the loss of properties to the second home sector threatens the survival of local businesses, schools and public transport, as well as other services. Villages such as Satterthwaite and Lowick in my constituency have lost, or are soon to lose, their local schools because the houses that used to send children to those schools now stand empty for much of the year. Villages such as Bouth have lost their post office and others, such as Crosthwaite, face the same fate because the houses no longer contain local consumers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_215">I do not want to focus any blame on people who have second homes, and I would not want to upset Labour Members, many of whom no doubt have second homes. I merely make observations about my constituency, where I have my home and where my constituents struggle in the face of a lopsided and increasingly inaccessible housing market. Local people do not resent second home owners; indeed, many who are classified as such are people who have purchased a home in my constituency with the intention of moving to it full-time once they retire. Those people will become fully fledged and wholehearted members of the community in time. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encourage them to hurry up and join us as quickly as possible, because their local post office, church and bus service need them.

 My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the fact that affordable housing is a problem throughout the country, particularly in rural areas.

<p><a name="st_134"><a name="51027-21_spmin0"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. I remind hon. Members, as I did a few minutes ago, that this debate is about affordable housing in Cumbria.
</p>








<p><a name="st_135"><a name="51027-21_spnew0"><b> Tim Farron: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that important point, to which I shall turn in a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_219">It is important to recognise that there are competing liberties here&#151;the right to have a first home and the right to have a second home. When it comes to a competition between those liberties, and at times it does, I am certain about which side of the fence I am on. It is important that the primary right is to a decent and affordable first home for people and their families. Second home ownership can bring some benefits to an area but a balance needs to be struck.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_220">How do we achieve that? The Government could put a cap on the second-home market in those parts of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cumbria where it is agreed that the proportion of second home ownership is excessive. They could do that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by introducing a new planning law that would place turning a first home into a second home in a formal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;category of change of use. In parishes where second-home ownership exceeded an agreed limit, the planning authority&#039;s default position would be to refuse any application for a change of use.
</p>








<p><a name="st_136"><a name="51027-21_spnew1"><b> Mr. Dan Rogerson  (North Cornwall) (LD):</b> 
 I welcome my hon. Friend&#039;s comments on planning. Does he agree that there is also an opportunity for dwellings that are currently second homes, when resold, to be brought back into use as first homes through that planning mechanism?
</p>








<p><a name="st_137"><a name="51027-21_spnew2"><b> Tim Farron  (Westmorland and Lonsdale) (LD):</b> 
 Yes. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. Clearly, the Government could build such a provision into the mechanism. That would be helpful. It is important to examine the possibilities and be pragmatic. It is not beyond the Government&#039;s wit to draft enforceable legislation and guidance on the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_221">Another way in which to affect the housing market positively would be to build on the Government&#039;s encouraging recent work of granting local authorities permission to charge second home owners up to 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cent. of the full amount of council tax. The position is much improved. The previous Conservative Administration&#151;representatives of which are scarce&#151;deliberately granted a 50 per cent. council tax subsidy for second-home owners when they introduced the council tax in 1991. It is a great shame that no 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>27 Oct 2005 : Column 511</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Conservative Members are here to intervene and put me right should I be wrong. It was a reprehensible act, which redistributed wealth from the hard-working many to the privileged few.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_222">I urge the Government to abolish the remaining 10&nbsp;per cent. relief to second home owners and to examine the possibility of introducing permission further to increase council tax for second home owners in areas where there is deemed to be an excess of second-home ownership. Such a measure would reduce demand for second homes, although, realistically, it may not make a vast difference. More important, it would provide local authorities with the wherewithal to fund new affordable housing schemes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_223">The communities of south lakeland are well aware of the Government&#039;s plan, which has already been mentioned, to introduce new pension rules from April 2006, to give tax relief of up to &#163;215,000&nbsp;to individuals who invest in a second or third property and place it in their personal pension. They also know that the change will have disastrous consequences for our area, providing another incentive for purchasing second homes and further heating an already overheated market, thus leaving local families who are searching for a home in an even more desperate position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_224">With one in six homes already beyond the reach of local families, how much worse will the position be for Cumbria&#039;s towns and villages when the new pension rules are introduced? How many more local young people and families will be forced to move away from the area that they call their home as a result of the proposal? How many beautiful lakeland villages, which so many hon. Members have visited on their holidays, will become moribund ghost towns, bereft of a living, working community?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_225">The Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales national parks are in my constituency. For those national parks to remain valuable centres of peace and recreation for the nation, the communities in them must not be allowed to die, replaced by weekend havens for the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well-to-do. The national parks were set up as accessible assets for the nation&#151;for the people of this country. To contribute towards the parks&#039; becoming available only to a minority flies in the face of the national park ideal, with which the Labour party has often closely aligned itself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_226">I am sure that the Government did not intend to damage rural communities through their pension plans. However, the proposal&#039;s unforeseen consequences will be appalling. I ask the Minister to confirm in his response that the Government will abandon the proposed change in the pension rules.
</p>








<p><a name="st_138"><a name="51027-21_spnew3"><b> Danny Alexander: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend accept that the consequences are not totally unforeseen because Liberal Democrat Members have raised them not only in the past few months but in the past couple of years? Despite the assurances from the Treasury that such consequences will not ensue, the aggressive marketing campaigns of many companies to promote those products suggest that they could ultimately be worth several billion pounds.
</p>








<p><a name="st_139"><a name="51027-21_spnew4"><b> Tim Farron: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. Perhaps I was being a little too generous, and gentle, to the Government in the hope of coaxing something out of them.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_227">I suggest that, if the Government are seeking to stimulate saving and investment, they might instead offer tax credits for investment in affordable housing developments. The benefits of such a move would be many and, importantly, they would be shared. Such a scheme would provide a return for investors, a boost to the supply of affordable homes, and a contribution to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the achievement of Government policy&#151;which would be no bad thing, I am sure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_228">While I am in the mood for making suggestions, may I say that I would be grateful if the Government actively encouraged the sustainable development of affordable homes for local people within the national parks? The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yorkshire Dales national park, for example, has won plaudits for its work in ensuring the development of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affordable homes for local people and in flexibly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interpreting its planning and conservation roles, employing much-needed common sense in response to local needs. Such good practice should be spread to other national parks, with the Government&#039;s proactive support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_229">My neighbours and fellow residents in Westmorland and Lonsdale face average house prices that are 13&nbsp;times higher than the average annual wage. This is not untypical for rural areas such as ours, as my hon. Friends have pointed out. The Government&#039;s support for the development of new affordable housing, for purchase as well as for rent, is welcome, as is their support for shared ownership schemes and for the provision of local occupancy clauses in affordable housing developments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_230">However, I have two concerns in that respect. The first is that the term &quot;affordable&quot; seems to have been stretched beyond all credibility. New properties on sale for upwards of &#163;120,000&nbsp;are being presented as affordable housing, but I can assure the House that, for most of my constituents, that amount is definitely not affordable. Secondly, local occupancy clauses are far too easily abused and thwarted. I have come across many examples in Grasmere, Windermere, Coniston and Ambleside of buyers who, technically, meet the criteria for local occupancy, but who have purchased property and let it for commercial purposes, rather than for the provision of affordable housing to local families. I hope that the Minister will take notice of my early-day motion calling for more effective enforcement of local occupancy clauses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_231">In closing, I observe that the term &quot;affordable housing&quot; has now fully entered the Government&#039;s lexicon, and I am grateful for that. However, the problem is that too much housing in Cumbria is unaffordable, and too much of it is unoccupied. That situation is not inevitable, however, and it is certainly not irretrievable. It is within the grasp of society to affect this situation, and to remove the appalling pressure on local families. The Lake district and the Yorkshire dales, which I represent, are often described as the lungs of England. I call on the Government to take action that will benefit the communities that populate those lungs, to allow them to breathe more easily.

<br>&nbsp;<br>and Lonsdale (Tim Farron) on securing this debate, but with very genuine congratulations. He has raised this issue in his maiden speech, in two letters to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, in his early-day motion, in a press release this afternoon and in this Adjournment debate, and I congratulate him on his campaign. I agree with much of what he has said, and I commend him in other ways as well. I commend him for his election result, which we all watched with interest, and I am happy to commend him for his Lancastrian roots. However, I have to disagree with his choice of football team. I am afraid that he is a Blackburn fan&#151;which is a little way down the road from my own home town&#151;but he cannot be perfect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_232">The hon. Gentleman has raised some important questions in this debate. I want first to set out the national approach, and then to consider the situation in Cumbria. I shall then try to address some of the specific points that he has raised. It is well known that the Government are committed at national level to addressing the need for more affordable housing. The background to the problem is deep rooted and long standing. Let me give a couple of statistics. Over the past 30&nbsp;years, the number of households has increased by 30&nbsp;per cent., but in the same period the number of new homes built has fallen by 50&nbsp;per cent. That has widened the gap between demand and supply, so there is little wonder that the long-term house price trend is so much higher in this country than in others. That, of course, is set out in the Barker report, which is extremely important for the Government and for the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_233">On the supply side, we have, as is known, a strong strategy to increase housing supply, which is set out in the communities plan. Much public comment has been made on that plan delivering results in London and the south-east. I should put it on the record that there was a 36&nbsp;per cent. increase in the number of new homes being built per year between 2001&nbsp;and 2005, combined with increased densities in house building&#151;it is important that that is achieved&#151;and a significant increase in re-use of brownfield sites. There are those who say that the policy is to build over England&#039;s green and pleasant land, but that is a clich&#233; that perhaps makes for an easy headline and it is not borne out by the facts. The hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale has not accused us of doing that, although others have.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para15">
<a name="stpa_234">This policy is addressing one cause of the affordability problem, which is that, over several decades, we simply have not built enough new homes. The underlying reasons for the increasing number of households are well known and they include more single people and longevity. Let me again put it on the record that Government policy is in favour of longevity. This is a good thing, not a bad thing, but it presents us with some difficulties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para16">
<a name="stpa_235">On the other side, however, a range of measures are necessary in addition to a stable market and increasing supply. Since 1997, we have doubled the investment in affordable housing for rent or purchase, and &#163;5&nbsp;billion will have been spent over the three years to 2006. That investment will support the delivery of our new range of simpler, more affordable, more accessible home ownership schemes.

<a name="51027-21_para17">
<a name="stpa_236">In the short term, through our new homebuy scheme, we will help more than 100,000&nbsp;households&#151;that is a lot of people, not just 100,000&nbsp;of the population&#151;to own their own home by 2010. Homebuy will provide a flexible shared equity-based product, which will increase access to home ownership for those priced out of the market. It will also provide opportunities for social tenants to buy a share in their home. Homebuy will reinforce the longer-term strategy by increasing home ownership opportunities for key workers and other first-time buyers now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para18">
<a name="stpa_237">Empty homes are also a factor in contributing to an adequate supply. Over the last decade, the number of vacant dwellings has dropped by nearly 180,000, but there are still 690,000, according to the latest figures, which are from 2004. There remains more to be done, which is why we have recently provided local authorities with a new weapon in their armoury&#151;empty dwelling management orders. I would encourage all hon. Members to pay attention to this bit, because their advice surgeries will be full of complainants, such as landlords who have been abusing their position, who want their help.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para19">
<a name="stpa_238">Empty dwelling management orders support the efforts of local councils to get empty dwellings back into use. There are also tax incentives to support the use of space above shops, the conversion of properties and the renovation of properties that have been empty for three or more years. I hope that there is support for the orders across the House, although it impossible to say whether the official Opposition support them. They have probably gone to their second homes, and I hope they are paying 90&nbsp;per cent. council tax on them.

<a name="51027-21_para20">
<a name="stpa_239">Many initiatives focus on the urban areas where key workers and first-time buyers have found it difficult to find affordable housing, but rural areas have not been, and will not be, overlooked. Current schemes are designed to be flexible enough to respond to the needs of rural communities as well as urban ones. Second homes, for example, are often of particular concern. We have heard the stark statistics&#151;I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for putting them on the record&#151;and other rural areas face similar problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para21">
<a name="stpa_240">Since last April, councils have had the option to reduce the 50&nbsp;per cent. council tax discount on second homes to a minimum of 10&nbsp;per cent. We understand that many authorities have chosen to do so&#151;we are not saying that councils must do so, but they have that choice, depending on their local circumstances. I wish that some of the newspapers that, under the Freedom of Information Act 2000&nbsp;introduced by the Government, report the allowances of Members of Parliament, would point out that those of us who have second homes in fact voted to increase our own taxes quite substantially&#151;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am not sure whether all Members realised what they were doing at the time. It is perhaps not a flippant point, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I have wanted to put it on the record for over a year now. I thank you for allowing me a wide berth on that.

<a name="stpa_241">To return to the debate, the Rural Affordable Housing Commission, established jointly by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, is now examining issues, problems and solutions across the country in rural areas, and will make recommendations based on good practice.

<a name="51027-21_para23">
<a name="stpa_242">The hon. Gentleman made a point about self-invested personal pensions, on which there were a couple of interventions. I believe that there is a deep misunderstanding on this matter. He referred to an &quot;unintended consequence&quot; of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor&#039;s policy. I must tell the House that very little, if anything, that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor does is unintended or not thought through. There are limiting factors in relation to SIPPs. We do not believe that the transfer of a pension fund into property will have the negative impact to which he refers. People who go for SIPPS and see property as a form of investment are a tiny minority. Under the scheme, one does not buy a second home as part of one&#039;s pension and use that second home as a holiday home or whatever; the property is owned by the pension fund, and any call on that property is paid out of the pension fund.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para24">
<a name="stpa_243">Of course, the hon. Gentleman will raise the question of enforcement, which is an important point, but we do not believe that the concept of SIPPs will lead to the sort of consequences that he and the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander) fear. Responsible financial advisers and other commentators are making it clear that SIPPs is likely to be an attractive option only for a minority and will not produce substantial changes in behaviour.

<a name="stpa_244">Let me turn to the meat of the debate. Clearly, Cumbria is one of the most beautiful parts of our country&#151;it is not the most beautiful constituency, but it might be the second most beautiful&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps it is the third most beautiful. I shall not start a bidding war.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para26">
<a name="stpa_245">It is clear that unique challenges are involved in trying to provide affordable homes for local people in the Cumbria area. Owing to the attractiveness and quality of life on offer in the Lake district and surrounding areas, demand for housing is extremely high, much of it coming from outside the immediate area. The link between local income levels and the cost of housing has been broken. and for many years local people have struggled to find a place on the property ladder.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para27">
<a name="stpa_246">The Government have been concerned for some time about the position in Cumbria and are committed to doing what they can to help. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has taken a personal interest in the matter, and has met local stakeholders twice to listen to their concerns and recommend new approaches to tackling the issue. That reflects his long-standing personal commitment to the Lake district and its surroundings.

<a name="51027-21_para28">
<a name="stpa_247">Since those meetings, the Government office for the north-west and the Audit Commission have been working closely with local authorities and registered social landlords in Cumbria to promote a more strategic approach to affordable housing provision. As a result, a group of the county&#039;s local authorities known as the Cumbria strategic housing group have succeeded in attracting an additional &#163;4&nbsp;million from the North West

<br>&nbsp;<br>Regional Housing Board for 2005&#150;06&nbsp;specifically for the provision of new homes in the area. That reflects the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high priority that the board gives affordable housing provision in the new regional housing strategy, and is in addition to the mainstream Housing Corporation investment of over &#163;20&nbsp;million for new affordable housing in Cumbria in 2004&#150;06.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para29">
<a name="stpa_248">No one is suggesting that local partners have been inactive. For example, South Lakeland district council has dedicated its increased council tax receipts from second home owners&#151;a consequence of the change on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which the hon. Gentleman was gracious enough to congratulate the Government&#151;to the provision of affordable housing. As a result, the council expects to invest around &#163;950,000&nbsp;this year in a variety of schemes, including funding for the improvement of properties and their conversion to affordable housing for rent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para30">
<a name="stpa_249">However, although finance is clearly important, this is not simply an issue of public funding. The new planning policy statement 3&nbsp;on housing, due to be published for consultation shortly, will strengthen our ability to provide affordable housing through the planning system. That is a postcard that the hon. Gentleman can take home with him. Officials at the Government office for the north-west have been working with Cumbrian local planning authorities, encouraging them to make the maximum use of existing planning powers to secure affordable housing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para31">
<a name="stpa_250">The forthcoming joint structure plan for Cumbria and the Lake district proposes a new policy requiring 50&nbsp;per cent. of new homes built outside the national park area to be affordable, and 100&nbsp;per cent. of new homes built inside the national park to be secured in perpetuity either for occupation by local people or as social housing. The structure plan also proposes to introduce the concept of allocating sites specifically for social housing in the national park. This is the first time that that approach has been adopted in Cumbria. It extends the existing &quot;rural exception sites&quot; approach, which is a familiar route for the provision of new affordable housing. The revised structure plan is due to be adopted in January 2006.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para32">
<a name="stpa_251">We should not focus entirely on new housing. The Government&#039;s commitment to providing decent homes by tackling the huge backlog of under-investment in our housing stock is also having a significant impact in Cumbria. Additional public sector investment of &#163;21&nbsp;million has been supplemented by a further &#163;85&nbsp;million of private sector investment. That has helped to ensure that by 2010&nbsp;Cumbria&#039;s social rented housing will meet the decent homes standard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51027-21_para33">
<a name="stpa_252">I hope that the hon. Gentleman, the hon. Member for Workington and other Cumbria Members with a direct interest will welcome the joint structure plan.

<a name="stpa_253">The hon. Gentleman asked whether we could find ways to change planning law and to provide a cap. As I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, the new policy consultation will propose some changes. I am not sure that his scheme is workable, but I invite him to respond to the document.
