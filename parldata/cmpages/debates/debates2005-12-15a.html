<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="51215-01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Jim Knight): </b> 
 As you know, Mr. Speaker, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is attending the World Trade Organisation talks in Hong Kong. Under the Secretary of State&#039;s chairmanship, the European Union Agriculture Ministers reached an historic agreement to reform the sugar regime, which has remained largely untouched for the previous 40 years. Reform of the sugar regime was a key priority of the UK presidency.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="51215-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bone: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for his response, but does he agree that the sugar regime demonstrates everything that is wrong with the European Union? Consumers in the EU pay three times the world price, EU taxpayers pay &#163;1 billion a year and, worse still, farmers in the EU dump their product on developing countries, destroying local farming. Is the reform not a case of too little, too late?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="51215-01_spnew1"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 I was just about to say how much I agreed with the hon. Gentleman, as I concurred with all the reasons why it was important to reform the sugar regime. However, the reform is good for consumers and taxpayers because it will reduce prices and halve the current &#8364;7 billion a year cost. It is good for jobs, given that we lost 16,000 food processing jobs while sugar 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2005 : Column 1422</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>prices were three times the world price, and it is good for growers, because it ends the scandalous distortion under which EU growers receive only &#163;1 for every &#163;5 spent to support them. That is why it has been broadly welcomed by most key UK interests, that is why Tate & Lyle&#039;s share price soared after the deal, and that is why it should be welcomed in the House.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="51215-01_spnew2"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 The British farmer is not frightened of change, as the Minister knows, but he is only too aware of the pace of change, particularly the question of the rate of compensation and which growers will receive it. Can the Minister explain the future of the British Sugar factory at York, and what alternative break crop is available to arable farmers if the demise of sugar beet takes place?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="51215-01_spnew3"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 As I said, the deal offers the EU big sector sustainability and long-term certainty. The Commission estimated that twice as many jobs would be at risk from failure to reform as from the market-based approach that has been agreed. Farmers will receive more than 60 per cent. compensation for the sugar price cut through the single farm payment, including recognition of the UK&#039;s deficit area status. Consultation will take place with the industry on the exact way in which the compensation will be paid. The future of the sugar factory in York is in the hands of the market.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="51215-01_spnew4"><b> Paddy Tipping  (Sherwood)</b> 
 (Lab): I congratulate the Minister and his colleagues on reform of the sugar regime, which shows that, with commitment, reform of the common agricultural policy can take place, although it needs to go further. As there are consequences for both producers and processors, will the Minister publish details of the scheme as quickly as possible so that decisions about future planting, the operation of the market and its effect on the British Sugar factory in Newark can be made?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="51215-01_spnew5"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 I am sure that as soon as we have the details requested by my hon. Friend, they will be published.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="51215-01_spnew6"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): Could the Minister say a little about the impact on African, Caribbean and Pacific countries&#151;especially Guyana, where 35,000 people work in the sugar industry, on which they and their families are heavily dependent? The anticipated changes will reduce their national income by about $40 million per year, which wipes out by a factor of five the $8 million from which they have benefited in G8 debt relief. Will the Minister address the problems experienced by Guyana?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="51215-01_spnew7"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The UK shares my hon. Friend&#039;s concerns and we accept that the deal will reduce prices received by our traditional African, Caribbean and Pacific suppliers and reduce the attractiveness of the EU market for least developed countries. However, EU prices will still be at twice world levels and preferential access will still be guaranteed under the terms of the existing sugar protocol. Contrary to certain reports, the deal contains no new import restrictions. In addition, ACP countries will benefit from a two-year delay in price cuts. The amount of aid has still to be determined 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2005 : Column 1423</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and cannot be settled until the new EU financial perspectives are agreed. The UK is pressing for at least &#8364;250 million a year over seven years.

 (Con): As the Minister knows, contrary to popular myth a large number of the growers in East Anglia are not large estates or large farmers. They are smallholders and small farmers and they are a vital part of the rural economy. Will the deal protect their specific interests?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="51215-01_spnew9"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 Certainly, as the details of the compensation are worked out, we will have in mind the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents&#151;the small farmers who play an important role in the rural economy. Until the details have been agreed, it is difficult for me to add any more.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="51215-01_spnew10"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 Everybody will be pleased at the progress made over recent days in Montreal, but from the written answer that the Minister gave my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) on 29 November at column 312 on greenhouse gases, it looks as though we will not have met our targets over the past two years. To make sure that we can all have confidence that we are going in the right direction, will the Minister agree to annual targets from now on, independently assessed and adjudicated? That way, we   would know that there was no spin and no dishonesty.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="51215-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it was a tremendous outcome at the Montreal talks. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State deserves a great deal of credit and she was much admired for the way that she led the whole EU delegation. Let me make it clear that there are two targets. First, there is our Kyoto target, which is legally binding and which we are well on track to meet and, as I said, to exceed. Then there is our domestic voluntary target of 20 per cent., which we are not on track to meet, but we are having the climate change review in order to ensure that we do so. As regards independent monitoring, the inventory is already independently monitored by the National Environmental Technology Centre, the United Nations framework convention on climate change and the National Audit Office. On individual targets, reductions in CO <sub>2</sub>  have been up and down in different years, but we are willing to consider any suggestions that the hon. Gentleman may have.

 (Lab/Co-op): It was indeed a considerable achievement to obtain a Montreal agreement, which I notice Friends of the Earth described as an &quot;historic agreement&quot; that would &quot;strengthen global resolve&quot;. The Secretary of State deserves slightly more enthusiastic praise than we heard from the Liberal Democrat Benches. In the spirit of consensus that affects us all nowadays, will my hon. Friend give us an idea of how he intends to build upon the agreement at Montreal, which was a major step forward but will clearly require a great deal of work, at European level in particular, to take it forward?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="51215-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right, and there will be further opportunities to discuss the Montreal outcome. It gives us effective rules for implementing the Kyoto protocol, agreement on new targets and frameworks post-2012 and a global approach based on the convention, incorporating all signatories to the convention including non-Kyoto signatories&#151;among them the US and Australia.

 (Con): I hope that one day I will have the opportunity to answer the questions, but on this occasion I shall just ask a question. The Sustainable Development Commission&#039;s report, conveniently enough for the Government, is due out tomorrow, but we understand that of all the targets in the report, three are set at red, the rest at amber, and as regards green lights, the Government achieved zero. We know that since 1999 carbon has not reduced at all in the UK; indeed, it has gone up by 9 per cent. Whatever the Government are doing, it is not working. Is it not time that they got together with the Conservative Opposition and perhaps even the Liberal Democrats to find some kind of cross-party consensus to tackle the greatest threat facing the globe for generations ahead?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="51215-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is incorrect&#151;CO <sub>2</sub>  has gone up 3 per cent. since 1997. It went up 3 per cent. in 1996&#151;in one year alone&#151;and subsequently fell back. It would have gone up 5 per cent. if not for measures introduced in the 2000 climate change review. There is no room for complacency. We are committed to getting our domestic target of 20 per cent. on track. We will introduce the climate change review and, as our amendment made clear in the recent debate on climate change, we are more than willing to consider ideas from the Opposition. So far, none have been submitted.

 (Lab): I add my congratulations to the plaudits already given to the Secretary of State for the agreement reached in Montreal. I note that Paula Dobrianski, the US Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs who was present in Montreal, said that the United States would not welcome formal discussions geared towards a one-size-fits-all approach, which perhaps ties in with the Byrd-Hegel resolution of the US Senate. May I therefore suggest that contraction and convergence are the way forward? That is not a one-size-fits-all approach, and I hope that the Government will provide time for a Bill on that point, which has its Second Reading on 14 July.

 The principle of contraction and convergence undoubtedly has some attractive elements, and I am interested in the concept. Given the talks in Montreal, the principle does not appear to command a great deal of international support at the moment.

 (Con): You may share my sense of d&#233;j&#224; vu, Mr. Speaker: I am here again; you are there; the Minister is in his place; and the Secretary of State is not here&#151;so not much has changed. I am sorry that the Secretary of State is not here because I want to place on the record my congratulations on her personal contribution to the limited success of the Montreal discussions. However, it will need more than an agreement to talk to reduce the risk of a catastrophic slide into climate change. Will the Minister reconsider his answer to my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)? Just as it is vital to have international agreements to tackle climate change, is it not vital to have a cross-party approach to tackling those issues in order to set a framework in which to deliver climate change emission reductions?

 I welcome the hon. Gentleman back to the Front Bench, although given his chairmanship of the Environmental Audit Committee and the number of times that I have appeared before it, he does not appear to have been away. I welcome his recognition of the crucial role played by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State at Montreal, but he will find that non-governmental organisations and the international community think that the agreement was much more significant than his assessment. I welcome an approach based on consensus, and a consensus exists within this House on the principles, which is helpful in tackling the real environmental threat. On exploring that consensus, however, we need to know where the Opposition stand, and I repeat my invitation to them to spell out their position and ideas on climate change, because we cannot wait for 18 months while the matter is referred to a working group.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="51215-01_spnew22"><b> Mr. Ainsworth: </b> 
 We will spell out our considered recommendations in due course, and I look forward to working with the Minister on them. Does he accept that normal politics are not working when it comes to climate change, because the problems are too long term and too great? May I press him again on the concept of an independent body that transcends individual Parliaments, individual Governments and individual changes in party leadership, in order to monitor progress, set targets and achieve progress against those targets? The Government are trying to provide leadership internationally on that vital issue, but that should not be undermined by failure to make progress at home.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="51215-01_spnew23"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I do not disagree with those general points, but Conservative Members have not done enough homework on the procedures by which our progress is audited. Our targets and the inventory are calculated by an independent organisation, the National Environmental Technology Centre, by the United Nations framework convention on climate change and by the National Audit Office. Those are respectable bodies that provide independent assessment, but if the hon. Gentleman does not think that they are adequate, I would be willing to consider his points.

 I do not agree that it is a stealth tax. If the hon.

 I very much welcome my hon. Friend&#039;s interest in biofuels, and the fact that Teeside appears to be developing as one of the centres of biofuel production. I have looked at the Australian model. It is worth saying that the prime reason for setting up the Australian committee was that there were problems with consumer confidence in biofuels, particularly ethanol. That is not the case in the UK, where the mix of 5 per cent. is accepted by all car companies. However, it is important that we look at ways in which we can encourage the uptake and development of a biofuel industry in the UK, and I will give my hon. Friend&#039;s suggestion serious thought.

 An obligation of 5 per cent. on the oil companies is a considerable driver in relation to the demand for biofuels and the opportunities for supplying them from the domestic market.

They get a payment for the set-aside and a payment for the crop, and there is also the encouragement of a 20p per litre discount.

 Yes, I do. Those who know our dairy industry and our climate all recognise that the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland and my part of the world, is extremely well suited to dairy farming.

But the price that farmers are paid for a litre of milk has fallen by 7p over that same period. Somebody else is making 6p a litre more, and I think that we know who that is likely to be. May I urge my hon. Friend to use his good offices to introduce a more co-operative approach between the retailers and the dairy farmers, before irreparable damage is done to the dairy industry?

 An estimated 81 million tonnes of waste was sent to landfill in England in the last year for which we have figures. That is 45 per cent. of the waste stream, compared with 50 per cent. in 1998&#150;99.

 We are running out of landfill sites, and the Minister will be aware that some 90 per cent. of household electrical goods are dumped into landfill. The future is unclear because of the complete Horlicks that the Government are making over the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive. In the meantime, however, charitable organisations such as the GreenHouse project in Worthing, of which I am a patron, are doing great work to promote the reuse of electrical goods and household furniture, which is restored and sold on at a discount to families on benefits to help them to kit out their homes. These are fantastic projects. What is the Minister doing to promote that kind of innovative reuse?
</p>

 I am very interested in the project to which the hon. Gentleman refers. He is very welcome to write to me about it, because it is the kind of project that the Government are doing a great deal to support.

We could not possibly meet that target. Representatives of the industry are universally saying that they have not been consulted on this matter or called in to talk to the Minister&#039;s Department. Is it not time that the Department got moving?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o56"><a name="51215-03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 No, I do not accept that. My hon. Friend is talking about something that is not a legally binding directive; it is a discussion document. Our landfill targets are certainly challenging, and we will have to do a lot better than we are at the moment if we are to meet them. However, I would point out to my hon. Friend that we are not doing badly. As I said, we have trebled our recycling rates in the past eight years. We are also reviewing our waste strategy to see whether we need to set even more ambitious targets. However, we are improving from a very low base. We had the worst record in Europe on landfill under the previous Conservative Government.

 My hon.

What has China committed itself specifically to do to engage in the process of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, along with India? How will the Government persuade the United States to participate fully in that whole programme?

 It is true that China and India are not annexe 1 countries and are not therefore obliged to take targets. It is also true that what the United States does has an influence on all countries. I do not dispute that. China is engaging positively, however. In the EU-China summit, we agreed co-operation with China for a near-zero coal-burning power station as a demonstration project to develop that technology. China is moving ahead on a range of technologies, including renewables, as is India, and both those countries are keen to engage in the clean development mechanism, which also transfers technology and investment from developed countries to developing counties. All those framework issues were agreed at Montreal.

 The Minister will be aware that, according to the Environment Agency, half the 8 million tonnes of green bin material thrown away in the UK is sent overseas, often to third-world countries that have great difficulty in managing their own waste.

<p><a name="st_o95"><a name="51215-05_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 It is not the case that we cannot cope. As I said, there is a legitimate trade in recyclable materials and in the growing economies of China and India, in particular, there is huge demand for paper and plastic. We should welcome that, as it means that trees are not being cut down instead, but very strict rules apply to the export of such material. They are important, and the Environment Agency has an enforcement role: it has already taken out prosecutions and is investigating a number of other cases. It is important to reassure householders so that they continue to recycle. They are doing much better than they have ever done, but need to do a lot better yet, safe in the knowledge that the vast majority of what they put aside is genuinely recycled in a sustainable way.

<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51215-06_spnew0"><b> Mr. James Paice  (South-East Cambridgeshire)</b> 
 (Con) (Urgent Question): I am grateful to you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to ask an urgent question, of which I have given notice. Will the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs make a statement on the conclusions of the independent study group on the triplet studies of bovine tuberculosis and what action she proposes to take?
</p>





<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51215-06_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Mr. Ben Bradshaw): </b> 
 This morning the Government announced new measures to tackle bovine tuberculosis. At 9.30 am, a written statement was published. These measures include a 12-week public consultation on the control of badgers to reduce the disease in high incidence areas, the introduction of a requirement for the pre-movement testing of cattle to reduce cattle-to-cattle spread, and changes to the compensation arrangements that will bring payments for bovine TB into line with those for three other cattle diseases. Copies of all the relevant documents have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and are available on the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs website.
</p>





<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51215-06_spnew1"><b> Mr. Paice: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for his reply and earlier conversation with me.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">This year roughly eight times as many cattle will be slaughtered as in 1997 from reactions to TB tests. Herd incidence is rising at 20 per cent. a year. The whole farming world believes that the Government have spent the past eight years putting off what we all recognise is   a difficult decision. However, I welcome the introduction of pre-movement testing, for which we have been calling. I ask the Minister to reflect again on the answer that he gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin). I do not think that he fully appreciated the question that was being asked.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Can the Minister tell us whether there will be a regional basis for pre-movement testing or does it apply automatically across the whole country? Will he publish the proposed table for compensation under the new arrangements? Will there be an opportunity for farmers to appeal against whatever is allocated to them?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">I welcome the extension of gamma interferon tests, but why do the Government persist in their own little world of trials of testing systems? Is it not clear from other countries that gamma interferon and polymerase chain reaction can significantly improve test results and reduce the culling of unhealthy cattle, and can indicate whether badgers in a particular sett are carrying TB? It is worth emphasising that badgers suffer mercilessly from TB.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">Why have the Government not published specific proposals for badger culling? Is it not clear that the low level of trapping in the triplet studies, down to 30 per cent. in some areas, has caused massive disturbance, making badgers move into adjoining areas, thus spreading the disease rather than controlling it? Does the Minister agree, therefore, that only by efficient and humane culling of whole family groups can we be certain of removing infected animals?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2005 : Column 1442</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">We agree that strict cattle controls and better testing are necessary, but alone they will not work. I believe that the Minister will have general cross-party support for a badger culling programme. Such a decision is clearly distressing and unwelcome, but it is inevitable and the further delay for another consultation is unnecessary. We do not wish, however, to create a badger-free zone, so will the Government develop a plan so that badgers from clean areas can be reintroduced once the infection has disappeared? Then we can have what we all desire: healthy cattle and healthy wildlife.
</p>





<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51215-06_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments and questions. He is right to stress that this is a health and welfare issue for badgers as much as for cattle. It is not quite fair of him to say that the Government have been putting off a decision for six years. After all, the Government initiated the Krebs trials. No previous trials had been conducted by Governments to get to the bottom of the role played by badgers and, indeed, the extent of that role. I think that he would be the first to acknowledge that there is still a lot of uncertainty in the science.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Far from putting anything off, we brought this announcement forward to today; a lot of people did not expect the Government to say anything until 2007&#151;a year after the Krebs trials finish. The hon. Gentleman asked why have a delay and a consultation now, but he should accept that it would not be right to jump to conclusions less than 24 hours after we have received the results from the very long-running and important tests. I want hon. Members and other people to have the opportunity to take a careful and, I hope, calm and rational look at not just the results of the Krebs trials, but the experience gained in the Republic of Ireland and elsewhere in the world. The executive summary to the document that we published today states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;international experience indicates it is not possible to contain and eradicate bovine TB if its background presence in wildlife is left unaddressed.&quot;</p>

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight the dilemma that is posed by the results that were published last night by the independent scientific group on cattle TB, which showed a significant benefit in terms of the incidence of bovine TB in the area where badgers are culled, but a significant disbenefit in a circle around the periphery. It also showed, however, that the balance of benefit tended to improve with the intensity of culling and with the size of area. It is clear that a number of uncertainties still exist, which is why the Government think it important to have a proper, full and open consultation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">In answer to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question about pre-movement testing, it will not be regional as such, but for the first year at least, there will be a requirement for all cattle moving out of one and two-yearly testing herds. It will depend on the incidence of TB, rather than on an arbitrary regional boundary. Yes, we will publish the tabulation system for compensation, if it has not been published already in the documents before the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-06_para9">

<br>&nbsp;<br>and the charges. I did not quite understand it&#151;perhaps someone else may like to put it to me again during this session&#151;but the testing will be a private transaction between a farmer and a vet. Certainly, DEFRA has no intention of profiteering or charging more than would otherwise be charged. Indeed, our objective is to roll out testing by lay testers, which should significantly reduce the cost to farmers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">The hon. Gentleman asked about gamma interferon and PCR. It is important to stress that nothing that we are announcing today means that we can take the foot off the accelerator in terms of the work that is already going on to develop a vaccine both for badgers and for cattle, or to develop a PCR. He is not quite right to suggest that we have already got a reliable PCR test for bovine TB in badger setts. That work will continue, as will the rolling out of the gamma interferon test, which is an important adjunct to, not a replacement for, the skin test.
</p>





<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51215-06_spnew3"><b> Mr. Eric Martlew  (Carlisle) (Lab):</b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for announcing that there will be pre-movement testing. I am sure that he is aware that bovine TB was introduced into Cumbria, following the restocking from the west country after the foot and mouth outbreak, because there was no such testing. It is over 10 years since I asked what progress was being made on a vaccine for bovine TB. There seems to have been no progress. Is that because of a lack of resources or a lack of will?
</p>





<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51215-06_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 It is neither of those things. We announced field trials for vaccines for badgers back in the summer and there is more work to be done to progress the field trials to cattle, too. However much money one throws at such difficult scientific, medical and veterinary issues, I am afraid that one cannot hurry the science. Scientific research on the development of an effective vaccine cannot be speeded up&#151;it takes time. That challenge is faced by not only this country, but other countries that suffer similar TB problems.
</p>





<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51215-06_spnew5"><b> Mr. Colin Breed  (South-East Cornwall) (LD):</b> 
 I welcome the statement. I think that we can wait another 12 weeks given that we have waited several years for Government action to address what we all accept is a crisis in the countryside regarding bovine TB.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-06_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">The Minister is apparently ruling out any chance of DEFRA being involved in any control measures for badgers and is leaving it all to the farmers. I suspect that he will tell us that that is because of cost, but if the action was successful, compensation payments would reduce, which would cover some of the cost of any control measures implemented by DEFRA itself. How will he ensure that such control measures are effective if all farmers in a specific area do not propose to participate? Does he perceive that farmers who undertake such control measures might be threatened or intimidated? What is the current state of the Krebs trials? Are they just continuing, or will the results be available before the implementation of any measures that he might introduce after the consultation process?
</p>

<p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>period so that they would not have to meet the full force of those costs straight away? On the tabulated valuations, I am sure that there will be disputes about the value of specific cattle because of their pedigree and so on. Does the Minister intend to have at least an appeal system so that farmers are not just told, &quot;Sorry, that&#039;s what your valuation is.&quot;? We need a mechanism whereby farmers can challenge the valuation of compensation.

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51215-07_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 DEFRA is not ruling anything in or anything out, but if the hon. Gentleman reads the document that we have published today, he will note that we suggest three different scenarios for consultation. He is right that none of them gives the state a role in any culling process. It would be carried out by farmers not only for the reason of cost that he suggests, but because of practicality, as well as the capacity of the Government to deliver. Farmers and farming bodies have understood that during conversations that other Ministers and I have held with them. There is a general desire that farmers should have ownership of any policy that is pursued.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_13">On effectiveness and farmer compliance, the hon. Gentleman put his finger on one of the real question marks over how effective a culling policy could be if compliance was not high. The Krebs trials that reported last night showed that the more edges there are, the greater the edge effect. It is better, if possible, to have coherent areas in which culling is intensive and widespread. It is a problem if farmers and landowners in such areas do not want culling to take place on their land because there is no way in which the Government would compel them to cull.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_14">The discussions that we have had with farmers and the industry show that they do not envisage that threats to farmers would be a major problem. On the contrary, they rather think that the scheme would be more effective if it were run by farmers because local farmers could get together to organise any possible cull.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_15">The Krebs trials have not finished yet. Although the culling has finished&#151;the last culling took place about two weeks ago&#151;the independent science group is still evaluating the latest figures. As the group has indicated, we expect that the latest figures will show more benefit than the earlier ones because, as I said, the evidence suggests that the longer repeated culling goes on, the greater the reduction of bovine TB. The data will be provided as they come through during the consultation and, no doubt, afterwards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_16">On pre-movement testing and costs, I remind the House that the costs to the taxpayer at present are more than &#163;90 million a year. I hope that there is cross-party support for the idea that the taxpayer should not shoulder all the costs and that they should be shared if the Government are doing something that we think will help farmers. In respect of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question about valuations, there is no appeal.

 Pre-movement testing will begin in February. As my hon. Friend will know it has already begun in Scotland where post-movement testing also takes place. He is right that improved biosecurity is important, although it will not solve the problem completely. One thing that the rationalisation of compensation will help to do is to create more incentive for farmers to improve their biosecurity. If we go ahead with badger culling at the end of the consultation period, we shall ensure that where badger culling is licensed, it is in return for certain standards of biosecurity.

In the light of the consultation, which we understand will take three months, will the Minister guarantee that at the conclusion of that three-month period a decision to act will be taken?

</p>





<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51215-07_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I do not accept that today&#039;s important announcement should be greeted with disappointment. No previous Government of either political colour have ever consulted on a significant badger cull in this country. I hope that he accepts and appreciates that, and takes that message back to his farmers. As for the consultation, as I said, we have brought it and the decision forward. My firm view is that the time for decision is nigh. It will be made at the end of the consultation by the Government. Of course, we will listen to the independent TB advisory group, and to the opinions expressed during the consultation. In the end, however, it will be a decision for the Government.

 I am afraid that I must tell the Minister that my constituents will be very disappointed and that their hearts will be heavy at the thought of another three months spent waiting for yet another consultation. In the hot spot of Cheshire, which is on the front line in the spread of bovine TB, particularly around Audlem in my constituency and Market Drayton, which is the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), may I suggest that the Minister institute a pilot scheme for culling, as he would do in any other area of Government performance, to help to demonstrate the evidence that he has to weigh up in that 12-week period? Pilot schemes have obviously helped in other areas of Government policy making, and the time is ripe for one to be used in this instance.
</p>





<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51215-07_spnew10"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman reveals a lack of knowledge of bovine TB. The Irish trials took three years to achieve results, despite intensive culling using snares over wide areas. A pilot lasting a few weeks in his constituency, as he has suggested, would show absolutely nothing, and would be worse than useless. Let us have the consultation. Incidentally, he is not right that it is yet another consultation, because no such consultation has been held before. There was no consultation on a policy of badger culling under the Conservative Government, so I do not know what he is talking about.

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51215-07_spnew11"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton  (Macclesfield) (Con):</b> 
 The Minister stated that bovine TB was a serious problem not just for cattle and dairy farmers but for animal welfare and human health. Has he ever seen a badger with TB, and the distress and pain that it suffers before it dies? Can he give us an accurate figure for the amount of money that the problem will cost the taxpayer in compensation to farmers? It is clear to those of us who are concerned about both the dairy industry and animal welfare that culling is the only effective way to rid this country of TB, which is damaging to our dairy herds.

<br>&nbsp;<br>post-mortems of badgers with TB, which is clearly not very nice for them. It is difficult to tell whether or not a live badger has TB, although some people claim to be able to do so. I have seen badgers near my constituency in Devon wandering around during the day, which was not at all usual in my childhood but has become commonplace. As for the cost of TB, as I said earlier, last year, it cost the taxpayer more than &#163;90 million, a good proportion of which was compensation for slaughtered cattle.
</p>





<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51215-08_spnew1"><b> Robert Key  (Salisbury) (Con):</b> 
 When the Minister considers the question of costs and the lack of an appeal, will he bear in mind the fact that farmers&#151;usually, small farmers&#151;perhaps with closed herds, have lost all their spirit for farming as a result of what has happened to their herds in recent years? He should not forget that we are talking about some of the poorest farmers in the country, who will now be exposed to the full cost of veterinary charges. I beg him to think of the consequences for poor, small farmers.
</p>





<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51215-08_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I shall certainly do so, but the hon. Gentleman will recognise that Governments have a responsibility to the taxpayer. Three independent reports have been produced, all of which show that serious overpayment has been made in a significant number of cases. In addition, a higher payment was made for bovine TB than for other cattle diseases, which is why we are introducing the change to the compensation payments.
</p>





<p><a name="st_22"><a name="51215-08_spnew3"><b> Dr. William McCrea  (South Antrim) (DUP):</b> 
 While it is true that bovine TB is falling in Northern Ireland in contrast with the significant rise in other parts and regions of the United Kingdom, the need for a wildlife cull in hot-spot areas is essential. It is not welfare-friendly to protect TB-infected wildlife, so a cull would surely be good not only for farmers but for wildlife suffering from the disease.
</p>





<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51215-08_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 It is important to remember that this is a devolved issue, and I am sure that my colleagues responsible for agricultural issues in Northern Ireland will study the consultation documentation as closely as everyone else in the House.
</p>





<p><a name="st_24"><a name="51215-08_spnew5"><b> Mr. Owen Paterson  (North Shropshire) (Con):</b> 
 It really is incredible, having spent &#163;2,000 million not curing TB with current methods, that we should have yet another consultation. To secure agreement on a method of culling, the Government must seek a derogation from the 1979 Berne convention on the conservation of European wildlife and natural habitats. Article 9 allows for derogations, but appendix IV lists a number of prohibited culling methods. How long will it take to secure a derogation, and which methods of culling will the Minister seek?
</p>





<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51215-08_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is wrong. This is not yet another consultation&#151;it is the first ever consultation. He is also wrong about the need for a derogation from the Berne convention.

<p><a name="st_26"><a name="51215-08_spnew7"><b> Mr. Roger Williams  (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD):</b> 
 The Minister has already pointed out that if a badger cull is to be effective, it must be intensive and cover a sufficiently large area. May I draw a comparison with the contiguous cull policy on foot and mouth which, although distressing at the time, led to an early elimination of the disease? Will the Minister&#039;s attempts to eliminate TB be as strong as his attempts to eliminate foot and mouth?
</p>





<p><a name="st_27"><a name="51215-08_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I was not at the Department during the foot and mouth outbreak, but whatever we decide to do on bovine TB, it will require considerable resolve. The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight the fact that the scientific evidence appears to suggest that fiddling around with small-scale localised culling is at best ineffective and at worst probably makes things considerably worse. The stark choice that we may well face after the consultation is to do nothing or to do something quite serious.
</p>





<p><a name="st_28"><a name="51215-08_spnew9"><b> Bill Wiggin  (Leominster) (Con):</b> 
 I regret that there will not be an appeal system, so will the Minister ensure that valuations of cattle are published and updated on his website so that people know where they stand. I think that he said that the Government will not compel a farmer to cull, so may I have a reply to my letter to the Secretary of State about the appalling bullying of my constituents in Pensax? Finally, he asked for clarification of a question that I asked earlier. If the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is paying a certain price to vets for the test, will he ensure that vets cannot charge farmers more for the same work?
</p>





<p><a name="st_29"><a name="51215-08_spnew10"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 That will be a matter between farmers and their vets, as it is a private transaction, but we hope that in time there will be more lay testers, which will reduce the cost of testing for farmers. As for compelling farmers to participate, I do not recall the connection with the constituency case that he raised, but I shall check and write to him. In the event of a badger cull going ahead, it is not realistic to expect any Government to compel landowners or farmers to cull badgers on their land. However, in some of the worst affected areas, the level of compliance will be high, and we would do what we could to encourage compliance, and I believe that farmers and farm industry representatives would try to do that as well. There should be encouragement and exhortation, but I would stop short of compulsion. Valuations will be updated regularly, and both the valuation regime and the pre-movement testing arrangements will be constantly reviewed.
</p>





<p><a name="st_30"><a name="51215-08_spnew11"><b> Bob Spink  (Castle Point) (Con):</b> 
 I welcome the statement. Unlike many of my colleagues, I do not think that it is unreasonable to conduct a 12-week consultation after six years. Compliance, however, is a major issue, and it is linked to the financial help that the Government can give small farmers on pre-movement testing. Will he address that issue?
</p>





<p><a name="st_31"><a name="51215-08_spnew12"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 No, not at this stage. We would very much like a proper system of farm insurance in this country, as most countries have, whereby farmers pay into a fund which can cover such costs. In the UK we 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2005 : Column 1449</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>still have a system that is based almost entirely on the taxpayer. We are trying to move away from that, so what the hon. Gentleman is recommending would be a retrograde step. I hope our announcement today shows farmers that the Government are serious about tackling TB, and I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#039;s welcome for the 12-week consultation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_32"><a name="51215-08_spnew13"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering) (Con):</b> 
 To identify better the spread of bovine TB, should the Government be doing more to encourage the analysis of badgers that fall victim to road kill?
</p>





<p><a name="st_33"><a name="51215-08_spnew14"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I am not sure. The road-kill testing has not been incredibly helpful to us in identifying areas of high TB, or even the relationship between areas of high TB in badgers and areas of high TB in cattle. It is quite expensive and in all these matters decisions must be made about what is the most effective way of spending taxpayers&#039; money to tackle the disease. Given the announcement that I made today, I am not sure that spending a lot more money on testing road-kill badgers for TB is the most effective way forward.

Operations are being cancelled and people&#039;s names are being taking off waiting lists. As an example of the problem, the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Hospital Trust will be cutting 280 jobs, crucially including those of nurses and doctors. We learn today that two thirds of our hospitals do not reach the top standards of cleanliness. In education, we heard yesterday that four out of 10 children come out of primary school without being able to read or write properly. So does the right hon.

 Returning to council performance, will my right hon. Friend consider timetabling a debate on the accountability and responsibility of councils for leisure and recreational facilities? I have recently taken a petition of 15,000 names to No. 10 Downing street protesting against the decision by Tory-run Dudley council to close Brierley Hill swimming baths and leisure centre.

 The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight the important contribution made to general taxation by road users.

The solicitors agreed to forgo their payments, but in court it has been decided that &#163;1,800 will go to the solicitor and an average of &#163;1,400 will go to the miner, which is a scandal. The fast-track scheme was promised on the basis of not spending a great deal of money&#151;for example, medical tribunals are not required. I know that the Department of Trade and Industry will appeal against that judgment, which is an almighty scandal.

We recognise the difficulties that there have been and the costs that have built up. I am not going to comment on a particular legal decision, not least while it is subject to appeal, but I entirely accept that we need to get the balance right between the amount of compensation paid and the legal costs involved.

However, the figures are 20 per cent. higher than the average for the United Kingdom and 25 per cent. higher than the average for England, including the east midlands, which has a similar population and is also socially and economically similar to Scotland.

<a name="stpa_54">The House will know that we are in the middle of a substantial transformation, enabled by the sustained growth in the defence budget that has been a feature of each of the spending reviews that have been conducted since the Government came to power. We are procuring a series of major new platforms, including future aircraft carriers&#151;on which I made a written statement to the House yesterday&#151;type 45 destroyers, new medium-weight armoured fighting vehicles, the A400M, Typhoon and joint combat aircraft, among others. This transformation has at its heart the delivery of truly network-enabled capabilities, linking sensors, decision-makers and shooters in a much more integrated way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_55">We expect these platforms to have very long service lives. The future business for the defence industry in many sectors will therefore be in supporting and upgrading the platforms throughout what we believe will be their long service lives, rapidly and incrementally inserting technology to meet emerging threats, fulfilling new requirements and responding to innovative opportunities. That is what we expect of a large section of industrial effort, rather than immediately moving to the design and manufacture of the next generation.

<a name="51215-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_56">This will require rationalisation within the defence industry, particularly of over-capacity in production facilities. In some cases, sustaining the skills, technologies and industrial capabilities that we need will be challenging. Change is sometimes challenging and painful, but the one thing that would be much more painful than not changing in a changing world would be to refuse to change, and to find that redundancy and irrelevance had overtaken the product.

This degree of change and transformation&#151;and the respect for future planning capabilities and the maintenance of our strategic safeguards&#151;implies the   need for a comprehensive strategy for how we engage with the industrial base.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_57">The defence industrial strategy, building on the 2002 defence industrial policy, articulates a strategic view of our defence requirements going forward by sector, and the principles that will underpin procurement and industrial decisions in the future. It communicates for the first time to industry and the City those skills, technologies and industrial capabilities that are assessed as being required onshore in the UK in order to sustain the armed forces&#039; ability to operate with an appropriate level of sovereignty. It recognises that this will be possible only if we have a healthy, profitable and internationally competitive industry capable of responding to our requirements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_58">The defence industrial strategy also investigates how we might with industry address mismatches between planned activity and the work required to sustain desired capabilities. It will give industry and investors a much clearer idea of our priorities, allowing them to plan more assuredly for the future, which will be of benefit to the management, shareholders and workers in industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_59">I now turn to the impact of the analysis that we have conducted on specific sectors of the defence industry. In the maritime sector, the Government are investing in the biggest naval shipbuilding programme that the Royal Navy has seen for two generations. The highly capable expeditionary fleet that will result will offer significantly enhanced military capability, well suited to the demands of the 21st century.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_60">However, we need to recognise that the industry is currently fragmented&#151;different companies and facilities undertake submarine build, surface ship build and support, even though the skills required often cross over. We must also face the fact that current levels of work, although huge by comparison with the recent past, will not last for ever. Once we are over the hump of the major reinvestment in new ships in about 10 years&#039; time&#151;that is how far ahead we are looking at the shortest end of our horizon&#151;it will not be affordable to sustain excess industrial capacity in the longer term. That means making plans now so that we can keep the required key skills onshore in the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-12_para9">
<a name="stpa_61">For submarines, we are committed to maintaining onshore the ability to design, manufacture and support through life all aspects of that capability, which is so important to our national security. Cost growth in the area, however, is a real and persistent problem. We must control cost. To improve productivity, a new structure is required.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-12_para10">
<a name="stpa_62">As my announcement on the future carrier in a written statement to the House yesterday demonstrates, we need to sustain the ability to design and integrate complex surface ships and to support and maintain them through life.

That makes sense, not least in order to avoid the boom-and-bust cycle of sustaining or creating capacity for which there is no medium or long-term demand. That is also a much better arrangement for employees, providing the basis for more security and stability to develop and enhance their skills in long-term structured and secure employment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-12_para11">
<a name="stpa_63">In the air sector, the Royal Air Force is in the middle of a substantial re-equipment programme, introducing into service the Eurofighter Typhoon and looking forward to the arrival in the next decade of the joint strike fighter. Both those aircraft will last for at least 30 years. Our current plans do not, therefore, envisage the UK needing to design and build a future generation of manned fast jet aircraft beyond the current projects&#151;that is some 30 years away.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-12_para12">
<a name="stpa_64">That has unavoidable consequences, in forward planning, for the medium-term shape of the aerospace industry. We need to retain, however, the high-end aerospace engineering and design capability required to support, maintain, operate and upgrade Typhoon and the joint strike fighter through life, so that they are capable of tackling new challenges as they come along and incorporating new technology and improvements to meet those challenges. That is key to operating our aircraft in the manner that we would choose.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-12_para13">
<a name="stpa_65">The aerospace industry has a critical role to play, and there will be substantial business opportunities for BAE Systems and other companies such as Rolls Royce and SELEX. I am pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Rolls Royce to provide future through-life support to the RB199 engine on the RAF&#039;s Tornado aircraft.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-12_para14">
<a name="stpa_66">As the focus shifts from designing and building new manned aircraft towards supporting them through life, industry will have to make that challenging transformation. We are, however, committed&#151;this is enshrined in the defence industrial strategy&#151;to working with industry to manage that transformation with foresight to our mutual advantage. To that end, we intend to enter into negotiations with BAE Systems in the new year with a view to agreeing how best to work together&#151;and with the many other key suppliers in the sector&#151;to ensure that the key skills and capabilities that we need are sustained in a cost-effective manner. That work will be complex and arduous and will necessarily take time. It is essential, however, if we are to maintain stability in a period of transformation.

<a name="51215-12_para15">
<a name="stpa_67">This is an exciting, high technology industry with a healthy future. I am delighted to announce that we will invest in a significant technology demonstration programme for uninhabited combat aerial vehicles.

<a name="stpa_68">That is a serious investment in unmanned aerial vehicles, which is vital for the future, and it is also essential in assisting the sustainability of the required capabilities to support our new manned aircraft. Again, that involves a period of fairly dramatic transformation, and clarity and forward ability to manage that transition will maximise benefits to industry, the armed forces and, I hope, the taxpayer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_69">The armoured fighting vehicle fleet remains key to our land forces. Therefore, we must retain a capability to maintain and upgrade both our current and future equipment. We intend to work with BAE Systems Land Systems&#151;the supplier of 95 per cent. of our current inventory&#151;through a partnering agreement that will incentivise it as the systems engineer for the current fleet, contracting for capability provision, and bring advanced land systems technology into the UK. I am pleased to announce the signature today of an agreement articulating the principles under which such partnering will be taken forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_70">Looking to the future, we need industry to develop the complex system of systems that will make up the future rapid effect system&#151;FRES. The most likely solution will be a team in which national and international companies co-operate to deliver the FRES platforms, led by a systems integrator based in the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_71">A high concentration of knowledge relating to the existing fleet, but a healthy international competitive environment, also characterises the helicopter industry. As was announced last spring, we are working with AgustaWestland to promote a more open, predictable but demanding partnered relationship, providing better value for money while reducing the company&#039;s reliance on our investment to sustain the design engineering skill base. We are also undertaking a detailed capability and value for money assessment of the AgustaWestland future Lynx product, in relation to meeting both our battlefield reconnaissance and surface combatant maritime helicopter requirements. As we have long made clear, however, we will continue to look to the vibrant and competitive global marketplace to satisfy our future helicopter requirements.
</p>

<a name="stpa_72">The Government have made a major investment over the past 10 years&#151;through such projects as Storm Shadow and Brimstone&#151;in guided weapons. We attach considerable importance to sustaining capabilities for the design of new weapons, including upgrades, and support through life. However, the scale of our investment in that area, which has been massive in the recent past, is likely to reduce by 40 per cent. over the next five years. That is likely to lead to overcapacity and an inevitable requirement for rationalisation. That might require us to temper international competition in the short term. We will need to consider whether there are approaches that we might take, together with our allies, to maintain critical skills while continuing to show a welcoming face to those other companies that have established a UK presence in this field.

That reflects the growing importance of network-enabled capabilities, as well as the sad reality of the terrorist threat that we face. The UK has a number of very successful, highly innovative companies operating in these areas, whose profitability and dynamism are manifest. We intend to continue to look to the market to sustain our requirements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_75">Value for money remains the bedrock of our commercial policy. Competition will remain a major element of that, but it will not be used when other tools, such as partnering, would deliver a better outcome, or where it would impinge on our operational sovereignty. The defence industrial strategy does not signal a move in the direction of protectionism. The UK operates the most open defence market in the world, and is at the heart of efforts to encourage other nations, in Europe and further afield, to follow suit.

The rewards on offer are substantial. Sustaining the key technologies and capabilities required to maintain the operational edge of our armed forces and preserve national security is first and foremost in our thoughts. We also expect to enhance value for money for the taxpayer through improved acquisition performance, and to achieve better returns, health and sustainability for industry in return for such improved performance. For the nation as a whole, we mean to sustain a high-value, innovative and technology-driven industry that will provide quality skills and quality jobs for the future.

 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for his statement, and for making copies available to the Opposition in advance. As he will appreciate, however, it was a long statement and the document is extremely complex.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para11">
<a name="stpa_79">The document has been much trailed. It contains a number of points that we welcome, and many that we have called on the Government to adopt in recent years.

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para12">
<a name="stpa_80">If Ministers have genuinely embraced the idea, the House should welcome that. We also welcome the identification of key capabilities that Ministers consider it essential to retain in the interests of our national sovereignty, although we shall have to study some of the detail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para13">
<a name="stpa_81">The Treasury, however, holds the key to much of what is in the document. Has the Treasury agreed to fund the defence industrial strategy fully in the 2007 comprehensive spending review, and what discussions has the Secretary of State had with the Chancellor to that end? If the defence budget is squeezed in the spending round, the document becomes simply a wish list. Implementation is everything.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para14">
<a name="stpa_82">Has the Treasury made an assessment of the effect of spending on defence-related research and development and equipment on Britain&#039;s overall economic competitiveness, and will the Secretary of State make such information available to the House? Where onshore capability is maintained for reasons of strategic assurance, it is vital that value for money is guaranteed, especially when sole sourcing is involved. What measures will be established to ensure that, when the economic forces of competition are absent, taxpayers&#039; money is best protected?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para15">
<a name="stpa_83">I have a number of specific sectoral questions. The document states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;In a change to the stated Defence Industrial Policy, there is no absolute sovereign requirement to construct all our warship hulls on shore&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para16">
<a name="stpa_84">Does the Secretary of State expect to buy hulls from abroad? What assessment have the Government made of the impact on the shipbuilding industry and employment therein?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para17">
<a name="stpa_85">Individual helicopter programmes have been amalgamated in the overarching future rotorcraft capability process, and the overall budgets have been reduced by &#163;1.4 billion on the basis that the Financial Reporting Council will identify synergies and savings. I think we have all heard that from Departments in the past. The most pressing requirements identified by recent reports from the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee are caused by shortfalls in the helicopter lift capability that is essential to our activity in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. However, more than two thirds of the &#163;3 billion FRC budget is about to be spent on two programmes, the Merlin Mk1 upgrade and Future Lynx programmes, most of which are unrelated to those requirements. Furthermore, &#163;1.2 billion is scheduled to be spent on purchasing, without competition, 80 Future Lynx helicopters for the Army and Navy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para18">
<a name="stpa_86">An Army purchase is required to spread the non-recurring costs, but it is unlikely that such a route would have been followed if operational requirements had been the main driver. That approach seems to be at odds

<a name="stpa_87">The future aircraft carrier project was unveiled in the strategic defence review in 1998, with the first carrier due to enter service 14 years later in 2012. More than seven years down the line, we still have no firm order placed and no in-service date declared. Yesterday we had what is now described as a two-stage incremental approach to main gate. We will have another long wait before costs and timings are revealed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para20">
<a name="stpa_88">Will the Secretary of State confirm that both carriers will miss what the Government used to say were the target in-service dates of 2012 and 2015? Is it not true that the industry expects no first carrier before 2014, and no second carrier before 2106 at the earliest? Where does that leave the existing fleet of three small carriers, one of which has been paid off prematurely while the other two are due for disposal well before the likely in-service dates of their successors? Above all, where does it leave the capability of the Royal Navy, which has already sacrificed so many of its other warships for the sake of the promised future carriers?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para21">
<a name="stpa_89">The statement made a passing reference to maintaining onshore the ability to design and build submarines, but no mention was made of the all-important issue of replacing the Trident fleet. Making the decision about embracing Trident is the step that the Government embrace about as much as Dracula would embrace a crucifix. Building a new fleet of missile submarines will have a massive impact on our defence industrial plans, and the time scale cannot be less than 12 to 15 years. That is why the Government pledged in the last Parliament to make the decision in this one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para22">
<a name="stpa_90">Will the Government now face up to what is a vital issue? Why is the Secretary of State so afraid to do so? Of whom or of which is he more scared, the Chancellor, the Prime Minister in waiting, or the dissent of many of his Back Benchers? When will he begin in earnest the debate about the future of the nuclear deterrent on which people on both sides of the argument are willing, indeed eager, to begin?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para23">
<a name="stpa_91">Let me assure him in one respect. If the Government take the right decision, they will be able to count on the support of the Conservatives to ensure that the country remains protected indefinitely against nuclear blackmail. The generosity of the Opposition to the Government at this time is unbounded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-13_para24">
<a name="stpa_92">Overall, this may be a rather pessimistic strategy document. The argument seems to be that when the current tranche of orders is completed, surplus capacity will have to be dealt with. I wonder what assumptions are made in this assessment of the outlook for British defence exports and what measures the Government could put in place to ensure that some of the surplus capacity is used to expand our defence exports overseas, especially in the aerospace industry.

<a name="51215-13_para25">
<a name="stpa_93">At first glance, there are a number of positive elements in the strategy document, but there are also a number of anxieties that will be felt across the country. The Secretary of State may be able to address some of them, but the Chancellor remains the key to preventing it from

 There are obviously some elements of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s contribution that I greatly welcome.

<p>
<a name="51215-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_94">Secondly, I believe that we should try to achieve as much consensus as possible in respect of the document. I have always taken that view on defence as a whole. Issues of national security should, as far as possible, be resolved on a non-party basis. That is not easy and it does not mean the absence of criticism, but the consensual approach should be welcomed.

Gentleman looks at the foreword to the document, he will see that one of the three faces pictured at the top is that of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury&#151;and he is smiling. It can also be seen that the word &quot;no&quot; does not appear anywhere under his signature. As far as I can make out, that is a first.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_96">I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there has been a great deal of cross-Government participation. That is why, sitting alongside me on the Front Bench, is the Minister for Industry and the Regions, my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael) and&#151;a little further down, but close to us in spirit&#151;my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General, who is also smiling. Clearly, the Government have adopted a united approach on this matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_97">More seriously, the hon. Gentleman asked me whether the Chancellor has settled with me on the next three spending rounds. Of course he has not settled all that with me. We should remember that the rounds stretch through to 2015 and beyond, and it is obvious that no responsible Government would make commitments that far in advance. Over the past few years, there has been a real increase in defence spending which, as I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would in all fairness admit, was not always the case under the last Conservative Government. In fact, that period saw a 29 per cent. cut in real terms in defence spending. There is a great deal of unity on the part of the Government and I am glad that there is a great deal of consensus on the general direction of where we are going with our defence industrial strategy.

<a name="stpa_98">It is a detailed publication and it is divided into three parts. The first provides a strategic overview; the second an analysis of specific sectors; and the third deals with implementation and how we have achieved implementation thus far. On maritime, the hon. Gentleman was good enough to read out the section that said that there would be no blanket requirement for hulls to be built onshore, but he unfortunately missed out the next part of the sentence, which says that there is a need to maintain a sustainable work load for a viable restructured industry in this country.

<a name="stpa_99">Yesterday&#039;s announcement that 60 per cent. of the work on the two biggest crafts&#151;at 60,000 tonnes&#151;ever to be built by the Navy will be allocated to British shipyards demonstrates clearly that we are trying to maintain a sustainable level of employment and skills, particularly at the high-end sector of the technological development of shipbuilding and refurbishment. We are seeking long-term clarity and attempting to introduce ships at what might be called a regular drumbeat in order to assist the maintenance of skills. If we need a peak capacity at the lower end of production&#151;the sort of crafts that would not traditionally be regarded as warships&#151;we reserve the right to go offshore, but yesterday&#039;s announcement clearly shows that we intend to maintain a sustainable work load for a viable restructured industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_100">The hon. Gentleman asked several detailed questions about aircraft carriers and in-service dates, but he appears to have missed something important from yesterday&#039;s announcement. By innovatively involving the companies that are to produce the new carriers&#151;British Aerospace and the rest of the alliance&#151;in the maintenance, updating and refitting of the existing aircraft carriers, we have effectively ensured continuity of capability. That is why the First Sea Lord, the Chief of the Naval Staff, said that yesterday&#039;s announcement was the best Christmas present that the Navy could have been given.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_101">On Trident, I have little to add to what I have already said. It is a very important discussion, but we want to take time to reflect on it. With all due respect to the hon. Gentleman, we have clearly said, first, that we will retain the nuclear deterrent. We said that unambiguously six months ago in our manifesto. Secondly, the basis of retention is the assumption that, as long as potential enemies have nuclear weapons, we will retain them. Thirdly, we are not discussing whether to retain Trident, but whether in 15 to 20 years&#039; time we will need something to continue the nuclear deterrent. We have a little more time, therefore, to challenge ourselves and each other on the assumptions and practicalities of the issue. There is no need to take a peremptory decision on that in order to meet the time scale for the defence industrial strategy.

 The Secretary of State said that the UK operates the most open defence market in the world and mentioned efforts to encourage other nations in Europe and further afield to follow suit. No doubt he is often disappointed at their failure in that respect, so to what extent can he frame our policy to ensure reciprocation from others?

<a name="stpa_102">Will my right hon. Friend join me in paying tribute to the defence industry, companies, the work force and, indeed, the communities that have given such good service to our forces over so many years? May we have a debate on the effect of the strategy on many of those communities and its impact on our manufacturing base and the Government&#039;s wider industrial and regional policy? May we have such a debate early in the new year, so that Members from the affected constituencies can detail the effect on their constituents and attempt to ensure that we have a defence footprint throughout the country, not just in a few southern and eastern counties?

<br>&nbsp;<br>referred not just to Portsmouth and Vosper Thorneycroft, but to Barrow-in-Furness and to Govan, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson). There was a genuine geographical spread among the beneficiaries. Yes, I do pay tribute to the work force and its adaptability, flexibility and willingness to change right across the defence industry. What the document means, I can tell my right hon. Friend, is that we are offering a degree of transparency, information and forward thinking that should give those people a greater degree of stability and security in managing change in a fast-changing world. The trade unions&#151;including John Wall of Amicus and various others&#151;were involved, through the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions. I have written today to those MPs&#151;in all parts of the House&#151;with a particular interest in these sectors, saying that I or the noble Lord Drayson will meet them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_103">My right hon. Friend also asked what we, probably the most open defence procurers in Europe, are doing to encourage others to follow suit. We are doing three things, the first of which is to illustrate, through the success of our defence industries, that watching the minutes sometimes loses the hours, and that, through a degree of openness and competitiveness, we can develop a healthy industry. Secondly, during our presidency of the European Union we have encouraged our European colleagues to open up a little. Through the European Defence Agency, we have just signed a code of conduct that, although voluntary at this stage, moves matters in the right direction. Thirdly, we are maintaining dialogue with, and pressure on, our friends in the United States Administration&#151;the President, Secretary Rumsfeld and others&#151;with some degree of success. This is proving less successful on the Hill, and we must continue to work on that.

 I begin by associating myself and my colleagues with the tributes that the Secretary of State paid to our armed forces. This is indeed a very significant statement that will have far-reaching consequences for United Kingdom defence and its supporting industries. As has been acknowledged, we will all need time to study the 140 pages of detail, and I would also welcome the chance of a debate early in the new year on the strategy. But we certainly support the principle of ensuring that our armed forces have appropriate equipment at the right time and at the right cost; sadly, that has not always characterised defence procurement in recent decades.

<p>
<a name="51215-14_para10">
<a name="stpa_104">In giving industry clearer signals about what is essential to national security, how will the Secretary of State ensure proper ongoing public scrutiny of the new partnering arrangements and any other mechanisms, so that we can be confident that we are maintaining competitiveness and value for money at the point of acquisition and throughout the project&#039;s life? Given the   ongoing problems associated with technology transfer&#151;from the United States, for example&#151;to which he has alluded, how will he ensure that in the non-core sectors, we do not end up being over-dependent on other countries?

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his remarks and I hope that the opportunity for such a debate arises. A defence debate is coming up early in the new year and Members may want to make representations about the topic of that debate. I would welcome our building a cross-party consensus on this issue. In a way, I regard the defence industrial strategy as a parallel of the strategic defence review, which I had the honour to oversee in 1997&#150;98. It constituted a thorough review of the operational capabilities, configuration and direction of our armed forces, and I hope that this strategy proves similarly effective. There will be plenty of opportunities for scrutiny by, for example, the National Audit Office and Parliament, and the right hon. Member for North-East Hampshire (Mr. Arbuthnot)&#151;he is with us today&#151;who presides over the Defence Committee, will doubtless take an interest in this issue and in the project itself. The difficulty lies not in that but in getting the balance right between what we open up to competition, and what we maintain here as a strategic and sovereign requirement. I welcome all contributions to the debate on that issue, because I genuinely believe that it is not a party political one.

 The answer to the first question is yes: the contribution made by the work force to which my hon. Friend refers is substantial. The answer to the second question is also yes: Devonport has everything to gain from participating in the strategy, just as work force and company representatives have gained from participating in the strategy thus far. On the third question, I look forward to discussing the maritime strategy with her and others. I am glad that we were able to announce yesterday a further stage in the reaffirmation of the carrier, and the allocation of work to the south&#151;to Vosper Thornycroft&#151;as well as to Barrow-in-Furness and to places further north.

 Yes, I can. First, I welcome the interest that the right hon. Gentleman and the Defence Committee have shown in this issue. Secondly, I entirely agree with him that this is not a document for philosophical consideration; we hope that it is intellectually rigorous, but it is a blueprint for action. Thirdly, we have spent six months on this issue since I came in as Defence Secretary and it is not unusual to find that a document on a mammoth topic such as this needs further work in certain areas, and the right hon. Gentleman has highlighted one of them. There is a lot of grit in this oyster, but we welcome discussion and contributions in order to add more flesh to the bones.

<p><a name="st_98"><a name="51215-15_spnew7"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I am glad to confirm that this document does not affect in any way the future direction of the tanker project. We continue to have detailed and complex discussions with financial institutions about the private finance initiative side of the project; there is no real question of the operational requirement being changed. Far from backing off this project, at the last informal meeting of our European presidency&#151;it was held at RAF Lyneham and the central item for discussion was the tanker project&#151;I encouraged our European allies to follow the direction that we are taking.

 I am sure that the Secretary of State&#039;s judgment in putting his trust in respect of our chemical and biological defence into the hands of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down in my constituency is entirely correct. He gave an assurance about the testing and evaluation work carried out by QinetiQ at Boscombe Down, also in my constituency, but said that he wants the European Defence Agency to consider whether we should amalgamate and rationalise some of that work across Europe. However, what about the intellectual property rights that we share with our American allies?

<p><a name="st_100"><a name="51215-15_spnew9"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 Obviously, that is one of the issues that has to be dealt with. Whenever I make a statement on any aspect of defence, the hon. Gentleman always has a perfect right to comment, as his constituency seems to have an interest in almost everything defence related. He has identified a problem that we must resolve, but I shall make one general point about the EDA. We do not regard it as an autonomous body that can order and procure on its own. If I may use the expression, we think of it more as a dating agency&#151;a body that brings member states together to collaborate on projects that they consider worthwhile. It does not act over and above the member states, but rather brings them together.

 I very much welcome this document, and take particular note of the important fact that it has been produced to time. Of course, the devil is in some of the detail, and I seek clarification from the Secretary of State about balance. On the one hand, the document states that &quot;complex vessels&quot; will be built in the UK, but on the other, that &quot;lower-end&quot; manufacturing will be outsourced. Does that apply to a certain category of vessel, or are we talking only about peaks and troughs? When might it be possible to get clarification about how the strategy will be applied to the military afloat reach and sustainability program? Finally, if representatives of the work force feel that it is appropriate, will he be willing to meet them?
</p>





<p><a name="st_102"><a name="51215-15_spnew11"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 The answer to the last question is yes: I am always ready for such meetings. I met those representatives recently, as my hon. Friend knows. I am prepared to meet them again, and he can be present again, if he so wishes. He asked about balance, and I assure him that there is no categorisation according to classification. Building what we traditionally regard as major warships at the upper end of the market calls for high technology and high skills, and can be sustained only by a systemic and systematic order process. At the lower end of the market, peaks and troughs occur according to fleet requirements. We are thinking about combining the two approaches, but yesterday&#039;s allocation of work&#151;part of which went to my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency&#151;makes it clear that my intention is to have a shipbuilding industry that is stable and sustainable in the long term, and which maintains the highest level of skills.

 This is an ambitious programme of big capital projects, but will the Secretary of State take into account the fact that there seems to be a shortage of cash for detailed implementation? The danger is that these ambitious projects will suffer as a result. There are too many stories about cannibalisation of parts, shortages, and the cancellation of operations. Will the right hon. Gentleman undertake to keep an eye on the detail as well as on the headlines?

 Yes indeed. One reason why we must get best value for money is that these projects are immensely expensive.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson) said that the document was delivered on time, but it has also been delivered on budget&#151;and that is a claim that I have always wanted to make on behalf of the Ministry of Defence. Being on time and on budget is what we aspire to on our own account, as well as what we demand from industry. That is precisely because we need to get better value for money.

 I thank my hon. Friend for his remarks about the carrier programme, and he is right about our approach. Yesterday, we allocated responsibilities for 60 per cent. of hull build and ensured a degree of continuity in capability by dovetailing the present carrier fleet with incoming vessels. We are prepared to spend &#163;300 million, but we have made sure that all the negotiating levers will not be handed over to the carrier producers. It is very important to get right the demonstration and fine design stages, because it is there that the downstream cost is incurred.

 My constituents who work for British Aerospace will be most disappointed to hear the Secretary of State in effect announce in his statement the end of the manufacture of manned fast jets after the Typhoon project. Even more disappointing is the fact that he said nothing about a desire to build the joint strike fighter and merely spoke about maintenance and support. Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that an absolute condition of placing the order for the joint strike fighter with the US should be that this country will do all the manufacturing and servicing of future versions of that fighter? Will he extend the buy-British approach to any future plans for unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, and ensure that such machines are built in this country?

 First, although the hon. Gentleman clearly feels that my statement is terrible for BAE Systems, the problem is that the company does not feel the same way. I believe that it will welcome the Government&#039;s defence industrial strategy. Secondly, it would be little over the top for the hon. Gentleman to tell his constituents that a dramatic crisis is looming because one of our planning assumptions is that we may go to unmanned aerial vehicles after 2040. That projection is no more than a warning about something that may happen down the line. Thirdly, we are spending in the order of &#163;50 million on more than 200 Eurofighters, and we are also insisting that maintenance on the joint strike fighter and the updating of its technological capabilities is carried out in this country. All of that is good news. Most important for a company like BAE Systems is the fact that we are sharing with it our long-term vision of how much we shall spend within the limits of what is possible for a Government that must go through three reviews, where we will spend it and how it should invest its money and so on. That is good news for industry and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reflect on that.

Can he give more comfort to the House on how he may secure the final assembly and check out unit to be based at Warton to look after and construct the joint strike fighter?

We believed that the operational capability of those huge aircraft overcame any objections that we should buy a less capable European alternative. We bought the C-17s and we are looking at buying more. As far as I can make out the RAF, whose morale will be flying a little higher than it was a few years ago, regard the C-17 as a great success. I forgot to mention it earlier. The independence of strategic airlift at European level is important. Some years ago it was identified as completely insufficient in the strategic defence review, so we tried to remedy that. We will continue to have a view on it.

 It might be appropriate to say a word or two about the context of this afternoon&#039;s business, because this is one of those Bills that sadly seems to have received all-party support to date, and that usually means very bad legislation indeed. Time and again in the House, we are confronted with that revolting political concept consensus, which usually involves a lack of proper debate and scrutiny of the legislation. A few of us hope to put that right and give the Bill something of a proper examination in the limited time that is now available to us this afternoon. In doing so, I start with the group of amendments that you have just identified, Madam Deputy Speaker.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_109">It is fair to say that the thrust of the amendments covers two principal areas of consideration&#151;one is the general concept of consultation and the other is the contradistinction of expedience and reasonableness, which we shall perhaps come to later. In framing the amendments on consultation that my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) and I have tabled, I underwent a rollercoaster ride in deciding 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2005 : Column 1480</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>finally where to end up, because the amendments suggest that the Treasury be obliged to consult the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs. I was in two minds about that, because when I looked at the genesis of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs, I found a rather mixed picture, and it is fair to say&#151;I should warn the House&#151;that this is perhaps not quite so straightforward as it would seem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_110">I wanted to create a vehicle, a mechanism, whereby somebody other than the Treasury can look at the very important matters that we are dealing with in the Bill&#151;retrospection and all that goes with it&#151;and I lit upon the commissioners as the most appropriate body. In doing so, I went to the Act that set up the commissioners and, indeed, to the explanatory notes to that Act, and I want to share them briefly with the House, so that hon. Members can judge whether my amendment is appropriate. Obviously, I will argue that, on balance, my amendment represents the way forward, but I want to attach a health warning to it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_111">I refer first to paragraph 7 of the explanatory notes to the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005, which states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;The Act provides that, in the exercise of their functions, the Commissioners will comply with directions of a general nature given to them by the Treasury. It provides the legislative structure within which the Commissioners have the operational discretion to organise in the most appropriate way, and to make changes over time as necessary.&quot;</p>

 I am not convinced by the point that my right hon. Friend makes. Perhaps he could clarify. If the Government make the overarching decision on the direction of Her Majesty&#039;s Customs and Revenue, I do not understand how there can be any real discretion.
</p>





<p><a name="st_148"><a name="51215-18_spnew1"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a fair point. The judgment that we must make is between the overall statutory framework in which the commissioners operate on the one hand and their more detailed management and day-to-day responsibilities on the other. What I want to go on to suggest in support of the amendment is that we can be perhaps somewhat more optimistic that, in the detailed implementation of the Bill, we should expect the commissioners to be able to exercise that rather more detached position that I suggested just a moment ago in that they may do anything that they think

<a name="stpa_123">We are seeking in our amendments to oblige the Treasury to consult the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs and we are faced with a straightforward and simple proposition that occurs fairly frequently when we consider Bills of this kind: are we content with what the Government are trying to tell us in the Bill? Clause 1(1) states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;it appears to the Treasury to be appropriate to make regulations under a relevant power for the purpose of reflecting the whole or part of the provision made by the retrospective tax provision.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_124">We see the phrase, &quot;it appears to the Treasury&quot;, full stop. That is what the Government want us to accept. In other words, they are saying &quot;Trust us. We are the Treasury; we are the Government, so it will all be okay.&quot; That would be bad enough in any normal circumstances, but we are talking about retrospective tax provision and we are asked to be doubly trusting of the Government and the Treasury&#039;s ability to implement a retrospective provision. That, of course, is the theme of the Bill.

<p>
<a name="51215-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_125">I hope that, on Third Reading, we might have an opportunity to reconsider the principle of retrospection, with which I feel as uneasy now as I did when I first had the honour of coming to the House in 1983. Sadly, I recall being told by much wiser and more senior people than I was at the time&#151;although I am now very wise and very senior, as you know, Madam Deputy Speaker&#151;back in 1983 that retrospection was completely out of the question given the traditions of the House, the terms of our unwritten constitution and Magna Carta and all that.

<p><a name="st_152"><a name="51215-18_spnew4"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 The answer is probably shame and guilt. I slaved in the low foothills of government for some nine years, as the Minister might recall, and there were occasions on which I was less than happy with what the Government did. I am sure that she has been utterly content with everything that her Government have done during her honourable period in the Treasury, but, frankly, that is not always the case. It will not wash for her to suggest that I cannot criticise her Government now just because I voted for something as a loyal Minister in the lower levels of government because, as I said, I am now older and wiser. I am now guilt-free, and I hope that the Minister shares that condition.

<br>&nbsp;<br>powers with an assumption that retrospection is desirable and something for which the Treasury can reach almost at will. That is the whole point of amendment No. 1, because I wanted to find a safety net that would give us a degree of reassurance about what the Treasury might be able to do under the broad terms of the Bill&#039;s present wording. I lit upon the commissioners as being probably the best bet.

It is hard to think of any circumstances in which the Treasury would not think it expedient to legislate in favour of getting more revenue, however just or unjust that might be. That is the big problem with the wording at present; it encourages the Treasury to say, as we often hear from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that if something will generate revenue it is expedient and must be good, irrespective of how fair or unfair it might be.

In the case of Health Care Developers Inc. <i>v.</i> Newfoundland, in 1996, there is a reference to whether the terms of the Public Tender Act were wide.

 That is what gives us a little ray of hope. As my hon.

By including the commissioners in the process, as our amendment suggests, we are giving ourselves a little extra protection, through the word &quot;necessary&quot;, which certainly does not exist in the Bill.

<p><a name="st_181"><a name="51215-20_spnew4"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend is right. That is an important point for the Minister to address when she responds to our arguments. Although we probably will not be able to have more than one vote on this group of amendments, it is open to the Minister to say that she is prepared to accept any number of our amendments, or that she will propose a collective amendment in the other place. My understanding is that as the measure is not a money Bill it will be considered in another place.

<a name="stpa_152">I shall not go through all the other legal precedents and definitions for expedient. The definition can be extremely wide, and if the Treasury is to decide whether something is expedient, it is hard to think of wider terminology. We would be legislating to say that the Treasury could do whatever it wanted if it thought it was expedient, and no one else would have the chance to challenge that. It is almost trite to refer to draconian laws, but even Draco would have been unable to achieve anything as all-embracing as the provisions that we want to amend.

 Obviously, it would be better than not accepting the amendment at all but, in deference to my hon.

If my hon.

If we are to introduce strong regulations that can penalise people retrospectively and if the Government act unreasonably, it should be possible to challenge such action in the courts.

 Although the concept of reasonableness frequently occurs in legislation sponsored by other Government Departments, it may be strange and foreign to the Treasury which, uniquely in government, lives a completely unreasonable existence.

The issuing of guidelines, which is not part of my right hon. Friend&#039;s amendment but which Ministers could nevertheless do, could make his amendment worthwhile.

It is almost impossible to discuss reasonable taxation, which is almost an oxymoron.

We are dealing with a measure and amendments to it that are in no way addressed to the average person in the street. I made a calculation, which might have been wrong, on Second Reading and I am now working from memory.

As I said, we are not discussing a measure that affects the average employee in the street. It tackles artificial tax devices. They are artificial because they change people&#039;s conduct so that they behave in ways in which they would not normally engage. The individuals affected should sue their accountants if they did not warn them of the written ministerial statement that was made on 2 December 2004. That is as far back as retrospectivity would go if the Bill were passed as it is worded and the Government chose to exercise retrospectivity through the Treasury.

I share my right hon. Friend&#039;s view that tax legislation should be based as far as possible on consultation. It is important that good legislation should reflect discussions that the Treasury has had with tax advisers, professionals and representatives of industry, so that their views can be taken on board. The Treasury has a fair record of consultation with external bodies. Indeed, when retrospective taxation was discussed in the debates on what became the Finance Act 1978, one of the preconditions of retrospective taxation in trying to close tax loopholes was that there should be consultation with professional bodies and institutions. That is an admirable principle, and it is usually followed. However, it is not always followed. My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) highlighted, in his brief intervention on the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), the view of the Institute of Chartered Accountants that, based on the Paymaster General&#039;s statement of 2 December 2004, no one would have expected the Bill to have taken this form.

<a name="stpa_190">What of amendments Nos. 14, 15 and 17? I do not believe that the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst intends to destroy the Bill, but if he does, he should have said so when he moved his amendments, rather than dress up his aims in linguistic niceties about the meaning of &quot;reasonableness&quot; and &quot;expedient&quot;. The amendments strike at the heart of the caveat of a deterrent. If the statement of 2 December 2004 holds in its deterrent effect, no legislation will be necessary because people will not try, through remuneration&#151;this applies only to employment remuneration&#151;to avoid paying their proper taxes or insurance.

<a name="51215-23_para20">
<a name="stpa_191">The idea that in those three amendments&#151;Nos. 14, 15 and 17&#151;all that the right hon. Gentleman is doing is a bit of linguistic tidying-up is simply not the case. If he wants to know the use of &quot;expedient&quot;, he needs to see it in the wider context. He knows full well that it is not about looking into whatever dictionary one cares to take off the shelf because the context of the word is important as well. In the particular case of proposed new section 4C, the expediency applies to certain specified purposes, which is quite right. If he wants precedent for using the word &quot;expedient&quot; rather than &quot;reasonableness&quot;, he need look no further than to his own Government in 1992, although I can understand why he now wants to distance himself from decisions that he was happy to vote for at the time.

<a name="51215-23_para21">
<a name="stpa_192">This has been an interesting debate, but it would have been better if the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst had been more straightforward with the House about what he was attempting to do&#151;to remove the strong and important deterrent effect of the regulations. If the right hon. Gentleman still wants to put his amendments to the vote, I ask my hon. Friends to oppose them.

 It certainly has been a revealing debate and the Paymaster General&#039;s petulance gives the lie to some interesting aspects of the Government&#039;s attitude&#151;not least the fact that she has reduced the commissioners to a mere cipher of the Treasury. I do not know what the commissioners think about that or whether the Government would want to view their role in those terms. We now have it on the record that the Paymaster General is asking why we should bother consulting the commissioners because they are one and the same with the Treasury and there would be no point in doing so. We can leave that matter hanging for future study and

<a name="stpa_193">The Paymaster General&#039;s defence of the word &quot;expedient&quot; and her rejection of our attempt to introduce the word &quot;reasonable&quot; were equally revealing. She seems to be saying that any measures designed to counter tax avoidance must be expedient, or they would not work, and that any suggestion of reasonableness is unacceptable. Well, that is very revealing of the Government&#039;s attitude both generally and specifically. So from that point of view, this debate, through the vehicle of the amendments, has shone a searchlight not just on the Bill&#039;s wording but on the attitude of Ministers and Departments&#151;in this case, the Treasury.

<p><a name="st_238"><a name="51215-25_spnew1"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 In many ways, these amendments bring us to the core of the Bill. I shall leave my right hon. and hon. Friends perhaps to concentrate on other aspects of the measure, but the matters in clause 1(1) that attracted my attention relate to subsections (4) and (5) of proposed new section 4B of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, which I seek effectively to delete from the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_202">I shall look first at proposed new subsection (4), which says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;It does not matter whether the retrospective tax provision in question was passed or made before the day on which the National Insurance Contributions Act 2006 was passed.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_203">That is blatant beyond all belief. The Government now no longer even attempt to conceal what they are up to or to divert our attention from it. I suppose that I grudgingly give them almost a degree of credit for the fact that they are being perfectly blatant in what they are saying. We now have a Bill, for which the Government have aspirations of its becoming an Act on the statute book, that says, &quot;It does not matter. We can do pretty much what we want, whether or not it was passed now or at some other time&#151;who cares?&quot;
</p>





<p><a name="st_239"><a name="51215-25_spnew2"><b> Peter Bottomley  (Worthing, West) (Con):</b> 
 My right hon. Friend is being uncommonly generous. In fact, the Government are being just as arbitrary about what they pay out, let alone what they get in&#151;for example, the discrimination against any of our pensioners who live in Canada, rather than the United States, or in the rest of Europe, rather than the European Union. That happens all the time.
</p>





<p><a name="st_240"><a name="51215-25_spnew3"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 Of course I agree with my hon. Friend. The Government would probably say, &quot;Well, it does not matter really, does it?&quot; because those folk are far away and do not have a direct voice in what is going on here. We are talking about the Government saying that it does not matter how, when or whether they raise money, but I suspect that that would apply equally to their attitude to whether they disburse money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_204">Proposed new subsection (5) says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">&quot;But nothing in subsection (2) authorises regulations to be made which have effect in relation to any time before 2nd December 2004.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_205">My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr.   Chope) has tabled an amendment by which he seeks to alter that date. I would prefer to remove it altogether. The Paymaster General attempted to justify that date in summing up the previous debate. She said something along the lines of , &quot;If a Minister says on a certain date we may legislate in the future to do something that you may do in the future but we are not sure and we really don&#039;t care very much, that is all right.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_206">We are now into the era of blanket provision, forecasting or attempting to forecast what might be and giving the Government what amounts to a blank 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2005 : Column 1505</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>legislative cheque to do whatever they like. That may be all right in the minds of Ministers whose attitude, frankly, to government and Parliament over the past seven or eight years has been consistently contemptuous&#151;we have almost come to accept that&#151;but to have it spelled out in a Bill is going way too far. It is one thing to alter the procedures of the House, to reduce, curtail or deny debate or to cut down almost to nothing the time available to scrutinise legislation in Committee, but when phrases such as &quot;it does not matter&quot; or &quot;any time before&quot; this or that date are included in a Bill, we are getting into extremely dangerous territory.
</p>





<p><a name="st_241"><a name="51215-25_spnew4"><b> Mr. Greg Knight: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend is making a good point. If passed, will not the Bill rip up the rights that we have enjoyed in this country since Magna Carta? Under legislation passed by the House, the citizens of this country should know precisely where they stand. Are we not returning to the pre-Magna Carta age, when law used to be made at the whim of the king, but it is now being made at the whim of the Government?
</p>





<p><a name="st_242"><a name="51215-25_spnew5"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 Yes, I fear that my right hon. Friend is right. I am worried that we are finding that gradually over time&#151;Bill by Bill and Act by Act&#151;what we always thought was sacrosanct, even though we do not have a written constitution, is being eroded by such phrases. For most of my life, I have taken a lofty attitude to written constitutions. I thought that we did not need them and that they were for only people such as the Americans and the French. I have now come to the view that only a properly written constitution will protect us from Governments such as this. Such phrases in Bills have the effect&#151;whether openly or surreptitiously and gradually or suddenly&#151;of removing from our lives what we thought were precious certainties. If we do nothing else, surely we must remove phrases such as &quot;It does not matter&quot; from our legislation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_243"><a name="51215-25_spnew6"><b> David Howarth  (Cambridge) (LD):</b> 
 I am following what the right hon. Gentleman says with great interest and agree with most of it. However, I am puzzled about the effect of amendment No. 6. Surely leaving out those lines from the Bill would increase the Government&#039;s powers under proposed new section 4B(2) and thus make things worse?
</p>





<p><a name="st_244"><a name="51215-25_spnew7"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 I concede to the hon. Gentleman that that is a possibility. It is something that he and the House must take into account when they decide what to do about the amendment. I am trying to make the general point at the moment that such provisions appear to give the Government enormous and unlimited powers to do whatever they want, whenever they want, and, indeed, to do so retrospectively. That danger exists throughout the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_207">When we consider the other amendments in the group, we will find that they address a similar area of concern. Proposed new section 4C(3)(a) is a similar measure that says that regulations may make provision to modify

<p><a name="st_264"><a name="51215-26_spnew16"><b> Mr. Chope: </b> 
 Certainly. The idea of governing by ministerial fiat, by statement, is dangerous, and not only in the context of the measure that we are discussing. One might consider the consequences of this year&#039;s pre-Budget report, where the Treasury unsaid what it had previously said about the eligibility of the inclusion of ordinary houses in self-invested personal pensions. An earlier ministerial statement had announced that from April 2006 it would be possible for people to include property in their SIPPs and on that basis many companies set up businesses and incurred expense and risk. The Government will not compensate people who were adversely affected by anticipating Government legislation. I have no quarrel with people anticipating legislation. They took the Government&#039;s word as a true intention of what would happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_217">It turns out that that is not going to happen. As recently as 14 November this year, I received a letter from the Economic Secretary justifying and, indeed, commending the proposals that SIPPs should include assets such as houses. He pointed out that that would not have an adverse effect on the property market. In any event, he said, only 1 per cent. of pension funds would be affected. Anyone who assumed from that letter that they should invest in such pension funds or set up schemes to facilitate such investment would have been acting in advance of the Finance Bill and therefore at their own risk. Unfortunately, no compensation is available in such a situation, but the Government are suggesting that if they make an announcement through a written answer on national insurance contributions, it should be regarded as gospel. Their approach is therefore inconsistent. We appear to be moving into a new era of government by fiat&#151;whatever Ministers say goes&#151;while, at the same time, letters are written to introduce provisions for compensation for people who act on the basis of those Government statements only to find that they have acted to the detriment of their interests.

It is hard to see that raising &#163;96 million&#151;which equates to &#163;3 or &#163;4 per person in employment&#151;through retrospective legislation can be justified on the basis of proportionality. Is that modest gain justified by the enormous assault on our civil liberties and human rights represented by this provision?

We cannot have half a principle going back to 11 October this year, but not going back to 2 December 2004. Either one can envisage that retrospectivity, as I do, going back to a ministerial statement that is yet to be enacted but will be enacted if the Bill is passed, or one cannot.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61">&quot;First, the warning must be precise in form. A mere suggestion that there are vague schemes of tax avoidance that must be countered should not suffice&quot;.</p>

<a name="stpa_268">It is the generalised nature of the Paymaster General&#039;s statement of 2 December 2004, which leads people to ask whether the first Rees rule principle has been met. The Paymaster General was explicit in saying earlier that it had been met, but others feel that it has not. That poses the question of how people should have reacted to that statement. Is it perhaps more appropriate to start the period of retrospection from 11 October 2005, when the Bill was published, and to thereby present clearly to advisers, professionals and others interested in tax matters the nature of the Government&#039;s concerns? That is the issue that we have been debating through this group of amendments and it is important to the principle of retrospection. People are looking for clarity and certainty, which the Paymaster General&#039;s statement of December 2004 perhaps did not possess in the eyes of some. I would welcome her comments on that and on other aspects of retrospection.

 Conservative Members quote the Rees rules but I am not sure that they understand exactly how they are implemented. I remind them that HMRC issued a detailed technical note on the day of the pre-Budget report that made it clear that contrived and complex avoidance schemes were being closed down. Draft legislation was issued shortly afterward and comments on the technical detail were invited. The reference in the regulatory impact assessment to which the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) drew attention relates to the disclosure rules, not to the retrospective aspect.

<a name="51215-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_271">Given that we are dealing with inconsistencies, I should point out that one minute Conservative Members claim that nobody understood the meaning of the statement of 2 December 2004, yet the next they pray in aid accountants&#039; and accountancy firms&#039; explanations&#151;given in December 2004&#151;of their understanding of the statement&#039;s meaning. Let me give Conservative Members three helpful quotations from the people at PricewaterhouseCoopers, as provided by John Whiting. The first states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62">&quot;we recognise the problem that the Government is trying to tackle by taking this unusual power.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

 Will the Paymaster General give way?
</p>





<p><a name="st_302"><a name="51215-30_spnew2"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 No, I will not, if the hon. Gentleman does not mind. He has not been here for all of this very long debate, and in the few remaining moments I want to reply to the amendments of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth).
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_276">So the idea that people could not comprehend this measure or that they did not have sufficient details from the Government is a misunderstanding on the part of Conservative Members. The confusion, moreover, is perpetuated in the amendments, which seek to do lots of different things and contradict&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, I suppose that it is a case of betting both ends against the middle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_277">Amendment No. 5 would have the effect that regulations made under the provisions in the Bill could apply only to tax measures made after the Bill had been passed. Clearly, that would undermine the deterrent effect of the statement of 2 December 2004, and put at risk national insurance yield of &#163;95 million in 2004&#150;05. I disagree with the hon. Member for Christchurch, as I do not think that that is an insubstantial sum. It could also put at risk all the 2005&#150;06 yield of &#163;240 million, as the end-of-year bonus season could escape liability for national insurance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_278">Amendment No. 5 would also produce an anomalous result between tax and national insurance. The Opposition spoke about human rights challenges, but the amendment would mean that people using an avoidance scheme that gets caught by any of the tax provisions having effect from 2 December 2004 would have to pay back their income tax liabilities, but not their national insurance liabilities.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2005 : Column 1522</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_279">Amendments Nos. 6 and 20 would increase uncertainty. Ironically, or perhaps deliberately, they would contradict amendments Nos. 5 and 16. They would remove proposed new section 4B(5), which specifies that regulations cannot have effect before 2 December 2004. The amendment would therefore extend the scope of retrospection, and mean that there would be no limit on how far back Ministers or regulations could go. I am sure that Opposition Members would not want that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_280">Amendment No. 16, like amendment No. 5, would undermine the deterrent effect of the 2 December 2004 statement. As I described earlier, it would put at risk substantial amounts of revenue, as bonuses paid through the contrived schemes could escape the national insurance liability if the operative date for the regulations were 11 October 2005. That would produce another anomalous result: tax would be collected through a scheme whose purpose was considered to be avoidance, but the national insurance liability under the same scheme would not be collected. Frankly, that would be an unreasonable&#151;to put it politely&#151;use of legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_281">Amendment No. 19 would restrict the scope of regulations that may be made for modifying any provision of any enactment for the purposes specified in proposed new section 4C(2). That would mean that the regulations could not amend primary legislation, so that where such legislation deals with matters in 4C(2)&#151;such as contributions, contributory benefits and pension scheme matters&#151;it could not be amended, even where not to amend it would be to the detriment of employees. The current arrangement is to allow such amendments where that is fair to employees and ensures that they receive their entitlement as a result of a change of national insurance liability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_282">Amendment No. 9 is unnecessary, and frankly unwise. It would omit proposed new section 4C(5)(g), which enables regulations to be laid that will redetermine matters to the benefit of contributors. Without that provision, it is possible that increased entitlements that arise from retrospective legislation will be denied by virtue of a previous determination. That is, when people are deemed to be required to pay national insurance, that will affect their entitlement to contributory benefits. The amendment would prevent increased benefit entitlement being assigned to those individuals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_283">I shall deal briefly with amendment No. 18, which addresses the Bill&#039;s impact on the provision of statutory payments, such as maternity, paternity, adoption and sick pay. Retrospective regulations made under the powers in the Bill could have an effect on entitlement to those statutory payments. Eligibility for statutory payments is based in part on the employee&#039;s average weekly earnings assessed over a specified calculation period. As a result of an avoidance scheme an employee may therefore receive less than they may have been entitled to if they had paid the correct amount instead of the lower amount. The amendment would prevent the employee from receiving that additional payment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para13">
<a name="stpa_284">I think that the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) thought that the Bill prevented the restoration of those statutory payments, whereas it is the amendment that does the damage. The Bill provides for that to happen. Therefore I urge hon. Members to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2005 : Column 1523</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>reject amendments Nos. 5, 6, 16, 19, 20 and 9. They undermine the deterrent effect of the 2 December 2004 statement, increase uncertainty for employers, are detrimental to employees and will put at risk a substantial amount of national insurance money that is due to the national insurance fund. If the amendment is put to the vote, I urge my hon. Friends to vote against it.

<a name="stpa_289">I should declare an interest as a qualified solicitor and, until recently, a practising one. Although I am no longer practising, I remain on the roll of solicitors. Amendment No. 23 deals with the confidentiality rule and seeks to clarify its scope by making it clear that confidential advice does not need to be obtained from a UK qualified barrister or solicitor or, in Scotland, an advocate because it is important to make the provision wider than it is in the Bill.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2005 : Column 1524</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para19">
<a name="stpa_290">There are in essence two parallel issues. One is the duty of confidentiality that covers almost all professional practitioners and the other is professional privilege, which must be argued before a court of law. All solicitors who hold a practising certificate and operate in England and Wales are required to abide by the Law Society&#039;s guide to the professional conduct of solicitors 1999. Rule 16 of that guide deals with a solicitor&#039;s general duty of confidentiality to his client. Rule 16.01 states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66">&quot;A solicitor is under a duty to keep confidential to his or her firm the affairs of clients and to ensure that the staff do the same.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para20">
<a name="stpa_291">There is a distinction between the duty to keep a client&#039;s affairs confidential and the concept of law, which is referred to in the Bill, known as legal professional privilege. The duty in conduct extends to all matters communicated to a solicitor by the client or on behalf of the client, with some very narrow exceptions. Legal professional privilege, however, protects communications between a client and a solicitor from being disclosed even in a court of law. Certain communications are not protected by legal professional privilege, but non-privilege communications remain subject to the solicitor&#039;s duty to keep his client&#039;s affairs confidential.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para21">
<a name="stpa_292">The disclosure of a client&#039;s confidences that is unauthorised by the client or by law usually leads to disciplinary proceedings against the solicitor and could leave that solicitor or barrister&#151;it is usually a solicitor because there is no contractual basis between a client and a barrister&#151;liable, in certain circumstances, to civil court proceedings that arise from the misuse of confidential information. So the duty of confidentiality applies to information about a client&#039;s affairs irrespective of the source of the information, and it continues despite the end of the retainer or, indeed, the client&#039;s death, when that right passes to the deceased&#039;s personal representatives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para22">
<a name="stpa_293">Solicitors must be very careful. Even when a solicitor sends a postcard to acknowledge the receipt of a communication, care must be taken to ensure that no confidential information appears on it. The Law Society rightly regards the duty of confidentiality as fundamental to the relationship of the solicitor and the client. It exists both as an obligation in law, having regard to the nature of the contract, and as a matter of professional conduct. All the information discovered by a solicitor in the course of his retainer is confidential. Whether the information is also subject to privilege is a separate legal issue, about which I shall go into detail in a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para23">
<a name="stpa_294">The circumstances in which confidentiality can be overridden are rare indeed. A solicitor who volunteers confidential information must be prepared to show    powerful justification for breaching such confidentiality. Although it is clear that the solicitor owes that duty to the client, there are certain exceptional circumstances that override the duty. For example, a solicitor can reveal confidential information to the extent that he believes that it is necessary to prevent his client or a third party from committing a criminal act that the solicitor has reasonable grounds to believe is likely to result in serious bodily harm.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para24">
<a name="stpa_295">The Law Society&#039;s rule 16.02 sets out the circumstances in which the duty of confidentiality can be overridden. I shall not go into all of them, but the duty 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2005 : Column 1525</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>does not apply, for example, to information acquired by a solicitor, when the solicitor himself is being used by the client to facilitate the commission of a crime or fraud, because pursuing a crime or fraud is not within the scope of a professional retainer. If the solicitor becomes suspicious about a client&#039;s activities, he can normally assess the situation in the light of what the client has to say about it and the solicitor&#039;s own professional judgment and behave accordingly. Of course, in certain circumstances, the client himself may give express consent to the passing on of confidential information. In those circumstances, of course, the rule does not apply.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para25">
<a name="stpa_296">Occasionally, a solicitor is asked by the police or a third party such as the Inland Revenue&#151;so this is relevant to the Bill&#151;to give information or to show documents that the solicitor has obtained when acting for a client. Unless the client is prepared to waive confidentiality or the solicitor has evidence that a crime is taking place, the Law Society advises lawyers to insist on receiving a summons, usually a witness summons, or a subpoena, so that when those circumstances arise the lawyer can claim privilege before the court and ask the court to decide the issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para26">
<a name="stpa_297">The Inland Revenue asks solicitors to disclose documents and information on numerous occasions. In such circumstances, it is pretty clear that solicitors are protected. However, the Bill does not make it clear what will happen if a client employs someone who is a solicitor in France, Spain, or any of our EU partner countries, rather than a solicitor who is qualified under English law. The Law Society&#039;s international unit is clear about the matter because it has published guidance that states that overseas lawyers who operate in England and Wales, or who have offices and provide legal services in England and Wales, are expected to observe the same standards as UK-based solicitors. The rules of conduct cover such an eventuality, but I am not sure whether the Bill does. Could the Inland Revenue argue that, because a person under investigation had employed an overseas lawyer, that lawyer should not have the right to claim privilege on behalf of his client? I hope that the Minister agrees that privilege and the right to claim it should remain in such circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-30_para27">
<a name="stpa_298">Accountants are under a professional duty in a similar way to solicitors. They have been issued with guidance informing them that they should not disclose information to third parties.

She wanted to be a solicitor, but during her employment with me and while she was taking her studies, she was not legally qualified. However, she was an expert on certain areas of law. Information such as that which she obtained when advising a client on her area of expertise, even though she was not legally qualified at the time, should be protected under the Bill and the general provisions on client-lawyer confidentiality.

However&#151;this might answer the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)&#151;there is no specific provision in money laundering legislation or the Bill to provide the same protection to accountants.

The Bill is key to achieving the Treasury and Government&#039;s objectives of fairness and opportunity by ensuring that all pay the correct amount of tax and national insurance that the House has already decided. It is an essential element in building a serious and credible deterrent against future avoidance activity and it is needed to secure total tax and national insurance yields of &#163;200 million in 2004&#150;05 and &#163;500 million per annum thereafter.

Member for Eastleigh, and I am not sure what the Liberal Democrats now count as a substantial amount of revenue, but I think that &#163;200 million, rising to &#163;500 million, comes into that category.

<a name="stpa_312">Over many years, we have seen a minority of employers&#151;it is only a minority, but they happen to be very wealthy&#151;using highly sophisticated tax advice to sidestep the intention of anti-avoidance legislation passed by this House, ranging from 1998 up to the Finance Act 2005. Despite legislation effective from the date of announcement, they have managed to continue to avoid paying the amount of tax and national insurance that is properly due. They do so because new contrived schemes can be devised quickly and used when legislation closing existing schemes is announced. With that approach, the revenue remains very much at risk, even in the short term unfortunately, because employers still have scope to adopt another scheme and get away with avoidance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_313">The Government&#039;s intention is to shut down such activity permanently. To do so, we have to undermine fundamentally the incentives for employers repeatedly to seek out new contrived schemes contrary to the intention of Parliament. The Bill is intended to deter future avoidance by providing a power to backdate a national insurance liability to 2 December 2004 if necessary. With such backdating, there is little point in employers and their advisers looking for a new loophole 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="stpa_314">Any amendment that had the effect of removing our ability to make regulations imposing a backdated national insurance charge to a date before the announcement would remove the deterrent effect of the Bill and put all the revenue captured by those arrangements at risk. We have discussed that repeatedly, on Second Reading, in Committee and today, and I have repeatedly reassured Members that there are numerous examples of contrived schemes that the Government have had to deal with since 1997 and that the previous Government also had to tackle. They include contrived schemes involving employee benefit trusts, soft currency loans, such as those denominated in Turkish lira, adjustable options and special purpose vehicles. That will continue unless the Government take action.

The provisions would already have been discussed during a Finance Bill, before national insurance triggers action, and would be only to reflect anti-avoidance measures. Where such regulations are made, the House will already have had the chance to consider any relevant human rights issues on backdated tax legislation during the passage of the relevant Finance Bill or other legislation.

Both will be available at the same time, so that Members can see how they fit together.

<p><a name="st_315"><a name="51215-32_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hoban: </b> 
 At the outset, may I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) for his role in scrutinising the Bill in Committee? It was not an onerous Committee, but he and my hon. Friends made great progress in asking detailed questions of the Paymaster General. I am therefore grateful for his work on the Bill. As the Paymaster General said on Report, this is my first opportunity to speak on tax matters as a Front-Bench spokesman. I am a chartered accountant, albeit a non-practising one&#151;I except, of course, my annual struggle 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2005 : Column 1529</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>with my tax return&#151;and I look forward to engaging in constructive debate on tax with the Treasury. I believe that the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) is a chartered accountant, and he, too, will wish to make a contribution to our debates.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_319">For the benefit of Members who are new to the Bill, including my right hon. and hon. Friends who participated in our debates on Report, may I reflect why the Bill is needed? The Paymaster General referred to avoidance issues, but a separate Bill on national insurance is a needed because of the way in which national insurance and other taxes are administered. The Bill makes additional provisions to the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. Before 1999, national insurance contributions were managed by the Department of Social Security. Since then, they have been managed by the Treasury. Until national insurance was brought within the Treasury&#039;s remit, the national insurance and the income tax systems were often out of sync, and it took some time for national insurance to catch up with changes in income tax. Indeed, at one point, the Treasury and the DSS announced wildly differing approaches to the taxation of share options within weeks of each other. At least the Bill tries to manage those processes and bring them together.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_320">The Bill has two principal objectives&#151;first, to apply disclosure arrangements in the Finance Act 2004 for taxes other than national insurance to national insurance itself, and, secondly, to create the opportunity to levy retrospectively additional or new national insurance charges in cases in which the Government believe that schemes have been contrived to avoid national insurance. As the explanatory notes acknowledge, that is a first for national insurance:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70">&quot;Existing NICs legislation does not allow regulations to be made which can take effect that far back.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_321">That captures the flavour of our earlier debate on retrospection. I wish to highlight three issues that have been raised in debates on the Bill: retrospection; the breadth of the Bill and the problems that that has caused; and the delay between the introduction of primary and secondary legislation, and the comments that the Paymaster General made about the subject.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_322">On retrospection, we have debated the Paymaster General&#039;s statement in December 2004 and the issues that arise from it. There are concerns about retrospection, but I do not want to reopen the wounds that were exposed on Report. The Institute of Chartered Accountants, in a letter from the tax faculty to the Paymaster General in February this year, highlighted three issues, including, first, the test of certainty and the fact that taxpayers should be aware of how much tax they pay. They are entitled to expect that they will be taxed in accordance with the law in force at the time of the relevant transaction. Retrospection undermines those expectations of certainty. Secondly, the institute considered the legal basis of retrospection and the way in which it sits in the wider context of EU and human rights law. Looking at emerging EU case law, it said that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71">&quot;the state cannot retrospectively remove a right without a transitional period&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_323">The Bill does not, as far as I am aware, provide a transitional period for the removal of a right. The test of the Bill, therefore, may not be in the House but in the courts.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2005 : Column 1530</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_324">The third issue raised was the potential of retrospective legislation to undermine the credibility of the UK tax system in the eyes of UK taxpayers. The Institute of Chartered Accountants rightly observes that by and large the UK tax system has a high degree of credibility, the tax rules are obeyed, and taxpayer compliance and honesty are good. If we introduce increased uncertainty into the tax system by greater use of retrospection, the predictability and certainty that is such a feature of the UK tax regime will start to diminish, perhaps leading to concern on the part of international employers. If they come to the UK and site operations here, will they find the tax regime changing without prior warning? We need to bear in mind those three aspects when we consider retrospection and its impact on the overall tax environment in which we work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_325">A further concern about retrospection is its impact on the law-making process. If retrospection on a wide scale becomes institutionalised, will law making become lax? If the Revenue thinks that it can have a second bite at the cherry by using retrospection to correct mistakes that it has made in drafting legislation, will that create an environment in which the Revenue takes less care in drafting the original legislation? I am sure the Treasury and Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs will not see retrospection as a way of taking a more relaxed approach to drafting legislation. On the whole they are diligent in drafting legislation and we want that to continue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_326">We discussed today the breadth of powers in the Bill. I remarked earlier that tax advisers were surprised at the content of the Bill and the breadth of the measure. In its report on the 2004 pre-Budget report the Treasury Committee, commenting on the Paymaster General&#039;s statement on 2 December 2004, stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72">&quot;The indication in this statement that the Government will continue to announce proposed legislation, effective from the day of the announcement, to stop schemes which come to their attention is nothing new.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_327">Indeed, we touched upon the Rees rules, which relate to that. The Treasury Committee went on:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73">&quot;What is new is the declaration that future schemes, not yet devised or which have not yet come to the Inland Revenue&#039;s attention, may be stopped as from 2 December 2004. This amounts to a general anti-avoidance rule in this area of taxation of income and rewards, although no new powers are being taken by government.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_328">So, in the Committee&#039;s view, the very thing that the Government had backed away from&#151;introducing their disclosure rules in the Finance Act 2004&#151;because of criticism from the tax law review committee at the Institute for Fiscal Studies and comments from the Chartered Institute of Taxation, they seemed to have backed towards. We need to look again at how the legislation works.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_329">The Paymaster General spoke of the importance of making sure that the proper or right amount of tax is paid. In seeking to extract that, how do the Government distinguish between planning, mitigation and avoidance? There is a spectrum. If people are following the law, at what point do the Government intervene to tackle avoidance issues? We will need to consider that. The Paymaster General referred to the process for scrutinising secondary legislation, and that may give us the opportunity to do so in Committee when those 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2005 : Column 1531</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>statutory instruments are laid. Taxpayers have a right to expect that the tax law on the day on which they undertake a transaction will continue to apply to that transaction going forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_330">The third and final issue that I shall comment on is the delay between primary and secondary legislation. Primary legislation tackles the PAYE and income tax aspects of a contrived scheme. Under the Bill the consequent national insurance secondary legislation can come forward so that amendments made to income tax legislation to close down avoidance schemes can be used in national insurance legislation to close down similar loopholes.
</p>





<p><a name="st_316"><a name="51215-32_spnew1"><b> Rob Marris </b> 
: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that he favours a move to a portmanteau Finance Bill that covers national insurance, because national insurance is no longer the responsibility of the Department of Social Security, which is now the Department for Work and Pensions, or is he content to continue with dual-track Bills&#151;Finance Bills and national insurance Bills?
</p>





<p><a name="st_317"><a name="51215-32_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hoban: </b> 
 As ever, the hon. Gentleman has made a pertinent and thought-provoking point. Some have suggested that national insurance and pay-as-you-earn are coming closer and closer together and that a distinction should not be drawn between PAYE and national insurance as a way of funding contributory benefits. I am not sure whether PAYE and national insurance should come together. My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) has set up a commission under the chairmanship of Lord Forsyth to review the tax system. It will consider simpler taxes and may examine that area, on which I do not want to comment today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_331">The delay between primary and secondary legislation relates to my earlier point about the different origin of national insurance contributions, and national insurance has taken some time to catch up since its management by a separate Department. The Bill allows for a 12-month delay between primary legislation and statutory instruments coming into force.

<p><a name="st_319"><a name="51215-33_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hoban: </b> 
 The secondary legislation may be delayed for up to 12 months, although it does not have to be delayed for that period. I am grateful for the Paymaster General&#039;s clarification that it may be delayed for up to 12 months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_332">The Bill also allows statutory instruments to come into effect 12 months before they are laid. I know that that issue was raised in Standing Committee by my hon. Friends, so I am grateful for the Paymaster General&#039;s reassurance, first, that such statutory instruments will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure and, secondly, that she will work to ensure that all the regulations relating to the closure of schemes both for PAYE and national insurance will be published at the same time. I am sure that those who take an interest in such matters will welcome that assurance, because it will make scrutiny far easier.

<a name="stpa_333">Retrospection has concerned us during many debates on the Bill. There is a concern that it may become widespread and institutionalised, and its use raises several issues. We must ensure that such measures do not become institutionalised, so that the quality, credibility and predictability of our tax system is not undermined.

: There are important elements of consensus and agreement on the Bill, but there are also some elements of disagreement, and the Paymaster General has obviously found it difficult to get her head around the fact that we take that nuanced view.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_334">On consensus, I shall repeat the point that I made on Second Reading, which the Paymaster General has already quoted&#151;the Government should take reasonable steps to stop people creating complex tax avoidance schemes, in this case in relation to national insurance, which is obviously right because of general revenue concerns. We supported increased national insurance contributions to fund the health service, and we do not resile from that. The measure is also obviously right given the general principle of fairness&#151;most of us pay our dues, and it must be right for the Treasury and the Inland Revenue to act against those who do not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_335">The problem, which Liberal Democrat and Conservative Members have expressed, concerns the general principle of retrospective legislation. Again, that principle is not absolute, because, as the Minister has said, retrospective action has been taken in the past on tax matters&#151;it is part of history. As the European Court of Justice has stated&#151;I have quoted it today, and I quoted it on Second Reading&#151;there are certain cases in which it is proper to apply retrospective measures, so we are not dealing absolute moral principles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_336">However, we need to take account of the concerns that have been expressed. The Institute of Chartered Accountants is not in the business of promoting the interests of fat cats but of preserving the basic principles of tax law and maintaining its fundamental integrity. It has raised serious worries about this aspect of the Bill, and it is only proper that we should echo those. I would summarise the problem by saying that there are, of course, certain circumstances in which retrospective action is necessary in the tax world, but there need to be checks and balances. One of the useful amendments that was tabled was designed to achieve that, which is why we supported it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_337">I have looked back at the comments by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) to which the Minister took exception. I find it difficult to see why. He was merely reiterating what I had said on Second Reading&#151;that there are worries about the principle of retrospective action. He pressed the Minister on several occasions to give an estimate of the tax revenue that would be involved. Clearly, we need to talk about real numbers. If vast amounts of revenue are involved one takes a slightly different view of a major legal principle being challenged than one would take if it was to secure very small amounts of revenue. My hon. Friend repeatedly asked what amount was involved, and we ended up with a scale that ranged from &#163;250 million down to nought. No estimate was

</p>





<p><a name="st_321"><a name="51215-33_spnew3"><b> Rob Marris: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman says that the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) pressed for some figures but did not get any. There are figures in the regulatory impact assessment and in the explanatory notes. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend may not find those figures credible&#151;that is an intellectual possibility&#151;but his suggestion that we were given no figures surprises me.
</p>





<p><a name="st_322"><a name="51215-33_spnew4"><b> Dr. Cable: </b> 
 I have merely read through the transcript of the Committee&#151;I was not there at the time, unfortunately. There was a simple and in no sense politically loaded request for clarification of the revenue position in light of the fact that the proposals covered part of a tax year. It may well be that the answers that we were seeking were in the regulatory impact assessment and did not need any explanation or clarification from the Minister, but the exchange that I read was unsatisfactory, and that is what led to my hon. Friend speaking and voting as he did.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_338">My final point concerns a basic element of tax policy. We keep getting pieces of legislation that are designed to plug loopholes, and it is sometimes necessary to ask why so much avoidance takes place. Some of it must be due to the extreme and growing complexity of tax legislation. One of the most interesting contributions in the Committee was made by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who forcefully made the point that he was discussing a Bill designed to plug a tax loophole that was in large part generated by the vast ramifications of the complexity of tax law that the Government are creating. He makes an entirely valid point. We should stress that the more complex tax legislation becomes, the greater the incentives and opportunities for tax avoidance, and the more legislation is required to deal with it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_339">I reiterate my first and major point that the principle of preventing people from creating complex tax avoidance measures to avoid paying national insurance must surely be right.

<a name="stpa_352">The consultation document, &quot;Turning the Tables&quot;, which was published on 3 October, dealt only with school meals but strongly advised that the policy be rolled out for other types of food and drink available throughout the school day. I am worried that the report was rushed out to meet the conference deadline, and was not seen by a number of members of the panel before publication. I cannot believe that all members of the panel agreed that intense sweeteners, which are being promoted by the Food Standards Agency as a healthy choice, are all bad for children.

<a name="stpa_353">The only drink allowed for the purposes of hydration is plain water. While I applaud the promotion of water, I suspect that many children would prefer an alternative. If the only choice is between plain water, full fruit juice, milk or sugar-sweetened dairy drinks, the calories will pile on and children will still feel thirsty.

 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate and on his speech. As someone who has served as a school governor, may I point out that many schools receive valuable income from the drinks machines in their establishments? If the machines could contain healthy drinks, schools&#039; income would be maintained and children would be better off. That would be better than banning the machines altogether.
</p>





<p><a name="st_330"><a name="51215-34_spnew2"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that excellent point. I shall refer to that matter later.

<a name="51215-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_354">I am convinced that a small group of agencies is actively promoting the idea that intense sweeteners are unhealthy, even though there is no evidence to support that. In fact, the opposite would appear to be the case, as the Food Standards Agency is actively promoting them as a healthy option.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_355">The Health Education Trust was represented on the school meals review panel by its chief executive, who I suspect is the main opponent of the use of intense sweeteners. I understand from discussions with Waters and Robson that the HET offers its services to food and drinks producers as a consultant, giving advice on food and drinks that it feels able to endorse as suitable for schools, at a cost of &#163;500 a day, along with &#163;100 per brand endorsement. It also runs a healthy vending project, in which an operator must pay &#163;500 to display the HET endorsement logo, and 5p commission on every vend through the machine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_356">Interestingly, the HET endorses Volvic Touch of Fruits, which is produced by a French company and contains 11 teaspoons of sugar per litre. By any standards, that is a lot of sugar. Yet the HET told Abbey Well Foods that it would not endorse its product even if it were to reformulate it to a similar profile. When Abbey Well asked to meet the HET in order to try to understand its position, it was informed that it would have to pay the normal consultation fee prior to any such meeting. Will my hon. Friend the Minister examine the make-up of the HET to determine whether there are genuine conflicts of interest among members of the committee?

<a name="51215-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_357">In order to address some of the problems, the British Soft Drinks Association met the Department for Education and Skills on 23 November. I understand that little progress was made there. The DFES was unable to answer any questions relating to why intense sweeteners were excluded from the proposals, but suggested that it might be because they helped children to develop a sweet tooth. However, they were unable to supply any evidence to support that view, other than anecdotal evidence. The DFES was unable to respond, even when it was explained that the amount of sweeteners could be adjusted to meet any desired level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_358">The DFES confirmed that a new panel, the school food trust, had been set up to examine rolling out the recommendations to include all food and drink in

<b>15 Dec 2005 : Column 1537</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>schools, including snacks and the contents of vending machines. I understand that those members of the school meals review panel who were available would be invited to sit on that panel. There are no prizes, therefore, for guessing what their recommendations might be. They are due to report in January after a six-week period, and the main role of gathering the evidence has been allocated to a director of the Compass catering group. Compass has a potentially significant financial stake in the supply of food and drinks products to schools. Perhaps it is not therefore the best choice for the role.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_359">The current proposals appear to rule out all carbonates and still and juice drinks, regardless of calorie or juice content. Many drinks classified as &quot;healthy choice&quot; by the Food Standards Agency in relation to advertising to children would also be banned. Rising concerns about calorie intake and obesity have moved the soft drinks industry into developing products to meet the demand for drinks that have less or no sugar but that continue to provide tasty refreshment and hydration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_360">Consumers of all ages have responded with great enthusiasm to low-calorie drinks. Consumption of regular sweetened drinks fell from 96 litres per head in 1984 to 84 litres per head in 2004. Over the same period, low-calorie drink and bottled water consumption rose from 10 litres per head to 147 litres per head. In 2004, the share of the soft drink market held by regular sweetened drinks was 27 per cent., while low-calorie drinks had 49 per cent., bottled water had 15 per cent., and fruit juices had 9 per cent. There is a danger, therefore, that if a choice of healthy, tasty, low-calorie products is not allowed in schools, children will vote with their feet and seek potentially unhealthy products from outside school.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_361">In the main report, &quot;Turning the Tables: Transforming School Food&quot;, section 10 of the recommendations states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77">&quot;We believe our recommendations will lead to the consumption of healthier combinations of lunchtime foods by primary and secondary school children. This improved quality will clearly mean some increased costs but those costs should be set against the health and other benefits. Redressing the imbalance in children&#039;s diets will contribute towards a reduction of obesity and diseases such as tooth decay in young people. In the longer term the changes we recommend now should reduce the chances of young people suffering from various chronic diseases in later life. But more than that new standards can set the scene for holistic changes in the way young people perceive food and health, and can pave the way for wider changes in our food culture.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-34_para15">
<a name="stpa_362">I support that statement in its entirety. I am not advocating allowing high-fat, high-sugar or high-salt products. Unless we allow a wider range of healthy foods, snacks and drinks, however, more children will be tempted to buy and consume their food and drink outside school. The regulatory impact assessment released with the report recognises that children might react negatively to the proposed changes, resulting, in its own words, in the consumption of unhealthy foods outside school.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-34_para16">
<a name="stpa_363">I started my speech by applauding the efforts of the Department and I shall conclude in the same way. The initiative is excellent. It is flawed, however, in not allowing a wider range of healthy options to be available throughout the school day. There is nothing wrong with tuck shops and vending machines in schools, provided 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that the school sets the standards for the products available. As the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) mentioned, for many schools it is a useful form of extra income. Sixteen per cent. of two to 15-year-olds in the United Kingdom are obese, and the figure is much higher in some areas. To help fight that rising problem, low-calorie products from an approved list should be allowed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-34_para17">
<a name="stpa_364">Will my hon. Friend address the following questions? Will he allow a member of the Food Standards Agency to become a member of the advisory committee? How will he ensure that there is no conflict of interest for anyone sitting on the advisory committee? Will he make public the evidence used by the advisory committee for rejecting any ingredient? I realise, of course, that there are a number of genuine fears about the use of some artificial sweeteners, and it could be an ideal time, when we are considering food and drink in schools, to widen the debate on this issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51215-34_para18">
<a name="stpa_365">However, the drinks that are currently supplied to 60 local education authorities and manufactured in my constituency are those with which I am concerned today. Abbey Well drinks contain no artificial colours or flavours, are made with natural mineral water and are sweetened with sucralose, which has the same profile as sugar but with only five calories per serving. The average consumption of between 40 and 120 cases a week in each secondary school that the company supplies demonstrates that such products are both popular and beneficial, and I urge my hon. Friend to ensure that they continue to be consumed in schools.

As I said earlier, it remains subject to consultation that runs to 31 December. The report recommends far-reaching changes to the standard of food and drink in schools. It    recommends that tough minimum food-based standards should be implemented for school lunches by September 2006, stipulating the portions of food that should be served, and, importantly, restricting children&#039;s choices to ensure that they cannot opt out of healthier food.

To that end, the panel also recommends that standards similar to those for school lunches should also apply to tuck shops, vending machines and other outlets.

It has also developed a nutrient profiling model that identifies food types and allocates points, depending on the level of each nutrient per 100 g of food.

However, the model has been developed for use in relation to advertising controls only, as part of the Government&#039;s programme to regulate broadcast advertising to children of foods that are high in fat, saturated fat, salt and sugar. Food and drink that the model might categorise as &quot;healthy&quot; may not necessarily meet the more stringent standards recommended by the school meals review panel&#151;a point about which my hon.

The HET&#039;s director was a member of the school meals review panel and actively contributed to the proposed new standards on which we are consulting.
