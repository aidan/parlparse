<p><a name="qn_o0">1. <a name="50316-01_wqn0"><b> Mr. Bill Olner  (Nuneaton)</b> 
 (Lab): If he will make a statement on the work of English Partnerships. [221847]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="50316-01_spmin0"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister  (Mr. John Prescott): </b> 
 English Partnerships is the national regeneration agency. It is responsible for the national brownfield strategy and has played a key role in increasing the percentage of new homes built on brownfield land from 56&nbsp;per cent. in 1997&nbsp;to 67&nbsp;per cent. in 2003. English Partnerships is also responsible for the development of the growth areas, the millennium communities, coalfield regeneration and the housing pathfinder programme. During the current spending round, EP will invest &#163;2.2&nbsp;billion to create sustainable communities, including &#163;1&nbsp;billion from receipts. On top of that, EP aims to lever in a further &#163;2.5&nbsp;billion of private sector investment. Finally, it is also running our competition to build high-quality homes for &#163;60,000, so that more people on low incomes can get a foot on the housing ladder.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="50316-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Olner: </b> 
 I commend the fact that my right hon. Friend is continuing to fund English Partnerships well. EP is doing a wonderful job in Pride in Camp Hill, in my constituency, in seeking the regeneration of both housing and industry. I have issued him an invitation before, but I really would like him to come and see what that money is doing in real terms, and what English Partnerships is doing to regenerate the communities that need that investment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="50316-01_spmin1"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for his kind remarks about the important role of English Partnerships, and I note his invitation to visit his constituency. I suppose I shall be visiting many places in the next few weeks, and I shall take the opportunity to pass on his praise about the excellent work of English Partnerships in increasing the investment of public and private money in regeneration. The Opposition are proposing to cut &#163;1&nbsp;billion off that programme, which 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 238</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>would mean cutting back on social housing, housing for first-time buyers, and pathfinder programmes&#151;but what&#039;s new? That is what they always do.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="50316-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Andrew Mackay  (Bracknell)</b> 
 (Con): What would the Deputy Prime Minister say to my constituents who find that this unelected quango is foisting a huge number of extra homes on the RAF staff college site in Bracknell against the wishes of the local residents and their elected representatives?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="50316-01_spmin2"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 My first advice would be to tell them to vote Labour. Apart from that, I would point out that English Partnerships was set up by the previous Conservative Administration. It is an excellent body, and we have made it into more of an intervention tool than it was under the previous Administration. We are trying to build new housing in Bracknell, a move that the local authority very much supports. There is some difficulty about the infrastructure, but people there desperately want more housing. We have tried to buy more public land, which will give us the opportunity to provide more housing, which is desperately needed, particularly in the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s area.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="50316-01_spnew2"><b> Geraldine Smith  (Morecambe and Lunesdale)</b> 
 (Lab): Is my right hon. Friend aware that English Partnerships has been extremely helpful in my constituency, in assisting Lancaster city council with the west end masterplan in Morecambe, which deals with housing regeneration in seaside towns? Does he also agree that, when we are dealing with private sector housing and compulsory purchase, we must be very sensitive to the residents who are directly affected and ensure that the city council takes their views into consideration? I welcome the support from English Partnerships, however.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="50316-01_spmin3"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her kind remarks. She is absolutely right: English Partnerships has shown great sensitivity in consulting local authorities, communities and other stakeholders on the changes that have had to be brought about. The pathfinder programmes are an area of great sensitivity, but they are providing homes that people want, and it is important that they go through the proper consultation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="50316-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Edward Davey  (Kingston and Surbiton)</b> 
 (LD): Given the abysmal record in many parts of the public sector of managing publicly owned land, is it not time that Ministers asked English Partnerships to develop a more coherent strategy for using that valuable land? Since the senior management at English Partnerships has improved recently, why does not the Deputy Prime Minister ask EP and the local authorities together to compile and publish a full register of all publicly owned land, not least so that that land can be made available to tackle the crisis in affordable housing?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="50316-01_spmin4"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 That is precisely what we have been doing. English Partnerships has been recording all the available brownfield sites, and I want it to ensure that all the land that is known in the public sector should be available. In that regard, the Government have made a bid for land used by the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 239</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Department of Health and the Ministry of Defence. The land in Bracknell mentioned by the right hon. Member for Bracknell (Mr. Mackay) is also a classic example. We want to use public land to provide affordable homes. The idea that we have developed is that the Government can hold on to the land while charging only for the price of the construction on it. It is an idea that has caught on, despite the industry telling me that homes for &#163;60,000&nbsp;could not be built. It now admits that that can happen, and I notice that French Ministers adopted the idea last week.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="50316-01_spnew4"><b> Paddy Tipping  (Sherwood)</b> 
 (Lab): Will the Deputy Prime Minister visit the Gedling borough area again in the next couple of months, to look at the excellent work that English Partnerships is doing at the former Gedling colliery site? It has made &#163;2&nbsp;million available for regeneration there. On his visit, will he also press the Tory-controlled Gedling borough council to get its finger out and grant planning permission there?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="50316-01_spmin5"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 I will leave it to my hon. Friend to give such very direct advice, but English Partnerships is certainly playing a major role in the coalfield communities. Many of them have been transformed, and given hope where there was only despair after the massive closure of the pits and the communities by the previous Administration. It is a delight to visit those areas now to see that they are providing, in some cases, more jobs than were involved in the pits themselves. New ideas and innovations, very much led by English Partnerships, have brought the public and private sectors together. The Glasshoughton site is now a ski instruction area, which employs more people than were involved in the mine. The chief ski instructor is an ex-miner, which is good.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="50316-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Eric Pickles  (Brentwood and Ongar)</b> 
 (Con): English Partnerships has expressed concerns about the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s policy of demolishing perfectly good terraced housing. I was brought up in a Victorian terraced house and I remember with affection the enormous community spirit in the area, and I also remember the heart being torn out of those communities in the 1960s by transportation to soulless tower blocks. Why does he want to cram more people into the south of England and abandon the north of England to the bulldozer?

</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="50316-01_spmin6"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 It always amazes me when hon. Members make criticisms about knocking houses down. The hon. Gentleman should have seen the state of some of the houses that are being knocked down in these pathfinder areas: they have an outside toilet and are being sold for &#163;1,600. It is not possible to make the proper improvements to them. Many of them benefited from the previous Government&#039;s regeneration programmes, which tarted up the windows and painted the doors. They call that regeneration. We want a fundamental change, which in some cases means that if we want communities with green spaces some houses might have to be knocked down, but only the ones that really cannot be repaired to good value. This is about lifting up a community spirit and being involved in the area, but I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that he must not rely totally on the press for advice, as he does in his comments about Brentwood when he gets on 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 240</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>about the Gypsies. He is the one who cancelled the programme, with the rest of his Administration, for the provision of land for Gypsies.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="50316-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Dennis Skinner  (Bolsover)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend is aware that we got the money to deal with Shirebrook pit tip. We flattened it, and there is now a factory on there that will be employing 1,000&nbsp;people by the end of this year&#151;more than worked down the pit at the end, when the Tories closed it. That is because of our co-operation with the Labour authorities and English Partnerships. Is he aware that we have another project on the Markham pit site, where we are going to get the junction from the M1&nbsp;straight on to the site? There will be 5,000&nbsp;jobs&#151;English Partnerships again. We are turning the whole thing round. Eight great Budgets, and still the show goes on.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="50316-01_spmin7"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 I am very grateful for the kind remarks of my hon. Friend, who, living in the coalfield communities, knows exactly what has been done by English Partnerships. He came to see me early in 1997, asking what we could do for the coalfield communities, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Mansfield (Mr. Meale). I put together a &#163;450&nbsp;million programme. It is a great delight to go to coalfield communities now to see that they have hope, jobs and a future. How different that is from the previous Administration&#039;s destruction of the coalfield areas.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="50316-02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Keith Hill): </b> 
 The Government office for the north-east, on behalf of the Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, recently submitted comments in response to a public consultation by the North East assembly on the draft regional spatial strategy for the north-east. That response is a public document and can be made available to the right hon. Gentleman and hon. Members.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="50316-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Beith: </b> 
 Will the Minister include it in his advice to the unelected regional assembly that establishing a restriction of only 60&nbsp;or 70&nbsp;houses a year to be built in the Berwick and Alnwick areas would be a disaster for those who need social housing and first-time buyers in a part of the country where houses prices are still increasing quite rapidly? Does he recognise that preventing small builders and housing associations from building half a dozen houses in a village or 10&nbsp;in a small country town will make no difference either way to the policy objectives of the strategy so far as the major urban areas are concerned?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="50316-02_spnew1"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman has made his argument, which he is perfectly entitled to do, and I am sure that it will be listened to. We now await the submission of the regional spatial strategy, which will then be subject to further public consultation and an examination in public before it comes to the Deputy

</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="50316-02_spnew3"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I hear my right hon. Friend. At the same time, however, I am sure that he will agree that there is enormous investment through the housing market renewal project, which is already well under way in Newcastle, and through the decent homes programme in his area. We await further announcements in connection with housing market renewal in the Tees valley, which I am confident will be welcomed locally.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="50316-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bernard Jenkin  (North Essex)</b> 
 (Con): But the people of County Durham and the north-east might well ask the Government why on earth such a thing as a north-east assembly exists at all? Does he remember that there was a vote last autumn, and that 78&nbsp;per cent of people who voted, on a substantial turnout, voted no to a north-east regional assembly? Does not that demonstrate that there is a moment in the lifetime of every Government when Ministers demonstrate that they are completely out of touch with the real wishes and aspirations of the British people? They do not want regional government.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="50316-02_spnew5"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I always find the hon. Gentleman a slightly implausible voice on behalf of the people of the north-east.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="50316-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Jenkin: </b> 
 We won.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="50316-02_spnew7"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Of course we accept the judgment of the people of the north-east on the elected regional assembly. Nevertheless, I believe that a broad consensus remains in the north-east about the value of a north-east regional assembly, particularly in its housing and planning functions.

<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="50316-02_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Local and Regional Government  (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nick Raynsford): </b> 
 The Government&#039;s policy is to establish a resilient network of fire and rescue service control centres throughout England. Draft location criteria for those new regional centres were included in the consultation on the Government&#039;s response to the Mott MacDonald report, issued on 11&nbsp;December 2003, and subsequently amended in response to that consultation. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently in the process of procuring sites in eight regions.

<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 242</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="50316-02_spnew8"><b> Ann Winterton: </b> 
 Will the Minister recognise that technology can never replace local knowledge at both command and control centres and fire stations? Will he&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stop pitting county fire brigades against their neighbours, leave local command and fire centres alone and give an undertaking to the House that there will be no further regionalisation through replacing county fire brigades with regional ones, a move which will be as fiercely resisted as regional government?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="50316-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 I am afraid that the hon. Lady is confusing two separate issues. There are no plans to regionalise fire and rescue authorities, and I have made that clear on many occasions. What we are doing is procuring a resilient network of regional control centres, which will employ the best technology to ensure a quick and effective response to whatever risk applies in an area. That is recognised as delivering a better service, improving public safety, saving lives and saving money, which can then be used to improve community fire safety. The hon. Lady may shake her head, but that is the truth, and when she has examined the facts in more detail she will realise that local knowledge has played only a limited role in fire response since the 1980s when computerised gazetteers were introduced. We now need to ensure that we are using the best possible technology to deliver the best service and save more lives.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="50316-02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. Safety is paramount. The thrust of the Government&#039;s policy on reform of the fire service is about saving lives, and we will achieve that by more focus on prevention, more community fire safety work, and rapid responses to incidents wherever they occur&#151;ensuring the most effective possible response by the most appropriately placed appliance.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="50316-02_spnew12"><b> Mrs. Caroline Spelman  (Meriden)</b> 
 (Con): We have now heard of deep-seated concern on both sides of the House about the Government&#039;s plan to cut the number of fire control rooms from 49&nbsp;to just nine. Does the Minister accept that voters now have a clear choice between the Conservatives, who will abort the Government&#039;s plan to scrap our fire control rooms, and a Labour Government who will pursue their discredited and unwanted regionalism regardless?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o30"><a name="50316-02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 I do wish the hon. Lady would do her research more thoroughly. First, there are currently 47&nbsp;separate control centres, not 49. Secondly, the cost of responding to emergencies varies enormously, because many centres are very small and require a disproportionate number of staff in relation to calls.

<a name="50316-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">The hon. Lady would do well to consider the example of the Isle of Wight, where the average control room operator deals with one call every seven hours. That is not a cost-effective response. In London, where there is already a regional response, the average control operator deals with one call every 30&nbsp;minutes. It is to achieve that greater efficiency, to use resources more effectively, and to use the consequent savings to save lives that we are proceeding with what all who have examined the issues closely recognise to be a real improvement in the standard of safety delivered through control centres. I am sorry that she cannot recognise that as well.

<p><a name="st_o31"><a name="50316-02_spmin2"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Phil Hope): </b> 
 Following work with national representatives of several building control bodies, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is considering a revision of the building control performance standards handbook and the introduction of seven key performance indicators.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="50316-02_spnew14"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 The introduction of competition in building control has been an outrider for wider outsourcing of local council services. Does the Minister share my concern about mounting evidence that the profit motive is driving down standards? When will he introduce a rigorous regulatory regime for private firms that is at least comparable with the one that has applied to local authorities for years?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o33"><a name="50316-02_spnew15"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s concern, and I will examine any evidence that quality is suffering, but we want the building regulations to be applied effectively through proper compliance and checking by both local authority building control officers and approved inspectors. There are 12&nbsp;performance standards, providing a framework for the delivery of high-quality services by building control bodies in the public and private sectors.

Obtaining part P certification costs them around &#163;2,000, which is too much. I can tell him, as a member&#151;indeed, a fellow&#151;of the Institute of Electrical Engineers, that part P is not necessary and that houses would not burn down if it were repealed tomorrow.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o35"><a name="50316-02_spnew17"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman seems to be unaware that as a result of part P lives will be saved and there will be fewer injuries throughout the country. He may shake his head, but that is the reality. Part P ensures that when fixed electrical installation takes place in a house it is done safely. An unqualified person can still do the work, but must ensure that it is checked to be certain that it has been done safely, so that lives are not lost in the future.

 (Lab/Co-op): How much is being allocated to street crime wardens for the financial year 2005&#150;06. [221854]

<p><a name="st_o44"><a name="50316-03_spmin2"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Yvette Cooper): </b> 
 Some &#163;8.1&nbsp;million has been allocated to street crime warden schemes in 2005&#150;06.

<p><a name="st_o45"><a name="50316-03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hendrick: </b> 
 Crime is down by a third in Lancashire and we have 303&nbsp;more police than in 1997. May I thank my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister for making available to Preston city council an extra &#163;123,838, which, along with the existing &#163;55,000, will pay for the street crime wardens who have done&#151;and will doubtless continue to do&#151;an excellent job in Preston?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o46"><a name="50316-03_spnew7"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 I congratulate Preston on getting the extra money for the wardens. During the first wave, crime has come down in the warden areas by 28&nbsp;per cent. It is shocking to think of the many warden schemes that would be at risk if the Tories were allowed to cut &#163;1&nbsp;billion from our budget.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o48"><a name="50316-03_spnew9"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 I am certainly sorry if there are parish councils that do not want to join in the warden schemes&#151;funded by this Government&#151;that have been so successful in cutting crime. Such councils would also suffer from the huge cuts that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party would impose. Perhaps he should discuss that issue with his Front Benchers.

Long-term youth unemployment is virtually eradicated, and the reduction in unemployment over the past few years has saved us something like &#163;21&nbsp;billion.

 Why do not we use the police officers&#039; statistics in Nottinghamshire, compiled by the police? In the past 12&nbsp;months, all crime is down by 8&nbsp;per cent., domestic burglary is down by 17&nbsp;per cent. and robbery is down by 24&nbsp;per cent. As a result of the Government&#039;s extra investment, there are record numbers of police officers in Nottingham. They are now backed up by community support officers.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o59"><a name="50316-03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 Labour has given Nottinghamshire 200&nbsp;extra police officers in the past eight years, but a Conservative Government would give Nottinghamshire 740&nbsp;extra police officers in the next eight years. The Prime Minister gave the figures for Nottinghamshire for the past 12&nbsp;months; let me give him the figures since 1999. Since 1999, overall recorded crime in Nottinghamshire has gone up by almost a fifth and violent crime has gone up by more than a half. The chief constable says:

</p>

<p>

<p><a name="st_o68"><a name="50316-03_spmin10"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It does not have implications. The right hon.

We have always said that we should leave as soon as possible, once the Iraqi forces are capable of dealing with their own security.

<p><a name="st_o70"><a name="50316-03_spmin11"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The Cabinet had before it the Attorney-General, who was there precisely to answer questions and to say that the war was lawful. As I have said to the right hon. Gentleman on many occasions, we can debate whether the conflict was right or wrong but, frankly, it is absurd to keep on suggesting that some secret opinion of the Attorney-General said that the war was unlawful. The Attorney-General has made his position absolutely clear&#151;the war was lawful because of the breach of UN resolutions and the evidence that Saddam was in breach of the UN resolutions.

<a name="50316-03_para5">
<a name="stpa_o6">To go back to the point about withdrawal, I have to say that I profoundly disagree with the right hon. Gentleman. The most important thing at the moment is that we have democracy taking root in Iraq, and that is a fantastic development. It is having consequences right across the middle-east. If he talked to people in Iraq, they would say to him that, of course, they want the multinational force to leave as soon as is possible, but we have got to make sure that the Iraqis are capable of looking after their own security before that happens. That is why we are building up the Iraqi security forces.

 The situation is now under review. Obviously, it is important that we keep closely to what the institute advises.

Occasionally, it will make proposals that are highly controversial.

<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 250</b>

 Given that, how does the Prime Minister respond to the remarks today of the hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o76"><a name="50316-03_spmin14"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Let me answer that in two parts. First, I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) and the work that he has done to bring about a settlement in Northern Ireland. I obviously disagree with the remarks that he has made for a very simple reason. I think that the SDLP conference passed a resolution a short time ago saying that the party would not go into government exclusive of Sinn Fein. That, therefore, is the issue. That is why it is important to try to make progress that includes everybody, but that has to be on the very clear basis that there is a commitment to peaceful and democratic means by everyone.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-03_para7">
<a name="stpa_o8">This process has been very difficult over the past eight years, but I think that we have made an immense amount of progress. What is happening today with the IRA and with the way that the McCartney family are behaving, what they are saying, the fact that the British, Irish and American Governments are all on the same side, and the fact that every major political party is on the same side, are an indication of how much has changed. For the rest to change, it is necessary for those people inside the republican community finally to stand up and say, &quot;We will pursue our perfectly legitimate aspirations for a united Ireland peacefully, and we want nothing to do with criminal gangs, criminal activity or, indeed, paramilitarism.&quot;

 First, it is absolutely correct to say that we have worked very closely indeed with Sinn Fein over the past few years. I make no apologies for that&#151;it has been a necessary part of securing the progress that we have secured. Secondly, the reason why

<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 251</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>we have not got an inclusive Executive&#151;or, indeed, any Executive&#151;or devolved institutions in Northern Ireland is precisely because we have made it clear that the price of going into government is giving up criminal activity and paramilitarism completely.

It is not going to happen because of what he says, and it is not actually going to happen because of what I say, but it may just happen if people look at the progress made over the past few years and realise that the Unionist community is sincere in its wish to go forward on an inclusive basis, provided that violence is given up completely.

 I can assure my hon. Friend on both points. There is big investment going into extra numbers of police in my hon.

We will also make sure that, rather than freezing the Home Office budget, we continue the investment in our prison services.

<p><a name="qn_o10">Q3. [221834]<a name="50316-03_wqn6"><b> Simon Hughes  (Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</b> 
 (LD): Does the Prime Minister accept that whatever pre-election goodies the Chancellor may have in his Budget, they will be too late for people such as Ted Maxwell from Bermondsey, a disabled pensioner, whose local post office closed two weeks ago? Is not it right that as a direct result of the Government&#039;s policy, more than 2,000&nbsp;post offices have closed, and that if Labour is returned to office thousands of people will never have a local post office again?
</p>



<p><a name="st_o84"><a name="50316-03_spmin19"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I do not accept that. The reason for the closures, as the hon. Gentleman knows, is the reduced amount of business because increasing numbers of people have the money paid into their bank accounts. However, we do try to make provision for those who do not want that to happen. I am sorry about the particular circumstances of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituent; on the other hand, I am sure that he would realise, and so would other pensioners in the country, that there has been an enormous amount of money put into pensioner support over the past few years: the winter fuel allowance, the TV licences for the over-75s, the above-inflation increases in the basic state pension and the pension credit. Indeed, I may say to the hon. Gentleman 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

Does he realise that the remaining small number of people who are unemployed in constituencies such as mine need special measures, such as building on the new deal and programmes like that? Will my right hon. Friend give a commitment to ensure that such programmes are sustained so that the remaining very difficult cases can be dealt with and we can get people into employment?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o86"><a name="50316-03_spmin20"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I can assure my hon. Friend that we will indeed keep the new deal going. It is an important programme that has helped many young people, many of those who are long-term unemployed, lone parents and disabled people into work. It has done a fantastic job. It is never, ever, as the previous Government&#039;s programmes used to be called, a skivvy scheme&#151;we all remember both that and the high levels of unemployment in the 1980s. That is genuinely a thing of the past, but to keep it a thing of the past we need a strong economy backed up by measures like the new deal that have a proven track record of working.

Afterwards, they will make a repayment based on their ability to pay. If, for example, a woman raises children or someone is off work for any reason, they will not have to pay. That is in contrast to the proposals, which we emphatically reject, to charge a real rate of interest on all student loans, and which would have a devastating effect on students&#039; incomes.

They said that if they had had the knowledge that Ofsted had about the child minder, they would not have let her anywhere near their child. I spoke to Ofsted yesterday, and it is to conduct an internal inquiry. None the less, does the Prime Minister agree that the matter is so serious that an independent inquiry should be held and a report published so that the procedures to determine who can become a registered child minder can be tightened? The key point is that such a case must never be allowed to happen again. No child should ever be put into such a vulnerable position, and their families, parents and grandparents should not have to grieve for them.

<a name="stpa_o15">We have a system of child care regulation. As the hon.

New regulations that came into force last December clarified the circumstances in which Ofsted may share information with parents. I would like to study the case to see whether more needs to be done. As the hon. Gentleman said, Ofsted is conducting an internal inquiry, but I want to know whether the new regulations, had they been in force at the time, would have made a difference. We always have to keep a balance between ensuring that the system is not over-bureaucratic and ensuring that the proper checks are in place. I am very sorry that in the case the hon. Gentleman raises, those checks were not sufficient to prevent a tragedy.

 Before I call the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it may be for the convenience of hon. Members if I remind them that, at the end of the Chancellor&#039;s speech, copies of the Budget resolutions will be available to hon. Members in the Vote Office.
</p>




<a name="topichd_2">
<a name="50316-04_head3"><h3 align=center>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<a name="time_0">
<a name="50316-04_time0"><h5>12.30&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50316-04_spmin1"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 Britain is today experiencing the longest period of sustained economic growth since records began in 1701. And the foundation of this Budget is our determination to maintain British stability and growth.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Facing a future of intense global competition, Britain must be prepared and be equipped: long-term prosperity secured only if we make the right decisions to be world leaders in science, enterprise and education; family prosperity secured only if we also match a strong economy with investments to help parents balance work and family life, to give every child the best possible start in life, and to deliver a fair deal for pensioners.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">So my Budget choice is to lock in stability and never to put it at risk, and to strike the right balance between tax cuts that are affordable, investments that are essential and stability that is paramount&#151;at all times putting Britain&#039;s hard-working families first.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">I start with the economic forecasts. In any other period, a 100&nbsp;per cent. rise in oil prices and a 50&nbsp;per cent. rise in industrial materials and metals prices would have led to a surge of British inflation. But inflation, which went as high as 20&nbsp;per cent. in the 1980s, and was 10&nbsp;per cent. at the beginning of the 1990s, has every year in the past eight years been 3&nbsp;per cent. or less. It is the least volatile and most stable of all the major industrialised economies. And with Bank of England independence and continued wage discipline, I can report that inflation is today just 1.6&nbsp;per cent. We expect it to be just 1&#190; per cent this year, 2&nbsp;per cent. in 2006&nbsp;and beyond, and we will continue to meet our 2&nbsp;per cent. inflation target.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">I can also report that overall domestic demand is now forecast to continue to grow this year by 3&#188; to 3&#189; per cent., and by 2&#189; to 3&nbsp;per cent. in 2006. The key to a sustained improvement in manufacturing is the rising level of business investment, which grew by 5&#188; per cent. last year, and it is forecast to grow by 4&#188; to 4&#190; per cent. this year. And as trade and industry strengthen, we expect overall domestic investment to grow this year by 6&nbsp;to 6&#188; per cent., and we expect exports to rise at more than 6&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">Before each Budget time, we have heard predictions of a recession&#151;predictions which were wrong in 1997, in 1998&nbsp;and in 1999, and which were wrong again in the years from 2000&nbsp;to now. Most recently, the Budget forecast for 2004&nbsp;of growth at or above 3&nbsp;per cent. was said to be a deliberate misrepresentation of Britain&#039;s 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 258</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>economic position. Not to meet it, said the Leader of the Opposition, would destroy credibility. I can report that growth for 2004&nbsp;is, as forecast, 3.1&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Last year, one of our famous premier league football teams registered a record consecutive 49&nbsp;matches unbeaten, but failed to record a 50th. In December, I reported 49&nbsp;quarters of continued growth; today I can report economic growth for the 50th consecutive quarter. The Budget forecast is continued growth in quarters 51, 52, 53&nbsp;and 54. This year and next year, the euro area is forecast to grow at 1&#189; per cent. and then at just over 2&nbsp;per cent. Japan will grow even more slowly at less than 1&nbsp;per cent. Again, north America and Britain will see the fastest growth in the G7. Our forecast for British growth this year is 3&nbsp;to 3&#189; per cent. and for next year 2&#189; to 3&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">So it is Britain and north America that over the last eight years have grown at twice the rate of most of our G7&nbsp;competitors. And our living standards have been rising twice as fast. And unlike the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, there is no quarter in which the British economy has not registered growth.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">In each Budget I consider the uncertainties and risks to Britain from the world economy. Vulnerabilities come today not just from high oil prices, exchange rate volatility and current account imbalances, but also from long-term differential growth rates between our major continents. Always vigilant to these risks, the key to British stability and growth is that we sustain for the long term low inflation and low interest rates.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">In the 18&nbsp;years from 1979&nbsp;to 1997&nbsp;inflation averaged 6&nbsp;per cent. In the last eight years inflation has been 2.4&nbsp;per cent.&#151;half as much. In the 18&nbsp;years from 1979&nbsp;to 1997&nbsp;interest rates averaged 10.4&nbsp;per cent. In the last eight years interest rates have averaged 5.3&nbsp;per cent.&#151;half as much. And one fact tells the story of progress since the days of negative equity and mortgage repossessions: in the 18&nbsp;years to 1997, mortgage rates averaged 11&#189; per cent., in the last eight years just 6&nbsp;per cent.&#151;half as much.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">Inflation has been the lowest for 30&nbsp;years, interest rates the lowest for 35&nbsp;years and employment is at the highest ever. And with living standards since 1997&nbsp;rising on average by 3&nbsp;per cent. a year, Britain has today the best combination of low inflation, high employment and rising living standards in a generation. Since 1997, there are 150,000&nbsp;more self-employed, 300,000&nbsp;more small businesses, one and a half million more homeowners, a 50&nbsp;per cent. increase in personal wealth, a doubling in the numbers of those earning over &#163;30,000&nbsp;and over &#163;50,000, and a doubling in the numbers of those earning over &#163;100,000&nbsp;a year, while at the same time 2&nbsp;million children and almost 2&nbsp;million pensioners are no longer trapped in absolute poverty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">Not that long ago Britain seemed locked in a debate not just about inflation and stop/go, but also about intractable levels of unemployment. Indeed, in other countries high unemployment remains the dominant economic issue today. If Britain had today German or French levels of unemployment, we would have 2&nbsp;million fewer jobs, and if we had America&#039;s higher level of unemployment, there would be one third of a million fewer jobs in Britain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">The official figure published today show that since 1997&nbsp;we have now created 2,100,000&nbsp;jobs. This week, and every working week, another 125,000&nbsp;men and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 259</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>women are finding new jobs, an additional 50,000&nbsp;new vacancies are being advertised and almost 4,000&nbsp;new businesses are starting up in our country. And with a total of 650,000&nbsp;vacant jobs today needing people with skills to take them on, the answer is not to abolish the new deal, which has helped 1.2&nbsp;million people into work, but to extend it to become a new deal for jobs and skills.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">So my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is today announcing new rules to encourage incapacity benefit claimants into work and reforms in housing benefit to help job creation. Building on the 40&nbsp;per cent. increase in lone parent employment since 1997, we will next month extend to new areas a &#163;2,000&nbsp;return-to-work bonus for lone parents. We are today announcing for areas of high ethnic minority unemployment new centres for men and women to gain vocational qualifications and for entrepreneurship. And alongside a new union learning academy, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills and I are allocating &#163;65&nbsp;million for the coming year to employers for our successful employer training pilots, training thousands of men and women in our labour force. And the Home Secretary is today announcing targeted early intervention for young people at risk of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offending in their school years&#151;mentoring or tuition, to help prevent them becoming both long-term unemployed and persistent offenders later in life.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">The foundation of fiscal strength and soundness is our decision in 1997&nbsp;to radically reduce the national debt. In one year alone, Britain paid off more debt than all the debt cumulatively repaid in all of the previous 50&nbsp;years. And with the national debt reduced from 44&nbsp;per cent. of national income to 34&nbsp;per cent. today, Britain now has the lowest debt burden of all our major competitors. Lower debt and lower interest rates mean debt interest payments now consume a lower share of our national income than at any time since 1915. And our bill for debt interest payments is now &#163;4&nbsp;billion less than it was in 1997.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">These lowest debt interest payments for a century are matched by the lowest unemployment costs for a generation. So social security bills for unemployment have halved since 1997, and that is saving another &#163;5&nbsp;billions a year. As recently as 1994, 75&nbsp;per cent. of all new public spending went to debt interest and social security, effectively paying the bills of economic failure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">Today, 75&nbsp;per cent. of new money goes to investment in hospitals, schools and in the public services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">It is to build upon that fiscal discipline that I can report that following the Lyons report on public sector assets, &#163;14&nbsp;billions of asset disposals have already been identified, and &#163;4&nbsp;billions will be sold this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para17">
<a name="stpa_17">I can also report the first 7,800&nbsp;civil service jobs to be relocated out of London&#151;to Yorkshire, the south-west, the north-east and west, the midlands, east England, and Scotland and Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para18">
<a name="stpa_18">I can report&#151;ahead of target&#151;the first &#163;2&nbsp;billion of value-for-money Gershon savings, on top of &#163;2&nbsp;billion savings in procurement. I can also report&#151;on target&#151;the reduction of the first 12,500&nbsp;civil service posts. And having examined, in detail, representations put to me, I hold to Sir Peter&#039;s recommendation that to go beyond 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 260</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>his proposal of &#163;21&nbsp;billion in savings, which we will deliver, would, in Sir Peter&#039;s words, put the delivery of front-line services at risk.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para19">
<a name="stpa_19">I turn to the fiscal figures. After all my announcements today, borrowing, which in the early &#039;90s reached the equivalent of &#163;90&nbsp;billion a year, will be &#163;34&nbsp;billion this year, falling to &#163;32&nbsp;billion next year, then falling again to &#163;29&nbsp;billion, &#163;27&nbsp;billion, &#163;24&nbsp;billion and then &#163;22&nbsp;billion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para20">
<a name="stpa_20">The deficit for this year is now forecast to be 3.1&nbsp;per cent. of national income in France, 3.5&nbsp;per cent. in Germany, 4&nbsp;per cent. in America and 6.4&nbsp;per cent. in Japan. In Britain, the figure is 2.6&nbsp;per cent, and it will fall in successive years to 2.2, 2, 1.6&nbsp;and 1.5&nbsp;per cent. of national income.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para21">
<a name="stpa_21">And for those who take an interest in these matters, I can inform the House that in every year our figures meet the Maastricht criteria. In this Budget, the Treasury does not propose to initiate a further euro assessment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para22">
<a name="stpa_22">Our first fiscal rule is to balance the current Budget over the economic cycle. For the years to 2009&#150;10, the current balance is minus &#163;16&nbsp;billion, minus &#163;6&nbsp;billion, and then plus &#163;1&nbsp;billion, plus &#163;4&nbsp;billion, plus &#163;9&nbsp;billion and plus &#163;12&nbsp;billion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para23">
<a name="stpa_23">So we meet our first fiscal rule&#151;the golden rule&#151;in this economic cycle with a margin of &#163;6&nbsp;billions. And our second rule&#151;to keep debt below 40&nbsp;per cent. of national income&#151;is met with a margin of &#163;57&nbsp;billion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para24">
<a name="stpa_24">And while debt is now forecast to rise to nearly 50&nbsp;per cent. in America and France, nearly 60&nbsp;per cent. in Germany and 90&nbsp;per cent. in Japan, in Britain this year debt is forecast to be just 34.4&nbsp;per cent. of our national income. In future years, it will be 35.5, 36.2, 36.8, 37.1&nbsp;and 37.1&nbsp;per cent.&#151;at all times, debt below 40&nbsp;per cent of national income and meeting our fiscal rule.

<a name="stpa_25">So with our deficits lower than our competitors, much lower than a decade ago, with debt lower than our competitors as well and lower than a decade ago, we are meeting both our fiscal rules both in this economic cycle and the next. And it is because our public finances are strong that in this Parliament we have also been able to meet the extra and unanticipated costs of Iraq, Afghanistan and the fight against terrorism&#151;in total &#163;4.9&nbsp;billion&#151;and today I also am able to set aside additional defence expenditure for the year ahead of an extra &#163;400&nbsp;million.

Today Britain is strong among our main competitors when in the early 1990s we were weak and it is because we have entrenched stability for the long term that I can announce that, from May, we will now issue long-term bonds with maturities for the first time in a generation of up to 50&nbsp;years&#151;only possible because of our long-term stability&#151;locking in low borrowing costs and simultaneously benefiting taxpayers and investors.

<a name="50316-04_para27">
<a name="stpa_27">Mr Deputy Speaker, I turn now to our measures for enterprise. Faced with the accelerating pace of technological change, the rapid expansion of global competition, as I found in China, and developing countries now on course to produce half the world&#039;s manufactured exports, Britain&#039;s economic destiny cannot be founded on a low-skilled, low-tech economy. It depends on establishing British leadership in science, in skills and in the knowledge economy. For decades the neglect of investment damaged growth and prosperity. And like every advanced industrial nation today, Britain faces a stark economic choice: we could repeat the mistakes of the past, once again failing to invest long term in science, infrastructure or skills, or, just as together we have forged a British way to stability in the global economy, together we can forge a British way to success in the new economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para28">
<a name="stpa_28">After listening to business and industry, to management and work forces, I firmly believe that a shared national British purpose can be built across our country to meet the great economic challenges of our future: that we never again take risks with stability; that through greater flexibility we remove unnecessary barriers to profitable enterprise; and that we move ahead with public investments that are vital to business success in education and in our infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para29">
<a name="stpa_29">This Budget sets out a British way to long-term stability. I will set out the right choices for Britain for investment. But first I turn to how Britain can lead the way in removing barriers to enterprise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para30">
<a name="stpa_30">Britain now has one of the most open competition policies in the world. We are the most active advocate of free trade. Today the enterprise challenge is to enhance the flexibility needed for a successful economy and to tackle the regulatory concerns that all industrial economies face while securing the standards required for a successful society. Some say the only way to cut burdens facing business is to cut standards for consumers and for employees. Today the report published by Sir Philip Hampton rejects this course.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-04_para31">
<a name="stpa_31">When now China has, and Hong Kong plans, a minimum wage, it is right not to diminish or destroy minimum wage protections in Britain; it is right to uphold them. But it is also right to lessen the burden of regulation and to enhance our flexibility while still ensuring high standards.So instead of the old approach, which could mean that unnecessary inspections are carried out while necessary ones are not carried out, the best practice risk-based regulation now means more inspection only when there is more risk and a light and limited touch where there is less risk. Adopting in full&#151;and legislating for&#151;the Hampton review recommendations for this risk-based approach, for consumer and trading standards a single body will now take over the responsibilities of the four bodies we inherited in 1997. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is announcing that there will now be five inspection bodies for food safety, the countryside, agriculture, animal health and environmental protection, compared with 22&nbsp;separate bodies in 1997. Five existing agencies will be merged into the Health and Safety Executive. The Insolvency Service agency will take over the responsibilities of the DTI&#039;s companies investigation branch. In total, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we will reduce 35&nbsp;agencies to just nine&#151;a reduction of 26.

The Inland Revenue and Customs will also now consult on a single tax account for small business where information need be provided only once; there will be a single point of contact for both VAT and corporation tax, and flexible payment options. Seventy thousand firms no longer have to provide forms under our simplified VAT system to account for every VAT transaction. They make just one calculation and pay one&nbsp;flat rate.

<a name="stpa_86">Our aim is education from the age of three that is nationwide, of high quality and available to all. But we also want what every parent wants: that British primary and secondary schools should be the best equipped in the world for 21st century learning. Having established Building Schools for the Future to renovate and rebuild secondary schools, we will now establish a building programme for primary schools, too. In each of the next three years, for primary schools alone, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills will invest more, rising from &#163;1.6&nbsp;billion this coming year to &#163;1.8&nbsp;billion in 2007.

When he announced the raising of the thresholds for inheritance tax, why did he not admit that he is the one who has dragged millions of people into the net of death duties? When he talked about helping savers, why did he not admit that he is the one who hit savers with his &#163;5&nbsp;billion a year raid on pension funds?

Of course part of the reason for that, on which I know the Chancellor now agrees, is that when he first came to his high office, he implemented Liberal Democrat policy on giving operational independence to the Bank of England. The difference between the Chancellor and ourselves, of course, was that he did not say it and he did it, whereas we said it and would have done it had we been given the opportunity to do so.

The Chancellor talks of a &#163;200&nbsp;refund for all pensioner households, for one year; the Conservatives talk of &#163;500.

<br>&nbsp;<br>longevity the oldest pensioners tend to be the poorest. That is why we argue that the over-75s should be a priority, and that they should receive &#163;100&nbsp;more per month in basic state pension. That will inevitably benefit women in particular, as they live longer than men.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_144">That brings me to another important issue, which returns us to the theme of social justice. It is an absolute scandal that, in this day and age, women are still so discriminated against by the operation of the basic state pension. Why are they discriminated against? Because they take time out to start a family or bring up children, or perhaps take time out from their careers and working patterns to care for elderly relatives. In those circumstances, they do not maintain their national insurance contributions. When they reach pensionable age, they find that because their contributions are not complete they are not eligible for the same level of direct return from the state as men. That is iniquitous, which is why we argue&#151;again, in line with international experience&#151;that instead of basing women&#039;s entitlement to a pension on national insurance contributions, we should base it on residency. The system works well elsewhere, and there is no reason why it should not work well in Britain. Where there is a will, there is a way. We believe that such a system would end, at a stroke, the fundamental inequity in the present arrangements for women, and it is another proposal that we will put at the forefront of the coming debate at the general election.

<a name="stpa_145">There will be a third and, I think, very telling debate at the election on the back of this Budget. The Conservatives have their views, to which they are thoroughly entitled, and the Chancellor has his policies, which he has recommended to us today. We have a different take on things. If we want to tackle injustice and inequality&#151;if we want to define priorities, and make the tough choices that go with deciding those priorities&#151;we must be straight with people. We must say what our proposals will cost, and where the money will come from.

What they do want to know is what our priorities are. I have mentioned one of them: getting rid of the council tax and replacing it with a local income tax. I have mentioned another: alleviating the burden of student debt that currently afflicts far too many of our young people. A third is, of course, the introduction of free long-term personal care for the elderly. But all that bears a price tag. Where will the money come from?

They did not, but what did they do? They raised national insurance contributions, and for most individuals, families and households, that adds up to exactly the same thing. This Labour Government wonder why people get cynical about politicians, yet they give one impression before an election and do exactly the opposite afterwards. Well, we are not in that business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-06_para14">
<a name="stpa_150">In light of what the Chancellor has said today, and particularly given the imminence of the election, he should be prepared to open his books to the National Audit Office, so that it can examine the assumptions underpinning his forecasts. He made some allusion to that, but interestingly, no such thing is going to happen until the end of this calendar year. I wonder why. The Chancellor talks about the savings that can be achieved in central Government&#151;we agree that such savings should be achieved&#151;but how can we properly identify them if the NAO does not have such access, along with the right to publish the findings of its inquiry into the Government&#039;s behaviour as a whole?

<p>
<a name="50316-06_para15">
<a name="stpa_151">I turn to my second point about the overall context of the Chancellor&#039;s speech. There was a very revealing sin of omission, save for one passing reference, in that it is now perfectly clear that the environment does not loom large in this Government&#039;s overall economic thinking. We will argue at the coming election that the environment should be factored into each and every one of the Government&#039;s public policy decisions. That process has to begin with the Treasury itself, but it is clear that that is not happening.

That is a good story to tell, and I am looking forward with enthusiasm to telling it. As for the Chancellor and the leader of the Conservatives, they can carry on being two ships that pass in the night; the Liberal Democrats will address the agenda that matters most to people.

 It is a pleasure to be called in this fevered election atmosphere, but we must take a cool analytical look at what this Budget means. I certainly welcome the Chancellor&#039;s statement, because it shows an economy that is growing strongly. The Government are also meeting their fiscal rules for public finances; that is a very important issue for the Select Committee on the Treasury, which I chair.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_153">I am also delighted to see that there is a long-term investment programme to deliver 21st-century facilities in primary schools, to increase support for information and communications technology, and to provide help for young people. Mention has been made of China, to which I shall return. It is important that we upskill in order to compete with the markets and developing economies in China and elsewhere in Asia, which are increasingly high-tech. From the Treasury Committee&#039;s point of view, the reduction in the regulatory burden is also extremely important. When the Chancellor comes before the Committee next Tuesday, we will doubtless ask him how he intends to reduce that burden.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_154">I welcome the modest fiscal tightening in the Budget, particularly given the backdrop of potential global instability. I cite two major issues: first, the growing US current account deficit, which is now 6&nbsp;per cent. of the entire US economy and is reaching $700&nbsp;billion; and secondly, the oil price hikes of the past few months. Oil prices have recently exceeded $50&nbsp;a barrel, and we must bear it in mind that every jump of $10&nbsp;takes half a percentage point off the annual global growth rate for several years. So events in the wider international community impact on our own economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_155">In the past few years, the Treasury Committee has been concerned with issues such as the labour market. Our report states that the evidence that we received suggests

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;that migration into the UK has played a useful role in relieving skill shortages in the labour market and boosting non-inflationary growth.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_156">Indeed, although factory-gate prices are increasing, prices in the shops are not, and much of the reason why is the impact of such migration on our economy. In considering this issue, it is important to look at the experience of countries such as the United States, which has a generally young population, an immigrant community and economic growth. I hope that we look at this issue in a sensible, rather than emotive, way during the election campaign, because increased migration can provide an economic generator.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_157">As the Chancellor said, we need to increase the UK&#039;s skills base to meet this competitive challenge. The Treasury Committee has devoted time to considering this issue; indeed, as recently as two weeks ago we visited China, in the wake of the Chancellor&#039;s own visit. We have also been examining the operation of the golden rule and the fiscal cycle. As our report points out&#151;it is important for the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to hear this again&#151;

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;we believe the Treasury should clearly inform Parliament in a timely fashion of its preliminary analysis that the cycle has ended.

It would be helpful if, at this stage, and without jeopardising their position, the Inland Revenue were to publish a paper setting out their thinking on the principles which will guide future decisions as to whether a scheme is reckoned to be within or outside the terms of the announcement.&quot;</p>

We published a report on this issue as recently as yesterday, and we found that losses from excise duty fraud total some &#163;4&nbsp;billion. The revenue loss from tobacco smuggling alone is estimated at &#163;1,900&nbsp;million a year. The Treasury and the Government still have a long way to go to in clamping down on such fraud.

<a name="50316-07_para11">
<a name="stpa_164">I mentioned that the Select Committee visited China, and while there we took the opportunity to talk to its Customs authorities. They told us that in the past year or so, they had closed down 2,000&nbsp;illicit cigarette manufacturing factories. There is a huge trade in that area, but we were a little dismayed to find that the Customs officers were based not in China but in Hong Kong. Given the burgeoning market in China, it is important that we have a Customs and Inland Revenue presence in China. I ask my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to consider that point.

<a name="50316-07_para12">
<a name="stpa_165">In fact, duty is paid on only three out of every 10&nbsp;packets of hand-rolling tobacco consumed in the United Kingdom. That is a matter of very serious concern. The illicit market share for hand-rolling tobacco has been above 30&nbsp;per cent. for each year since estimates have been available&#151;and the figure is rising, thus indicating, in the view of the Treasury Committee, that the level of tobacco smuggling is, to put it mildly, extraordinarily high.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-07_para13">
<a name="stpa_166">We also considered alcohol fraud. The latest estimate of fraud involving spirits&#151;&#163;250&nbsp;million a year&#151;is obviously of a different magnitude from what we see in tobacco smuggling. However, as we noted in our report, given the compliance costs of introducing tax stamps&#151;&#163;7&nbsp;million a year in start-up costs and &#163;5&nbsp;million a year thereafter&#151;such proposals should not be considered as a disproportionate response to the problem.

<a name="stpa_167">One of the various groups that the Chancellor considered in his Budget speech was pensioners.

I am a Member of Parliament with a constituency that includes a high percentage of pensioners who have benefited from the proposals that the Government have introduced since 1997, and hon.

 Just over 3&nbsp;million people are entitled to pension credit and well over 2.5&nbsp;people get it at the moment. Yes, some people have still to get the credit, which is why it is important for all hon. Members, not just Government Members, to run road shows in their constituencies, along with the pension credit personnel, to ensure that people apply for those credits and get their entitlement. If the hon. Gentleman is asking whether we have a way to go, the answer is yes, so it is important that we all work together in our constituencies to get that message across to pensioners and community groups.

<a name="50316-07_para16">
<a name="stpa_169">It is worth considering whether pensions should be allied to earnings. I have worked out that between 1997&nbsp;and now the net pensioner income has increased by 19&nbsp;per cent., and net earnings have increased by 12&nbsp;per cent. In other words, pensioners have had a seven percentage point increase above the inflation rate as calculated using the retail prices index, so the link to earnings virtually exists. If we went back to a flat rate for all pensioners, we would find that 30&nbsp;per cent. of pensioners at the bottom end of the scale would be hugely deprived as a result. The need to pursue the Government&#039;s policy is extremely important.

 I agree entirely, and I shall deal with that point with an anecdotal comment.

I have been a Member of Parliament for 18&nbsp;years, and for well over a decade of my time here, I was used to pensioners coming into my constituency surgery and saying, &quot;Look, I&#039;ve got just a little bit of extra savings, and there&#039;s a 100&nbsp;per cent. withdrawal rate as a result.&quot; The pension credit is helping to alleviate that situation, but we still have some withdrawal tax rates of 50&nbsp;or 60&nbsp;per cent. I suggest to my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary that we should work on improving that situation to ensure that we do not have such penal rates. However, when we consider that in 1997&nbsp;the withdrawal tax rate was 100&nbsp;per cent., we see that have come a long way.

Three things struck us about our visit to China that we should take note of: first, the sheer size of the country; secondly, the pace of change there; and, thirdly, the need to pay close attention to China. When we put together the first two&#151;the size and the pace of change&#151;the result is an emerging economic superpower with an increasingly important impact on the global economy.

Half the cement in the world is imported by China. China is looking to Africa, especially Nigeria, for oil. A fascinating example comes from one of my former colleagues with whom I worked, the former Secretary-General of NATO, who visited Venezuela about six weeks ago. He told me that the second biggest user of the Panama canal is China. So China&#039;s stamp is all over the world&#151;it is a global superpower&#151;and that is a very important issue for us to take on board.

China has huge scope to make efficient use of energy and to make its energy production&#151;currently heavily reliant on coal&#151;less environmentally harmful.

 It is one of the traditions of the House to congratulate the Chancellor on his Budget statement, though that does not necessarily mean an endorsement of every detailed part of what he said in policy terms.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_185">I expect this to be my last speech in this House. I made my first 26&nbsp;years ago. As is appropriate and traditional, I said nice things about my predecessor, Michael Ward, and spoke lovingly and appreciatively of Peterborough before making some comments about Northern Ireland.&nbsp;I have nothing new to add on Michael Ward and I still appreciate Peterborough and North-West Cambridgeshire. I thank the people there for the confidence that they have had in me for 26&nbsp;years and for their support and encouragement. I can look them in the eye and say that I have responded, to the best of my ability, on their behalf. I shall come back to the subject of Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_186">I, too, spotted the comment in Tom Bower&#039;s book &quot;Gordon Brown&quot; in which the Chancellor was told by an official what a fantastic economy he was inheriting and snarled, &quot;What am I supposed to do? Write a letter of thanks?&quot; The answer to that question was yes; he should have symbolically written a letter of thanks. There is no debate&#151;other than among Treasury Ministers, who have a different agenda&#151;about the fact that the Government inherited what has been called a golden legacy. They have built on it, as one recognises and appreciates. My constituents, in general terms, are better off today than they were when I became a Member of Parliament 26&nbsp;years ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_187">Yet one of the problems that the Chancellor has when making Budget speeches is that he is so partial in what he tells the House. The distinction between what he tells the House and what turns out to be the reality is so considerable, and appears to get bigger every year, that it is not surprising that what he tells us is taken with a large pinch of salt. To put a little balance into his statement, he might, for example, have reflected on the fact that, when he came to power, the current account of the balance of payments was virtually in balance. Last year, it was in deficit to &#163;57&nbsp;billion, which is the largest in our history. The previous record was the previous year when the deficit was &#163;47&nbsp;billion. If he had considered that, we might have had a slightly more balanced appreciation of the state of the economy.

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="50316-09_spnew1"><b> Mr. Liam Byrne  (Birmingham, Hodge Hill) (Lab):</b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman must surely be aware that the current deficit is only about 1.5&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product. That is in sharp contrast to the 4&nbsp;or 5&nbsp;per cent. of GDP that we saw in the 1980s.

<p><a name="st_26"><a name="50316-09_spnew2"><b> Sir Brian Mawhinney: </b> 
 When one is old and grey, the temptation is to offer advice to young men. The Chancellor made much about figures in billions that were considerably less than the &#163;57&nbsp;billion of deficit last year. One therefore needs to be a little careful in being quite so dismissive of the growing&#151;and record&#151;balance of payments difficulty.

<a name="stpa_188">As those of us who listen&#151;occasionally through gritted teeth&#151;to the &quot;Today&quot; programme know, four years ago and at this point in the previous Parliament, the Chancellor told us that his plans for this Parliament

<br>&nbsp;<br>were to borrow a total of &#163;16&nbsp;billion. He has actually borrowed &#163;95&nbsp;billion. If he had reflected on that fact, it would have given his statement slightly more substance.

<p>
<a name="50316-09_para4">
<a name="stpa_189">Right hon. and hon. Friends will recall what I was doing in 1995. I remember that when the Prime Minister was in opposition, he said that he had no plans to increase tax. That statement is engraved on my heart. However, the British people discovered that it would not take long for this Government to make their plans, and 66&nbsp;stealth taxes were introduced. Sixty-six is a big number, but I will give the House a bigger one&#151;the &#163;5,000&nbsp;per household that represents the increase in taxation imposed on our people by this Government.

It turned out to be spectacularly wrong.

<p><a name="st_27"><a name="50316-09_spnew3"><b> Mr. Purchase: </b> 
 I share the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s recollection of the importance of the balance of payments, and I take the other points that he has made about debt. However, is not the point that one takes on debt based on one&#039;s ability to pay it back? Is it not a fact that the dynamism of our economy and the growth figures that the Chancellor presented to us today show that households and the nation are far more able to meet that debt? It is probably a smaller proportion of households&#039; total income.
</p>








<p><a name="st_28"><a name="50316-09_spnew4"><b> Sir Brian Mawhinney: </b> 
 That is an interesting thought, and I do not have the statistics at my fingertips. However, the Chancellor reminded us today that the figure for average earnings was &#163;23,400. If one takes &#163;5,000&nbsp;from that, average earnings look a lot less attractive than would have been the case if the Government had stuck to their pledge not to increase taxes.

The Chancellor would not have even recognised the position of council tax payers had an election not been planned for a few weeks time. However, it is worth recalling that council tax has gone up by 70&nbsp;per cent. under this Government, and a third of the increase in the basic state pension has been eaten up by council taxes. It is no wonder that the so-called grey vote is on the march. We respond to it out of instinct; the Government respond purely on the basis of trying to get themselves through 5&nbsp;May.

 May I clarify two statistics for the right hon. Gentleman? In my city of Wolverhampton, the council tax has gone up quite a lot under this Government. In eight years, it has gone up by 16&nbsp;per cent. in real terms, and we must consider real-terms increases rather than the gross increases to which, I suspect, he referred when he mentioned the figure of 70&nbsp;per cent. On the money for the poorest pensioners, in 1997, a single pensioner was expected to live on &#163;69&nbsp;a week. However, from April, the figure will be, in round terms, &#163;115&nbsp;a week. In real terms, that is a 40&nbsp;per cent. increase.

 I am tempted to engage in this argument, but I will not except to say that it seems to me that the hon. Gentleman is using two different sets of inflation statistics to enhance his position. I heard the figures for an increase from &#163;69&nbsp;to &#163;115, and I am perfectly happy to accept that such a &#163;45&nbsp;increase has occurred. However, that has taken place over eight years, which equates to 5.75&nbsp;per cent. a year. Had the Chancellor said to us that he was happy to be able to tell us that he could increase pensions by an average of 5.75&nbsp;per cent. per year, we would have had a better opportunity to assess the comprehensiveness of the statement that he made to the House.

He forgot to say that for every job in the private sector that was lost last year, two jobs were created in the public sector. We are all in favour of employment, and we do not enjoy seeing our constituents out of work. Two jobs for one seems, on the face of it, a good exchange. However, the Government are seeking to persuade us that they have changed their attitude to wealth creation and substituting two public sector jobs for one private sector job in one year is not a recipe for wealth creation in the medium term.

China is so big that we must not fall into the mindset that it is homogeneous. It is taking our jobs at the moment because it pays less. However, when costs rise in one part of China, another part will come along that is even poorer than Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. That part of China will start the process all over again and, after that, a third part will come along to start the process again.The right hon. Gentleman knows that I do not indulge in criticisms of what he says in the House, but if I have a criticism of him, it is that he almost understated the threat. Last year, my son taught in one of Beijing&#039;s universities for a year. He taught not just English, but how to write job applications for the west so that the students could be trained abroad and bring back their skills to inject into the local community.

Had the Chancellor been so minded, he could have said that he was going to give some of the pockets of money to British universities on the understanding that they would go to China and India, which I agree is also important, to look for new opportunities to develop the knowledge economy in new ways.

<a name="stpa_197">The Chancellor mentioned three things en passant on which he should have focused much more. The first is inheritance tax. The papers of one Government are not made available to their successors. I am happy to tell the House, however, that I was one of the voices in the last Conservative Government that argued for a much more generous inheritance tax regime than we put in place. If I believed that 10&nbsp;years ago, how strongly does the House think I believe it now, after eight more years of house price inflation and after dragging more and more people into the net?

Now that we have heard where the Government have positioned themselves, my guess is that there are considerable votes to be won in middle England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland by the party that says, &quot;We will allow you to take your primary residence out of the inheritance tax calculation.&quot; I even offer my hon. Friends the election slogan, in case they are too busy to work it out. I would be very happy to go to North-West Cambridgeshire and say, &quot;Vote for me and give your children your home, not the tax man.&quot; I was deeply disappointed that the Chancellor did not rise to the occasion on inheritance tax.

<a name="stpa_199">The second thing that the Chancellor talked about was his tax credit proposals. There is an element of truth in what he said. Let me make it clear that I am not trying to make a particularly partisan speech. However, as a Back-Bench Member of Parliament, one thing that irritates me more and makes me more angry on behalf of my constituents than virtually anything else is the sheer incompetence of the pension tax service, the working tax credit and, above all, the Child Support Agency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_200">The Government have lost the plot. They seem to think that if they stand there and unveil a policy, that is it. Well, it may be &quot;it&quot; in Labour constituencies, but it is not &quot;it&quot; in my constituency. I receive a higher proportion of letters on the tax credit arrangements and the Child Support Agency and their inability to work than I do on any other issue. It makes me angry. I always said that when I was no longer able to be righteously angry on behalf of my constituents, it was time to quit. I am quitting, but I am still righteously angry. We heard nothing about investment or holding to account those who screw up the lives of my constituents who, by definition, are among some of the most needy. That washes off Ministers like water off a duck&#039;s back.

<a name="50316-10_para5">

I will not believe that the Chancellor and Treasury Ministers are serious about helping the most needy until they deliver a service in an efficient and humane way. Let me offer a suggestion: fire the chief executive and deputy chief executive of the CSA &quot;pour encourager les autres&quot;. I do not care who is put in their place. It cannot be any worse than the existing system. I was disappointed that the Chancellor said nothing about that.

I have heard the Chancellor lay red tape upon red tape upon red tape upon red tape upon red tape, yet five weeks before a general election he thinks that perhaps it is a good idea to say, &quot;Maybe I am not totally in favour of it.&quot; The Treasury Committee has been telling the Chancellor for eight years, &quot;Keep red tape to a minimum; reduce red tape, and then cut red tape.&quot; The Chancellor will go to that Committee on Tuesday and say nice things, yet the country&#039;s economy is being strangled. If the Chairman of the Committee looks before next Tuesday at the business surveys, he will see that all of them say that business is now more worried about regulation and red tape than anything else. I was disappointed that the Chancellor did not say anything more convincing.

<a name="stpa_203">I want to return for a moment to whether the Chancellor should have said thank you for the legacy of the economy. There are two other things for which he should have said thank you in 1997. He should have said thank you to the previous Government because, for the first time in our history, we set about trying to reduce third world debt. I am proud that I was a member of the Government who did that. I pay tribute to the Chancellor because he built on those foundations; in a sense, it has been a seamless operation, as it should be. Overseas aid and trying to reduce the debt burden on the poorest of the poorest in the world ought not to be a partisan point, so it would have been nice if the right hon. Gentleman had said thank you. I say thank you to him, even though he has not said thank you to us, because he has built on that foundation. I hope that that can continue.

<a name="stpa_204">The other thing about which he could have said thank you&#151;but I will say thank you to him&#151;is that we changed the fundamental socio-economic basis of Northern Ireland, about which I do know something. That enabled the peace process to start, because as a matter of Government policy we addressed some of the road blocks in the thinking and the experience. I give just one example; when I became a Northern Ireland Minister in 1986, people were two-and-a-half times more likely to be unemployed if they were Catholics than if they were Protestants. There was a range of issues that needed to be addressed, and we addressed them. We laid down the beginning of the improvement of the Northern Ireland economy, so I say thank you to the Government for building on that.

<a name="50316-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_205">The House will not recall&#151;it is obviously more in my memory than in that of the House&#151;that I was the first Minister who started the peace process, and I have a vested interest in its success. Today, Northern Ireland is much better than it was; tomorrow it will be better still, and although we continue to run into troubles for the peace process in the short term, the Government should not take their eye off the economy, which needs to be strengthened further and in the strengthening will make political progress even more possible.

I have had the privilege of being in this House for four Parliaments in government and two in opposition. In that time, irrespective of which side of the House I was on, in my constituency I have spoken minimally about politics and party politics, and maximally about the issues that people tell me are important to them and about moral values. I discovered something very interesting: when I make a speech about what interests my constituents, or about moral values, there is a long queue of people who want to talk to me afterwards, but when I make a speech about politics, they say, &quot;That was a great speech, Brian,&quot; and get off to the bar as quickly as possible.

We have similar instincts. My final words to the House are these: politicians who want to be held in higher regard by the public need to hear and respond to the beliefs and values of their constituents, as well as to their needs and aspirations.

His Housing (Building Facilities) Act 1924&nbsp;may have been one of the best and most important measures ever to go through the House of Commons. It led to the construction of hundreds of thousands of houses, mostly by councils at affordable rents for people who needed decent homes. Some of my very elderly constituents still say that they live in a Wheatley house and are proud to do so.

He was followed by John McGovern, Independent Labour party and later Labour, who held the seat until 1959, when my predecessor, Sir Myer Galpern, then Lord Provost of Glasgow, became the Member of Parliament for Glasgow, Shettleston. Just prior his retirement in 1979, he occupied the Chair in which you now sit, Mr. Deputy Speaker; he was a popular and distinguished Deputy Speaker until he moved to the other place on becoming Lord Galpern.

Glasgow, Shettleston is to be divided in two: one half is to become part of the new central constituency; the other half, including Shettleston itself, the area in which I have had the pleasure and privilege of living for the past 35&nbsp;years, will merge with the Glasgow, Baillieston constituency to form the new Glasgow, East constituency, which I hope to represent after the election.

It was distressing to see the hopes and aspirations of young school leavers being destroyed by the fact that there were no jobs available for them.

I hope that we can find a way to ensure that apprenticeships are not confined to youngsters but benefit adults who may have lost their job years ago and need to retrain.

It is not something that the present Chancellor invented.

<a name="stpa_245">There are many other things that it would have been more open for the Chancellor to have mentioned. For example, over the Government&#039;s four-year term to date, the borrowing outcome has become about &#163;80&nbsp;billion worse than forecast. In terms of total progress of the economy since 1992, productivity growth has trailed off quite significantly since 1997. We have lost 1&nbsp;million manufacturing industry jobs&#151;we had difficult times in the 1980s, but manufacturing jobs have continued to be lost and we have become increasingly uncompetitive. Above all, globalisation&#151;the opening up of world economies&#151;has enabled sustained prosperity to continue. In the past, both Labour and Conservative Governments had the problem of stop-go. Excess demand led to inflation, which in turn led to damping-down measures. But since globalisation it has led to a major rise in imports. The compound current account deficit since 1997&nbsp;is now approaching &#163;150&nbsp;billion. There is no problem with that so long as there are matching capital inflows to finance it.

<a name="stpa_248">A bit has been said about pensions. The pension tax credit was targeted to help pensioners dependent on the basic state pension who were in need, but there has been a problem, with about 40&nbsp;per cent. of the population having stopped saving for pensions in the private sector because pension credits are a major disincentive to do so. For those with private sector pensions, there is an unresolved problem. Millions of people will not receive the pensions that they had expected from their employment-related pension schemes. We are talking not only of the &#163;35&nbsp;billion cash-flow cost of the &#163;5&nbsp;billion per annum tax on pensions; there is also the fact that that has caused a fall of about &#163;100&nbsp;billion in the value of the assets held by pension funds.

They fell to a level where dividend yields exceeded gilt yields, which is normally where stock markets bottom. Had dividend yields been 25&nbsp;per cent. higher, with ACT credits, markets would not have fallen to the extent that they did. Having fallen thus far, pension funds and insurance companies all became forced sellers and have never rebuilt their equity holdings. The net result has been about &#163;100&nbsp;billion of pension fund deficits. That is about equal to the total deficits, which pension funds will be unable to make up.

Mercifully, that deficit will not present itself as a cash liability, but it is a forward contingent liability that will need to be addressed in one way or another. While private sector pension members have had a rough time, the taxpayer subsidy to pay-as-you-go public sector pension schemes, which remain index-linked, has continued to rise.

For example, 7.5&nbsp;million people have been raised into higher tax bands because tax thresholds were under-indexed over the past eight years. Indeed, if we added up all the clever ways that the Chancellor has found to extract more tax from us and asked what income tax would be if he had used none of those, we would find that it was 39p in the pound.

However, Terry Leahy, the head of Tesco, has pointed out that national insurance charges, corporation tax, property taxes and employment taxes, when taken together, mean that Tesco now pays more than 50&nbsp;per cent. of its profits in some form of taxation. If we compare UK tax rates with those in other EU countries, we find that the net taxation paid by British businesses is, in the main, now slightly higher; we are no longer the attractive tax base to invest in that we were. That is one reason why inward direct investment, which is needed to finance the current account deficit, has halved. Indeed, when I looked at last year&#039;s figures for what matched the substantially rising current account deficit, I was concerned to discover that about half of it was what we used to call hot money in the old days; it was not safe, long-term investment flows.

I have been in contact with the National Audit Office, which is looking into it but still does not have a full explanation. Some of it seems to be genuine&#151;there was double counting of depreciation&#151;but the NAO told me that most of it resulted from transferring revenue expenditure to capital expenditure. We all know about the business of balancing over the cycle. I always understood that this would take the sensible approach of having a cumulative total of deficits and surpluses, but no&#151;we re-base every year as a percentage and produce some theoretical figure that nobody understands and is no longer a measure of the net deficit over a cycle.

The Government themselves, having gone to such lengths for a rather bad PPP for London Underground, were surprised that they had to put that on balance sheet. The structuring of Network Rail is completely ludicrous&#151;it is a renationalised rail service provider and the only reason why the &#163;21&nbsp;billion debt is not on balance sheet is that the situation has been fudged by having a body of 100&nbsp;council people who are supposed to be consulted. In describing meeting the debt and borrowing ratios, it would be much fairer and more meaningful to have a figure that included all the Government&#039;s off-balance-sheet liabilities.

It is currently running at &#163;57&nbsp;billion and approximately 2.5&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product. That is nowhere near as bad as America, where it is more than 5&nbsp;per cent., but America has to run a current account deficit because the dollar is the main reserve currency and it has to put more dollars into foreigners&#039; pockets in order to finance growing trade. If one takes that factor out, the effective levels of current account deficit are fairly similar. That is no problem as long as the direct inflows are there, but they are reducing quite significantly. Indeed, the number of jobs that have resulted from foreign direct investment in this country is down 20&nbsp;per cent. on the 1997&nbsp;figure.

The ONS measure of what is included to calculate public sector inflation and of what is and is not output was attacked by the Government, but it reveals that only 16&nbsp;per cent. of that spending has got through to front-line delivery services. According to its calculations, public sector inflation is up from 1.6&nbsp;per cent. to 10&nbsp;per cent. and public sector productivity is down by 10&nbsp;per cent.

So what is everyone else doing? Are they adding to productivity? I am afraid that the great splurge in public sector spending has not worked, and the complete change from the prudent Chancellor in 2000&nbsp;to one who has turned on the public spending taps in dramatic fashion since then has not worked because the resources have not got through to front-line delivery.

Members may be aware of William Keegan&#039;s excellent book on the subject&#151;is that, by any measure, we had an extraordinarily prudent Chancellor from 1997&#150;2000, but we have had a very different Chancellor since then. Along with that public sector expenditure, growth in this country has been largely puffed up in reality by higher public borrowing, an unsustainable growth in public sector jobs and unsustainable private sector consumer borrowing. The legacy of that is likely to be five years of sluggish performance.

I spent the 1970s in China and India, and I know something about those countries because of my 25-year involvement with them. In China, the proportion of GDP spent by the Government is between 22&nbsp;and 24&nbsp;per cent., depending on which measure is used. Business in China is not shackled with regulations that make it a nightmare to do anything. What is happening in China is, to an extent, unacceptable old capitalism, which we had in this country 100&nbsp;years ago. That is part of the competitive threat.

: The hon. Gentleman is telling us about the Chinese economy. Would he really want to go back to the days in this country when health and safety were never considered and entrepreneurs were free to lose as many men and women in the process of enterprise as they wanted? Would he really want to go back to that?

<p><a name="st_63"><a name="50316-15_spnew1"><b> Mr. Flight: </b> 
 I do not believe that anyone would. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I have done some very interesting jobs in my life. However, as the hon. Gentleman will know, it was Conservative Governments in the 19th century who started to introduce health and safety measures to protect people. It miscasts the issue to argue that our party has not supported such measures. However, if he is involved in any business at present, he would agree that many such measures are over the top. Regulation is often needed to change behaviour but once that has been achieved and behaviour is satisfactory that is followed by a mass of excessive inspections and regulations that accomplish little. I was pleased to hear the Chancellor&#039;s proposals about consolidating a fair deal on inspection, as that is in line with our recommendations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_269">I am not, however, advocating that this country should return to raw 19th-century capitalism; I was trying to make a point about what is happening in China. We have to compete with China, so we need the minimum regulation. Another major reason for the dynamism of the Chinese economy is that the tax take or the amount spent by the Government is about half the public sector take in the UK, so in China there is a great deal more to reinvest in industry. Members may have noted the recent study on developments in continental Europe since the second world war, which found that for every 1&nbsp;per cent. more taken by Governments in public expenditure there was a fall in the growth rate of 0.14&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_270">It is manifest that advanced economies need a sensible balance. Given the fact of ageing populations and higher expectations, there is an ever greater need for a public sector that can deliver what people want. It is therefore crucial that the public sector is as efficient as possible, because if it continues to consume more and more without improving its output we will end up with economic growth that is insufficient to sustain it.

 The hon. Gentleman has talked about a sensible balance. About 38&nbsp;per cent. of the gross domestic product is spent by the public sector. What does he suggest is a sensible balance? Is it 36&nbsp;or 34&nbsp;per cent., and can he tell us how we would achieve that rate?
</p>








<p><a name="st_65"><a name="50316-15_spnew3"><b> Mr. Flight: </b> 
 I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not&nbsp;mind my saying that such questions are rather silly. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development puts the current UK figure at 45&nbsp;per cent., so no one really knows whether we are at 39, 41&nbsp;or 45&nbsp;per cent.&#151;it depends on which measure is being used. It is a fact, however, that the higher it is, the lower the growth rate. We therefore need a balance between the two. That balance may be about 40&nbsp;per cent.&#151;the Conservative spending plans are to return to 40&nbsp;per cent. in five years&#039; time&#151;but it may change if circumstances change. Welfare will not be delivered if the economy suffers from an ever increasing tax take. Who would have thought that Ireland would have an economy with an income per capita well in excess of the equivalent figure in the UK, or that it would have grown at twice the rate of our economy? The public sector spend in Ireland is 34&nbsp;per cent. of GDP.

<a name="stpa_271">In introducing his Budgets, the Chancellor has always talked about a Budget for enterprise. He has made great play of the wonderful things that he has done for the venture capital industry and implied that he had learned lessons from the USA. The reality is that the venture capital industry is in a poor state. It is in decline, and has experienced major problems in the past three years. None of his initiatives has succeeded in achieving a material improvement. The small and medium-sized enterprise sector is in reasonable shape, but it regards itself as a Cinderella as it does not have any of the fiscal advantages that have been given to the venture capital sector.

A successful example of enterprise in this country is therefore under tax attack. The UK could do a great deal more to make new enterprise more effective and successful, and there is much that we can learn from America and implement. We should not be under any illusion about the fact that, although we may be doing better than continental Europe in these areas, we are still not doing anything like as well as the US, and nothing like as well as we ought to be doing for the long-term health of the economy.

<p>
<a name="50316-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_273">In conclusion, the Chancellor is a little unwise to treat the electorate as dummies. People know very well that there have been major tax increases. Indeed, they supported the proposition at the last election. Everyone said, &quot;Yes, we&#039;re happy to have higher taxation to get better public services.&quot; They were better off as mortgage interest rate costs had fallen. However, people do not believe that they have got the delivery for that additional taxation. They are not happy with the way in which public services are being run or provided.

It is also that it is at a totally different stage of development from western capitalist countries. China is still at the 19th-century Victorian stage of development, so we are competing not with a country that has the same social, economic and industrial beliefs and policies as ours, but with a rather ruthless capitalist economy, certainly in terms of its economics. Perhaps I shall return to the subject of its politics a little later. China has an advantage that the Victorians did not have, however, in that it can copy, borrow and perhaps steal the high technology expertise of western countries.

<a name="stpa_283">We cannot compete with China on wages either. However, we must recognise that the pressure from countries such as China is having an adverse effect on wages in some sectors of our manufacturing and service economies.

<p>
<a name="50316-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_284">We welcomed the recent announcement that the minimum wage would rise to &#163;5.05&nbsp;in September. Indeed, the Chancellor also welcomed the fact that there was going to be a minimum wage in Hong Kong, although I do not know what effect that will have on the Chinese economy. But it is certainly welcome that we have pushed up our minimum wage again. We should realise, however, that in some sectors of industry, certainly in some areas of manufacturing, the minimum wage is now being treated almost as an excuse by management under pressure not to increase wages much above that level. In other words, it is becoming not a floor but a ceiling in some manufacturing sectors such as the car component industries.

<a name="stpa_285">With global pressure keeping wages down in certain areas, what will happen to the working tax credit? We all welcomed the introduction of the working families tax credit, as it was then called, the child tax credit and the pension tax credit. The Chancellor has talked about the

<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 307</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>child tax credit and the pension tax credit, but he did not mention the working tax credit. If wages are going to be pushed down, however, the increase in wages will be less than the rate of inflation, and the cost of the working tax credit will increase.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_286">The working tax credit is, in effect, a subsidy for those on low wages. It is an implied recognition that we cannot pay the kind of decent wages that should be paid to families to enable them to have a reasonable standard of living. So the Government, quite rightly, decided to subsidise their wages, because private industry cannot afford to compete with the foreign competition. I hope that we will be able to continue to pay the working tax credit at its present level, but the more wages are pushed down, the less likely it is that the Government will be able to fund it, unless we cut the level. That is a danger that we might have to face.

Whether &quot;not low tech, not low wage&quot; is equal to &quot;high tech, high wage&quot; I am not sure, but perhaps, even if we work hard, we will aspire to &quot;high tech but not necessarily high wage&quot;, because these Chinese are clever too, Mr. Deputy Speaker. They can produce those high-tech goods for low wages. I am expressing the obvious, but at least we are beginning to believe that that is a problem we will have to face. That is a good start.

<a name="50316-16_para8">
<a name="stpa_290">When such changes are introduced, I am not aware of there being a rigorous analysis of whether they are good for competitiveness and productivity.

It may be that that does not matter if the other countries in western Europe that we compete with&#151;and, indeed, the United States&#151;also have policies of more or less the same kind.

<a name="stpa_291">Again, China is different. If we are serious about competing, although we might not get there in the end, we must try to be more rigorous in our analysis of many of these extremely enlightened policies, which we want to keep, in light of the fact that we are competing with a country that does not have such policies and will not have them for a very long time.

<p><a name="st_76"><a name="50316-17_spnew1"><b> Mrs. Liddell: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is contradicting himself. One reason for the increase in receipts is the improving performance of the economy, which is forecast to continue for some time. I think that he has been rather churlish, and I am surprised that someone with his experience should reach such conclusions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_77"><a name="50316-17_spnew2"><b> Mr. Davies: </b> 
 Perhaps the right hon. Lady should have listened rather more carefully. The fact that the country is enjoying more buoyant revenues than the Chancellor originally predicted shows not that he is prudent, but that he is imprudent. He or his officials made&#151;one hopes&#151;the best possible estimate of the likely levels of revenues in the economy. He then set a level of expenditure. What has happened in practice is that we are running a considerable deficit&#151;a much larger deficit than he expected. Last year&#039;s projections have been revised by &#163;6&nbsp;billion this year. The position would have been a great deal worse had his own revenue projection been accurate, which it clearly was not.

 Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_79"><a name="50316-17_spnew4"><b> Mr. Davies: </b> 
 I have just given way to the right hon. Lady; I might give way to her again a little later, but perhaps she will allow me to make some progress. I notice that during her intervention she in no way quarrelled with my basic thesis concerning the approach to be taken when the economy is growing at or above trend. The Chancellor used to think that the trend rate 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 311</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of economic growth was 2.5&nbsp;per cent. Last year he increased the estimate to 2.75&nbsp;per cent., so perhaps he thinks that it is still 2.75&nbsp;per cent. In the coming financial year, the economy is projected to grow by 3&nbsp;to 3.5&nbsp;per cent., according to the Red Book, and next year by the trend rate of 2.5&nbsp;per cent. So at this point in the cycle, we should not be borrowing at all. Rather, we should be running a surplus, because the economy is growing above the trend rate, and has been for two years. I now give way to the right hon. Lady.
</p>








<p><a name="st_80"><a name="50316-17_spnew5"><b> Mrs. Liddell: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is being very generous in giving way. I seem to remember that when he was in government and I was in opposition criticising his Administration for their attitude to borrowing, they were borrowing for failure. However, the point that the Chancellor is making is that we are borrowing to invest.
</p>








<p><a name="st_81"><a name="50316-17_spnew6"><b> Mr. Davies: </b> 
 I am pleased that I have convinced the right hon. Lady of the arguments that I have been adducing. She has now changed the subject altogether and is talking about the Major Administration of the 1990s, of which I was not a member. Although I did support them most of the time, I carried no particularly convinced brief. So much has she endorsed my arguments that I feel able to move on to my next point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_300">Emerging from these figures is a great worry about the situation of the nation&#039;s finances. We have enjoyed high rates of growth in the past few years, but they have been associated not only with very substantial Government spending, but with greater Government deficits than the Chancellor himself originally anticipated. They have also been accompanied by a complete collapse in private savings. The savings ratio has virtually halved in only eight years, which is a very worrying development. As I recall, when Labour took office the savings ratio was some 9&nbsp;per cent.; now it is approximately 5&nbsp;per cent., which is a massive reduction. That dissaving by the household sector has been accompanied by massive dissaving by the public sector, which, as I just explained, has also been borrowing above its own expectations in the past few years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_301">Of course, those two factors combined contribute to very buoyant demand. It is not surprising that an economy grows fast in those circumstances, but one has to ask oneself where the motor of growth is coming from now. If demand has been fuelled during this period by massive, above-expectation borrowing&#151;I believe it to be excessive&#151;and a collapse in household saving that amounts to substantial dissaving, where will such growth come from during the next period? Do the Government plan to run up even bigger deficits? Are they going to borrow &#163;100&nbsp;billion a year instead of the current &#163;50&nbsp;billion&#151;a figure which includes the refinancing of gilts falling to maturity, involving some &#163;35&nbsp;billion net? Is the household savings ratio going to collapse to zero? I do not think it possible for it to collapse to a minus figure&#151;at least, not for a sustained period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-17_para4">

I have been waiting to see whether the Paymaster General, or somebody else, is going to answer my question about where growth will come from in the next few years. That is a crucial question to ask about any economy, and the silence of Ministers on it is extremely eloquent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_303">The Chancellor made much of the economy&#039;s stability over the past few years. Of course, that stability is very welcome indeed. The question is whether we should confine ourselves to self-congratulation about it, as the Chancellor did earlier. It is perfectly true that we have had low inflation, high and rising employment and very low unemployment, all of which is very welcome. My constituents are pleased about that, naturally&#151;everyone should be pleased about it&#151;but it would be sensible for hon.

<p>
<a name="50316-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_304">There is no question but that the economy&#039;s stability, as shown in a low and pretty stable inflation rate, is largely the result of turning over the management of the monetary side of our economy to an independent Bank of England&#151;or rather, to the Monetary Policy Committee&#151;a policy of which I was always in favour and for which I argued consistently in the 1990s. When the new Government came to power, I refused to join my Front-Bench colleagues in voting against that measure, because I thought it absolutely right.
</p>

<a name="stpa_305">I am glad that the Government did that. Indeed, I pay tribute to the Chancellor for that treatment&#151;it was a very sensible thing to do&#151;and it would be extremely churlish and dishonest of me to say otherwise, because I have always advocated that move. It is splendid, but there is more to it than that: one must ask oneself how it has been possible to run the economy with high demand, high employment, low unemployment and low inflation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_306">Ten years ago no one, myself included, would have supposed it possible to run an economy with high demand, getting unemployment below 3&nbsp;per cent. of the economy, and very low inflation&#151;somewhat under 2&nbsp;per cent. on the basis of the harmonised index, which we now take as the measure. The right hon. Member for Llanelli was moving in the direction of the same analysis. I do not often agree with him, but I do agree on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_307">There is no doubt that the reason is international competition. The manufacturing sector of our economy has been consistently undercut by competition, particularly from the newly developed economies of India and China. There have been enormous, dramatic structural changes in the economy over the past few years. Swathes of manufacturing have disappeared&#151;they are no longer economic&#151;and either the companies have gone broke or, in time, they realised the way the wind was blowing and set up manufacturing capabilities in or entirely contracted out to India, China and, in certain cases, eastern Europe or other places where labour rates are much cheaper.

I do not know whether he ever feels tempted to apply for any of those jobs&#151;most of them are very well paid&#151;but he can read about them every Thursday. That is not a cheap point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_309">In fact, on a quantified basis, twice as many jobs have been created in the public sector as in the private sector over the past eight years. I do not think that that has ever happened before, except under Labour Governments. It has always been a very bad feature of Labour Governments. Of course it is not sustainable, because the role of those people is regulatory&#151;and, some of us would say, parasitical in many cases. They are certainly extremely expensive. They are therefore a burden on the productive sector of the economy. People who are working profitably and productively must pay taxes to support the burgeoning public sector. That reduces the return on investment and the return from effort, work and risk taking and so on in the rest of the economy; it is a major burden.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_310">There is no doubt that in the past few years a combination of those factors has caused the running down of household savings almost to nothing, the borrowing of large sums and, given the impact of international competition, a certain freeing up&#151;although that seems a rather brutal way to describe what is, of course, a traumatic change in the circumstances of an individual and his or her family. If someone is a skilled worker in engineering or another traditional manufacturing industry and finds that there are no more jobs in that field, and no more opportunity to deploy their skills, that is very traumatic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_311">Nevertheless, on an aggregate basis, it is perfectly true that the unemployment that has been created in one sector of the economy has been counterbalanced by employment created in other sectors, particularly the public sector. That is not sustainable, which is my theme this afternoon. We can have a lovely ride and get away with it for a long time, as the Government have done, but it is not sustainable. How long can one get away with borrowing? One cannot borrow for ever; even Governments&#151;even this Government&#151;cannot do that. We must think about these matters very carefully.

<a name="50316-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_312">Instead of reflecting, as a sober, responsible and prudent Chancellor would do, on the way in which these favourable outcomes have been achieved, on the risks attached to the policies that have been pursued, on the potential threats to those policies continuing to be successful and on whatever changes might be required&#151;that is the sort of sensible and sophisticated discussion we ought to have in the House on these occasions&#151;the Chancellor went in for an orgy of self-congratulation. I do not believe that people who do that can ever be described as prudent. They may or may not succeed in deceiving other people, but they are clearly running a considerable risk of deceiving themselves. Once someone has deceived himself into a state of complacency about the world, he is not prudent and responsible, and not a person to be entrusted with the management of anybody&#039;s finances, let alone the country&#039;s finances.

 I find what the hon. Gentleman says fascinating; I know that he is very knowledgeable.

There was a larger amount of fixed interest, particularly gilts, in the portfolio, and in those days we had debentures, which were a form of fixed interest that does not exist now&#151;it was destroyed by a Labour Government in the 1970s, but that is a long story.

It became generally accepted at that time that one could not achieve a reasonable return from a long-term pension fund except through equities. Fixed-interest gilts or other forms of fixed interest were a bad investment in theory, and should be the minority of the funds in a pension fund. I think that the hon. Gentleman will find that from the 1960s through to the 1990s, the commitment to equities has been very much a constant. Of course it varies across the cycle, but there has been no conceptual change in fund managers&#039; views over that time.

It may well be true that the &#163;5&nbsp;billion tax did not help pensions but, to use his phraseology, two things holed them below the waterline. The first was the revelation brought about by FRS 17&nbsp;of the terrible state of some pension funds that the Government inherited from the previous Government, which had been hidden for years. The other thing that definitely holed them below the waterline was the appalling oversight by actuaries concerning rising longevity. Although the hon.

They were completely crazy to implement FRS 17&nbsp;when they knew that the new international directive under the international financial reporting standard was coming in two or three years later&#151;indeed, it is coming in this year. Its implementation caused quite unnecessary consternation in boardrooms around the country and quite unnecessary panic about the liabilities of pension funds.

From that Budget on&#151;from the very moment when the pensions tax was announced&#151;not one new defined benefit scheme has been launched, and that has been the case for eight years. That tells us something. If the line on a graph suddenly goes down as though it is falling off a cliff, that should tell the hon. Gentleman something.

We have had to listen today to a tirade of figures from the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, which he appears to have plucked from nowhere. I do not know if he reads Keith Waterhouse&#151;one of the funniest men still writing in tabloid newspapers today&#151;in the <i>Daily Mail</i>. He has a name for the Office for National Statistics: he re-christened it the national guesswork authority, and if he had heard the hon. Gentleman today, he would have found a chairman for it.

 Does the hon.

 I find that a very serious point. It is a separate point, but it again seeks to undermine what the Chancellor has said today. It pretends that the people employed by the ONS are corruptible. That is exactly what the hon. Gentleman suggested. I reject those arguments, which now almost tend to say, &quot;Let us see the workings, let us see the arithmetic. Can I see this paper, can I see that paper?&quot; The fact is that the overwhelming number of people in public services&#151;in the ONS and elsewhere&#151;do their very best, every day of their working lives, to produce information and services which, generally speaking, the people of this country value.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_330">The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked where future growth will come from. He referred, rightly, to manufacturing and the loss of jobs in the sector. Between 1980&nbsp;and 1990, when the Conservatives were in control, we lost about 350,000&nbsp;jobs; during the same period, output fell and in 1990&nbsp;it was still slightly less than it had been in 1980. Under the Labour Government, however, although a similar number of jobs have been lost, which is regrettable, especially in areas such as mine in the west midlands, productivity has increased massively, outstripping productivity gains in the economy as a whole, and present output is broadly similar to what it was in 1997. Although we have been overtaken in many respects, our engineering and manufacturing companies have created something of an economic miracle.
</p>








<p><a name="st_99"><a name="50316-19_spnew8"><b> Mr. Quentin Davies: </b> 
 I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not want to confuse productivity and production. Manufacturing production may not have increased in the 1980s, but productivity increased quite substantially; that often happens when employment is falling.

<p><a name="st_100"><a name="50316-19_spnew9"><b> Mr. Purchase: </b> 
 That is true. I certainly understand the distinction. My point is that output was falling in the period between 1980&nbsp;and 1990; it is not doing so now. With the other two factors held constant, the Labour record and the Tory record stand in distinction from each other. I am actually complimenting the people who work in engineering and manufacturing, who have brought about a minor economic miracle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_331">If we are looking for engines of growth, we must look at what my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has done in respect of lifelong learning. Although in the 1980s, during the period of Conservative rule, supply-side measures were at the top of the agenda, no real attention was given to upskilling, new-skilling and retraining for the people who would eventually produce the goods and services we need. Now, the great amount of funding that has gone into further education in particular is helping to bring about the kind of changes that I have been describing. A couple of weeks ago, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor visited Wolverhampton to open a new city learning quarter, called Metro One. Millions of pounds have been spent to the great advantage of adults who are returning to learning and now finding jobs in our economy. That cannot be thought of as a waste of public funds.

<br>&nbsp;<br>not amazingly well blessed with natural resources, so we have to export in order to buy the other things that we want. Exports have increased by 6&nbsp;per cent., which is largely due to the way in which we have been working on the supply-side factors such as education, which has brought about smarter, better working and higher productivity, which have enabled us to remain competitive in world markets. You do not get that kind of increase in your exports without acting to ensure that people can do the work and add value to our output. The Chancellor gave us that extremely important statistic today.

<a name="stpa_334">I also want to mention that borrowing will fall in the longer term, that investment in science will increase and that the enterprise economy will be supported. Given all the evidence that the Chancellor has presented to the House today, it seems that we will meet both the golden rule and the sustainable investment rule in both the current cycle and the next cycle. This masterful Chancellor has presented us with a golden scenario.

 I have never worked for a company in which savings could not be made. Whether those savings entailed mere stock control, better and smarter working or something else, I have never worked for a company that could not make savings in its day-to-day operations. I would be amazed if a Government of whatever stripe examined what they were doing and how they were doing it and could not make savings. The Gershon savings amount to about 5&nbsp;per cent. of total expenditure and will be gained over a period of years, which is not surprising. The right hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to the fact that those savings should have been made some little time ago, but I do not regard such expenditure as wasteful.

<p>
<a name="50316-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_342">There are some points that we need to consider in detail. Much has been made of the fact that the Chancellor subcontracted to the Monetary Policy Committee the setting of the monetary framework, which is the other side of the Budget. By and large, the Budget report and financial statement deals with the fiscal dimension of the Budget while the Monetary Policy Committee deals with monetary matters. The fact that we have interest rates at about 5&nbsp;per cent. raises the issue of the structural nature of our economy. If, to achieve an inflation rate, projected by the Chancellor, of about 2&nbsp;per cent., we need to have effectively internationally uncompetitive interest rates of 5&nbsp;per cent., that says something about the structure of the economy. That in part reflects the substantial growth in public sector employment. Without doubt, it has tightened the labour market considerably.

<a name="50316-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_343">I would not disagree with the taking on by the public sector of more and better trained people such as doctors, nurses and teachers. However, that has not been the entire hallmark or characteristic of changes in public sector spending by the Government. Since they came into office, the Government have recruited about 583,000&nbsp;extra people into the public sector. Not all of them are nurses, doctors and teachers, and others of a vital nature. The growth of the quangocracy, the new organisations and so on requires to be teased out so that we can ascertain where the money has gone.

<a name="50316-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_344">One of the interesting points that the Chancellor has made great virtue of in his golden rules is borrowing for investment. I want to spend a moment looking at the term &quot;investment&quot;. Within a few years of the Chancellor&#039;s taking office, the term &quot;public spending&quot; had been transmuted into &quot;investment&quot; as a way of clothing with respectability what was actually old-fashioned public spending. In the health sector, most of the bricks and mortar activity that I would regard as investment is now being carried out under the terms of the private finance initiative. Likewise, in the transport sector one can see that road building, what little of it goes on, is done by the private sector. In the railway sector, the entire expenditure of Network Rail has been taken off the public balance sheet. I am led to the inexorable conclusion that most of the &quot;investment&quot; has been in borrowing to deal with the variable costs of employing additional labour, not bricks and mortar in the public sector.

<a name="stpa_345">Much has been made of the long run of growth in the economy. I take this opportunity to salute all the hard-working people in the United Kingdom and the excellence of British management and our companies and enterprises, which by and large have enabled that growth to take place. Following the difficulties of the mid-1990s, industry has got its act together and is working extremely hard. We have become innovative. We have changed the nature of manufacturing and of what we do in the so-called ideas economy. Much of that has happened without the intervention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. However, let me cite some figures for the record, using data supplied by the Office for National Statistics. Average growth during the period 1992&#150;97, when growth resumed, was 3.1&nbsp;per cent.; between 1997&nbsp;and 2004, under the present Administration, it was 2.7&nbsp;per cent. In 1992&#150;97, manufacturing output volume increased by an average of 2.1&nbsp;per cent. year on year; under this Government it has been 0.7&nbsp;per cent. Business investment was 5.5&nbsp;per cent. under the Conservatives; it has been 4.5&nbsp;per cent. under this regime. As my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), who has left the Chamber for a moment, pointed out, household saving went down by 3.9&nbsp;per cent. under the Conservative Administration, but there has been a massive decline of 7.5&nbsp;per cent. under this Chancellor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_346">The foundation laid by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) formed a valuable basis for what has taken place. Why do Conservative Members worry, despite the attractive numbers put before us by the Chancellor on the growth of the economy and relative borrowing ratios? Why do we have the temerity to criticise? It is because when my right hon. and learned Friend was Chancellor, he recognised that tight and tough control on public expenditure at a level of 38&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product, a tough approach on inflation and a proper approach on fiscal policy were the necessary foundations for a stable economy with the prospect of long-term growth. In fairness to the present Chancellor, he has entirely agreed with that Conservative approach and has maintained, in his own way, the policy foundations that we put in place. I sometimes wish that Members on the Treasury Bench would stop airbrushing out of history the fact that growth in this country started in 1992.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_347">Going back to my first point about inflation and interest rates, one of the problems that the Chancellor has not been able to affect is productivity. Under the Government of my former colleague, John Major, annual productivity growth averaged 2&nbsp;per cent., but the average now is 1.5&nbsp;per cent. If productivity is such a struggle, I conclude that many of the macro-economic activities that the Chancellor has introduced, supposedly to modernise and improve the economy, have not had a measurable effect on what has happened in the United Kingdom.

The Chancellor has an uncanny knack of getting his growth statistics and forecasts right, but when it comes to borrowing his track record is poor. In the &quot;Financial Statement and Budget Report&quot; for 2002&nbsp;the prediction for borrowing this year was &#163;17&nbsp;billion and the figure for the next financial year was some &#163;18&nbsp;billion. Those figures have been changed to &#163;32&nbsp;billion and &#163;29&nbsp;billion respectively. It is absolutely clear that the forecasts on borrowing are significantly out, and it would be useful if the Treasury Committee could inquire into why it is possible to get the growth figure spot on&#151;that is the central figure for the economy&#151;when the borrowing figure is so far out. Unless there is greater accuracy in the projections, management of the economy is very difficult.

<p><a name="st_111"><a name="50316-21_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jack: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right. When we compare the big figure of receipts with the big figure of expenditure, what is left in between is a small figure. That has always been the case. However, having worked so hard in the last four years of the Major Government, and recognising that the Chancellor accepts the importance of a prudent approach to the economy, when one starts to see the cumulative effect of borrowings mounting up considerably above previous projections&#151;and with the inevitable fact that they will have to be repaid somehow if the sort of prudent approach that the Chancellor wants us to support is to be maintained&#151;it is right to question the methodology by which one can accurately predict growth within the Treasury model, but not borrowings.

<a name="50316-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_349">I mention that because in the &quot;Financial Statement and Budget Report&quot; the Chancellor looks to substantial growth in, for example, corporation tax revenues to underpin his overall growth.

If that is multiplied by three&#151;the average rate of corporation tax is around 30&nbsp;per cent.&#151;he is looking for an increase in taxable profits of around &#163;30&nbsp;billion in the UK year on year. There will be some windfall gains from the oil sector, but it is evident that in the retail sector, for example, there are problems and there may not be sufficient revenue to give the Chancellor the sort of lift of taxable profit that he is looking for.

 I return to a point that I have made before. I have acknowledged that receipts and public expenditure both involve big numbers but that in between there are some smaller numbers. Part of running a successful economy is about the credibility of the numbers that are published. Markets determine exchange rates, as the hon. Gentleman knows, and indeed have a profound influence on interest rates. If they believe that the numbers are right they can decide if they are going to support the Chancellor of the day. I am raising the question of how correct the numbers are, because if they are proven by subsequent analysis to be incorrect, that undermines the Chancellor&#039;s position and could have an effect on interest rates, which by definition would have an effect on the rest of the economy.

<br>&nbsp;<br>haves do not pay it but that the have-nots, for want of good legal advice, end up being caught. The Chancellor said that 94&nbsp;per cent. of estates do not pay inheritance tax. That is a reduction. Last year, it was 95&nbsp;per cent., and the year before, about 96&nbsp;per cent. More people are caught and, given the importance of the house as an asset and given what my hon. Friends said about the pension situation, it is time to look at inheritance tax, particularly for householders.

<a name="stpa_354">The Chancellor mentioned a national energy network, and I was intrigued by that new creation because I support innovations in energy. However, I emphasise to those on the Treasury Bench, who have patiently listened to my remarks on biofuels, that I was disappointed that, again, there was no indication that the Chancellor was prepared to go beyond the current duty derogation to try to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stimulate a UK biodiesel and bioethanol industry. Yesterday, I received a representation from the Iogen Corporation&#151;a Canadian-based company&#151;which made the position clear:

<a name="50316-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_356">I appreciate that consultations are currently taking place between industry and the Department for Transport and I urge the Treasury Bench to look at the matter again. If we are to meet our European targets for inclusion&#151;they are targets, not directives&#151;we will need a biofuels industry of our own. It is therefore important to encourage that embryonic industry off the ground, using United Kingdom raw materials to the benefit of our rural and, indeed, overall economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_357">The Chancellor sensibly mentioned the need for further work to skill the economy. I agree with that. BAE Systems is my constituency&#039;s biggest employer and it survives on the talents of talented aerospace engineers. However, if the Chancellor wants to back high-tech manufacturing in the United Kingdom so that it provides the sort of technologies that will survive in a world dominated by competitors such as China and India, the Government will have to do more to sustain investment in technology, the development of new materials and new techniques in aerospace and, most important, ensure that they have contingent moneys should they decide to buy the Eurofighter tranche 3, thus enabling that commitment to be honoured. They should also do more to bring about a final assembly check-out facility and maintenance unit in the United Kingdom for the joint strike fighter, to keep our technologies fully engaged and ensure that Britain continues to be up with the best in the new arts of aerospace aviation&#151;for example, unmanned air vehicles and stealth technologies. If the Chancellor&#039;s comments about reskilling and investing in new technologies cover that, I put a tick in that box. However, if they do not, one of our key future technology industries will be severely damaged, as will the economy of the north-west and the nation.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate. Like the right hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Sir Brian Mawhinney) and others, this will probably be the last time that I shall speak in the House. I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman is not in his place. I do not blame him for going for a cup of tea because we have heard the speeches of the hon. Members for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) and for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) in every Budget debate for the past eight years. I absolve the right hon.

<a name="stpa_360">I had a particular reason for wanting to wish the right hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire well for the future. When I entered the House in 1994&nbsp;after a traumatic by-election caused by the death of the late John Smith, the right hon. Gentleman was, in his normal courteous way, the first Member to wish me well for the future. I should therefore like to take the opportunity to return the compliment and wish him well. I remember that he spoke about the pre-1997&nbsp;state of his then constituency of Peterborough. My experience of Airdrie and Shotts under the previous Conservative Administration was markedly different, however, and it is for that reason that I rise to congratulate the Chancellor on this Budget.

<a name="50316-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_361">I disagree with the right hon. Member for Fylde, who took up the theme of the Leader of the Opposition and the right hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire that this is a vote-winning Budget. It is not. What will win an election is the fact that this Budget is incremental on other Budgets that have gone before. Almost everything that the Chancellor talked about in this Budget builds on initiatives that have already been undertaken.

<a name="stpa_362">I know, as a Member of Parliament for a particularly deprived area, that my constituency comes top in terms of the transfer into employment of people of working age. That is a considerable achievement in an area blighted by the end of the coal mines and badly affected by the end of the steel and shipbuilding industries. Such an achievement would have been impossible were it not for the actions of this Government from 1997&nbsp;onwards. Pensioners in my constituency will share the view expressed by Age Concern this afternoon, warmly welcoming the Budget. The constituents whom I have had the honour to represent have seen a significant change in their well-being as a consequence of the Government&#039;s actions.

<a name="stpa_363">I come from an area in which no pensioner&#151;indeed, no individual&#151;would ever have known what it was like to have &#163;200&nbsp;in their hand at one time. Yet that is what the winter fuel payment has meant for my constituents. Something else that would not have been possible without the sound management of the economy and the consideration of the Treasury&#151;something that the Chancellor did not mention in the Budget&#151;is the payment to miners who have suffered ill health. I represent a constituency in which the pits closed 30&nbsp;or 40&nbsp;years ago, and where there are 240-odd men whose health was damaged as a consequence of their work in them. In my constituency of 58,000&nbsp;souls, &#163;9.3&nbsp;million has already been paid out to some of the poorest people, almost all of whom are pensioners. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined, when I made my maiden speech in 1994, that that would happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_364">I made my maiden speech in a debate on the Finance Bill. I was too naive to realise, when the Whip sent me in to do so, that I was making a job application to serve on the Bill&#039;s Committee. This was at a time when no Member could say that they had worked on a Finance Bill until they had seen the sun come up over St. Thomas&#039;s hospital night after night. I remember the subjects that I spoke about during the deliberations on that Bill. I talked about pensions, and about the difficulties that people had experienced as a consequence of the personal pensions mis-selling during the lifetime of the previous Conservative Administration. I was privileged to be able to play a part in putting that right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_365">I also remember talking about the assistance needed by the creative industries, especially the film industry. Manufacturing industry in this country will never be the same again, but when we are experiencing growth in our economy, we can turn to the part of that economy that adds to the overall well-being of us all, namely the creative industries. I have seen this happening in Scotland and throughout the country, and I hope, at some point in the future, to be able to sing the praises of our creative industries in another part of the world.

<a name="stpa_366">The assistance that the Budget has given to small and medium-sized enterprises in reducing the burden of regulation is something that I feel passionately about. I made my maiden speech on the need to encourage SMEs, because I had previously been the chief executive of a small company that worked with such businesses. Reducing the burden of regulation can make a great change to those small companies, probably more so than any other aspect of what the Government can do.

<a name="stpa_376">One of the themes of this Budget debate has been international competitiveness. The Chancellor referred to that in his speech, the right hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), who is the Chairman of the Treasury Committee, referred at length to the threat from China in particular, and my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Sir Brian Mawhinney), in another excellent valedictory speech, referred to China and India.

<p>
<a name="50316-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_377">There is an old forecast, which even the Treasury Bench may have heard of, that as the 21st century unfolds, China will do the manufacturing, India will do the IT, America will do the farming, and all the tourists will come to Europe. That might be the sort of forecast that is not proved to be accurate in reality, and economic forecasts tend to be the reverse of what happens. It indicates, however, the insecurity and dangers that we face in an international world in which the huge economies of China and India are beginning to flex their muscles in a way that has tremendous advantages for us in terms of reducing costs and prices and keeping our economy competitive, but that none the less poses huge threats to our way of life and standard of living in Europe and this country in particular. I am glad that that theme has been raised, as it is a phenomenon that will grow and grow as the years go by.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_378">Inevitably, in this possible pre-election period, the other theme of the debate has been the contrast between the performance of this Government and their predecessor, who, along with the Chancellor, have lasted eight years, and the preceding 18&nbsp;years of Conservative Governments and their economy policy. Now that we have had eight years of this Chancellor and this Government, it is legitimate to compare what has happened under them with what happened in the preceding 18&nbsp;years on the economic front. The contrasts are interesting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_379">The greatest achievements of the Thatcher years of government, and following that, the Major years, were on what economists call the micro-economic side. Reducing the power of trade unions, the privatisation of monolithic and unprofitable nationalised industries, the elimination of exchange controls, deregulation and the big bang in the City, and the reduction in taxation were all extremely radical at the time. In retrospect, they are an incredibly innovative and radical set of measures that were much envied, much copied and will stand the test 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 331</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of time. This Government, despite their different philosophy, have not thought it right to unravel most of those achievements. In terms of the 20th century, they were the most brilliant set of measures achieved by any two Governments in a row.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_380">On the other hand, I must admit, as someone who follows economic policy reasonably closely, that the macro-economic performance of those Conservative Governments was not as good until much later. The way in which monetary targets were followed&#151;as we all know, M1&nbsp;and M3&nbsp;are no longer motorways but measures of monetary policy&#151;with great lack of success and great confusion in the early 1980s, was not a great credit to the then Government and their advisers. A period then followed in which the switch was made under Chancellor Lawson to following an exchange rate, and to following the Deutschmark, which was not exactly one in which macro-economic growth was handled steadily. It eventually led to our membership of the exchange rate mechanism, and the fallout from that was disastrous for the Government of the time. It is certainly not something of which they can be very proud.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_381">What followed was brilliant. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) mentioned this. In fairness to Lord Lamont, it should be said that his first Budget after our exit from the ERM was both brave and well judged. It set the framework for what followed. It was brave in that Lord Lamont was well aware, as we all were, that he had been through an extremely bad time after we came out of the ERM, but he had the guts to go ahead and do exactly what the country needed. We needed him to produce a well-balanced Budget, and also to accept inflation targets which have stood the test of time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_382">When my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) became Chancellor, he took that a step further in what we all remember as the Ken and Eddie show, in terms of management of inflation, interest rates and so forth. That was the beginning of what could legitimately be called the Lamont-Clarke expansion, which has continued throughout the final years of Conservative government and the eight years of Labour government that we have experienced so far.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_383">Macro-economic policy was mixed. It was poor to begin with, but got better under the Conservative Government. During the last eight years, almost exactly the reverse has happened under Labour. I think we all agree that it started brilliantly. Conservative Members have conceded that the new Chancellor&#039;s first steps were excellently judged&#151;the independence of the Bank of England, for instance, which could be described as outsourcing. It always amuses me when Labour Members rebel against outsourcing or criticise it, as they often do. One of the largest undertakings of that kind was the outsourcing of the entire fiscal policy to the Monetary Policy Committee. It was a brilliant success, but Labour Members do not see the parallels with other types of outsourcing, which may also prove successful. This was certainly successful, and continued a vein of policy that began with the Conservatives.
</p>

<p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>followed by profligacy on the public spending side, and there is an obvious black hole that has not been filled by any of the proposals in the Budget. There is real cause for concern about what will happen after the election if the present Government are returned. Let us pray that they are not. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford used the phrase &quot;Apr&#232;s moi le d&#233;luge&quot;, and I think that that encapsulates the Government&#039;s attitude to public spending. We must bear it in mind that higher taxes will almost certainly result if they are returned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_385">On the micro-economic side, the Government faced two challenges. First, they were required to continue the improved performance in the private sector brought about by successive Conservative Governments. Sadly, they have not achieved such an improvement. One example is public transport in London. If people in the City were asked what one development would make their lives easier and make London an even better magnet for international capital and employment&#151;which are hugely important to the British economy as a whole&#151;they would name better transport, but the Chancellor has played a poor role in the management of London&#039;s public transport. He has prevented real expansion and development. We have a crumbling tube system, because nothing was done for five or six years while the Government argued with the Mayor of London. Certainly, for the past four or five years there has been no real investment in London&#039;s tube system, as a result of the Chancellor&#039;s ridiculous concept of the public-private partnership and a long wrangle with the mayor. That is an example of the Chancellor&#039;s getting the task of helping the private sector badly wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_386">The complexity of the tax system has increased enormously. Regulation has also increased enormously, and there have been problems with the pensions system, to which reference has been made. So the Chancellor&#039;s behaviour in respect of the private sector has been extremely poor from a micro-economic point of view.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_387">As we know, however, the real challenge that the Chancellor faced was improving public services. If a&nbsp;Labour Government were elected for anything, it was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to improve public services, which had not improved as much as was necessary under Conservative Governments. Rather, they concentrated on getting the economy into shape, which they did very successfully. The Chancellor has got this challenge wrong, and in a number of ways. In the first instance, in successive Budgets he made the mistake of talking about how much money he was going to put into the public sector before asking for the necessary reforms. Any ordinary business manager in such a situation would say, &quot;Let&#039;s see your plans, and if they&#039;re good I will give you the money.&quot; He would not take the opposite approach and say, &quot;Here&#039;s the money, now where are your plans?&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_388">As a result of the Chancellor&#039;s approach, the temptation was to spend money in all sorts of wasteful ways and to increase salaries. I accept that in some cases, such increases were necessary, as certain public sector employees were well behind those in the private sector&#151;although now, of course, they are well ahead. But that approach was a serious error of judgment and I do not know why the Chancellor came to that conclusion. Perhaps it was an attempt at self-flattery; perhaps he wanted to appear to demonstrate great largesse, in order 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 333</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to please his own side. However, in terms of managing the public sector, that approach certainly was a major misjudgment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_389">As has become apparent over the years and as the Chancellor himself has pointed out, he has been an opponent of some of the reforms that the Prime Minister and other Secretaries of State wanted to implement. For example, at one stage the Chancellor seemed to oppose foundation hospitals, yet freeing managers to make the decisions that they need to make down the line is obviously good and sensible management. Such reform is essential and we believe that it should be taken further, but the Chancellor is glorying in deriding the extent to which the market and decentralisation can play a part in changing the public sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_390">Not only does the Chancellor apparently oppose reforms that the Prime Minister and other Government members want; he has strangled the public sector by imposing bureaucracy, red tape, regulations, directives and money controls. At one stage, there were 6,000&nbsp;public sector targets&#151;more than in Stalinist Russia at its height. The Chancellor has displayed a fatal tendency to control, and a clear misunderstanding of the management required in the public sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-23_para15">
<a name="stpa_391">So the Chancellor is far from being a good Chancellor. Rather, in this competitive world in which China and India, for example, have much lower costs than ours, he has dangerously weakened the private sector through the particular enterprise and growth climate that he has created. Moreover, he has totally failed to improve public services in the way that his supporters and ordinary people want.

Some 1.1&nbsp;million of our 16&nbsp;to 24-year-olds are neither in employment nor in education, but most worryingly of all, a Department of Trade and Industry employment skills survey of 76,000&nbsp;employers published just the other day shows that 2.1&nbsp;million of our work force&#151;10&nbsp;per cent.&#151;lack the basic skills that they need to do the job. What does my hon. Friend think about such a structure? Surely the Chancellor ought to have done something more in this respect this afternoon.

 At the end of every Budget debate, Members stream out of the Chamber and are greeted by those in the press, who want to know whether or not we thought it a good Budget. Usually, answers to that question are based on relatively short-term considerations&#151;whether it will last a day or a week before people start to pick holes in it. Even after imperfections and weaknesses have been identified, we are asked whether, on balance, we would describe it as a cup that is half full or half empty. With today&#039;s Budget, there are easy and difficult answers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_394">In the short-term, this is a Budget with a cup that is three-quarters full in relation to the next election. As Labour Members have pointed out, that is not an opportunistic Budget because a stable economy, with a period of sustained economic growth, cannot be delivered by a single Budget. The Chancellor has rightly flagged up and sustained a year-on-year commitment today, and it will rightly provide the basis for Labour&#039;s manifesto claims at the next general election. The additional trimmings that he has put on the cake will be attractive because they underpin Labour&#039;s commitment to an inclusive society, where we genuinely deliver reinvestment and opportunities for all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_395">I welcome the fact that we have made substantial commitments in the Budget to the rights and prospects of our children. I welcome the fact that we are making a commitment to extend the concept of an entitlement to education and training from the ages of three to 18. I welcome the commitment to reinvest in the infrastructure of the schools and health services that our communities depend on. I welcome the commitment to employment for all and the associated implication, which is that we will unashamedly target resources towards those who have been excluded and most alienated from the jobs market. I also welcome the commitment to pensioners that we will deliver to them free bus travel and a council tax rebate. I am sure that the communities that comprise my own constituency will understand the substantive nature of this as a package that a Labour Government can deliver on the back of a period of stability and economic growth.
</p>

<p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Parliament and whether it will see us through the big challenges of the next decade. It is against those challenges that I want to try to make my own contributions, and I make them unashamedly to a Labour Chancellor not only on the presumption that he will continue to be the Chancellor in the next Labour Government, but on the basis that only a Labour Government can take on board the implications of the challenges. Sadly, the contributions from Opposition Members, who seemed to go little further than a &quot;we can tax you less&quot; approach, do not even begin to touch the nature of those challenges.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_397">The challenges come down to two things. First, as a Parliament and as a society, we must ask ourselves how we renegotiate the contract with ourselves. We live in a society in which people rightly expect to live longer and fuller lives. However, a difficult set of questions must be addressed as to how we pay for the services that will underpin those longer lives. In many ways, this is a biological issue more than a political one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_398">At a political level, the more difficult challenge is one that will come from outside: the challenge of climate change. Tomorrow, a conference will take place in Derby and will be addressed by leaders from across the world. If we were to set today&#039;s Budget in the context of meeting those challenges, the cup would be three-quarters empty. It is a poor Budget in relation to climate change and misses some real opportunities that we need to address&#151;when we have the space to do so&#151;before the crises that climate change will cause begin to land on our doorstep at a rate that we cannot deal with.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_399">Severe cautionary warnings have been issued as to what is already happening, but they are not coming from the IMF, the World Bank or the OECD. They are coming from the United Nations and from non-political organisations such as Munich Re, the world&#039;s largest re-insurance company. In a recent report to the UN, Munich Re said that in the next 25&nbsp;to 30&nbsp;years, the scale of claims for damages resulting from climate change is likely to result in annual costs that outstrip the annual income earned by the world. The forewarnings are dire; it says in simple terms that the costs of climate change could bankrupt the global economy. We will have to think our way into a different world and a different view of economics.

<a name="stpa_402">To those who are enthusiastic about globalisation, I say that we need to think carefully about its costs and the viability of that policy in even the medium term. In China today, the cost of globalisation, and of being able to flood world markets and dump cheap produce in our shops, is that the Chinese are already in the middle of an energy crisis. The Chinese Government have instructed the Chinese coal mines to increase production dramatically above current levels just to keep the system 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 336</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>going. A by-product, with some human significance, is that although China produces less than a third of the world&#039;s output of coal, it accounts for 75&nbsp;per cent. of the deaths of coal miners. That is the product of exploitative markets; we have seen this in our own land in previous centuries. To suggest that a burgeoning global economy can be driven without recognition of these human costs is crass and irresponsible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_403">Moreover, those who see China and India dominating the global economy in the years or decades to come need to talk to Chinese and Indian environmentalists who point out that, in the short term, China and India will face colossal crises about where they will get access to water supplies to keep their populations alive, let alone how they will expand supplies to meet the water requirements of an increasing domestic production market, driven to sustain the global economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-24_para12">
<a name="stpa_404">The water is not there, and nor are the energy resources. If we try to set that against the obligations that we have entered into in respect of Kyoto, those obligations look absurd. The commitments in China are predicated on the construction of 500&nbsp;more coal-fired power stations. There is not a cat in hell&#039;s chance of our meeting the Kyoto commitments, let alone containing the current rate of climate change, if we presume that that is how the global economy can function in the years and decades to come.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_405">The Budget has missed a real opportunity to address a shift in how we think about taxation&#151;a shift from the taxation of goods to the taxation of bads. We have said nothing about a change in the taxation of aviation fuels; we have said nothing about a change in the petrol fuel duties; and we have said nothing about the windfall profits that have accrued to the upstream gas and oil industries as a result of the recent hike in oil prices. However, we do know that Shell has announced that its profits this year have gone up to &#163;9.3&nbsp;billion, and those of BP have risen to &#163;8.7&nbsp;billion. The TUC&#039;s estimate of what we could legitimately look for as a windfall tax on such unearned profits would be in the region of &#163;5&nbsp;billion to &#163;6&nbsp;billion. Had we levied such a tax, we could have earmarked it precisely for investment in the renewable and sustainable energy systems that we desperately need to maintain our own sustainable economy in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_406">The right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) set the point in the context of biofuels, and there is a case for doing that. However, many other areas in the renewable energies sector are crying out for our help. A lobby from the sector set out to us how it could be a major employment driver in a new technology initiative to provide us with a green economy for the future. It pointed out that Britain accounts for 4&nbsp;per cent. of the global market in renewable and sustainable energy systems. Germany has 15&nbsp;per cent.&#151;and not because it was waiting for an investment initiative to co-ordinate energy thinking by its Government, but because its Government created domestic renewable energy markets that allowed the goods to be produced and then to be exported. While we are spending time thinking about the issue, other countries&#151;our competitors&#151;are getting in and investing in changing the nature of their domestic markets. We have missed a real opportunity today by failing to do that.

<a name="50316-24_para15">
<a name="stpa_407">As a comparison, I wish to refer to some of the discussions on environmental thinking and taxation that are taking place not only among our European partners but within the developing world. Many Governments are in direct discussions with their farming communities and urban communities about how they best support regionalised and localised food and farming systems that cut down on food miles and on the carbon and fossil fuel content involved in the long-distance transhipment of food products. Such systems strengthen the lines of food accountability between local farmers and local consumers and create a virtuous circle for sustainable food production. We have failed to pick up on what many of our competitors are seeking to do in structuring the tax advantages around the relocalisation of food systems, in which food security will be a central issue in our competitors&#039; view of the challenges of the immediate future. Our failure to tax carbon miles, in many ways, plays into the hands of those who disregard climate change to the peril of us all.

<a name="50316-24_para16">
<a name="stpa_408">We have done little or nothing about our approach to tackling global pollution. I suppose the only good thing that I can say on that is that, at least, we have not filled the space by a reaffirmation of our belief in the virtues of pollution trading credits. Some of the more critical and serious analysis says that the idea that we can create markets in tradable pollution as a solution to the pollution crises is daft.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-24_para17">
<a name="stpa_409">I offer a comparison with what Parliament did when it acted at its best to deal with pollution and contamination. A number of us are old enough to remember growing up in towns and cities where winters were characterised by periods in which we could barely see in front of us because of the thick fogs that descended. They were part of our annual seasons and cycle. At that time, the Government of the day passed the Clean Air Act 1956. We already knew of the problem, from the hospital wards and doctors&#039; surgeries, and from the cemeteries that were lined with the bodies of people who had spent their lives sucking soot from industries that had no pollution controls. The Government did not set up soot swap shops, but said, &quot;You can&#039;t do it. We&#039;re giving you a period of notice after which those emissions are not going to be allowed.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-24_para18">
<a name="stpa_410">We changed the market rules. We did not abolish production in the UK or make the country any less competitive, but we cleaned up the markets. The Government intervened to change that by legislation and regulation. We have to reconsider how we use our tax powers, if we will not use legislative powers, to change the market again in order to clean it up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-24_para19">
<a name="stpa_411">As for where and how we do that, it can be done in collaboration with the developing world. If our sustainable technologies can fill today&#039;s soot gap or carbon gap, it gives us an enormous opportunity to offer as gifts to the developing world, not the technologies that we have banned or abandoned in our countries and then handed on under the pretext of aid, but the technologies that they, too, will need to rely on for clean production fit for the 21st century.

<p><a name="st_128"><a name="50316-25_spnew1"><b> Alan Simpson: </b> 
 I accept that and thank the right hon. Gentleman for raising that issue in the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. We may well need to factor that into our view of Britain&#039;s role in the global economy, specifically in relation to our commitments to the developing world. In some respects, there may be more mileage in that than he thinks. Today&#039;s announcement that the World Bank will be led by Paul Wolfowitz may seriously complicate what the Chancellor said about his plans for debt cancellation and poverty relief. Mr. Wolfowitz&#039;s record is such that he is more likely to cancel the poor than the poverty. We must recognise that we might need to look for a different leadership role in addressing the same challenges that we and the developing world will face, which brings me on to my next point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_412">We will also need a different contract with ourselves. Longevity will force us to go back and consider the fact that most of the tax that we pay in our lifetime is a redistribution from us to ourselves. It comes back to us in our old age and perhaps we pass it across to our children, in the way that our parents passed their taxes across to us in our childhood.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_413">In solidarity with ourselves throughout a longer lifespan, we have to ask how we pay more in our working years for the longer period that we hope to enjoy in our later lives, certainly in our retirement or older years. We need to have a more grown-up debate about that, not a cross-party slanging match, but a recognition of the real challenges for a society that expects to live longer. My only observations on that are cautionary ones about how we address the poverty challenge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_414">On the Labour Benches and in Downing street policies, a lot of reliance is placed on tax credits. The difficult thing about tax credits is that they rely heavily on a bureaucracy of means-testing that creates its own complications. I doubt that there is a Member of the House who has not had constituents coming to them with real problems and complications because they say that the Inland Revenue has got its calculations wrong on the tax credits that they were entitled to. They face bills for repayment to the Inland Revenue when they have no savings. So the tax credit system is a fragile approach, particularly to those who either have no savings or are in insecure and variable employment. We need to be careful about how much reliance we place on it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_415">Tax credits and means-testing are good at directing benefits to the poorest of the poor, but they also create anger and resentment at the injustice of tax on the margins. I invite the Chancellor to look at an additional principle, a golden rule, about our approaches to taxation and poverty. It would be a huge advantage if we were able to say, as a matter of principle, that we, as a Labour Government, will not tax the poor more heavily than we tax the rich. Att the margins of entitlement in the tax credits and benefits system, the clawback is about 80&nbsp;per cent. and above. It is the resentment that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 339</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>people acquire at those margins of clawback that divides neighbour from neighbour, street from street, and parents from grandparents and from their children. The consequence, even in pragmatic terms, is that it is very hard to get any political credit from tax credits. The credits, if there are any, tend to go to the Inland Revenue, but the blame almost certainly goes to the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_416">If we want to rebuild a sense of social solidarity, it will be much easier to do so, and certainly less bureaucratic, if we return to the principles of universal entitlement. Certainly, those marginal tax rates that affect the poor make the suggestion that we should have a top tax rate of 50&nbsp;per cent. on those earning more than &#163;100,000&nbsp;seem quite modest. If that were to raise the predicted &#163;6&nbsp;billion extra revenue stream for the Chancellor, and if he were to earmark the entirety of it to meet the cost of restoring the value of pensions and the earnings link, many on the Labour Benches would rise up and celebrate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_417">Many of us would also be perfectly happy if the additional &#163;5.6&nbsp;billion that could be raised simply by removing the ceiling on national insurance was earmarked, not just to meet tomorrow&#039;s pension requirements but to repay the pension entitlements of those who thought they had been saving throughout their lives and paying it into their pension funds, only to find that their pensions had been stolen by the collapse and theft of those funds. If we want to convince today&#039;s generations of young people that it is sensible and safe to save in pension schemes, at the very least we have to find ways of repaying those who have done precisely that only to find that their pensions have been stolen from them.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_418">Finally, I welcome the Chancellor&#039;s direct investments in schools and health. We all know that sizeable costs will have to be paid in the years to come that will be top-sliced as a result of going down the path of funding some of the investment through private finance initiatives and public-private partnerships. They are extremely expensive ways to lock us into long-term debt, before a single nurse, teacher, cleaner and so on begins to be employed. It would be much better to look again at our approach to pension savings and the use of those funds. In 1962, 51&nbsp;per cent. of pension funds were put into Government gilts or public bonds. When the 2002&nbsp;crash happened and &#163;250&nbsp;billion was wiped off the value of pension funds, only 17&nbsp;per cent. of those funds were in public bonds. We should put the public back into public investment. We must find ways of allowing and encouraging pension funds to become the source of direct public investment; public saving in public investments that will secure public pensions&#151;pensions that would not disappear in the bursting of a dotcom bubble, but would deliver an annual bonus not only in cash terms, but in terms of the quality of life that we in this country are able to enjoy.

When I first visited China in 1992, while wandering around Beijing I saw oxen in the streets pulling coal carts; when I last visited a couple of years ago, one had to travel further into the rural hinterland to see such scenes.

Stamp duty is forecast to raise &#163;9.4&nbsp;billion in 2004&#150;05, and today&#039;s announcement will hand back &#163;250&nbsp;million of that &#163;9.4&nbsp;billion. The revenue from stamp duty has increased dramatically since 1997.

To try to buy people&#039;s votes with a one-off &#163;200&nbsp;is incredible, risible and pathetic in the extreme.

<a name="stpa_442">Having talked about manufacturing, I salute the Opposition, particularly Conservative Members of the Opposition. They have done a good job today in difficult circumstances. It has been hard for them because economic growth is on forecast and we have great job creation. Some members of the Conservative party recognise that. The right hon. Member for Fylde got his figures right on public sector jobs in contradistinction to private sector jobs. There are 2.1&nbsp;million extra jobs under this Government, but the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) got the figures wrong and said that two thirds of those jobs were in the public sector. In round terms, the figures are 600,000&nbsp;out of 2.1&nbsp;million. That is slightly less than a third, and there is proportionately slower growth of employment in the public sector than in the private sector. Conservative Members should recognise that.

It is clear, however, that in most of the years between 1979&nbsp;and 1997&nbsp;when the Conservative party were in government, public sector net debt as a proportion of gross domestic product was higher than it has been for the past eight years under the Chancellor. For most of those 18&nbsp;years, it was higher than the Chancellor&#039;s projections for the next five years.

That is a worrying trend, because it affects our competitiveness. The Chancellor was right to focus on the competitive challenge from countries such as China and India. It is widely accepted that those countries are becoming global powerhouses and will prove a greater competitive threat to us in the years ahead.

This year, tax freedom day in this country fell on 30&nbsp;May. In 1964, by contrast, it fell on St. George&#039;s day, 23&nbsp;April. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 349</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>By 1970&nbsp;it had advanced to 26&nbsp;May, and it stayed around that date until the latter days of the last Conservative Administration in 1997, when it fell by a few days. Since then, under Labour, it has risen by six days and is set to rise further. The situation in the eurozone is even worse. Average citizens there must work right through to the end of June before they start to work for themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-27_para15">
<a name="stpa_462">In America, by contrast, tax freedom day this year fell on 11&nbsp;April, the earliest for 37&nbsp;years. It should be noted that&#151;contrary to what the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) said&#151;the US has some of the lowest taxes and unemployment rates of all the industrialised countries. Growth there is about 4.5&nbsp;per cent., while in the eurozone, which has some of the highest levels of unemployment and taxes, growth is about 1.5&nbsp;per cent. Growth in the eurozone has been consistently lower over the years. Britain is, as we know, somewhere in the middle. These figures confirm to me&#151;and, I hope, to the hon. Gentleman&#151;that there is indeed a link between lower taxes and greater prosperity. The greater our prosperity, the more we shall be able to fund our public services and look after the disadvantaged in our society over the longer term.

<p><a name="st_144"><a name="50316-28_spnew0"><b> Rob Marris: </b> 
 Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that we should emulate the USA economy, with its huge federal deficit spiralling out of control? Is he, in fact, suggesting that we should return to the policies that his Government espoused between 1992&nbsp;and 1997&nbsp;when they doubled the national debt? If he is, my constituents would like to know about it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_145"><a name="50316-28_spnew1"><b> Mr. Baron: </b> 
 Not at all. After all, the Chancellor&#039;s debt is already big enough; we do not need to add to it. The point that I am making is that there is a causal link between lower taxation and higher growth. Tax freedom day is one way of illustrating that. If we compare what is happening in the eurozone with what is happening in the United States, there is no doubt that growth rates are higher in the US, in large part because taxes there are lower. That link cannot be denied. If we keep increasing taxes, over the longer term we shall stifle our prosperity and our ability to help those who are most in need.

 May I make some progress? I shall allow the hon. Gentleman to intervene if I make sufficient progress, but I am conscious that at least one other hon. Member wishes to speak before we finish.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_463">My other concern about the Budget is that the Chancellor is committing himself to ever higher spending on essentially unreformed public services. The fact that they are largely unreformed is a key reason why taxpayers have seen too little benefit for their public services, considering the extent of the increase in spending. For example, recorded crime figures in Essex show that crime in general has risen by about 40&nbsp;per cent. during the course of the past five years, while violent crime has soared by 150&nbsp;per cent. Meanwhile, too many parents&#151;certainly in my constituency, and I suspect in others&#151;cannot get their children into their first choice school.

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_464">For me, the aspect that perhaps causes most concern is the health service. Despite the hard work and dedication of staff&#151;I accept that there have been some improvements&#151;the performance of the NHS falls well short of what could so easily be achieved if the Government just stepped back, stopped interfering and allowed the medical professionals to get on with the job.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_465">The Department of Health&#039;s own figures, for example, show that average waiting times, despite all the money that has been put into the NHS, have lengthened by five days since 1998. The increase is from 90&nbsp;days to 95. Those figures cannot be disputed, because they are the Department of Health&#039;s own.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_466">The problem is not a shortage of money, but the fact that not a lot of the money has reached front-line services. The reason for that is that the Government have bombarded the NHS with hundreds of targets, which not only can and do distort clinical priorities, but soak up a lot of the new money because they need monitoring. Again, it is no coincidence that the Department of Health&#039;s own figures show that the number of managers has increased at three times the rate of the number of new doctors and nurses. That is not to deny that we have new doctors and nurses, but that rate of increase for managers is a key reason why a lot of the money does not reach front-line services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_467">We would replace those targets with a set of clinical guidelines and entitlements drawn up by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence for all conditions. That would ensure that, for the first time, all patients were treated according to their clinical condition, not whether they were on a targeted list of some sort. One advantage of that would be that those suffering from long-term conditions would no longer be considered second-class citizens.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_468">I said at the beginning of my speech that no Budgets are all bad. There are some good elements in this Budget, but too few, I am afraid. One thing that I welcome, as do all Conservative Members, is the additional help for pensioners, although I must concur with my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evans): given that council tax increases have soaked up at least a third of the state pension increases over the last five or six years, and about 50&nbsp;per cent. of all pensioners are on a means-tested benefit of some sort, while 1.5&nbsp;million pensioners are not even claiming the pension credit to which they are entitled, the promised one-off payment of &#163;200&nbsp;is derisory.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_469">That promise falls well short of our promise to halve the council tax bill up to a maximum of &#163;500&nbsp;and, perhaps most importantly for pensioners, to re-link the state pension to earnings and break the link with inflation, which, over the longer term, will be far more beneficial to those pensioners than one-offs such as the Chancellor has given today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_470">The Budget is a missed opportunity to reverse the many tax increases of recent years and ensure that taxpayers&#039; money is wisely spent on our public services. Therefore, it is a missed opportunity for the Government. I certainly believe that taxpayers across the country are increasingly getting irritated by the extent of the tax increases and the fact that they are not seeing enough improvement in their public services for the money that is being spent. I think they will realise

<p><a name="st_148"><a name="50316-28_spnew4"><b> Mr. Andrew Tyrie  (Chichester) (Con):</b> 
 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I have before me a copy of the <i>Evening Standard</i>, which was bought at midday&#151;well before the Chancellor stood up to make his Budget speech. It contains a large chunk of the Budget, with a large number of measures apparently having been leaked. This is the latest in a long line of discourtesies to the House, but, far worse, it is also a serious breach of Treasury confidentiality before a Budget.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_471">I can only hope that this is unintentional. If it were planned, of course, it would be a very grave matter indeed: a previous Labour Chancellor resigned after he leaked the Budget. Given the apparent seriousness of this matter, are you prepared to allow a Treasury Minister&#151;there are some on the Treasury Bench&#151;to make a statement immediately to say what action will be taken to explain how this happened?
</p>








<p><a name="st_149"><a name="50316-28_spnew5"><b> Mr. David Laws  (Yeovil) (LD):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I have seen the same article in the <i>Evening Standard,</i> and the hon. Gentleman is right that it pre-announced a number of items announced in the Budget that could not possibly have been known to anyone outside the Treasury. That is in the context of an article that claims to have an exclusive interview with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, today, I presume. This is a serious matter, and it has been taken seriously by the House previously when Chancellors have, on occasion, resigned for leaking Budget secrets. Would it be appropriate for you to ask the Leader of the House to make a statement on this issue tomorrow?
</p>








<p><a name="st_150"><a name="50316-28_spmin0"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker  (Sylvia Heal): </b> 
 The matter that has been brought to my attention is obviously one of concern, but I cannot immediately do anything about it. Members of the Treasury Bench are present, it has been brought to their attention, and it will be brought to the attention of Mr. Speaker.

<p><a name="st_151"><a name="50316-28_spnew6"><b> John McDonnell  (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):</b> 
 May I thank the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron) for the brevity of his speech, which has allowed me to contribute?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_472">The debate has ranged from Confucius to Adam Smith to Karl Marx. It has ranged over China, India and various other areas of the world&#151;

 Indeed. The debate has considered the long-term prospects of the global economic system, the environment and a range of other matters. In the limited time that I have, I want to concentrate on the next few weeks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_473">Today&#039;s Budget contains much that is to be welcomed. The statement included commitments to the eradication of poverty, which the Chancellor has taken 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 352</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to the next stage by introducing additional benefits, especially for pensioners, such as the winter fuel allowance and council tax refund, and the welcome development of free bus travel for pensioners.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_474">My concern is that if this Budget is intended to motivate Labour voters to come out and vote for the Government, which I hope that it is and I welcome it in that respect, it does not go far enough. We need to go further to make clear to the traditional supporters of this Government what is needed and what a Labour Government can do to represent their interests. We are faced with an election in which the lowest turnout in the political history of this country is a prospect, and traditional Labour supporters might comprise the largest stay-at-home element. From pensioners to students, to the low-paid, to public sector workers, large sections of Labour&#039;s traditional heartland and base have been alienated from the electoral process, such as workers who have lost their pensions as a result of activities under the previous Government. My view is that we need to mobilise those latent Labour supporters before the election, and we should do it with a real Labour Budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_475">I therefore want to set out some of the things that we should be doing to build on the Chancellor&#039;s stated aims. In expenditure terms, we should raise the state pension to the guaranteed credit level&#151;&#163;105&nbsp;for a single pensioner and &#163;160&nbsp;for a couple. We should restore the link with earnings. The total costing for that is &#163;7.3&nbsp;billion, increasing over the next few years to more than &#163;9&nbsp;billion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_476">Because of those people who have lost their pension security, because of the exploitation, I think, of the private pensions industry, and because many employers have mismanaged schemes over the years and taken pension holidays, resulting in schemes that can no longer support the pension promised to those workers, we need to strengthen the financial assistance scheme that the Government introduced, which was a superb measure to which we committed ourselves at the previous election. We now know, however, that the &#163;400&nbsp;million set aside to protect and compensate those workers is insufficient. On current estimates, if we are to protect workers who have lost their pensions as a result of insolvency, the cost could be in the region of &#163;2.5&nbsp;billion. In the run-up to the general election, we should make the commitment to cover that cost. We should also promise students that we will abolish tuition fees and restore the maintenance grant&#151;at a cost of what? At a cost of &#163;1.3&nbsp;billion. The total of that expenditure is &#163;11.1&nbsp;billion.We could go further in tackling poverty if we increased the minimum wage to the level requested by the TUC&#151;&#163;6.60&#151;which is not exactly extravagant compared with what some of our constituents earn.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para14">
<a name="stpa_477">We are asked how we will pay for all this. My view is fairly straightforward. We could introduce a package of measures which I think would be popular. First, we could introduce a windfall tax on bank and oil profits. So far this year, the banks have reported global annual profits of &#163;28.6&nbsp;billion, and estimated annual profits of &#163;19.1&nbsp;billion subject to UK corporation tax. The oil companies have reported profits of &#163;38.3&nbsp;billion globally, and &#163;10.6&nbsp;billion subject to UK corporation tax. A total profit of &#163;29.7&nbsp;billion has been made this year by banks and oil companies. A windfall tax of, say, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 353</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>&#163;2.5&nbsp;billion would cover the cost of a one-off cash injection into the financial assistance scheme for pensioners. We could go further, and increase it to cover any future costs resulting from further insolvencies. A new tax band at 50&nbsp;per cent. for incomes above &#163;100,000&nbsp;would bring in &#163;5.2&nbsp;billion, covering the cost of the abolition of tuition fees and the restoration of maintenance grants.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para15">
<a name="stpa_478">We should also consider where expenditure has been growing. In recent years, there has been a massive increase in defence expenditure. By 2007&#150;08, we shall be spending &#163;7.2&nbsp;billion more on defence than we did in 2002, in real terms. We are doubling our defence expenditure under this Government. What we need to do now is at least return to the levels of 2002. If we did that, we would save &#163;3.5&nbsp;billion. Those measures alone would cover the costs of the raising of the pension, the restoring of the pensions link, the one-off cash injection, the abolition of tuition fees and the restoration of the maintenance grant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para16">
<a name="stpa_479">I welcome the Chancellor&#039;s reforms. I welcome the measures to tackle poverty, especially those targeted at children and pensioners. What we also need, however, is a Budget that motivates Labour supporters and fills them with enthusiasm to vote for the return of a Labour Government. That requires a real Labour Budget, based on tackling poverty and securing peace rather than expenditure on weapons, and benefits that are readily available rather than those which, unfortunately plunge more and more people into means tests and increase the costs of their administration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para17">
<a name="stpa_480">Some of today&#039;s debate has seemed not to be part of the real world that we inhabit in our constituencies. Over the past seven or eight years, the Government have lifted many families out of poverty. We have tackled unemployment. Many of us remember the early 1990s, when in street after street houses were repossessed because people were in negative equity. In many of our constituencies, unemployment reached 20&nbsp;or 25&nbsp;per cent. Poverty was rife. I compliment the Chancellor on the progress that he has made; but there is a long way to go&#151;which, I believe, means focusing our energies on securing peace, investing in tackling poverty among pensioners and investing in our education system. We must remove any disincentive for students to stay on at university, and that means the abolition of tuition fees and the restoration of the maintenance grant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-28_para18">
<a name="stpa_481">We need to consider other elements of public expenditure. The money wasted on privatisation proposals means that we are not gaining the best from the money being invested in our public services overall. Debate after debate&#151;on the probation and prison services, the railway industry or whatever&#151;means that we are wasting resources on privatisation rather than direct investment. I therefore urge the Government not to listen to the arguments put forward about Gershon reviews and so on and the cutting of 100,000&nbsp;civil service jobs, but to recognise that civil servants are delivering our manifesto commitments with dedication and commitment, and that they deserve our support.

<p><a name="st_156"><i>Lords Reasons for disagreeing to Commons Amendments considered.</i></p>








<a name="time_19">
<a name="50316-30_time0"><h5>7.14&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_157"><a name="50316-30_spmin0"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker  (Sylvia Heal): </b> 
 I must inform the House that a message has been brought from the Lords, as follows. The Lords disagree to certain of their amendments made by the Commons to the Constitutional Reform Bill, for which disagreement they assign their reasons. They agree without amendment to the remaining amendments proposed by the Commons. Copies of the Lords reasons and motions and amendments relating to them are available in the Vote Office. They will be debated as a single group.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_484"><i>Lords reasons</i>: Nos. 1A, 2A, 264A, 265A and 593A
</p>








<p><a name="st_158"><a name="50316-30_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs  (Mr. Christopher Leslie): </b> 
 I beg to move, That this House does not insist on its amendments Nos. 1, 2, 264, 265&nbsp;and 593, and beg to move amendments (a) to (e) in lieu thereof.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_485">Despite the clear decision taken by this House a few weeks ago in February, the House of Lords has yet again insisted that the newly reformed office of Lord Chancellor must for ever be a peer, and must for ever be a lawyer with 12&nbsp;years&#039; service or a High Court judge with at least two years&#039; service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_486">So much has now been agreed between both Houses on the Bill&#151;a new judicial appointments commission, a new UK supreme court and the ending of the judicial role of the Lord Chancellor&#151;that it seems bizarre for the Lords to have this continued attachment, first, to a statutory bar on anyone elected in this House from ever becoming Lord Chancellor, and secondly, from anyone with anything less than two years as a senior judge or 12&nbsp;years in legal practice from holding what in future will be a wholly ministerial post.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_487">Despite hours, days and months of protracted debate, their lordships seem to have suffered a bout of collective amnesia and forgotten that the core, essential nature of the role of Lord Chancellor is changed and reformed fundamentally by this Bill. The Lord Chancellor will no longer be a Law Lord or head of the judiciary, so there is no longer any justification to insist that a Lord Chancellor must never be someone elected to this House of Commons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_488">Is there any reason why the Lord Chancellor must always be unelected? The answer is no. The Lord Chancellor will deliver public services with a budget of more than &#163;3&nbsp;billion and there is a strong case that, from time to time, the House of Commons should be able to hold that person directly to account. In our constitution, a Government are formed from the largest party group of elected MPs in this House. With the reformed office of Lord Chancellor no longer a Law Lord nor necessarily tied to the Woolsack in the other place, logic dictates that, in future, any Prime Minister should be able to make appointments from either House of Parliament, and not be fettered from selecting Ministers who can be held democratically accountable.
</p>








<p><a name="st_159"><a name="50316-30_spnew0"><b> Peter Bottomley  (Worthing, West) (Con):</b> 
 This is a minor point, but the Minister said that we would be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 359</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>barring someone from this House from ever becoming Lord Chancellor. That was a slight slip. Although they cannot be Lord Chancellor while they are in this House, they could be if they went to the House of Lords. That has happened in the past.

<a name="time_20">
<a name="50316-30_time1"><h5>7.15&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="st_160"><a name="50316-30_spnew1"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 In which case they would not be able to be Lord Chancellor while they were in this House. My point is quite simple. It would be irrational to pickle for ever the Lord Chancellor in an unelected House when the ministerial post has changed. Although it has the title &quot;Lord Chancellor&quot;, it is a different post.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_489">Are there any good reasons why the Lord Chancellor must always be a senior judge for two years or a lawyer for 12&nbsp;years? No. Enshrining the new &quot;concordat&quot; that we have in the Bill between the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chancellor means that, henceforth, the Lord Chancellor will no longer be the head of the judiciary. The Bill removes the judicial functions from the post of Lord Chancellor, which fundamentally changes the nature of that role. There is nothing in the reforms that requires a Prime Minister to pick only a high judicial office holder or similar as one of his or her Ministers. Such a restriction could potentially narrow the field so greatly that perfectly eminent individuals&#151;perhaps senior law academics&#151;would be debarred by statute from appointment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_161"><a name="50316-30_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Kidney  (Stafford) (Lab):</b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on his deft finesse. Can he confirm that, although we will no longer have to choose a peer or lawyer, none of those qualifications is prevented from being taken into account by a Prime Minister in the future?
</p>








<p><a name="st_162"><a name="50316-30_spnew3"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 As usual, my hon. Friend hits the nail on the head. He is completely right to suggest that we will want to appoint the best person for the job. That is quite simply our intention, and part of the reason for our amendments. It may well be that, in practice, an individual with experience as a practising lawyer or, indeed, a Member of the House of Lords is the most appropriate and best person for the job. However, it is not inexorably the case that that will always happen.
</p>








<p><a name="st_163"><a name="50316-30_spnew4"><b> Mr. John Bercow  (Buckingham) (Con):</b> 
 I have said it often enough, but I am happy to repeat it: I am not a lawyer and I say that as a matter of pride. Nevertheless, I can see some merit in the occupant of the office of Lord Chancellor having legal experience. I would not want to cavil for a moment at the motives of the hon. Gentleman or his ministerial colleagues. If, however, what they have in mind is a cunning plan at some stage to make the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) the Lord Chancellor, why not say so?
</p>








<p><a name="st_164"><a name="50316-30_spnew5"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 I was wondering which constituency beginning with &quot;Sh&quot; the hon. Gentleman was about to suggest might provide a future occupant for the post. I, too, am not a lawyer, but I agree that it may well be reasonable to assume that a practising lawyer would be a good person to have as Lord Chancellor. I would not want to say for a moment that that might not be a good

<br>&nbsp;<br>qualifying criterion. However, I am saying that it would be wrong to enshrine in statute that, absolutely and in all circumstances, the post must be held by a lawyer with 12&nbsp;years&#039; experience or a senior judge with two years&#039; experience.
</p>








<p><a name="st_165"><a name="50316-30_spnew6"><b> Andrew Mackinlay  (Thurrock) (Lab):</b> 
 I totally agree with the Minister&#039;s propositions and will be glad to support him in the Division Lobby, which will be a great relief to him. Just looking ahead a little, is it not time that this potty Parliament&#151;I do not mean that disparagingly&#151;had Ministers of either House going into either House? That is the real issue. The architects of legislation should see it through all the procedures. They would not have to work off a brief or be parrots for others. If a Lord Chancellor&#151;

</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_490">My simple point is that we need to find a way through the impasse. Therefore, we have made a suggestion. We are content to say, in the Bill, that

</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_493">In proposing that compromise, we acknowledge the concern that there may otherwise be nothing to continue the convention that a suitably experienced person should undertake this senior office within the Government.

<p><a name="st_168"><a name="50316-30_spnew8"><b> Mr. Dominic Grieve  (Beaconsfield) (Con):</b> 
 I know that the Government specialise in meaningless words, but the hon. Gentleman must agree that if he reads the amendment in lieu, it amounts to nothing whatsoever. It is not worth the paper it is written on because the Prime Minister can still do exactly as he pleases.
</p>








<p><a name="st_169"><a name="50316-30_spnew9"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 It would have been possible for us simply to rebut the insistence that came from the other place, but we wanted, in the spirit of compromise, to answer those concerns that there was nothing in the Bill to enshrine a sense of convention that we should have suitably experienced individuals for this senior ministerial post. That is why we have put the compromise together in the form of an amendment in lieu.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050316/debtext/50316-31.htm"/>







<p><a name="st_170"><a name="50316-31_spnew0"><b> Mr. Kenneth Clarke  (Rushcliffe) (Con):</b> 
 Surely, if the Prime Minister wants to, he may do all those things when he appoints any Minister in any Department. Does the hon. Gentleman at least accept what I understand to be the argument in favour of having an experienced senior lawyer? Whereas in the generality of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 361</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>ministerial posts, people like us are appointed to a variety of posts as they get reshuffled, and operate as generalists and politicians in this House, in the case of the Lord Chancellor, we want someone absolutely imbued with a sense of the independence of the judiciary and the supremacy of the rule of law, and who is not just part of the party political cab rank to which he and I are proud to belong.
</p>








<p><a name="st_171"><a name="50316-31_spnew1"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 I am sure that the right hon. and learned Gentleman is not ashamed of that fact. My point is simple. The nature of the Lord Chancellorship is changing. It will be a ministerial post. He will no longer be head of the judiciary or a Law Lord. We do not need the unnecessary legal qualificatory bar or the requirement that he must always be unelected. Heaven forfend that an elected person should hold a ministerial post. It is as simple as that, and that is why we have suggested broad criteria that might be desirable for holding the office of Lord Chancellor. It will still, of course, be a senior ministerial post. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is right to suggest that we would not want to fetter the Prime Minister unduly, which is why we hope to strike the compromise that we have produced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_494">Although we give examples of the sort of experience that might be desirable, we remain of the view that it is wrong to be unduly or rigidly prescriptive, because circumstances can change and we cannot predict entirely who might be the best person for the job in the future. Nevertheless, our amendment is tabled in a spirit which more formally recognises the desirable qualities of the reformed office of Lord Chancellor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_495">The battles and disagreements about the changes to the nature of the Lord Chancellorship have been had, debated and are largely resolved. It is a different job, with different characteristics, requiring different qualities, and it is time to accept that fact rather than fight the old arguments again by proxy.


</p>








<p><a name="st_172"><a name="50316-31_spnew2"><b> Mr. A. J. Beith  (Berwick-upon-Tweed) (LD):</b> 
 The more the hon. Gentleman talks about the difference and the changed nature of the job, the more he risks putting off those peers who might, at the end of the day, accept that that does not need to be specified in statute. At least some of them are concerned primarily that the person who holds the office should continue one present feature of the job&#151;that its holder has the seniority, standing and view to enable him to challenge other Ministers when they seem to threaten the independence of the judiciary.
</p>








<p><a name="st_173"><a name="50316-31_spnew3"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman makes a worthwhile point: strength of character and integrity cannot simply be legislated for by saying that only people in the House of Lords or with 12&nbsp;years&#039; legal experience fulfil those criteria. In the compromise that we have proposed, we have tried to highlight the fact that we recognise that experience is required. The sorts of experience required are listed but they are not prescriptive. Our amendment sets out what is desirable, which is why we offer it as we do. It sets out in broad terms the qualities sought in candidates for the new lord chancellorship, and I hope that both Houses can accept that approach.
</p>








<p><a name="st_174"><a name="50316-31_spnew4"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I am sorry that the Minister is prolonging a dispute with the other place when we appear otherwise

<br>&nbsp;<br>to be close to reaching an end to an important piece of legislation, which, for various reasons, it is desirable that we see on the statute book if possible. However, the way the Minister is proceeding does not give me confidence that there will be a satisfactory resolution of the outstanding matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_496">The Minister starts on a completely false premise. He argued that, because the nature of the Lord Chancellor&#039;s job has changed, as provided for in the Bill, it is perfectly appropriate that the post should be held by any other Minister in the Commons. I must assume that he has read the Lords <i>Hansard,</i> where he would have seen that ever since debate on the measure started, one of the central issues that has had to be considered is the aversion voiced in the other place, and indeed by us, to the disappearance of the special role of the Lord Chancellor as a Minister different from other Ministers. The Government have been forced to acknowledge that during the passage of the Bill, even though they did not want to do so, because they have provided that the Lord Chancellor shall take a special oath of office; they have acknowledged that the Lord Chancellor should retain his historic title, marking him out from other Ministers; and most particularly&#151;because they certainly did not intend to do this when they first floated these reforms&#151;they have been forced to concede various guarantees about continued judicial independence that have been enshrined in the concordat. And who is the Minister who will oversee the protection of the concordat? It is the Lord Chancellor.

 Is not my hon.

He cannot be responsible for the appointment of judges either as a tick-the-box man, following the recommendation of the judicial appointments commission, or as a direct appointee, and then go back to private practice to appear in front of the very judges whom he may have appointed.

 The issue goes rather further than that. As I understand what the present Lord Chancellor is saying, not only may he himself wish to return to private practice when he comes to the end of his period as Lord Chancellor, but he will actually suggest&#151;I believe, on Monday&#151;that in future judges should be appointed as judges for periods of time and return to practice thereafter. That is something that fills me with enormous disquiet, but we shall have to return to that as and when that extraordinary announcement is made.

He can argue that he does not want it, but there is no logic behind the position that he has adopted. As the right hon.

The right hon.

I am troubled by the prospect of ending up with a Lord Chancellor who is fairly junior in the hierarchy of Ministers, who is present in this House and who wishes to have a further career in politics; such a person will inevitably be subject to much greater pressure not to uphold the rule of law or to defend the judiciary.

<a name="stpa_502">The Attorney-General, although he has an important role in advising the Government, is not present in Cabinet to uphold the rule of law, whereas the Lord Chancellor is, on a permanent basis. The Attorney-General is only present by invitation. All the more reason, therefore, why we should ensure that there is a lawyer of distinction within Government to perform precisely that role. If the Minister had simply suggested that we also consider a distinguished teacher of law in a university as an addition to the provisions on a qualifying practitioner, his argument would have had some force and I would have been prepared to consider it; but to remove the requirement to be a lawyer when the Lord Chancellor will have to perform a series of legal and quasi-judicial functions to maintain the independence of the judiciary is a very foolish&#151;and quite unnecessary&#151;development, which increases our anxiety that the only reason why the Government have done it is that they have already identified a Member of this House whom they wish to appoint to the job as soon as possible.

The Lord Chancellor does not just look after a Department but performs a particular role in government. He must remind Governments&#151;constantly in some cases and occasionally in others&#151;of their responsibilities towards that great inheritance of the rule of law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_527">I have no idea whether someone would be designated to perform that role if we changed the law. No one can be certain about that, although some of us have our suspicions. However, I am certain that the definition to which the Prime Minister must adhere when making the appointment means absolutely nothing at all. If definitions do not apply when the Prime Minister chooses the least important parliamentary secretary, he is not doing his job properly. Prime Ministers should choose Ministers who are good at the job and have the responsibilities and experience to discharge it. The present Prime Minister does not seem to have followed that very often, but it is a perfectly reasonable statement of how Prime Ministers are supposed to choose Ministers. There is nothing in the proposal that restricts the Prime Minister&#039;s choice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_528">It is not the Minister&#039;s fault that we feel strongly about this. It is the Prime Minister&#039;s fault, as he has presided over an Executive who have diminished the powers of the House, who resent the powers of the other House, and who have used their organisation of Government not for the better pursuance of government but for the creation of Ministries ad

<br>&nbsp;<br>hominem. They have also shown scant interest in the rule of law. If ever there was a time when the country needed in statute rules that, to some extent, restrict the cavalier manner in which the Prime Minister chooses his Ministers, it is now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_529">The new Department has a peculiar slogan, which I have mentioned previously. It is incorrectly punctuated and thoroughly dangerous because it states that the Department for Constitutional Affairs stands for, &quot;Justice, rights and democracy&quot;. Of course there is no mention of duties, responsibilities or obligations. No&#151;the Department is a specially honed Ministry, designed to present a specific political view of the world. I want the head of that Ministry to be at least sufficiently trained in the law and of sufficient standing to defend what should exist in it and what the slogan denies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-33_para13">
<a name="stpa_530">For that reason, I strongly support what their Lordships have done. In any event, I believe that all the rubbish, which is supposed to be a compromise but is a litany of the obvious, should be removed, and I trust that we shall stick to our guns.

<p><a name="st_200"><a name="50316-34_spnew0"><b> Mr. A. J. Beith  (Berwick-upon-Tweed) (LD):</b> 
 The Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs produced two reports on the Bill. The Government and the House of Lords together have implemented to a considerable extent the changes that we recommended. I welcome that. The Committee&#039;s track record is like that on most subjects: when we make recommendations, things tend to happen. That applies to the Bill. The rescue of the title and office of Lord Chancellor is a welcome change because it tries to deal with the genuine concern in many quarters that we might have ended up with a Minister who recognised no special obligation beyond that of running the Department well and delivering what the Prime Minister of the day wanted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_531">The concept of delivery often appears to be at variance with strong constitutional principles, which are normally maintained by convention, as the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) said. The retention of the office and the special Oath has partly allayed such concerns. However, of the two amendments that their Lordships have sent back to us, only one restricts the Prime Minister&#039;s ability to choose anyone he likes to be Lord Chancellor, and it also restricts that person to being a lawyer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_532">The amendment that requires the Lord Chancellor to be a Member of the House of Lords poses no restriction beyond that. Prime Ministers regularly decide that they would like someone to be a Minister who is not in the House of Commons and put that person in the House of Lords. Some rather good Ministers have emerged through that route, but it sits a little strangely with the way in which we do business at this end of the Building. Let us be clear: the amendment that restricts the Lord Chancellor to being a Member of the House of Lords does not restrict the kind of person who could fill that role. The only restriction that their Lordships propose in the other amendment is that the Lord Chancellor should be a senior lawyer.
</p>








<p><a name="st_201"><a name="50316-34_spnew1"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I accept that the Prime Minister can place whoever he likes in the Lords unless there is a reform of that ability. However, someone in the House of Lords 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 371</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>acquires greater independence than he would enjoy in this House because he is freed from the considerable political pressures that he might experience here.
</p>








<p><a name="st_202"><a name="50316-34_spnew2"><b> Mr. Beith: </b> 
 As it happens, I often observe the House of Lords from relatively close quarters&#151;I declare my interest as the husband of a Member of it. I find a wide range of independence and party loyalty among its Members, who include some good people in all parties and none.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_533">It appeared to the Committee and me that the primary concern was whether the person who exercises the office will have the standing and independence to defend the rule of law in Cabinet.
</p>








<p><a name="st_203"><a name="50316-34_spnew3"><b> Mr. Garnier </b> 
: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_204"><a name="50316-34_spnew4"><b> Mr. Beith: </b> 
 No, I am answering the point made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), whose concern I understand. However, I do not think that that concern is addressed by placing in the Bill a requirement that the person should be a Member of the House of Lords or a senior lawyer, even though I believe that the Government would be wise to look in both those directions for candidates, certainly in the near future, in seeking to get this position established, so that this matter can be settled in a reasonable way.
</p>








<p><a name="st_205"><a name="50316-34_spnew5"><b> Mr. Garnier </b> 
: Does the right hon. Gentleman appreciate that this Government are careless of the constitution not only in the way in which they create their legislation, but in the way in which they allow us time for debate? He has about 30&nbsp;seconds left before this debate finishes. Is not that an utter disgrace and a suborning of the parliamentary process&#151;

 First, let me ask the Minister to pass my sincere sympathy to his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), and to say how sad my hon. Friends and I were to hear his news.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_540">I am grateful for this opportunity to draw to the House&#039;s attention the serious anxieties of many of my constituents about the proposals in the consultation document &quot;Best Care, Best Place&quot;. I was grateful to the Secretary of State for seeing an all-party delegation from Mid-Sussex, whose members expressed very clearly their views on the problems involved in the proposals. He gave them a genuine and full hearing. I want the Minister to know that the issue features very strongly throughout my constituency&#151;in Burgess Hill, East Grinstead and Haywards Heath and in the royal areas&#151;and is followed with great interest in the wider Sussex area. I note the support of my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude) and my hon. Friends the Members for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) and for Wealden (Charles Hendry), who I hope may seek to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_541">Many of these ideas were aired only five years ago when there was another major consultation on a document entitled &quot;Modern Hospital Services for Central Sussex&#151;A challenge for us all&quot;. And a challenge they have proved to be, albeit an unresolved challenge. Five years on, here we are again in another period of instability and uncertainty for my constituents and for the patients and staff of the Princess Royal hospital in Haywards Heath.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_542">The Princess Royal is a busy modern purpose-built hospital with 339&nbsp;beds. During last year 10,700&nbsp;people were treated as emergency admissions and 3,072&nbsp;as elective admissions. In its admirable and busy out-patient department, 79,890&nbsp;people were looked after. The accident and emergency department&#151;a subject of continuing and great local anxiety&#151;cared for 30,734&nbsp;people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_543">The Princess Royal has a total staff of 1,331. All those excellent people are dedicated to their work and to those for whom they care, and I pay the warmest tribute to them for the magnificent service that they provide. The Minister will understand that they are extremely anxious about the future, and deeply concerned about the continuing upheaval caused by the endless rearrangements and the lack of stability of service. Many of them know what is right for Mid-Sussex, and think little of what is proposed. I want the Minister to reassure those people tonight, and to give some certainty to what the future holds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_544">I say that because I want the Minister to appreciate that the Princess Royal is an excellent NHS hospital that is greatly valued in its local community. As I said in a debate five years ago on 29&nbsp;November 2000&nbsp;and again on 6&nbsp;November 2001&nbsp;in the House, we are truly proud 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 377</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>locally of the service that it provides, the skills and excellence of its staff and the solid best efforts of its management. We understand the anxiety of the wider community to have the services that they really need and to which they are entitled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_545">I should also tell the Minister that there are some&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fundamental questions relating to joined-up government which must be addressed and which, in my opinion, have not been dealt with well in the document. The Government&#039;s new housing proposals require all of us in West Sussex and elsewhere in Sussex&#151;particularly Mid-Sussex&#151;to absorb a substantial number of new houses. The local infrastructure to support those plans simply does not exist&#151;a problem that I have drawn to the attention of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and the Minister for Housing and Planning in parliamentary questions, debates and extensive correspondence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_546">The provision of an extensive social infrastructure, including health services, is of the first importance. The Government&#039;s plans could include about 45,000&nbsp;extra people in Mid-Sussex. I therefore need an assurance from the Minister that the plans take into account the substantial extra growth being imposed on Mid-Sussex by his Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_547">Let me now deal with the consultation document and my constituents&#039; views. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs and my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham&#151;indeed, I think all of us&#151;understand that the national health service has always evolved, and we accept that that is right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_548">We accept the movement of some services between the Princess Royal hospital in Haywards Heath and the Royal Sussex County hospital in Brighton if it is based on sound and substantial clinical grounds. But my constituents share strong and determined views concerning the irreducible minimum of services that must be retained at the PRH. There is the deeply held perception locally that a remorseless drift of services away from Haywards Heath towards the Royal Sussex County hospital in Brighton is taking place, and that is what is causing such strong local anxiety.
</p>








<p><a name="st_212"><a name="50316-35_spnew2"><b> Mr. Francis Maude  (Horsham) (Con):</b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate and I entirely support everything that he says. Does he share my view that the uncertainty that his and my constituents feel about the current arrangements and consultation is amplified by the dithering and procrastination that surrounded the movement of the hospital services on which many of my constituents depended away from Crawley to Redhill? Such procrastination has led to a state of crisis at the East Surrey hospital in Redhill. I now have more complaints about the health service than I have had at any stage in my parliamentary career. Does he share my view that this matter has to be dealt with in the short term with certainty and clarity, and that in the longer term, the answer is to build a new hospital at Pease Pottage&#151;a prospect that was dangled before the public before the last election, and then promptly taken away afterwards?
</p>








<p><a name="st_213"><a name="50316-35_spnew3"><b> Mr. Soames: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend is quite right. The shambles and debacle of the Crawley and Redhill situation is causing the gravest concern to us all because 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 378</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>it inspires such little confidence in the NHS decision-making process. As to creating a new hospital at Pease Pottage, that will inevitably have to be considered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_549">Paediatrics was removed from the PRH a year ago and transferred to Brighton without any proper consultation. We must have today from the Minister some direct assurance that this sort of thing will not happen in future, and that serious thought will be given to preventing services from being stripped from the PRH. Secondly, the accident and emergency department was ludicrously threatened with closure five years ago, but following absolute uproar in Mid-Sussex and a vigorous campaign led by myself, the district council and our excellent local paper the<i> Mid Sussex Times&#151;</i>known as &quot;The Middy&quot;&#151;the decision was overturned and the department, I am grateful to say, has continued.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_550">But because of the ill-handling of this matter and of the very issue raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham&#151;the current unhappy debacle at the Crawley hospital, which has now been downgraded to a walk-in accident and emergency centre, and the extremely unsatisfactory situation at Redhill&#151;confidence in NHS decision making locally remains very low. We urge Ministers to take a personal interest in the way in which this matter will be handled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-35_para13">
<a name="stpa_551">Despite the assurances that have been given, there remains the real concern that our accident and emergency department at the PRH is to be downgraded. We cannot have this and we will not allow it. I am especially anxious about whether a hospital that does not treat acute trauma or provide emergency surgery will be viable in future. Again, we need assurances, particularly given that on our doorstep is Gatwick airport, and the threat of a major incident or terrorist attack.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-35_para14">
<a name="stpa_552">The third point of great concern is the question of vital maternity services and the possible reduction in neo-natal and maternity services at the PRH. I believe it absolutely essential that these services be retained, and that women should be able to have their babies in Haywards Heath. I understand that the trust is trying to recruit advanced neo-natal nurse practitioners. They are as rare as hen&#039;s teeth, and there is understandable scepticism about the idea that they can be recruited. We need assurances on this question and an understanding that it would be wholly unacceptable to the growing Mid-Sussex population&#151;in East Grinstead, Haywards Heath, Burgess Hill and the rural areas&#151;if they were unable to access essential services locally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-35_para15">
<a name="stpa_553">There are many serious difficulties that need to be dealt with concerning transport. Access to the Royal Sussex County hospital in Brighton is appalling, as is the traffic congestion that surrounds it. There is very real concern in Mid-Sussex&#151;particularly in East Grinstead, which is to the north of the constituency&#151;that transport times would be unacceptable in an emergency. There are also important questions that must be settled relating to car parking, staff transport and the wholly inadequate public transport infrastructure. We will look to the trust to build on the work that is already being done through the Mid-Sussex transport group.

 I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate and commend 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2005 : Column 379</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>him for the way in which he has led this initiative and campaign. Is he aware that almost 20,000&nbsp;of my constituents in and around Uckfield are dependent on the Princess Royal hospital? So there is tremendous interest in the accident and emergency unit&#151;for them, it is a 20-minute journey to Tunbridge Wells and a half-hour journey to Brighton or Eastbourne&#151;and the survival of that hospital is fundamental to my constituents as well as to his.
</p>








<p><a name="st_215"><a name="50316-36_spnew1"><b> Mr. Soames: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point, and I hope that the Minister will deal with it. The kernel of the argument is that what is proposed, if the services were to be downgraded, would be dangerous, unsatisfactory and not acceptable to his constituents or to mine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_554">There is also the question of the future of Hurstwood Park hospital, which is in the grounds of the PRH. Some detailed work needs to be done on the future location of those services&#151;of course, they must be tied into the medical school part of the trust&#151;but it seems strange that, with &#163;2&nbsp;million newly invested in that facility, it could be closed and moved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_555">On a separate, already very important matter, the consultation paper does not adequately deal with the needs of the increasing number of elderly residents in Mid-Sussex. Their needs must be addressed in the detail that they deserve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_556">In my view, the management of the trust need to be less Brighton-centric and to demonstrate a determination to run a split-site operation more obviously equitably. They need to show a greater tangible commitment to the PRH, not only in the services, but by word and deed. The PRH needs to be reassured of the wholehearted commitment of the medical school. That will require an act of will and leadership, of which we need to see much more.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_557">Finally, may I raise one matter with which my hon. Friends the Members for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) and for Wealden will wish to be associated? The Minister will be aware that in my meeting with the Secretary of State for Health on 28&nbsp;February, I mentioned to him our concerns about the excellent and unique Queen Victoria hospital in East Grinstead and raised the very important issue of the national burns review. The Secretary of State has since called for further information from officials because I hope and believe that he now realises that the proposals made by the national burns review are not substantial enough to be subjected to public consultation. The robustness of the data used to make recommendations from the review has been criticised independently, and the process appears to have lacked any form of serious transparency and taken little account of patients&#039; needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_558">If the Queen Victoria hospital is not a centre able to treat the most seriously burned patients, many will face long transfers to other hospitals and may be exposed to risks for which there is no clinical necessity. If the Queen Victoria hospital has to downgrade in any way, its national emergency responsibility will also be seriously affected. The future development would compromise its world-class research. Staff morale is being gravely undermined by the insensitivity with which the matter is

<p><a name="st_216"><a name="50316-36_spnew2"><b> Mr. Howard Flight  (Arundel and South Downs) (Con):</b> 
 I echo the sympathy for the Minister&#039;s colleague expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames).
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_559">The plans for a new hospital at Pease Pottage were effectively shelved some time ago, so it is crucial that the Princess Royal hospital should remain viable. It serves the east end of my constituency and is shared with Mid-Sussex and Wealden. It is an excellent hospital and is well supported in the community. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex has set out most clearly, the concerns are, in essence, that a period of instability will lead to the running down of the hospital and possibly to a fate similar to that experienced at Crawley.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_560">The background is that five years ago there was a fight to save the accident and emergency services and overcome the unwise plans of the time, and that the paediatrics unit has recently closed. Specifically, as has been pointed out, first, we seek confirmation that the A and E unit will not be downgraded, and that it is viable without facilities to treat trauma and without emergency surgery facilities. That is crucial not only because Gatwick is up the road, but because transport to Brighton is inadequate and there are severe delays at busy times.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_561">Secondly, we seek confirmation that the maternity unit has a secure future and that the recruitment of advanced neonatal nurses is going to be a viable solution to the problem. As has been pointed out, Hurstwood Park provides crucial facilities in the area and has just had a major investment. We seek confirmation that if there is eventually a move to coincide the location with the university hospital, it will be well planned and a good way off in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_562">At the heart of the issue is the new joint trust arrangement on split sites, which could work better. The management is based in Brighton, and there is at least a vulnerability to declining staff morale at the Princess Royal against the background of what is perceived to be a less than secure future. Unless and until there are firm plans and commitments for a major new hospital&#151;for example, at Pease Pottage&#151;it is crucial that this hospital remain viable and successful. As has been pointed out, the number of people that it may be expected to serve is going to grow, and it would be a disgrace if a failure to grasp these key issues led to the hospital repeating Crawley&#039;s experience.

Friend the Secretary of State a few weeks ago&#151;that the best people to make decisions about the NHS in his area are those closest to the front line.

<p>
<a name="50316-36_para13">
<a name="stpa_567">I would be failing in my duty if I did not put some of these important local issues into a wider national context. For the period 2003&#150;04&nbsp;to 2007&#150;08, expenditure on the NHS in England will increase significantly: on average by 7.2&nbsp;per cent a year over and above inflation. For the three years from 2005&#150;06&nbsp;to 2007&#150;08, NHS spending will increase on average by 7.1&nbsp;per cent. a year over and above inflation&#151;a total increase of 23&nbsp;per cent. in real terms over the period. Over this period, the total amount spent on the NHS in England will rise from &#163;69&nbsp;billion in 2004&#150;05&nbsp;to &#163;92&nbsp;billion in 2007&#150;08.

<p>
<a name="50316-37_para0">
<a name="stpa_570">The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex raised an important point about population growth in his part of the beautiful county of Sussex. I simply say that allocations to primary care trusts are capitation based, so they take place on a weighted population basis. If there is projected population growth in Sussex, as I am sure there is, we have a proper mechanism by using population projection data from the Office for National Statistics to make sure that the three-year projections for allocations properly reflect the increased likely use of health care and social services by expanded populations. In that regard, I can certainly give him the assurance that he seeks. That is why increases of the magnitude that I have described are going into his county.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_571">The hon. Gentleman raised several specific issues. In order to make the best possible use of the resources that we have made available and to achieve our goal of providing the highest-quality services, the NHS is, in many respects, changing the way in which it delivers its services to the public. We in the House generally recognise that hospital services need to change if we are to continue to fulfil patients&#039; needs and improve access. It is a disservice to the public to try to suggest otherwise. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has not fallen into that particular trap.

<p>
<a name="50316-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_572">As I said earlier, it is now the responsibility of the local NHS&#151;following &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot;, the initiative that we took a few years ago&#151;to manage and improve these services. In the central Sussex area, including Brighton and Mid-Sussex, the NHS has already started to look ahead to plan and develop health services fit for the future. A wide-ranging public consultation, led by the Mid Sussex primary care trust, has taken place across the local health community into how best to improve the quality and range of health care services. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman met my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to discuss it just last month.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_573">The proposals outlined in the consultation will certainly alter the pattern of health services by seeking to deliver as much care as possible closer to people&#039;s homes, but also by ensuring that specialist in-patient care is available to those who need it. This consultation has had the full support of the Surrey and Sussex strategic health authority, and was developed with all the NHS organisations in the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50316-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_574">The consultation period for the proposals has now ended and the local NHS organisations involved expect to make decisions based on the outcomes of those consultations, taking into full account the views of the joint overview and scrutiny committee over the next few weeks.

<a name="stpa_576">I understand that the local NHS held a further event last week, at which an invited audience of key local stakeholders reviewed feedback on the consultation, looked at the emerging issues and agreed some action for taking public involvement and engagement forward. By the end of March, a report setting out the feedback and the preferred way forward will be presented to the chief executives of all the health organisations concerned. I understand that the report will be discussed in detail by each individual board before any decisions are made, subject to detailed implementation plans and, where necessary, capital bids.

<a name="stpa_577">The hon. Gentleman raised a number of issues to do with the challenges facing his local acute trust, and expressed concerns about his local hospital, the Princess Royal hospital in Hayward&#039;s Heath. I am assured by those managing the service locally that the hospital has secured its future following its merger with hospitals in Brighton in 2002. I am also advised that it will benefit from the plans for an elective orthopaedic centre on the site in 2006. This will receive patients from the whole Brighton and Mid-Sussex area, and will provide a highly efficient service, with reduced risk of cancellations. I hope that, in some small way, that deals with his point about a Brighton-centric NHS.

<a name="stpa_578">Furthermore, it is my understanding that the consultation proposals offer a positive future for the Princess Royal hospital. Indeed, it has identified the continuation of accident and emergency services there as a fixed point on the campus, which was one of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s principal concerns. There is no question of A and E services being downgraded or becoming a minor injuries unit. That is not going to happen.

<a name="stpa_579">The Princess Royal hospital has, in fact, benefited from many developments since 2002, and more than &#163;8&nbsp;million has been invested in improving local services on the site, including an extra operating theatre, increased staffing levels, a new hysteroscopy suite, enlarged teaching facilities to help to accommodate its major role in the new medical school for Sussex and the

<a name="stpa_580">The hon. Gentleman also asked about the national burn care group and its work on developing proposals. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State wrote to him only a few days ago saying that the work is being led by the national health service. No final decisions have been made regarding the development of burn care centres. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that any proposals for change will be submitted to a full public consultation process, probably in the summer later this year. It is important to ensure that the NHS has sufficient capacity to deal with those serious injuries, and we recognise that we need to do more work to ensure that it has that capacity.

<a name="50316-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_581">I have listened carefully to the concerns raised by right hon. and hon. Members. It is our policy that primary care trusts, in partnership with other local NHS trusts and the strategic health authority, should decide the priorities for the NHS locally. That is where specific local knowledge and expertise lies, and it is not appropriate, particularly given Opposition Members&#039; strictures about micro-management by Ministers, for us to decide on the direction of travel and how services should be configured locally. We have made that clear. It is right that the local NHS should do that.

<a name="50316-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_582">I agree that a number of the problems facing the hon. Gentleman&#039;s local area require long-term solutions, and the relevant PCTs and the hospital trust have consulted about the future of all health services, including those at the Princess Royal hospital. I do not wish to prejudge the local consultation process, but as I said, it is my understanding that it offers a positive future for the Princess Royal hospital, but that some changes, to which he alluded, will be necessary. In particular, there will be a greater emphasis on providing care closer to where people live, with more investment in local primary and community services. I hope that he welcomes that.

<a name="stpa_583">I will, of course, ensure that local health officials see the <i>Official Report</i> of our proceedings and take note of the hon.
