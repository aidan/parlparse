 (Con): Which categories of children attending the proposed trust schools she expects to be entitled to (a) free and (b) subsidised school transport. [58779]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60316-01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Phil Hope): </b> 
 All children attending their nearest suitable maintained school receive free transport if the journey is over three miles, or over two miles for children under the age of eight. In future, primary pupils from low-income families will receive free transport if they live more than two miles from school. Secondary pupils from low-income families will receive free transport to any one of their three nearest suitable schools if the journey is between two and six miles.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60316-01_spnew0"><b> Tony Baldry: </b> 
 Every day, a number of parents in Bicester exercising parental preference hire a coach to take their children to Marlborough school in Woodstock, which is more than six miles away. In a semi-rural area such as mine, people who wish to express parental preference can do so only if they pay for it, which is unfair for everyone. It is unfair for parents who cannot pay, and it is unfair for parents who have to pay to exercise preference. With respect, the Education and Inspections Bill will not change that situation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60316-01_spnew1"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The Bill includes a number of important measures that will help families with transport. The cost of transport is a barrier, particularly for low-income families, which is why the Bill extends the entitlement to free school transport. There is a general duty on local authorities to assess all pupils&#039; travel needs; local authorities&#039; current focus is on 7 per cent. of pupils. When the new travel plans in the Bill&#151;another measure for disadvantaged pupils against which, regrettably, Liberal Democrats voted last night&#151;come into force more families will benefit from the opportunity for their children to attend the school of their choice.

The bottom 200 state schools have the highest number of children receiving free school meals and the highest number of children with statements. Does the Minister agree that the grand objective of trust schools is to achieve a better social mix, not just in trust schools but across all schools?

 My hon. Friend makes an important point about the nature of social segregation in different schools.

The forums and, indeed, the school adjudicator can measure and assess the problems described by my hon. Friend. Indeed, the schools commissioner will produce a report every two years to show what progress has been made in reducing those problems.

<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="60316-01_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Schools  (Jacqui Smith): </b> 
 The chief inspector&#039;s latest annual report shows that the quality of science teaching and learning is good or better in nearly three quarters of secondary schools. We are improving that teaching and learning further by making the school science curriculum more engaging; improving teacher recruitment; providing more and better professional development; and introducing a new statutory entitlement to study science programmes leading to at least two GCSEs.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60316-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Crabb: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for her reply. Yesterday, the CBI warned of the erosion of core science and engineering skills in this country, describing the decline in the number of science graduates as a car crash in slow motion. Does the Minister agree that the situation will not be turned around without serious improvement in the quality of science teaching in British schools? When 40 per cent. of all chemistry lessons are taught by non-chemists, is it any wonder that the country is not producing enough 18-year-olds with a love of, or an interest in, science?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60316-01_spnew5"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is quite right, as are the CBI and others, to identify the importance for the economy of high numbers of science understanding and science graduates. That is why, for example, the introduction of specialised diplomas with an emphasis on applied science in areas such as engineering is important and why we need to continue working, as he suggested, on the quality of teachers. It is reassuring 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1585</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that, whereas in 1997&#150;98 we recruited 2,790 people to teacher training places for science, in 2004&#150;05 the number increased to 3,460.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60316-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Lancaster: </b> 
 May I declare an interest, as recorded in the Register of Members&#039; Interests? Given the Minister&#039;s previous answer, what message does she think is sent to our sixth-form science students when they discover during national science week that the chemistry department of the five-star Sussex university is to be closed?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60316-01_spnew7"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 Like other higher education institutions, the University of Sussex is, rightly, an autonomous organisation. Students in the south-east will be reassured to know not only that the number of home full-time undergraduates studying chemistry has risen by 6 per cent. since 1999 but that the Higher Education Funding Council, working with the surrounding universities, particularly Reading, Southampton and Surrey, has already ensured that the places lost at Sussex will be provided at those other universities.

 (Lab): I, for one, am very grateful for the extensive work that we have done to renew science facilities in schools. However, the reality is that the number of young women who are entering engineering apprenticeships is pitifully low, because we do not have sufficient resources aimed at promoting and taking women into work. What will my right hon. Friend do to address that very low figure and try to improve the number of women going into engineering apprenticeships?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60316-01_spnew9"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has a strong background in this area and has pushed me on numerous occasions on precisely that issue. There is the work that I know that she supported in respect of women in science and engineering, the task of ensuring that there are role models for young people, the introduction of the specialised engineering diploma that I mentioned previously and the task of ensuring that, as we improve information, advice and guidance for young people, we enable, for example, young women to undertake taster courses in areas such as engineering so that they realise that engineering is not only something for them, but needs their talents.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60316-01_spnew12"><b> Sarah Teather  (Brent, East)</b> 
 (LD): The Department&#039;s own research has pointed to a crisis in specialist physics and chemistry teachers in deprived areas in particular. The Institute of Physics has called on the Government to adopt recruitment targets in the individual sciences rather than science as a whole. Why have they not done that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60316-01_spnew13"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 I refer the hon. Lady to the figures that I gave previously, which show that the Government have made considerable progress in increasing recruitment to initial teacher training of science teachers. I also refer her 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1586</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to the important work&#151;the &#163;51 million project&#151;being carried out jointly by the Government and the Wellcome Trust to develop science learning centres around the country, which are contributing to the continuing professional development of science teachers throughout the country.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60316-01_spnew14"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): In the science curriculum in mainstream British secondary schools from September, creationism is to be taught alongside Darwin&#039;s theory of evolution. Does the Minister welcome that, as students should understand the context in which scientific ideas arise and reinterpretation of empirical evidence can generate scientific controversy?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60316-01_spnew15"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 In fact, neither creationism, nor intelligent design are taught as subjects in schools and they are not specified in the programme of study for the science curriculum. In fact the national curriculum for science clearly sets out that pupils should be taught that the fossil record is evidence for evolution and that that is a fact. As my hon. Friend identifies, there will be opportunities, perhaps in RE lessons or in science, to consider scientific controversy and the issue of creationism may come up in that context, but it is not, of course, a factual element of the science curriculum.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60316-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Nick Gibb  (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</b> 
 (Con): In the spirit of the consensus that was developed yesterday, I thought that, together, we might tackle science teaching in our schools. One of the unforeseen consequences of the Conservative Government&#039;s making science compulsory was the proliferation of the double science award GCSE, which is now almost universal in the state sector and likely to remain so even with the Minister&#039;s reforms. For someone going on to study three sciences at A-level, that means a reduction of a third in the amount of science that he or she studies at GCSE. Does she agree that we need much better science teaching in our comprehensives and far more students studying the three separate sciences at GCSE?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60316-01_spnew17"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 I was not so involved in the consensus yesterday that the hon. Gentleman is talking about&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I voted for the Second Reading of our Labour Bill, yes&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> And Conservatives voted for a Labour Bill, as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o1">It is important that we ensure, in the way in which science is taught, particularly at key stage 4, that we provide our young people with both the knowledge and the enthusiasm to continue to study science at a later stage. That is why one of the things that we voted for yesterday was an entitlement for every pupil to study at least two science GCSEs. Part of the way in which that entitlement will be represented in schools will include the study of three separate science subjects. I am confident that, whether we are talking about the science and advanced science option, or the three single science options, that will provide young people with the knowledge and enthusiasm to carry on studying science at a later stage in greater numbers.

<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60316-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Ruth Kelly): </b> 
 There are no targets for the number of trust schools to be established in the next four years. This is about schools making decisions that are right for them and their children in order to raise standards. It will be for individual schools to decide whether they want to acquire a trust, what form that trust should take, and how the trust will help to improve outcomes for pupils.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60316-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Prentice: </b> 
 Given that the Conservative party will try to amend the Bill to take it back to its White Paper stage and encourage the development of independent trust schools, is it not as plain as a pikestaff&#151;I say this gently to my right hon.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60316-02_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 No. I thought for a moment that I was going to agree with my hon. Friend on something, but sadly not. I can assure the House that I will never compel a school to become a trust school, although it should be an option for a local authority, where a school is failing, to look at whether a trust is one way in which it could raise standards. The Labour party does not agree with the Conservative party, which in the minority report of the Education and Skills Committee insisted that all schools should be compelled to become trust schools.

<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="60316-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Rob Wilson  (Reading, East)</b>

</p>





<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="60316-02_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I did wonder when I read the minority report whether the hon. Gentleman and his friends had really understood the proposals, and now I am confirmed in the fact that they do not. There is nothing in the proposals on trusts, or indeed in the White Paper, that gives trust schools additional freedom or flexibility on teachers&#039; pay. Teachers&#039; pay will still be set in exactly the framework of terms and conditions, set nationally and negotiated with the teacher unions, that community schools follow now.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="60316-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Barry Sheerman  (Huddersfield)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): May I help my right hon. Friend with the question of what is as plain as a pikestaff? It is as plain as a pikestaff that any incoming Government of a party political complexion different from ours can change whatever they like in education&#151;that is the truth of the matter. Can we just concentrate on the question about the partnerships of trusts that can be of great benefit to schools? There is already a track record of very good relationships with foundations and outside partners that are good for the schools, good for the students and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1588</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>good for the future of education. Can we not nail the myth that partnership is bad and an inward-looking school is good? That is not the case.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="60316-02_spnew7"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I completely agree with my hon. Friend that schools should be looking outward to their communities, looking to establish deep and lasting partnerships, both with other schools and indeed with external partners, such as universities, FE colleges and business foundations, where they can make a difference to raising standards for their pupils. That is precisely what the trust school proposal in last night&#039;s Education and Inspections Bill was about.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="60316-02_spnew8"><b> Mr. David Willetts  (Havant)</b> 
 (Con): There is a slight flavour of the morning after the night before, and I detect that a squabble about paternity has already broken out. May I assure the Secretary of State that we will be very responsible in our approach to raising and encouraging trust schools, which have now been given birth to? I realise that she does not like giving predictions, but will she at least consider offering some encouragement to schools to become trust schools&#151;it is, after all, a policy that has now had widespread support on both sides of the House?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o30"><a name="60316-02_spnew9"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The best encouragement for schools to become trust schools is to see what works. To see that, one has only to talk to head teachers, who already work with foundations and trusts, who can explain what difference that makes to pupils and to raising standards in their schools. It is my view that the more schools see that working in practice, the more will be interested in trusts, but it is right to have a voluntary approach because in the end head teachers know best what is in the interests of raising standards.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o31"><a name="60316-02_spnew10"><b> Mr. Mark Todd  (South Derbyshire)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree that further work needs to be done on defining the risks that might be encountered by small primary schools in converting alone to a trust model? The evidence of foundation status and, before that, grant-maintained status in my constituency indicates that there are significant risks that governing bodies may not be aware of at the time.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="60316-02_spnew11"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I know that my hon. Friend has deep concerns about the matter, and many in the House were scarred by the experience of grant-maintained schools, but I can give him the assurance that thetrust school model is the antithesis of the grant-maintained school model, in that trusts remain as local authority-maintained schools, where local authorities are responsible for the financial control and for ensuring adequate financial controls in schools&#151;indeed, they fund the schools and can withdraw the delegated funding where they consider that there is an issue to resolve, as well as being responsible for ensuring adequate standards.

 Both the Prime Minister and I have held a number of discussions with a range of stakeholders about the opportunities that trusts can offer.

All these organisations may have much to offer in raising standards and improving outcomes, especially for pupils in our most disadvantaged areas.

 May I assure the Secretary of State that the Conservative-led Isle of Wight council, which inherited from 20 years of Liberal Democrat control an education system that even the Liberal Democrats admitted was failing, is looking with enthusiasm on trust schools as a means of reversing that failure? Will she assure me that the regulation-making powers contained in the Bill, particularly in clauses 7, 8, 12, 17, 19, 22, 24 and 25 will be used with a light touch so as not to put off charities and other organisations offering trust status to schools?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o35"><a name="60316-02_spnew13"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. We want a light-touch system. Where a school considers it to be in its interest to acquire a trust, it should have the opportunity to do that. That will help the school deepen its existing partnerships with its specialist schools relationships, and enable schools to build federations and collaboratives of schools working together to raise standards, which is particularly important in the light of our commitment to enable every young person from the age of 14 to study vocational education&#151;yet again, a measure delivered by the Education and Inspections Bill.

 I can certainly give my hon. Friend those assurances. It will be laid down in legislation that trusts must be charities operating on a not-for-profit basis and overseen by the Charity Commission, as well as the local authority. In no sense will schools outside the trust school regime be disadvantaged by not being trust schools. They will be funded on exactly the same basis as any other local school, in both revenue and capital terms&#151;yet again, a sharp contrast with the GM school policy operated by the Conservatives when they were in government.

 I am grateful for that reply, but not for the answer itself. Colleges are waiting for a response. The Minister is aware of my concerns about education funding in Bournemouth in general. My question is specifically to do with the fact that staff salaries at further education colleges, such as Bournemouth and Poole college, are often significantly lower than those of staff teaching the same subjects in a school. I know that the Government have taken some initiatives, but as long as teachers are receiving &#163;2,000 a year more at a school than at further education colleges, colleges will be unable to compete in recruiting and retaining staff&#151;

 Let me be clear that negotiations are a matter for colleges and the trade unions. No college in the country would thank the Government for intervening directly on the issue. It all comes back to funding. Since 1997 the Government have increased funding to the further education sector by 48 per cent. in real terms, which compares favourably with the 14 per cent. real-terms cut that took place in the five years running up to 1997. We envisage that with those increased resources, greater flexibility as regards their use and a longer-term funding framework, colleges should be able to address the structural barriers&#151;

</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for his question and know that he takes these issues very seriously. When my right hon.

 The Minister will be aware of the enormous frustration faced by many parents who are trying to get rapid and satisfactory statementing.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1592</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>so the policy is clear and categorical. On top of that, the framework includes early intervention and advice through SEN co-ordinators, which has led to a significant improvement in performance&#151;an increase of some 10 percentage points in the proportion of statements that are dealt with within the statutory time limit of 18 weeks in the five years running up to 2005. That is what the parents of children with special educational needs want to see happen, and we are making sure that it does.

 I believe that looking at best practice and seeing how we can spread that right across the country is the way forward. We do, from time to time, receive calls for radical reappraisals and reviews.

Only last week, I met a group of parents in my constituency who expressed their concerns about statementing and the inclusion in mainstream schooling of children with autism and Asperger&#039;s syndrome. Schools cannot cope, and the parents did not feel that the action being taken was appropriate. Will the Minister share with the House his thoughts on why Government figures show that the number of children with special educational needs, but no statement, has increased? Does he agree that the time has come for a review of how statementing, and indeed inclusion, work to support this important and vulnerable group of children?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o58"><a name="60316-03_spnew9"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 This group of vulnerable children is at the forefront of our thinking as we develop policy. Since we introduced our SEN strategy, &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot;, in 2004, there has been a tangible and significant improvement in performance. On the key criterion of the percentage of statements without exceptions that are drafted within the 18-week target, performance has risen from 82 per cent. to 92 per cent. in the five years running up to 2005. That is significant evidence that we are improving performance.

They are: support for adults who lack basic skills; support for adults who lack the level 2 platform of skills for employability; ensuring opportunities for developing level 3 skills; and safeguarding adult opportunities for personal and community development.

The number of adult places on courses contributing directly to those priorities might reduce. However, some 274,000 additional level 2 places will be created through our new train to gain programme&#151;a &#163;630 million programme over the next two years to deliver training of the kind that employers need through a demand-led system. I might add that some colleges&#151;for example, City College Brighton and Hove&#151;has expanded participation while increasing its fee income, so it can be done.

<p><a name="st_o63"><a name="60316-03_spnew13"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The question was about the number of adult education courses, not adult education learners. We collect figures on learners, as I said in an earlier response.

 Trust schools build on the existing foundation school model and will be empowered to make decisions about their buildings and staff needs. The specific opportunity that trust schools have compared with the majority of foundation schools is the ability to benefit from a lasting relationship with external partners, who will provide new opportunities for collaboration and support for leadership, teaching and learning in the school.

 As was said in yesterday&#039;s debate, my constituency has one of the country&#039;s fastest growing rates of independent school attendance.

 It has never been the Government&#039;s objective to get more young people and families to opt out of the state school system.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o68"><a name="60316-03_spnew17"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point. The trust school model is aimed precisely at building on the good experience in our system of the past eight years, such as the contribution that external partners make to the specialist school movement and the way in which schools are beginning to collaborate for the benefit of their pupils. However, as my hon. Friend rightly says, those collaborations are too often dependent on the enthusiasm and commitment of dedicated individuals. If they move on, the collaboration is often unable to continue. The ability to embed such collaboration, make it permanent and bring in external support is one of the key benefits of the trust school model.

<br>&nbsp;<br>although the assets of a trust school, like those of foundation schools, will be vested in the trust, there are also considerable provisions governing the disposal of assets. They are aimed at protecting publicly funded assets so that, to dispose of them, the trust would need to inform in advance the local authority, which would be in a position to agree a share of the proceeds or alternative use. If a school broke its link with a trust, the assets would revert to the school or, in the case of closure, the local authority.

 (Lab): What steps the Crown Prosecution Service takes to support vulnerable witnesses in court proceedings. [58771]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o92"><a name="60316-05_spmin1"><b>The Solicitor-General  (Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien): </b> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service can apply to the court to allow vulnerable witnesses to give evidence via a televised link or from behind a screen, or to withhold their personal details. The court may of course refuse the application.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o93"><a name="60316-05_spnew3"><b> Ms Keeble: </b> 
 Hate crimes have been a problem in my area, especially homophobic attacks. If the courts and the CPS cannot establish certainty, vulnerable witnesses may find themselves in a court without a screen, or in a court that is unsafe because of the layout and the furniture. A defendant may discharge his lawyer and, in effect, use the courtroom to continue to harass the vulnerable witness. Will my hon. and learned Friend examine the position, especially in relation to hate crimes?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o94"><a name="60316-05_spmin2"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 I will certainly do so. However, it is open to the CPS, under section 36 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, to prevent the accused from personally cross-examining a witness. The court must be satisfied that the quality of evidence given by a witness under cross-examination is likely to be diminished if the cross-examination is conducted by the accused, that it may be improved if the accused does not cross-examine the witness, and that it would not be contrary to the interests of justice to restrict cross-examination by the accused.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-05_para1">
<a name="stpa_o4">There are a number of provisions and conditions, but it is possible that the courts have the power to which my hon. Friend refers. As she knows to her cost, however, benches sometimes decide not to use some of the powers that they could use, such as the power to provide screens. It is important for the courts to realise how vulnerable witnesses often feel in such circumstances.

<p><a name="st_o98"><a name="60316-05_spmin3"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 There has been a considerable problem with domestic violence cases. There have been pilot schemes in Caerphilly and Croydon to establish whether non-lawyer advocates can work with domestic violence victims and witnesses, take them through the criminal justice system, and ensure that they are relieved of at least some of the stress of giving evidence&#151;although the experience is always likely to be stressful.

<p><a name="st_o99"><a name="60316-05_spmin4"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 A new code of practice for victims and witnesses is due to come into force on 3 April that sets out responsibilities towards victims, witnesses and bereaved relatives. Breaches of the obligations can, if unresolved through a complaints procedure, be referred to the parliamentary ombudsman. The Attorney-General has also recently published the prosecutors pledge to victims of crime.

 My hon. and learned Friend will know that the first full performance review of the CPS was published on Tuesday. It showed that performance was less than good in more than half of CPS areas and that in most, there was a failure to communicate with victims of crime&#151;to tell them that charges had either been dropped or reduced. Those are damning criticisms of the CPS. What steps is my hon. and learned Friend going to take to ensure that the Director of Public Prosecutions is aware of these failings&#151;and what is the CPS going to do to get its act together?

 The overall assessment of the recent analysis was that three CPS areas were &quot;excellent&quot;, 16 were &quot;good&quot;, 19 were &quot;fair&quot; and four were &quot;poor&quot;. So some 45 per cent. of CPS areas are either &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good&quot;, and 90 per cent. are for the most part complying with relevant standards satisfactorily.

<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1601</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>


<p><a name="st_o103"><a name="60316-05_spmin6"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 The Law Commission is dealing with the first stage of a review of the law on murder, and the Law Officers have had discussions with the Home Secretary and other Ministers. The Law Commission, which is of course an independent body, has issued a consultation paper containing provisional proposals. The Government will await the final proposals before taking a view on them.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o104"><a name="60316-05_spnew9"><b> David T.C. Davies: </b> 
 Can the Solicitor-General assure us that, whatever the outcome of the review, the most serious forms of murder will continue to carry a mandatory life sentence? Can he further assure us that from now on, a mandatory life sentence will mean that the person in question spends the rest of their life behind bars, rather than spending several years watching Sky television before being set free to continue a campaign of violence against the innocent populace?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o105"><a name="60316-05_spmin7"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman had listened when the review was announced, he would know that the Home Secretary made it clear that the mandatory life sentence for murder will indeed remain. The murder principle set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 will also remain. The Government passed that Act to ensure effective sentencing principles in dealing with murder cases, which, I have to say&#151;given the way that the hon. Gentleman asked his question&#151;his party singularly failed to do when in power.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o106"><a name="60316-05_spnew10"><b> Simon Hughes  (North Southwark and Bermondsey)</b> 
 (LD): Does the Solicitor-General agree that it is far better to respond to the Law Commission&#039;s proposals in the rational and measured way that it made its proposals, than in the histrionic manner that we just heard from the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)? The Law Commission has made it clear that the law is in a mess, that it is not saying and doing what the public think it is, and that it needs reform. The best way to get reform is to have a rational debate and to build consensus. Will the Solicitor-General commend the Law Commission&#039;s very sensible proposals?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o107"><a name="60316-05_spmin8"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 The proposals are out for consultation and will remain so for only a few more weeks, so I suggest that the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)&#151;who asked the &quot;histrionic&quot; question, as the hon. Gentleman put it&#151;respond to that consultation and make their respective views known. The proposals, provisional as they are, are very important and will doubtless change the law on murder in due course, although we have yet to take a final view. It is important that Members take the opportunity to make their views known to that independent body.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o108"><a name="60316-05_spnew11"><b> Mr. Dominic Grieve  (Beaconsfield)</b> 
 (Con): The Solicitor-General will be aware that the Law Commission proposes that, although first-degree murder would continue to carry the mandatory life sentence, second-degree murder&#151;which could involve killing a person when the intent is to commit grievous bodily harm of the most serious kind&#151;would not. Does the Minister think that it might be useful for the review 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1602</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>also to look at how fixed-term sentences are passed, and at the disparity between what the judge says in court and the sentence that is in fact served? The public need greater reassurance that fixed-term sentences mean what they say and approximate to the period that a person might serve in prison. Would it not be possible to provide that reassurance by making it clear that the mandatory sentence was not always necessary? People latch on to the mandatory sentence because they do not have confidence in the current sentencing system.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o109"><a name="60316-05_spmin9"><b>The Solicitor General:</b> 
 I suspect that the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies) and other Back-Bench Opposition Members, may take that inquiry as something of a rebuke for the way that he asked his original question. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) is right that it is important that we consider these matters with a degree of calm and ensure that the public have confidence in the sentences that are passed. The Law Commission is looking at how such matters should be dealt with. We must await the outcome of that, but the Government are discussing how to ensure that people understand better precisely what a sentence passed by a judge will mean in practice for each defendant. There are ways to achieve that, but we must approach the matter through a process of consultation and not by making announcements here. However, I take on board the point that the hon. Gentleman makes.

 The hon. Lady needs to raise this issue with my hon. Friend at the Home Office and, in due course, with Royal Mail. I share some of her concerns about how Royal Mail has decided to deal with this matter. The appropriate method for reporting abuse is via the Royal Mail security team, which then liaises with the police in investigations, but it is also important that we ensure that a person whose mail is diverted is able to get to the bottom of what on earth went on. That is why I have had a conversation with my hon. Friend at the Home Office, and I hope that the hon. Lady will be able to take those discussions further.

Nevertheless, I take seriously the future of the Post Office&#151;the Government take it extremely seriously. I have previously set out the position on Post Office accounts and accounts that can be used at the post office. It is important that pensioners and others get the best return on their savings and their money. I have generally assumed that the Conservative party supports financial improvement for pensioners, so I am a little surprised that week in, week out Opposition Members continue to suggest that pensioners should not get the best return on their savings and their accounts.

 I congratulate the Leader of the House on referring to the considerable successes that we have had since 1997 in the national health service and in many aspects of its work.

That stands in stark contrast with the acute problems that one or two acute hospital trusts face.

It is not inappropriate for universities to decide which courses to offer and to reorganise their provision accordingly. I would not want him to leave the House with the impression that there is a shortfall in the number of people studying chemistry, as chemistry course applications and acceptances through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service rose by more than 12 per cent. last year, compared with a national average increase of 7 per cent.

<p><a name="st_85"><a name="60316-11_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mr. John Hutton): </b> 
 With permission, I should like to make a statement on the ombudsman&#039;s report on the security of final salary occupational pensions published yesterday. The Parliamentary Commissioner&#039;s report is a detailed piece of work and, of course, deserves a proper, full and formal response. It is my intention to publish such a response in the next few weeks. However, I would like today to set out the reasons why, after very careful consideration, we have reached the view that we cannot accept any of the findings of maladministration and why we have therefore decided to reject all but one of her recommendations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_44">The ombudsman&#039;s report concludes that over the period between 1996 and 2002, both this Government and the Conservative Government were guilty of maladministration in three principal areas. I would like to take each of those findings in turn. I make no apology for the detailed response that I am about to give. To offer anything less comprehensive would not properly reflect the importance of the report and the seriousness with which we treat the findings that the ombudsman has made against this Government and the Conservative Government. I should stress, in that context, my Department has co-operated fully with the ombudsman and her office during the preparation of the report. It has provided detailed information and documentation on request and it has commented extensively on the specific findings that the ombudsman had indicated that she intended to make. Those responses are set out in the report, included in a lengthy annexe to it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_45">Turning to the individual findings: first, the ombudsman found that official information about the security that members of final salary occupational pension schemes could expect from the minimum funding requirement, introduced in the Pensions Act 1995, was sometimes inaccurate, incomplete, inconsistent and therefore potentially misleading, and that that constituted maladministration. We do not accept that the Department&#039;s leaflets were inaccurate, incomplete, inconsistent or misleading. It is true that some were more detailed than others, but that was because they were designed for different audiences. All the leaflets covered by the report carried very specific statements that they were not a full explanation of the law and were for general guidance only. The leaflets themselves make that clear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_46">Perhaps I could illustrate those points by taking some of the key documents referred to in the report, in order. In 1996, the then Government published a guide to the 1995 Pensions Act&#151;leaflet PEC3&#151;which described the intention of the various measures in the Act, including the minimum funding requirement, or MFR, and how they were expected to operate. The leaflet also said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;This leaflet is a brief summary of the changes. If you need advice about your occupational pension, speak to the trustees or managers of the scheme . . . This leaflet gives general guidance only and should not be treated as a complete and authoritative statement of the law.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_47">That was very much the pattern.

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_48">In July 1997, the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority&#151;OPRA&#151;guide for pension scheme trustees summarised what the minimum funding requirement was. The guide also said:

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_50">In May 2002, the Department issued leaflet PM3: &quot;Occupational Pensions&#151;your guide&quot;. Although the guide did not discuss the risk of schemes winding up underfunded, it did say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;this guide . . . looks at some of the questions you may need to think about and it tells you where you can find more information . . . Read any pension information your employer gives you . . . This leaflet is for guidance only. It is not a complete statement of the law.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_51">The Government do not consider that any of the leaflets or quoted statements relied on by the ombudsman could have formed a proper basis for scheme members, still less trustees who were professionally advised, to assess the security of their individual pension schemes. But, even more importantly, the Government also believe that the report fails to demonstrate that decisions taken by individual scheme members were influenced by the information that the Government did, or did not, make available. In other words, the report simply does not establish that the wording of the leaflets led to the losses suffered by individuals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para9">
<a name="stpa_52">I now turn to the second finding of maladministration. The ombudsman says that the failure by the Department for Work and Pensions to review its existing information leaflets, when informed that scheme members and member trustees did not know the risks to their accrued pension rights, constituted maladministration. The Government do not believe that the information given to the Department by the actuarial profession during this time should have instigated a review of its publications.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para10">
<a name="stpa_53">Those recommendations concerned how trustees&#151;not the Government&#151;should communicate with their members about the funding of their schemes. The Department invited views on that issue in the consultation document that it issued in September 2000 on the future of the minimum funding requirement. The response to that consultation led ultimately to proposals, which were then implemented, for the replacement of the minimum funding requirement. I want to say more about that replacement later. But so far as we are aware, no respondents suggested that departmental publications were causing confusion. They were not advising that the content of these leaflets concerning the purpose or intent of the minimum funding requirement was misleading or inaccurate. Ministers cannot fairly be criticised for failing to do something that was simply not proposed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para11">
<a name="stpa_54">Moreover, trustees had access to advice from their own scheme actuary, who would have been well aware of the operation of the minimum funding requirement. In addition each MFR certificate included a statement that meeting the minimum funding requirement did not equate to full buy-out. All of this information was 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1622</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>available to scheme members. We do not believe that it would have been reasonable for trustees to have relied on publications issued by the DWP which were brief and general in nature, rather than the professional advice they had access to and were under an obligation to consult. Trustees were required to give all scheme members basic information about their scheme, and many trustees produced fairly detailed information booklets. We have seen no evidence from the report that the ombudsman has considered what information trustees supplied to their scheme members and what, if any, impact this information might have had.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para12">
<a name="stpa_55">Thirdly, the ombudsman has said that the decision in 2002 by the Department for Work and Pensions to approve a change to the basis of the MFR was taken with maladministration. The Government believe that we acted wholly responsibly in implementing the recommendation of the actuarial profession which had received the backing of the independent Government Actuary&#039;s Department. The ombudsman has not allowed us to see the full actuarial advice on which some of her comments were based. The Government Actuary advised the ombudsman that, if this advice was not disclosed, it made it impossible for anyone to understand the basis on which she reached her conclusion that the Government were guilty of maladministration. As a result, we have not been able to see or challenge how she arrived at some of her conclusions on the 2002 change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para13">
<a name="stpa_56">The change in 2002 was intended to bring the MFR back to its original strength. Adjustments to the MFR were always on the principle of maintaining its 1997 level. This was the principle on which the actuarial profession kept the basis of the MFR under review and made recommendations to the Department. It was also the basis on which the Government Actuary&#039;s Department advised my Department. The report published yesterday contains a letter from the Government Actuary, referring to the decision criticised by the ombudsman, and I want to quote from it. It says that

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;the evidence base&quot;</p>
</ul>

<a name="stpa_57">for the DWP&#039;s decision
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;was not insufficient since it was based on strong advice from the actuarial profession, which had been developed by a committee containing leading technical experts from most of the major firms of actuaries, and supplemented by GAD as a further independent source of advice. The evidence base for this decision was in fact extremely strong and much stronger than for many (perhaps most) of the decisions that have to be taken by Government.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para15">
<a name="stpa_58">The ombudsman acknowledges in her report that the 2002 change did not affect the degree of knowledge which scheme members had.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para16">
<a name="stpa_59">Against this background, the Government have considered carefully the ombudsman&#039;s first four recommendations, which involve considering whether to restore the lost pension rights of affected scheme members, making consolatory payments and apologising to scheme trustees. As I have already made clear, the Government are unable to accept the findings on which those recommendations are based. We do not believe that the findings of maladministration can be supported by the facts. It simply cannot be right that the losses from the schemes that have collapsed should be met by the taxpayer without establishing any causal

<br>&nbsp;<br>connection between the actions criticised in the ombudsman&#039;s report and the losses that people have incurred. The report fails to establish that connection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para17">
<a name="stpa_60">Indeed, in respect of the ombudsman&#039;s fourth recommendation, relating to schemes that began to wind up between April 2004 and April 2005, the report itself acknowledges that the individuals concerned could be said to have had the opportunity to take whatever action they could to mitigate their potential loss. I do not consider that it would be in the wider public interest for Government to accept that very substantial liability on behalf of taxpayers. We calculate that liability as being in the range of &#163;13 billion and &#163;17 billion in cash terms over the next 60 years. We estimate that the administration costs would be in the region of a further &#163;20 million each year. We do not therefore intend to take the actions recommended by the ombudsman. The taxpayer cannot be asked to accept the responsibility for effectively underwriting the value of private investments in the way the report suggests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para18">
<a name="stpa_61">The Government do, however, accept the ombudsman&#039;s fifth recommendation with regard to reviewing the time that it takes to wind up a defined benefit pension scheme. Work is already under way in this area, and we will set out our proposals for how we intend to proceed when that work is completed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-11_para19">
<a name="stpa_62">I would like to finish by making two things absolutely clear. First, this Government have been the first to accept the moral and social obligation to make sure that as many as possible of those who have suffered hardship and distress in these circumstances receive financial support. That is why this Government have set up the financial assistance scheme, with &#163;400 million of public money. The scheme is designed to provide help to those who have lost the most and who are in the greatest need&#151;those closest to retirement and who are therefore least able to make alternative provision. The scheme will currently help up to 15,000 people who have faced significant occupational pension losses. <i>[Interruption.]</i>

<p><a name="st_87"><a name="60316-12_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The financial assistance scheme will top up those people&#039;s pensions with financial support, to give a maximum income of up to &#163;12,000 a year.

The Pension Protection Fund and the new pensions regulator will transform security for members of defined benefit schemes.

<p><a name="st_88"><a name="60316-12_spnew1"><b> Mr. Philip Hammond  (Runnymede and Weybridge) (Con):</b> 
 May I start with the bit that the Secretary of State missed out? On behalf of Opposition Members, I should like to express my sympathy for the 85,000 people who have lost their pensions through occupational pension scheme failures. Those are decent people who set out to do the right thing to try to ensure a decent retirement for themselves, and they have seen their dreams of a comfortable and secure retirement cruelly shattered. Their plight is not only a series of personal tragedies, but a tragedy for the cause of increased pension saving as confidence in the system is further undermined.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_65">The ombudsman&#039;s report specifically addresses misleading information by Government, but let us not forget the context. In spite of any amount of dodgy information, the problem would never have arisen if the pension funds in question had not failed. The Government must accept their share of responsibility for those failures, as well as for the information that misled people about the consequences. It was this Government who reduced the minimum funding requirement for occupational pension schemes. It was this Government and the present Chancellor who raided pension funds and are still raiding pension funds, to the tune of &#163;5 billion a year with his pension stealth tax, equivalent to &#163;120 billion of capital value wiped off pension funds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_66">So the Government stand accused not only of misleading about the consequences of the failure of occupational pension funds, but of helping to precipitate that failure. On the first count the ombudsman, an official of Parliament charged with the task of reporting to Parliament on claims of maladministration, has investigated and found that maladministration has occurred. What is the Government&#039;s response? A direct challenge to the authority of Parliament. The accused in the dock has decided that he will be judge and jury in his own case. He has just spent 10 minutes of his 15-minute statement going over the case again and telling us that the ombudsman, an Officer of the House, got her findings wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_67">The ombudsman rightly replies to the right hon. Gentleman that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;Parliament has decided that it is my role&#151;and not that of any party to a complaint&#151;to determine what constitutes maladministration.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_68">The House must insist that the Government bow to the decision arrived at by the due process which the House put in place in respect of the factual finding of maladministration by the ombudsman. While they are at it, the Government could also comply with the ombudsman&#039;s recommendation that they apologise. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s mother ever taught him this, but my mother always taught me that an apology costs nothing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_69">The real problem for the Government is that the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, South-West (Mr. Darling), then Secretary of State for Social Security, and the present Secretary of State for Transport, has already committed the Government to

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;As a matter of principle, we believe that when someone loses out because they were given the wrong information by a Department, they are entitled to redress.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 15 March 2000; Vol. 346, c. 308.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_70">The Secretary of State has sold the pass, leaving Ministers in the ridiculous position of trying to deny the ombudsman&#039;s findings of maladministration because that would-be Chancellor of the Exchequer has already committed them to providing redress in those circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_71">Surprisingly, yesterday at Prime Minister&#039;s questions, the right hon. Gentleman was rather more honest about the situation. He did not say the ombudsman was wrong. He did not question her findings of maladministration. He simply told the House that the Government could not pay what he claimed would be a &#163;15 billion bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-12_para9">
<a name="stpa_72">However, the ombudsman&#039;s principal recommendation was that the Government should consider whether they should make arrangements for the restoration of the pensions and other benefits of those who had lost out, in her words

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-12_para11">
<a name="stpa_74">The obvious way, to which the Secretary of State alluded, is the financial assistance scheme, which was put in place to help people who lost their pensions or suffered diminished pensions because their pension funds had failed. I welcome what the right hon. Gentleman said about his willingness to look again at the way the financial assistance scheme works. At present, it does not work. It is limited to people who are already retired or who are within three years of retirement age when the scheme fails. It is slow and cumbersome. Only 27 people have received payments from the scheme, out of 85,000 people who have lost their pensions or suffered diminution of their pensions. The fund is clearly underfunded for its stated purpose, having only &#163;20 million a year at its disposal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-12_para12">
<a name="stpa_75">Will the Secretary of State as a matter of urgency look at how the financial assistance scheme can be reconstructed to help a much wider group of people who have suffered loss of pension rights through no fault of their own? He said in his statement that it would be wrong for the whole burden to fall on the taxpayer. With that thought in mind, will he consider the possible use of unclaimed assets, in particular unclaimed pension and insurance assets, to see whether those could be used to support an expanded financial assistance scheme?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-12_para13">
<a name="stpa_76">When we proposed that last year, the Chancellor said that those assets did not exist, but since the general election he has discovered them and earmarked some of them for one of his own pet schemes. It would be a more appropriate use of unclaimed assets in the pension and insurance sector to use them to fund failures in that sector. I urge the right hon. Gentleman to ask his colleagues at the Treasury to embark upon a serious piece of work to identify the extent and scope of those assets, to see whether they could contribute towards a remedy of the situation.

<a name="60316-12_para14">
<a name="stpa_77">When the Secretary of State is talking to his right hon. Friend the Chancellor about additional funding for the financial assistance scheme, will he remind him of the &#163;45 billion that he has had so far from pension funds with his pension stealth tax, and the &#163;5 billion a year that he continues to levy on those pension funds, even as the system is collapsing about his ears? Will he remind the Chancellor of the pension fund failures and the misery suffered by tens of thousands of individual stakeholders in consequence?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-12_para15">
<a name="stpa_78">Both the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State have used the figure of &#163;15 billion. The Secretary of State today spoke of &#163;13 billion to &#163;17 billion. That is a cash figure and it is meaningless. Will he make a commitment today to put in the Library for the benefit of all Members a properly worked out net present value figure for the cost of making good the pension funds, so that Members can understand what the real figure is, not the hyped-up figure that he and the Prime Minister have been using?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-12_para16">
<a name="stpa_79">The Government must accept without further delay the ombudsman&#039;s factual finding of maladministration. If they do not, the authority of Parliament and the credibility of the ombudsman&#039;s office will be critically undermined. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, South-West had already committed them to the principle of redress in these circumstances, but the ombudsman&#039;s recommendations leave scope for examining various ways to deliver that redress&#151;through the financial assistance scheme, or perhaps by revisiting the use of unclaimed assets, as I suggested. The commitment to redress, in whichever form, has already been made by the right hon. Gentleman on behalf of the Government, so Ministers cannot duck it by refusing to accept the ombudsman&#039;s finding of fact. It is for the Government to deliver on that commitment, and a great deal is at stake. With national pensions day ahead of us this Saturday, and the Government&#039;s response to the Turner report eagerly awaited in the spring, if the Government get this wrong and send the wrong signal about the security and safety of pension funds to the British public, there is a real danger that efforts to address Britain&#039;s pension crisis by promoting pension saving will be fatally undermined before they even get off the starting blocks.

When he publishes the information requested by my hon.

 My right hon. Friend talked about extending the financial assistance scheme. When he does that, will he bear in mind that there is a group of schemes, including the APW scheme in Hampshire, in which the employer is still solvent, but the trustees were effectively forced into compromise with no option, with the loss of a significant part of individuals&#039; pensions? So far, the Government have set their face against extending the financial assistance scheme to schemes such as APW. Will he give me an assurance that in the review that is taking place he will look afresh at that group of schemes to see whether assistance can be offered, because those people have suffered just as much as anybody else, and through no fault of their own?

He knows, as we do, that each and every one of those 85,000 cases represents an individual, and a personal tragedy for somebody in retirement. Some of those cases include steelworkers from ASW in Kent, who are my constituents. They were looking to the guardian of the people&#151;the parliamentary ombudsman&#151;to come up with a fair answer.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. You will be aware that, following the question put to the Prime Minister by my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) yesterday, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has today issued a written statement admitting fundamental problems with the Rural Payments Agency and announcing the dismissal of its chief executive. This is extremely serious news for the thousands of farm businesses that already face a difficult financial future. In her statement today, the Secretary of State says that she has asked the new acting chief executive to report to her by Tuesday on the immediate steps needed to get the payments back on track. What indication have you received that the Secretary of State will come to the House to make an oral statement as soon as she has received that report?

 I understand the seriousness of the matter that the hon. Gentleman raises, but I have no knowledge at this time of any plans that the Secretary of State might have to make such a statement.

 I beg to move, That this House insists on its disagreement with the Lords in their amendments Nos. 16 and 22, and proposes the Government amendments (a) and (b) in lieu thereof.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_99">The amendments are technical amendments to clause   8, making it clear that an application for an identity card must include or accompany one to be entered on the national identity register. We have already had one debate on the Lords amendments this week, on Monday 13 March, when the House rejected them for the second time.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;The other thing worth saying is that last Monday, the Home Secretary . . . in levelling his defence against our proposal to make the scheme voluntary, did not in any sense call upon the constitutional justification of the Commons&#039; position that has been the mainstay of the noble Baroness&#039;s closing speech&quot;</p>

Mr Clarke attempted to justify the Government&#039;s case according to the issues that he raised in the other place&#151;none of them were constitutional issues; they related to the merits and demerits of this Bill.&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 15 March 2006; Vol. 679, c. 1248&#150;49.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_102">I intend to remedy that defect in my presentation today. Let me start with what was said by Lord Strathclyde, the leader of the main Opposition party in the Lords. He spoke very wisely, as befits a graduate of the university of East Anglia. He said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;This House should always proceed with caution when it is trying to defeat the Government, even when it is asking the House of Commons to think again on a Bill it has passed. Generally speaking, we do that. I think we always do that. What is so unusual about this aspect is that the Government have already been defeated on two occasions, and therefore this is the third occasion on which we are dealing with this matter.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">In this context, perhaps I may make three points. First, I think the House should proceed with caution and should deal with matters as controversial as this only when they are very few in number. This is the first time in this Session that we have come to an issue of this kind. Secondly, we should proceed only on an issue where there is a good deal of public support for what this House is doing. Thirdly, we should not proceed if there are issues to do with the Salisbury convention. My noble Friend and the Government may disagree about the use of the Salisbury convention; I am entirely satisfied that there are no Salisbury convention implications if the House were to return this small point back to another place.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_103">I shall deal with each of those three points. The first was that the House of Lords should proceed with caution. I think that Lord Strathclyde was quite right about that, and he should take his own advice. The fact 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1642</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>is that the amendment is not a small point. It constitutes a major and deliberate effort by the Opposition parties to sabotage the whole of a Bill that has been agreed by this House, and that was set out to the public during the general election campaign. I hope that the Lords will indeed proceed with caution, and will not adopt a strategy that is designed to undermine the entire Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_104">Secondly, Lord Strathclyde said that the other place
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;should proceed only on an issue where there is a good deal of public support for what this House is doing.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_105">I remind the House&#151;and perhaps, via this House, the other place&#151;of the facts about public support. There is not such support for what the House of Lords is doing. Even the result of the latest opinion poll sponsored by the NO2ID campaign shows that 52 per cent. of the public are in favour, while Home Office research shows that 70 per cent. are in favour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_106">Lord Strathclyde said that the other place
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;should proceed only on an issue where there is a good deal of public support for what this House is doing.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_107">According to the NO2ID campaign, 52 per cent. of people are in favour of the identity cards and against what the other place is doing; and, as I have said, Home Office research shows that 70 per cent. are in favour.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_108">The Conservative election manifesto was entirely silent on the matter, although the then leader of the party was a known supporter of identity cards. However, the findings of an opinion poll published by ICM before the election, in December 2004, show that some 80 per cent. of the public were then in favour of the introduction of identity cards, with 88 per cent. of Conservative supporters, 81 per cent. of Labour supporters and 72 per cent. of Liberal Democrat supporters in favour. So the answer to Lord Strathclyde&#039;s second point&#151;that the Lords should block the will of this elected Chamber only if there is clear public support&#151;is that there is not.
</p>





<p><a name="st_165"><a name="60316-17_spnew2"><b> Tony Baldry  (Banbury) (Con):</b> 
 Surely the point is that it was not put to the people who were polled that the system would be compulsory. I am sure that there would be huge support for voluntary identity cards. The issue that the House of Lords and this House are having to consider is the whole issue of voluntary versus compulsory. I suspect that if those people had been asked, &quot;Should it be a criminal offence not to carry an identity card?&quot; or, &quot;Should it be compulsory to carry an identity card?&quot;, the answer would have been very different.
</p>





<p><a name="st_166"><a name="60316-17_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 We have already agreed, in response to proposals from the other place, that before the stage was reached of making identity cards compulsory there would be further primary legislation. The Bill explicitly excludes a requirement for anyone to carry an identity card, so what the hon. Gentleman has said is completely incorrect.
</p>





<p><a name="st_167"><a name="60316-17_spnew4"><b> Mr. Tobias Ellwood  (Bournemouth, East) (Con):</b> 
 May I add to the effective point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)? There would be more consensus, not only in the House but among the public, if we could see the final price tag. Can the Home Secretary tell us how much the whole project will cost the taxpayer?

<p><a name="st_168"><a name="60316-18_spnew0"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman may have made my point for me. We have debated costs with the House of Lords, and we accepted an amendment on the subject tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson), in the spirit of seeking agreement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_109">As for the point made by the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry), the NO2ID poll explicitly asked whether the card should be issued with a passport, which is what we are dealing with here.

<p><a name="st_169"><a name="60316-18_spnew1"><b> Mr. William Cash  (Stone) (Con):</b> 
 Would the Home Secretary continue to take the line that he is taking in the context of what the Information Commissioner has said on the subject&#151;that the Bill would cause a sea change in the relationship between the individual and the state? Has he spoken to the Information Commissioner recently, and has he any reason to suppose that the Information Commissioner has changed his view?
</p>





<p><a name="st_170"><a name="60316-18_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I have not spoken to the Information Commissioner recently but, as I have said, there has been considerable debate on the substance of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman speaks of the relationship between the individual and the state. A general election is a pretty important part of the relationship between the individual and the state. That is why I think that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s noble Friend Lord Strathclyde was right to say yesterday that in his view&#151;not mine&#151;the House of Lords should proceed only on an issue on which there was a good deal of public support for what that House was doing. My point is that there is not.
</p>





<p><a name="st_171"><a name="60316-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Andrew Love  (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 Is my right hon. Friend at all concerned about the apparent drift away from the high levels of support for identity cards in the past? Does he recognise that if the identity card is introduced with a designated document, for a number of years people will be charged for an identity card without receiving any of the benefits, which will further undermine the system?
</p>





<p><a name="st_172"><a name="60316-18_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I accept the first point, but not the second. Because of the debate about these issues and because the precise questions are different in different polling data, there is an issue concerning public support that needs to be addressed. That is a major part of the proposal, and my hon. Friend is right to raise it. Lord Strathclyde&#039;s second point was narrow, but important. It is; is there

<br>&nbsp;<br>that has been approved twice by the elected House. I remind Members of the view of the Salisbury convention taken in January 2000 by the royal commission on the reform of the House of Lords. It was chaired by Lord Wakeham, who is not a notable Government toady, except when the Conservatives were in government. Recommendation 7 of commission&#039;s report states:

 I am most grateful to the Home Secretary for giving way; we are familiar with his semantic acrobatics on this issue.

 Will the Home Secretary give way on that point?

<p><a name="st_196"><a name="60316-19_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 In a moment. My fourth point is that the Lords amendments would impose an additional burden and cost on the plans for the introduction of ID cards that were approved by this House. It cannot be right for the constituents whom we represent to be denied by those whom they did not elect and cannot remove the most cost-effective option in implementing a scheme. In effect, the Lords voted for the establishment of two parallel biometric databases, with all the cost, inconvenience, confusion and insecurity that that approach involves. That raises the question of whether the unelected House has the right directly to place such burdens on our constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_116">The remaining issue is, essentially, a constitutional one: whether it is right for the other place to keep insisting on amendments that have been rejected here twice already, and that will be rejected again today.

 Such a scheme would not only impose additional costs, which is an issue that clearly exercised the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) earlier; we would also end up with two databases, one unprotected and the other protected by the national identity scheme commissioner. Is that not what the Lords are advocating?

 That is completely right. The effect of the Lords amendment would be precisely as my hon. Friend says. If it were passed, the protections that this Bill provides for the national identity register would not be available for the biometric passport register.

<p><a name="st_199"><a name="60316-19_spnew10"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 The Home Secretary referred to our exchange on Monday. If Lord Strathclyde is right to say that the Lords should act only when there is a significant amount of public support, may I remind the right hon. Gentleman that the latest poll that he cited shows that public support for the position taken by the Lords is 10 per cent. higher than was the support for his party at the general election? The numbers in respect of the share of those who voted are about the same, so he surely cannot argue that the Government are justified on this issue, and that the House of Lords is not this?

 My right hon. Friend is right about the Liberal Democrat arithmetic. The situation is very simple. I repeat that Lord Strathclyde made it clear that the Lords should frustrate the will of the Commons only when there is a &quot;good deal&quot; of public support for what the Lords was doing. The NO2ID campaign is opposed to our policy, but that organisation set the questions in the poll, in which more than half the country said that it did not support the campaign.

 The debate and the disagreement between the other place and our House turn on whether the scheme is compulsory or voluntary. The Home Secretary is right to remind us that we should need primary legislation if the scheme were to be completely compulsory, but the Bill establishes, by the back door, a halfway house to compulsion. Why?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_137">I suspect that the real reason is that the Home Secretary is not confident. When we eventually reach the stage of introducing primary legislation to make the scheme compulsory, he wants to be able to tell the House and the public, &quot;Sixty per cent. of people in the UK already have an ID card. What are you worried about?&quot; However, the only reason that 60 per cent. of people will have a card will be as a result of this back-door way of compelling them to have a card if they want a passport or a driving licence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_138">It is perfectly respectable for the Home Secretary to want a universal card, but as the shadow Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) said, the proposed scheme will not be effective; the card certainly will not achieve any of the things that the Government hope for it against terrorism, international fraud and so on, unless it is universal. The idea that it could be semi-universal actually denies the whole purpose of an ID card, certainly in terms of its practical effectiveness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_139">It is not unreasonable for the Home Secretary to want a universal card, but he does not want to legislate for it now because he knows that he would not get the measure through&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> No, he is not legislating for a compulsory card. If he did that now, he knows that the Government would have to pay the full costs for such a card. He could not compel people to have a card and to pay &#163;90 for it. He knows that a compulsory card would have to be financed by the Government and the Chancellor does not want to do that, so we have this rather dishonest and disingenuous halfway scheme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_140">If the Government and the Home Secretary were really confident about the proposed card, they would trust the British people. If the Home Secretary feels that he can make an overwhelming case for the importance of an identity card&#151;as he undoubtedly does; I think that he is entirely sincere&#151;he should trust his judgment and make that case to the British people. He should say, &quot;Believe me, we will benefit from the card so volunteer for it&quot;, but he cannot introduce the scheme by compulsion. In proceeding by compulsion, he does not trust the British people. He certainly does not trust the people when he proposes this semi, rather false voluntary scheme, which is in effect compulsory.

 The simple facts are that the Government say that ID cards will be introduced voluntarily, yet the 80 to 85 per cent. of the British population who possess passports will, if the Bill is passed, have an ID card foisted on them in coming years whether they like it or not.

<a name="stpa_143">As it appears fruitless to continue to ask the Government to use the same dictionary definitions as the rest of the English-speaking world, I shall take a slightly different line of inquiry. If, according to the Government, the scheme will be voluntary, will British citizens be able to withdraw their data from the ID database voluntarily? I know of no database in operation to which individuals can voluntarily enter their data, and from which they are not equally free to remove that information at a time of their own choosing. The Data Protection Act 1998, which sets out the core data protection principles, is clear. It states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;It must be recognised that even when consent has been given it will not necessarily endure forever . . . Data controllers should recognise that . . . the individual may be able to withdraw consent.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_144">Just this once, I shall take at face value the Home Secretary&#039;s insistence that the scheme is voluntary. If it is voluntary to enter, based on individual consent, will he confirm that it will also be voluntary to leave it?

<p>
<a name="60316-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_145">I am also struck by the breakneck urgency with which the Government seem to want to roll out ID cards by surreptitious compulsion. This week, we mark the 10th anniversary of the tragic shootings in Dunblane. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1656</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 included a provision for a national firearms database, yet almost 10 years later nothing has happened. This week, Ministers told us that the decade-long delay was due to difficulties with the IT systems required for the firearms register. Apparently, at long last, a pilot register will start in May, with a view to rolling it out in fully fledged form a little later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_146">The contrast between the woeful delay in establishing a comparatively small database, agreed 10 years ago after the harrowing loss of life in Dunblane, and the headlong rush towards a vast uncosted, untested and unjustified national ID database speaks volumes.
</p>





<p><a name="st_251"><a name="60316-22_spnew5"><b> Chris Bryant: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman refers to the anniversary of Dunblane. Last Saturday was the second anniversary of the Atocha bombings in Madrid. He knows perfectly well that because possession of an ID card is mandatory in Spain in order to have a mobile phone, that made it possible for the Spanish authorities to secure prosecutions.
</p>





<p><a name="st_252"><a name="60316-22_spnew6"><b> Mr. Clegg: </b> 
 The point is, why should the Government be so keen through compulsion to roll out an untested, uncosted and vast ID database and seem incapable for a decade to develop the IT systems for a much smaller one? It hardly confers confidence in the Government&#039;s ability to deliver. The Government drag their feet on something that is urgently needed and justified, yet rush ahead on something that is neither needed nor justified.

 The hon. Gentleman has not answered what I may call the Rhondda paradox. If he regards the passport as compulsory, surely a passport is just as much an infringement of civil liberties as the national identity card. If he regards it as voluntary, then there is no problem. What is his answer?
</p>





<p><a name="st_254"><a name="60316-22_spnew8"><b> Mr. Clegg: </b> 
 The key point is the distortion of the English language: saying that the ID card will be introduced voluntarily and yet doing it through compulsion. As to whether the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) is a paradox, I leave that for the hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton) to judge.

<p><a name="st_288"><a name="60316-24_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Mr. Charles Clarke): </b> 
 The effect of my motion is simple. It effectively reinstates the wording which this House has previously decided on and rejects the attempts of the other place to remove all references to glorification from the Bill. I can be brief in my remarks because I set out in detail what was wrong with the amendments made by another place when we last discussed the issue on 15 February, and I do not intend to return to that debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-24_para1">

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_166">is not really sustainable. I accept that today&#039;s amendments from the Opposition parties do at least seek to remedy the weakness that we reflected in the debate that we had last time, but the reference solely to &quot;listener&quot; was not the only thing that was wrong with the amendments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_167">The amendments from the other place are defective because instead of containing an exemplary description of what &quot;indirect encouragement&quot; could be, they provide an exhaustive description. In other words, the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1665</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>offence is limited so that it is committed by making available to the public a statement directly encouraging terrorism, or a statement indirectly encouraging it but only by actually describing it in such a way that the listener will infer that he should emulate it. To put that simply, the use of the word &quot;describing&quot; in the Lords amendments means that the Bill would not catch, as the original wording would, glorification, praise or celebration of an act of terrorism that does not actually describe the act. Although the amendments that have now been tabled by the Opposition parties do not rely on the word &quot;describing&quot;, the same type of objection still applies to them. The use of the word &quot;comprises&quot; makes them exhaustive.
</p>





<p><a name="st_289"><a name="60316-24_spnew0"><b> Mr. Dominic Grieve  (Beaconsfield) (Con):</b> 
 Instead of using the word &quot;describe&quot; our amendment uses the phrase &quot;referring to terrorism&quot;. Can the Home Secretary give me an example of when glorifying terrorism would not have to make a reference to it as an activity?
</p>





<p><a name="st_290"><a name="60316-24_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The point that I was making is that the amendment seeks to provide an exhaustive description, which, in my opinion, does not meet the original position put forward by the House. That is precisely why we think that the amendments made in the other place and the amendments tabled by the Opposition should not be accepted here.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_168">The removal of the reference to glorification, which appears to be the purpose of the amendments made in the other place, appears to be the position of the official Opposition, although it is difficult to be sure. On Tuesday, the official Opposition tabled amendments jointly with the Liberal Democrats that included the word &quot;glorifying&quot;, but by yesterday those amendments had been replaced by Conservative amendments that do not make reference to glorification. In the other place, those on the Conservative Front Bench urged their colleagues not to vote against the Commons on those points. No doubt we will receive some clarification on that from the Opposition spokesman.

 I will, but I warn the hon. Gentleman that I will not give way to him again in this speech because he will be making his own speech later in this short debate.
</p>

 On the whole, I am genuinely trying to see whether I can reach a consensus with the Home Secretary. For that reason, I considered whether it would be possible, within the restricted ambit of the word &quot;comprise&quot;, to give the Prime Minister his &quot;glorifying&quot; word, so that his ego would be satisfied, but after I had put the amendment down on the blues&#151; I take responsibility for this&#151;it seemed to me, for the very reason that I gave to the Home Secretary, that I could not think of a single example of when glorification would not involve a reference to terrorism. One cannot glorify something without referring to it. In fact, in lawyers&#039; language, the word was otiose and surplusage

<a name="stpa_169">What of the Liberal Democrats? No one&#151;including them, probably&#151;has any idea where they stand. On Tuesday they were with the Conservatives in accepting &quot;glorifying&quot;. On Wednesday they had parted company from the Conservatives, but today they are back with the Conservatives and opposing &quot;glorifying&quot;. It is such typical behaviour from the Liberal Democrats that perhaps it is not worth considering.

<p>
<a name="60316-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_170">The case for including glorification is strong. It is a clear and well understood English word that captures better than any other word some of the conduct that we are trying to deal with in the Bill. As I have said, I imagine that that is why the press have picked up and focused on the word. They know what it means and they know that their readers understand it. It was and, I hope, will be perfectly clear in the Bill for the sake of the courts. It is also a word that the nations of the world were prepared to accept last September when they voted to adopt UN Security Council resolution 1624, which features that word. We should uphold it in Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_171">As I have also pointed out before, in light of the attention given to the issue of glorification, if we were now to remove it from the Bill the courts would be fully justified in reaching one obvious conclusion&#151;that Parliament did not intend glorification of terrorism to fall within the scope of the encouragement offence. If any hon. Members doubt that, they may like to read a judgment given by the Lords of Appeal only last week. In the course of his remarks, Lord Bingham of Cornhill said:

<a name="stpa_172">That clarification, given in the case Regina on application of Gillan and another <i>v</i> Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis and another, which was given 8 March, should cause all of us to be clear that if we take out the word &quot;glorification&quot;, there will be understanding of that in the court when the legislation comes through.

<a name="60316-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_175">I should also remind the House that glorification features in the Bill as an example of what is encompassed by the concept of indirect encouragement. It is not self-contained. Glorification as an offence is a subset of indirect encouragement as an offence, and can be committed only if the conditions surrounding the main offence are met. Key among those conditions is the requirement that there must be an intention that others should be induced to commit terrorist offences or subjective recklessness on this point. Glorification without intention of emulation or subjective recklessness cannot constitute an offence.

<a name="stpa_176">That is a very important safeguard and gives the lie to some of the fanciful claims that have been made about perfectly innocent statements falling foul of this legislation. In part we can have such confidence because of the requirement in the Bill, as this House passed it, for the glorification to relate to conduct that could be emulated in existing circumstances. The amendments from the Opposition parties remove this requirement. I am quite willing to believe that the proposers did not intend to extend the scope of the offence in this undesirable way, but they must speak for themselves, as I am sure the hon. Member for Beaconsfield will do in a moment, and justify their own drafting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_177">Another important consideration in this debate is that the creation of an offence of glorification was a specific commitment in the manifesto on which my party fought and won the general election less than a year ago. That goes hand in hand with the question of which House should prevail in any dispute between the two Houses. In Committee and on Report the House voted explicitly on the question of whether this Bill should contain references to glorification. It endorsed the proposition by majorities of 16 and 25 respectively. The Bill then had an unopposed Third Reading and proceeded to another place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_178">The other place is a revising Chamber and can invite this House to think again. That is precisely what happened in respect of glorification, and other aspects of the Bill as well. Although I disagreed with the views of another place, I made no complaint as to its conduct up to that point. However, the Bill then returned to this House. On 15 February we had a lengthy debate on the whole issue and voted by a majority of 38 to include glorification in the Bill. We thought again, as the other place requested, and reaffirmed our original decision. At that point, I would have expected the unelected House to concede, and I am disappointed that it did not do so.

</p>

<a name="60316-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_181">The glorification of terrorism is not being made an offence, thank goodness. If the glorification of terrorism on its own were made an offence, it would mean, as we have said on many occasions, that anybody who celebrates Robin Hood, the peasants revolt or Spartacus would be liable to prosecution. Furthermore, the poor old Taoiseach would be liable to prosecution when he comes over here after celebrating the Easter rising next month in Dublin, which he intends to do. Mercifully, that is not the Government&#039;s objective.

<a name="60316-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_182">The Government&#039;s approach must be based on the Prime Minister&#039;s ego, because there is no other rational explanation. Having produced a Bill which contains draconian and powerful provisions to criminalise the indirect encouragement of terrorism&#151;something that we support&#151;the Home Secretary has insisted on including in clause 1(4) a most extraordinary subsection, which suggests that the courts should have particular regard to an example that he is offering, which is the possibility that glorification falls within the scope of indirect encouragement. At the same time, he has provided the suggestion that members of the public would reasonably be expected to infer that what is being glorified is being glorified as conduct that should be emulated by them in existing circumstances&#151;I think that the Taoiseach would still be in some difficulty, because quite a few people in Northern Ireland think that any celebration of the Easter rising does exactly that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_183">The key point is that every single judge and lawyer to whom I have spoken has highlighted that including such a concept is woolly, opaque and unclear, that the word, &quot;glorify&quot;, is not known in our law and that the definition of &quot;glorify&quot; as praise or celebration is very poor. The provision appears to be deliberately aimed at people who might wish to celebrate as part of their culture episodes that would fall within the Government&#039;s catch-all definition of terrorism. Above all, it is entirely unnecessary in meeting the Government&#039;s objective, and the Home Secretary has said nothing this afternoon to explain why it needs to be included in the Bill.

 The police certainly do not need additional powers to deal with a demonstration outside the Danish embassy. I was rather depressed to read today that although some prosecutions have been started, there are problems in identifying some of the people who participated because, of course, nobody was arrested at the time or shortly thereafter.

<a name="stpa_184">I say this to the Home Secretary: we have genuinely been trying to see whether we can reach agreement with the Government on the problem that has been posed by the Prime Minister&#039;s ego and his slavish adherence to the word, &quot;glorification&quot;. If one is French, that word does not feature in the debate at all, because the equivalent word is, &quot;apologie&quot;, which means &quot;vindication&quot; and is entirely different. For those in the international community, the failure of this House to enact the glorification clause would not be the most seismic event ever, because what they actually want to see is terrorists and those who encourage terrorism brought to justice.

The Home Secretary&#039;s suggestion that the word &quot;listening&quot; might not encompass viewing or reading struck me as having force. Indeed, if there had been an opportunity for a full debate and vote in the House of Lords, it might have been possible to do something about that there. That classically illustrates how our parliamentary procedure does not work very well. Here we have an opportunity to remedy that minor criticism.

<p><a name="st_307"><a name="60316-26_spnew1"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I believe that they will be a great improvement because they focus on what Parliament wants to achieve. My judgment is that Parliament wants to prevent people from indirectly encouraging terrorism by referring to it in such a way that the listener, reader or viewer, who heard, read or saw whatever was said would infer that he should emulate it. I have always accepted that glorification could constitute an offence if a reference to terrorism was made in such a way that a listener, reader or viewer inferred that he should emulate it. Our amendment removes the focus from a concept that should have no part in our law. People should be allowed to celebrate the Easter rising in Dublin without thinking that they are beginning to fall foul of the measure. They celebrate it not only in Dublin, but, for all I know, in west London.

<a name="60316-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_188">The clause that covers proscribing organisations specifically focuses on glorification. Again, the amendment would remove that focus and provide that, if an organisation referred to terrorism in a way that made people infer that they should emulate it, it would fall foul of the proscription provision. However, simply glorifying something would not fall foul of the provision. Some glorification will undoubtedly constitute a reference to behaviour and terrorism in a way that encourages emulation but some will not. The amendment would get rid of the concept of glorification. That is a great improvement.

 The Home Secretary can read what my noble Friend Lord Kingsland said. He took the view that the Government&#039;s slavish adherence to glorification was unproductive. He and many other peers on the Front and Back Benches criticised that. However, he said that the Opposition believed that the argument might have been exhausted and they therefore abstained on the vote. So many peers of all parties, including the Labour party, took objection to &quot;glorification&quot; that they defeated the Government despite the Government&#039;s turning out their troops in large numbers.

That would include allowing people to be deemed to be members of a proscribed organisation on the basis of the hearsay evidence of a police officer. That measure has never been used since it was introduced. There are an awful lot of added-on bits that we could get rid of. However, we are in the hands of the Government, and I can easily envisage the circumstances in which the Home Secretary&#151;despite having been completely honest when making the point in relation to control orders&#151;could come to the House in 18 months&#039; time and say, &quot;I&#039;m sorry, but there is insufficient parliamentary time.

 With the greatest respect to the Home Secretary, his reaction to our sincere and, as it happens, rather open attempts to reach agreement, as revealed by the amendment, will discourage us the next time that we wish to achieve cross-party agreement on such matters. My recollection is that the UN&#039;s use of the word &quot;glorification&quot; was heavily qualified by legal understandings of intention and purposeful activity in the act of glorifying&#151;understandings that have been excluded from this Bill.

If so, the amendments before us deliver precisely what they want. They also include the refinements described by the hon.

We had the leadership of the African National Congress, the SWAPO leadership, people from the Congress party in India and many others who have been condemned for terrorism. In public meetings from time immemorial through to the present, they would make speeches about liberation struggles in other parts of the world that could be construed as glorifying terrorism.

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Have the Government given you, and through you the House, any explanation of their extraordinary behaviour in pulling the business at about two hours&#039; notice? Have the Government Whips had such a bad week that they need to go home early to lie down? It is virtually unprecedented in my experience of the House that an important Bill coming to its final stages is suddenly hoicked from the Order Paper for no reason, and the Government do not have the courtesy to give the House an explanation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_362"><a name="60316-31_spnew1"><b> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. The hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green) makes a point that I made a couple of hours ago. May I add to that&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>





<p><a name="st_363"><a name="60316-31_spmin0"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker  (Sylvia Heal): </b> 
 Order. The hon. Gentleman is making a point of order to the Chair.
</p>





<p><a name="st_364"><a name="60316-31_spnew2"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Has there been any indication from the Leader of the House that he anticipates making another business statement on Monday in order to correct the incorrect business statement that he made earlier today, which made no reference to further consideration of the Bill at any time during the next couple of weeks?
</p>





<p><a name="st_365"><a name="60316-31_spmin1"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 I have received no such indication from the Leader of the House. Returning to the original point of order, it is, of course, the prerogative and responsibility of the hon. Member in charge of the Bill or motion to decide whether to proceed. I am not aware of any other explanation, but I have no doubt that the Bill will return at a later stage.
</p>





<p><a name="st_366"><a name="60316-31_spnew3"><b> Mr. Edward Garnier  (Harborough) (Con):</b> 
 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker, on Friday 3 March I raised a point of order with the Second Deputy Chairman in relation to an incident that took place at Nottingham East Midlands airport on 4 March. In response, the Second Deputy Chairman quite properly said that that was not a matter for him, but that he felt sure that the relevant Minister, namely one from the Department for Transport, would read what was said and would no doubt respond. I raised that point of order two weeks ago, and I have heard nothing since then, apart from noisy night flights out of that airport. Is there any way in which you can encourage the Minister with responsibility for aviation or one of the more senior Ministers in that Department to apply their mind to what is a serious problem and have the courtesy to this House and to a MP to respond?
</p>





<p><a name="st_367"><a name="60316-31_spmin2"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 I can only repeat to the hon. and learned Gentleman what my colleague, the Second Deputy Chairman, has already said&#151;there is nothing that I can do. However, he may want to consider another way of getting a response to his question other than a point of order.

<a name="60316-31_head1"><h3 align=center>Water Shortages (West Sussex)</h3>


<p><a name="st_368"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That this House do now adjourn<i>.&#151;[Claire Ward.]</i></p>



<a name="time_9">
<a name="60316-31_time0"><h5>4.16 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_369"><a name="60316-31_spnew4"><b> Nick Herbert  (Arundel and South Downs) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful for this opportunity to raise what is becoming one of the most serious issues for local people in West Sussex, which is the shortage of water. The past two years have been the driest period in the south-east since 1922, surpassing even the most serious post-war drought, which many of us remember, between 1974 and 1976. Many parts of the south-east have experienced less than three quarters of their long-term average rainfall in that period, and last winter was the second driest in Sussex since 1904. Only four of the past 16 months have seen rainfall reach average levels, and research commissioned by the south-east counties leaders group in 2004 found that less than half of the rainfall experienced in the region recharges water resources, which means that the south-east has less water per head than Syria.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_220">Current water levels continue to cause concern. Despite some rainfall last month, river levels in West Sussex are at their lowest level for three decades&#151; for example, the Ouse was flowing at only 41 per cent. of its long-term average last month. Almost 70 per cent. of water supplies in the south-east come from underground, so it is particularly worrying that groundwater levels are still below the long-term average for this month. On 9 March, the Bewl reservoir, which serves 400,000 people in Kent and East Sussex, was only 53 per cent. full, which is the lowest level that the reservoir has reached at this time of the year since it was built in 1974&#151;for comparison&#039;s sake, the average level for this time of year is 84 per cent.
</p>





<p><a name="st_370"><a name="60316-31_spnew5"><b> Mr. Nicholas Soames  (Mid-Sussex) (Con):</b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important Adjournment debate. He is aware, because he is coming to an infrastructure seminar tomorrow in East Grinstead in my constituency, that the Weirwood reservoir is even lower than Bewl. Is he aware that the Government have imposed on West Sussex county council a target to build 4,000 new houses at East Grinstead and that the requirement for extra water for those houses will be 6.75 million litres a day? Where does he think that that water will come from, and does he agree that that is not sustainable development?
</p>





<p><a name="st_371"><a name="60316-31_spnew6"><b> Nick Herbert: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend and agree with everything that he says. That is indeed the worry&#151;where will the water come from in order to support the additional housing demand? I pay tribute to him for holding his infrastructure seminar tomorrow, at which leaders of the county councils and others will discuss the problem of the infrastructure deficit. That was also addressed by the private Member&#039;s Bill promoted by my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude), which West Sussex Members were delighted to support and which suggested that there should be a proper audit of the infrastructure requirements of a development before it goes ahead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_221">The Weirwood reservoir is at about half its normal level, and the Environment Agency has confirmed that only one of the seven reservoirs serving the southern 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1691</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>region is at normal levels for this time of year. That has a serious impact in several ways. First, it affects farming. The south-east is one of England&#039;s most important regions for arable farming and horticulture, which takes place in the south of my constituency. The drought is already causing concern as the key growing season looms. The Environment Agency&#039;s report, &quot;Drought Prospects&quot;, published last month, set out three possible scenarios for the summer: average rainfall for February to April, 80 per cent. of the average during that period, or 60 per cent. of the average. The report stated that if the south-east were to receive only 60 per cent. of the average for this time of year,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51">&quot;Farmers would find groundwater and surface water sources to be very unreliable and could expect restrictions on spray irrigation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_222">That will have a direct impact on the supplies of the food that they produce and on their profitability, which is already being challenged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_223">Secondly, there is an environmental impact, including on local wildlife. Some of the finest wetland nature reserves in England are located in the south-east, such as Pulborough Brooks in my constituency. I suspect that the Minister may know about that. The ground is increasingly dry for the hundreds of pairs of lapwings and redshanks that traditionally breed in the south-east, and as flood plains dry out there are ever fewer places where these birds can breed and nest. At Pulborough Brooks reserve, just one pair of lapwings produced chicks last year, compared with 10 pairs in a normal year. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that that is because of the drought.

<a name="stpa_224">In terms of the prospect now confronting us, the Environment Agency has warned that water companies in the south-east, such as Southern Water, which largely serves my constituency, will need to do several things, all of which I wish to discuss. They include maintaining hosepipe bans, educating the public further about the severity of the drought, increased leakage control, and ensuring that their own drought plans are taken in good time.

Following Thames Water&#039;s announcement of a hosepipe ban, that extension will affect another 3.5 million people.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. People watching it may be confused because, only a few years ago, there were television images of villages that were almost washed away. Barrels from the brewery in Lewes in another part of Sussex were seen floating down the river and the city of Chichester was severely damaged. However, we have long-term water shortage problems in the south-east, which will be compounded for reasons that my hon. Friend will outline. Does he believe that there is any scope for designation as an area of water shortage, as is possible under the Water Industry Act 1999, to draw attention to our long-term problems?

<a name="stpa_228">A big population increase is projected in the south-east. That is set to happen against a background in which, nationally, household water use has increased by more than half since 1971. Just over 8 million people currently live in the south-east but that population is projected to grow by more than 1 million in the next two decades. The South East England regional assembly, at the behest of the Deputy Prime Minister, said that it wants an additional 578,000 homes built in the next 20 years. That is an annual average of 28,900 across the south-east. Fifty-eight thousand homes will be located in West Sussex&#151;a build rate of 2,900 a year. Yesterday, a report in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> highlighted Government projections and estimated that, on top of those figures, up to 5 million new homes will be needed in England in the next 20 years. Ironically, a subsequent report in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> ran a feature on the hosepipe bans and water shortages in the south-east. There is a clear connection between the increase in population, the projected increase in house building and the current scarcity of water. It is important that all concerned take that connection on board and plan properly for it.

<p>
<a name="60316-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_238">There is also a possibility of an extension to the proposed hosepipe ban, which would involve a ban on non-essential use. That idea has been floated in the local media, and I understand from meetings with Southern Water that there is every likelihood that such a ban will be introduced in its part of West Sussex shortly. A non-essential use ban would mean not only that people could not use a hosepipe to wash their car, but that they 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1694</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>would not be able to wash their car at all. Under such a ban, people could not even wash their car using a bucket and a sponge. As the public become increasingly aware of the severity of these measures&#151;which will be put in place at the beginning, not the end, of the summer&#151;they will quite rightly make further demands to find out what is being done to ensure that a proper water supply is available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_239">I understand that the water companies plan on the basis that there will be a drought once every 10 years, and that measures such as those bans are therefore acceptable. I believe that that planning scenario should be revisited. It is unacceptable to work on the assumption that there will be hosepipe bans once every 10 years. That is not the case in other parts of the world, and I do not see why people living in the south-east&#151;and in West Sussex in particular&#151;should have to live under that presumption.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_240">There are two ways of dealing with this situation. First, there should be an increase in supply. Local people will want to know what the water companies are doing about investing in new reservoirs, for example. Secondly, and more contentiously, we could moderate demand by introducing water meters. I fully accept that there is a case for that, but if metering is to be extended, the water companies must address their leakage problems first, in order to maintain public confidence in their actions. If the public were being asked to pay the price of the shortages through water metering, but the water companies were not meeting their responsibility to deal with leaks, that could lead to a breakdown in relations between the water companies and the public. I am sure that the water companies are alive to that risk.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_241">Water meters are now on the agenda, following the application for water scarcity status in Folkestone by Folkestone and Dover Water. The number of metered households in the country has increased, and more than a fifth of properties in Sussex now have metered water. That is partly as a result of meters being installed automatically in new homes. Also, as someone who is about to purchase a new home in West Sussex, I have discovered that simply transferring ownership within the county means that I shall have to install a water meter. People can also volunteer to have a water meter. I appreciate that it is intended to increase the numbers of homes with water meters by those means, and Southern Water aims to increase the take-up to 44 per cent. by 2010. However, that is some way short of the target that will be necessary to ensure that we have adequate demand management measures, in concert with supply, to supply the additional housing over the same period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_242">It is clear that water metering has a beneficial impact. Consumers cut their consumption by some 10 per cent. on average when meters are installed. It is significant that the Isle of Wight, where more than 90 per cent. of the 65,000 homes are metered, has not had a hosepipe ban since 1976. One has now been introduced, but much later than the bans introduced in other parts of the south-east. That suggests that metering is a successful part of the formula for dealing with that problem, but it is only a part.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_243">On international comparisons, as so often in relation to environmental matters, we are behind many of our peer group countries. There is 100 per cent. water metering for the supply to the six Scandinavian cities of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1695</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Oslo, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm&#246;. There is 100 per cent. water metering in urban authorities in Australia and very high levels of water metering in the Netherlands. As politicians, we have to decide the extent to which we recognise our responsibilities to take decisions that might be unpopular but are in the interests of the environment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-32_para16">
<a name="stpa_244">It has also been suggested that we should have a national grid for water. However, it would be prohibitively expensive. Because 1 cu m of water weighs a tonne, it would require enormous amounts of energy to pump the water from the north of England to the south. The water would also have to be clean. It would not be possible to pump untreated water and put it into rivers, because of the environmental impact of shifting wildlife from one part of the country to the other. It is important that if such measures are to be put aside, the Government and the water companies tell us precisely what will happen to ensure that every household has a water supply in parts of the country such as West Sussex, especially given the huge increase in housing that is expected. We may disagree about the merits of that housing and its location, but it is perfectly reasonable of local people to request that it should be accompanied by an adequate water supply. There is plainly insufficient water at present, which undermines public confidence that supplies will be available in the future.

 I offer my sincere thanks to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) for allowing me to contribute to his Adjournment debate on this important issue. Members who represent West Sussex are not divided politically about the difficulties that we face, although we might not agree on how to tackle the problem and the factors that contribute to the water shortage in the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_246">I note from parliamentary questions that many Members with constituencies in West Sussex have taken a deep interest in the problem and have been keen to ensure that Ministers are pressed on it. Owing to the very dry periods that we have experienced lately, our area is being described as semi-arid, which may shock our constituents but is entirely accurate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_247">We should recognise, however, that such periods are cyclical, occurring&#151;as the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs pointed out&#151;every 10 years. We need a measured and reasonable response to what is a sad state of affairs, especially in our part of the world. Our reservoirs present a picture that makes us all feel incredibly concerned.
</p>





<p><a name="st_375"><a name="60316-33_spnew1"><b> Mr. Soames: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is right to say that this is not a political matter. She is also right to say that there is a cyclical element in climate changes of this sort. Nevertheless, the cyclical element has occurred at a time when the Government have imposed massive house building targets on West Sussex. In mid-Sussex alone, an infrastructure deficit of over &#163;1 billion has been 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1696</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>necessary to cope with the projected new building. How does the hon. Lady think the Government will deal with that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_376"><a name="60316-33_spnew2"><b> Laura Moffatt: </b> 
 I was about to say that this is probably where the divide occurs. I do not consider it responsible to say that because of water shortages we should not have the houses that our area needs so desperately. The hon. Gentleman, who knows the constituency of Crawley extremely well, is aware of the pressure for new housing. I believe that we can accommodate the building of houses for people in desperate need, while developing a sense of self-awareness among those who are lucky enough to have homes already, with access to fresh potable water.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_248">A series of parliamentary questions and letters to, in particular, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have asked what is considered when new housing is proposed. It is important to ensure that a precious resource is taken properly into account before any new building takes place. I have found the advice I have received extremely useful, and I make sure that my constituents receive it as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_249">I was interested by the hon. Gentleman&#039;s proposition that the water company should be a statutory consultee. I have spent quite a bit of time with the water companies, particularly South East Water. I was impressed by the work that South East Water is doing to reduce leakage, improve supply and ensure that people think carefully about how they use their precious resource, but I do not think that making the company a statutory consultee is the answer. The water company&#039;s business is to supply water, and I suspect that no matter what question it is asked, it will say, &quot;We can supply water.&quot; The guidance from the ODPM is therefore an important element in ensuring that that is so. I do, however, firmly believe that the water companies are playing a significant role, as are local authorities, in making us understand our responsibility as tenants and home owners in West Sussex.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_250">Interesting measures have been taken in Crawley to ensure that we conserve our precious water supplies. Recently, my constituents were able to buy water butts for their gardens at an incredibly low price, subsidised by the local authority. It understood that people are keen to take such steps and the service was very heavily used. In fact, we had a really jolly weekend. Some of the people who came to get a water butt decided to come back for a second one when they discovered another drainpipe on their roof that could enable them to save even more water. There was also an education centre, which gave advice on saving water. We know that we could accommodate more house building if more people took such steps. Putting just one brick or &quot;hippo&quot; in our cisterns can enable others to access fresh water. We should share much of that advice.
</p>





<p><a name="st_377"><a name="60316-33_spnew3"><b> Mr. Soames: </b> 
 This debate is of course about water, and the hon. Lady is rightly telling us about the excellent and admirable things that Crawley borough council is doing. I do not want to interrupt this cosy consensus, but the problem is not just water. In fact, as she rightly says, water can be produced and it can be pumped from Wales, Scotland or anywhere. The problem is the overall infrastructure package, which includes not just water, but sewerage, roads and railways. All of that requires 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1697</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>enormous investment if Crawley or anywhere else in West Sussex is to cope with the demands being imposed, which will come under the heading of sustainable development.
</p>





<p><a name="st_378"><a name="60316-33_spnew4"><b> Laura Moffatt: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention and I do not disagree one bit. I am simply trying to ensure that water is included in that very important overall infrastructure package, because it is sometimes forgotten about.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_251">Many steps can be taken. Personal responsibility should extend not only to our own homes&#151;we should also take steps to help others. Self-awareness and self-promotion for home owners is very important, and we can create a much better infrastructure if we make sure that people understand that water is part of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_252">There have been some fantastic campaigns, such as Water Wise. South-east water companies have taken a very active role, alongside Government officials, in examining all aspects of water supply. Importantly, a statutory duty will be placed on the Environment Agency to ensure that it properly examines the water supply in a particular area. That follows on from the Water Act 2003, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for helping me to understand how that duty will impact on future consideration of water supply.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_253">So much is being done on this crucial issue. We should not alarm people to the point where they feel that all future house building should be rejected because of possible water shortages. We should ensure that we take a responsible attitude to this issue, which the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs certainly did in his speech. Labour Members will want to ensure that water metering does not result in water being a scarce resource for low-income families. My son is an environmental health officer and his entire reason for becoming one was to help ensure that people have decent living conditions. He would be absolutely horrified if we tried to impose water metering on everyone, although it is a good idea for many. People who have meters find it very upsetting to watch others on relatively high incomes wash their cars and then aim the hosepipe down the drain when they have lunch.
</p>

<a name="60316-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_254">Finally, we can tackle the problem in other ways. A young man in Crawley, who was educated in Crawley school, has developed a no-water car-cleaning product. I hope that such technologies will help to ensure that we in West Sussex keep our precious resource of water.

<a name="60316-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_255">We have had problems in Roehampton in my constituency that tie in with what has been said already in the debate. I want to give a view of the problem as it appears in a part of Greater London that is well developed and increasingly heavily populated. About two weeks ago, Thames Water decided to reduce the water pressure at the Putney pumping station, partly as a result of the increasing population in Wimbledon. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1698</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>There has also been a big problem with leaks locally, with two having to be fixed in my road in the past month.

<p>
<a name="60316-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_256">As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, it is incumbent on water companies to tackle leakages when they happen, but reducing the pressure at Putney pumping station has had a negative impact on some of my most disadvantaged constituents living on the Alton estate. They occupy very high council tower blocks, but the lower pressure means that the highest flats cannot get water pumped up to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_257">As a result, Thames Water has proposed to install what it calls a water booster pump in each of the tower blocks, at a cost that I believe will be in the region of &#163;50,000. The council is being asked to meet that cost, but the flats&#039; leaseholders will also have to pay their share. Some 300 people in my constituency have received bills of between &#163;800 and &#163;2,000, with the money going to pay for the water booster pumps in their tower blocks. Other taxpayers&#151;myself included&#151;are also contributing to that payment, as we are paying for the council tenants&#039; contribution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_258">I am especially worried about this matter. As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, the water companies must be careful to protect their relationship with their customers. The hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) said that water companies will never say that they cannot supply water, but I wish that she was right. In Roehampton and Putney, we are facing the problem that the water companies are saying exactly that&#151;that they cannot supply water to some homes. Ironically, it is people on lower incomes who live in affordable housing or council stock&#151;they may have managed to buy their own council property several years ago&#151;who now have to pay huge bills of up to &#163;2,000. I have written to Thames Water and to Ofwat about the problem, but unsustainable development in the south-east or West Sussex will ensure that the constituents of other hon. Members soon face problems similar to those that my constituents face. It is often the people who can least afford to pay who are being charged in the way that I have described.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-33_para13">
<a name="stpa_259">I hope that the Minister will be able to give advice or guidance to Ofwat and the water companies about the appropriateness of their behaviour, given that Thames Water made an after-tax profit last year of nearly &#163;200 million. A great deal of that profit is distributed to shareholders, but the company would do better to invest a little more in local pipe infrastructures before it asks tenants to pay for its inadequacies.

That is not to say that we should be complacent. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that we have had some of the lowest rainfalls since 1921 in the south-east of England and we are facing what may be one of the worst droughts for nearly 100 years. There are serious issues, and water companies have a duty to put drought plans in place&#151;I shall say a few words about those&#151;and they have been responding responsibly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_261">I want to touch upon a point raised by the hon. Gentleman and by my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt), that of development. It is true that for development, it is necessary to have the infrastructure to go with it. I shall concentrate on water tonight, but that is not to say that I do not recognise that there are other issues, such as transport, roads, schools, and hospitals, that go with new development. They are addressed in the structural plans. However, whatever the argument about numbers, it is clear that there is an overwhelming need for more homes, particularly in the south-east. That desire for more homes, which is felt by the constituents of hon. Members who are in the Chamber this evening, is something that we as a Government, and local authorities, cannot ignore. It is also true that we have to approach new communities on the basis of sustainable communities. Planning for water is part of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_262">The hon. Gentleman asked what steps were being taken in relation to development to ensure that there will be an adequate water supply. The South East England regional assembly is about to submit the complete draft of the regional special strategy for the south-east, the south-east plan, to the Government. The plan is on course for submission on 31 March. It will then go through consultation, independent testing and public examination before being approved by the Government in 2008. That plan addresses the issue of water supply. Water companies are statutory consultees in relation to structure plans and planning authorities will be statutory consultees on water company resource plans. It is a two-way process so that both know what is going on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_263">The Environment Agency, together with the water companies and the regional assembly, has undertaken modelling work on the impact of new house building on water supply. It has modelled six options based around the figures in the draft south-east plan and the impact of growth areas. It has concluded that a combination of supply and demand side interventions will mean that numbers can be accommodated. I want to make that clear. In relation to expansion of homes, numbers can be accommodated in terms of water resources.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_264">Interventions include an assumption on increasing water efficiency, and the possible construction of new reservoir infrastructure. New homes are much more water-efficient than existing stock, because of improvements in building regulations. The hon. Gentleman might be interested to know that the draft south-east plan, policy NRM2, sets out policy for a number of reservoirs. There are five in the draft plan. I have a list of all the reservoirs that are planned for the south-east. New reservoirs are planned for Southern Water at Broad Oak, for South East Water at Clay Hill, for Portsmouth Water Ltd.&#151;which supplies part of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1700</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Sussex&#151;at Havant Thicket and for Thames Water at Abingdon. There are proposals to extend existing reservoirs. The plans include raising Bewl for Southern Water and Mid Kent Water, where the proposal is to raise the banks and increase capacity significantly, the Bray enlargement for South East Water and Abberton for Essex & Suffolk Water. I was in Essex recently, talking to the local water company. I know that raising the banks at Abberton will increase the reservoir&#039;s capacity by 60 per cent. I am sure that the effect will be similar at Bewl. There is also provision for water transfers within regions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_265">I shall go through some of the measures introduced in the 2003 Act to manage future demand for water resources. They include time limits for all new abstraction licences; the facility to revoke without compensation abstraction licences where serious environmental damage has been caused, which relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs about damage to river ecosystems; greater flexibility to raise or lower licensing thresholds according to local pressure on water resources; and the extension of licensing to abstractors of significant quantities who are not included in the current licensing system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_266">Water company drought plans are a statutory requirement. Each water company must have plans to deal with drought, which has been helpful in dealing with the current situation. Water resource management plans are to become a statutory requirement. Consultation on the regulations is in progress and ends in April 2006. They will require water companies to look at future demand on a 25-year time scale. The 2003 Act also introduces new duties on the Secretary of State, regulators, water companies and public bodies to further water conservation. My hon. Friend the Member for Crawley made the important point that people can take simple measures to reduce water consumption: for example, not leaving the tap running or fitting water-saving devices such as spray taps, low-pressure shower heads and twin-flush toilets. None of those devices is particularly expensive and can be installed when modernising a bathroom or replacing fittings. We are also addressing such matters in new regulations on housing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_267">The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs mentioned water scarcity status. As he said, an application from Folkestone and Dover has been granted and the company&#039;s case was subject to a six-month examination. Any water company can apply for water scarcity status and such applications will be treated on their merits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_268">I was impressed that the hon. Gentleman had faced head-on the issue of water meters. They can be controversial, although the response from Folkestone and Dover was muted; 40 per cent. of the company&#039;s customers were already on meters, which may be part of the explanation. The company calculated that up to 70 per cent. of its customers would pay less on a meter, which is quite a significant number. Many people underestimate the benefits of water meters, although of course 30 per cent. will pay more because they are big users of water.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_269">Meters may pose problems for vulnerable groups, as my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley pointed out. I can reassure her, because the vulnerable groups 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1701</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>regulations are designed to protect large families on low incomes and people with certain medical conditions. A pilot scheme on water affordability is running in the south-west, which is helping us to understand how we might refine the regulations to improve them and make them more effective. We have an open mind about such things, but we want to make sure that water metering would not cause suffering for the most vulnerable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_270">There is an argument for metering; it reduces demand and is a fairer way of paying for water, but there is no water shortage in the north of England&#151;the most severe pressure is in the south and the south-east&#151;so there is not really a strong case for compulsory water meters nationally. We want an expansion in the use of water meters, but it should be undertaken as it is at present&#151;by the combination of people volunteering to use them and installing them in new homes or when people move. That means that their use is constantly increasing, but people still have a choice. It also spreads the cost of fitting the meters, which has had to be borne by the companies. So I think that is going okay.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_271">Where there is water scarcity, though, there is clearly an argument for compulsory metering, as one tool. It is not the only tool. Companies have a responsibility to ensure that there is proper supply management, which includes such things as addressing leakage; that is taken into account when companies apply for water scarcity status.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_272">I must correct the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs. He had me worried for a moment when he talked about washing cars with recycled water. When there is a hosepipe and sprinkler ban, it is permissible to use the bathwater to wash a car, or to take water out of the bath with a bucket and put it on the dahlias; that is not a problem and people do that. And of course one can collect rainwater, as my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley rightly said. In fact, I also benefited from a promotion by my local authority, which was giving away water butts. I was very enthusiastic. When I collected my water butt I found a party atmosphere, as my hon. Friend did. I suppose that the idea of getting something free from the council is always popular, so that probably explains the party atmosphere. It must have affected me, because I was so excited about my new water butt that I sawed through next door&#039;s downpipe when I connected it; but never mind&#151;it is connected now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_273">My hon. Friend also mentioned the range of measures that can be taken. She mentioned Water Wise, a group set up by the industry; I very much welcome that. We have also set up a water saving group, which I chair. It brings together the regulator, the Consumer Council for Water and industry representatives. The idea is to have working streams to look at ways of promoting water saving, in terms of demand and supply management, awareness and new technologies. That process is under way and I am grateful for the enthusiastic support that we have had from the entire industry. Water Wise is also represented on that group and I very much appreciate that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_274">The hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening) mentioned a constituency problem of reduced water pressure. I quite understand the point that she makes. Water pressure is sometimes reduced as a way of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Mar 2006 : Column 1702</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>combating leaks, and leaks are a problem in the Thames region. Thames, like all water companies, has targets to reduce leakage, but it has been missing those targets in recent years. I am glad to say that currently it is on target and I very much welcome that, but it has much more to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-34_para15">
<a name="stpa_275">Funnily enough, I had the opposite problem in my constituency. People had complained of low water pressure, and I asked the water company whether it could be increased. The company was very co-operative; it increased the pressure, with the result that the water main burst in the street concerned and no one got any water at all. My involvement in that was played down.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-34_para16">
<a name="stpa_276">The hon. Lady asked for some advice on what she could do. I understand that there is an obligation and a duty on water companies to provide minimum pressure to pump water to the topmost storey of a block of flats.
</p>

<p><a name="st_381"><a name="60316-35_spnew0"><b> Justine Greening: </b> 
 I am extremely grateful for that clarification, because I looked into the matter, and my understanding is that under the Water Industry Act 1991, the uppermost limit was 10 m. My flats were above that level, and there was no statutory duty to supply to any level above 10 m. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that. If I am incorrect, I shall be delighted.
</p>





<p><a name="st_382"><a name="60316-35_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I acknowledge that this is a local, constituency issue and an important one for the hon. Lady. I will find out exactly what the regulations are on that point, and I will write to inform her.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_277">On Thames Water, I want to make it clear that while it has met its target for this year, it has not met its overall target for leakages, and I do expect it to get on track in that regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_278">I do not want to say very much more, because I think that I have addressed the main points made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs. I recognise that those points are important, but the water supply in the south-east is not in crisis, although neither we nor the companies can ignore the fact reserves are very low. Of course, the companies have a duty to ensure that they match demand and resource management and to look ahead for future management.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_279">Some companies are also considering desalination. A small desalination plant is working in the southern region. Thames Water has also been talking about a desalination plant for peak management in the London region.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_280">Companies can apply for drought orders to minimise water loss and if they have to manage water by taking it away from non-essential users. No application for a drought order has been made at the moment. It may well be that, between now and the summer, we may have a bit more rainfall. It may well be that we do not have a dry summer. As I say, we cannot be complacent about these issues, and we must look at the long-term weather patterns. We must take into account issues such as climate change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60316-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_281">Droughts are not new&#151;droughts come and go&#151;but we need to be careful about whether we are seeing long-term trends. If we are seeing them, we must ensure that adaptations are made for them. That involves planning for water resource management, tackling issues such as leaking pipes and considering the powers available to water companies and their responsibilities in ensuring that water supplies are reliable.

<a name="stpa_282">This country now has one of the highest standards of drinking water quality, internationally. My hon. Friend the Member for Crawley is quite right to say that people should not order bottled water in restaurants; they should order jugs of water. Not only is ours some of the best quality drinking water in the world, but it has not been dragged halfway around the country or sometimes across the continent in trucks to be sold in restaurants. So on grounds of sustainability, I would certainly encourage people to ask for jugs of water in restaurants, not for bottled water. In fact, perhaps we should do a bit more of that in the Committees of the House of Commons, rather using bottled water.
