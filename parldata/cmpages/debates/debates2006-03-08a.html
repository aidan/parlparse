<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60308-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Local Government  (Mr. Phil Woolas): </b> 
 The average band D two-adult council tax bill in London boroughs was &#163;651 in 1997&#150;98 and &#163;1,162 in 2005&#150;06.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60308-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Evennett: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. Is he aware that there is great anger in my borough of Bexley at the increases over the past eight years, with another one to come in April? Families and pensioners have been hit hard by those increases, and in addition there is the very unpopular Olympic levy. How does he justify those rises?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60308-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 I advise the House that in the same period, the central Government grant to local authorities increased by some 78.5 per cent. in cash terms, representing more than 38 per cent. in real terms. Indeed, the figures for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s own local authority for the coming two years show grant increases, including in the dedicated schools budget, of 5.6 and 4.9 per cent.&#151;generous figures, I believe.

<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60308-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 Given the improvement in London&#039;s public services, including in the hon.

 The hon.

</p>


<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60308-01_spmin1"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister  (Mr. John Prescott): </b> 
 We have taken action through the Housing Act 2004 to reduce the abuse of right to buy, and we have cut the discounts for 41 housing-pressured areas. As a result, total sales have fallen, but we remain committed to helping people into home ownership. New opportunities are being offered through our homebuy schemes, and the provision of social rented housing is increasing. This will be a priority in the current spending review.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60308-01_spnew8"><b> John Robertson: </b> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend for his answer. While I accept that the right to buy has been very important to a lot of people&#151;not least to some in my constituency&#151;does he not agree that local authorities need to provide social housing as well as making houses available through the right to buy? Is it not time that we looked at the rules governing social housing, and helped those councils who want to supply good housing for people who cannot afford to buy?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="60308-01_spmin2"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 As I said, the action that we took in dealing with abuse of the right to buy led eventually to a reduction in the number of people 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 805</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>buying through that process, particularly in the London area. Through homebuy schemes, we are offering other opportunities to 300,000 more tenants, but we are constantly reviewing the situation. My hon. Friend must recognise that our decent homes programme has benefited more than 1 million people. Many people in his constituency will have benefited from that programme, as well as from the provision of housing in the public and private sectors.

 (Con): I hope that the Deputy Prime Minister is in favour of encouraging a property-owning democracy. If so, does he agree with me that housing association tenants have been badly discriminated against and should be given the right to buy their homes?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60308-01_spmin3"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 I think that tenants of housing associations already have the right to buy, but to extend that to the right to acquire would cost around &#163;1 billion more. We must make a judgment about the best use of public money. Tenants have the right to buy, but to extend that to the right to acquire would be expensive and also create financial problems for housing associations, as the previous Tory Administration noted, which was why they failed to implement that change.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60308-01_spnew10"><b> Christine Russell  (City of Chester)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend will know from his local links that the social housing stock of the city of Chester was decimated by the right to buy. As a result the average house price in Chester is now &#163;180,000, which is 10 times the salary of a newly qualified nurse or teacher. Can he give me an assurance that in the next round of the comprehensive spending review his Department will recognise the housing needs of people on relatively low wages who live in housing hot spots in the north? We have problems in the north&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60308-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b> 
 Order. The Deputy Prime Minister probably has the gist of that question.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60308-01_spmin4"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 I can reassure my hon. Friend on that point. She will know from the Chancellor&#039;s pre-Budget report that he said that greater priority would be given to social housing, and we await the Budget.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="60308-01_spnew12"><b> Alistair Burt  (North-East Bedfordshire)</b> 
 (Con): The Deputy Prime Minister is right to recognise the failure to deliver new social housing under his Government, as the number of completions in 2004&#150;05 was barely 56 per cent. of the completions 10 years ago under the Conservative Government. If the failure to provide social housing is of such concern, why have he and his Department stood back and done nothing to address the allegations that registered social landlords in Liverpool have, over several years, been voiding and tinning up good quality homes, contributing to the dereliction of areas and encouraging the demolition, not refurbishment of properties, which is at the heart of the growing resentment in Liverpool at the progress of the pathfinder programme? Why has he done nothing to address that failure by social landlords?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 806</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60308-01_spmin5"><b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> 
 It is interesting to note that the Conservatives have discovered Liverpool again, perhaps to try to obtain some electoral representation in the area&#151;because they have none at present. Let us be clear about the position. We made a judgment in 1997 that we should put more resources into improving 2 million homes that had been left in less than decent conditions by the previous Administration, who&#151;six years before&#151;had halved the amount of money invested in housing. We have improved more than 1 million houses. They may not be new houses, but people who live in them appreciate the new kitchens, bathrooms and central heating, which make a difference to their quality of life. The right-to-buy programme was at the expense of millions of tenants who saw the standard of their houses falling. We have been correcting that.

</p>


<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60308-02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Yvette Cooper): </b> 
 The Housing Corporation has provided some &#163;80 million for new social housing over this two-year period, which is a substantial increase for Birmingham compared with previous years and, in addition, a growing proportion of new affordable homes has come from section 106 agreements. We will announce the next allocations from the Housing Corporation shortly.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60308-02_spnew0"><b> Lynne Jones: </b> 
 My hon. Friend will be aware that three quarters of council lettings are to homeless people, compared with a third in 1997. Likewise, housing association tenancies are overwhelmed by homeless and clearance cases, leaving little availability for others in housing distress on waiting lists. However, thousands more homes are due to be demolished because of a lack of money to bring them up to a decent standard. The Government made &#163;650 million available for stock transfer&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60308-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker: </b>

 What does my hon. Friend say to those tenants who ask why that money cannot be made available to invest in council housing and building new homes?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="60308-02_spnew3"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to say that we have made money available for Birmingham. We have increased the resources available directly to Birmingham and we have also made options available for it to increase its housing to the decent homes standard. I know that the recent independent report by Anne Power on the approach taken by Birmingham city council was critical, and I am also concerned that the council&#039;s approach to pushing up the cost of land for housing associations also raises questions about the ability to deliver new social housing. We are investigating that.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="60308-02_spnew4"><b> John Hemming  (Birmingham, Yardley)</b> 
 (LD): Does the Minister not agree that, if the council were allowed to spend more than 25 per cent. of the right-to-buy proceeds on building new affordable properties, that could have a serious effect on reducing homelessness?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="60308-02_spnew5"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 As I have said, we have doubled the resources going into new social housing since 1997, and we are increasing new social house building by 50 per cent. over the next few years. We are raising additional resources from a range of different routes to invest in social housing, but the hon. Gentleman should raise with Birmingham city council the need for it to work with housing associations to increase support for new social housing, because we will only get the additional social housing that we need if the council works with housing associations, rather than working against them.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="60308-02_spnew6"><b> Richard Burden  (Birmingham, Northfield)</b> 
 (Lab): My hon. Friend mentioned the independent commission of inquiry into council housing in Birmingham, chaired by Professor Anne Power. Is she aware of the commission&#039;s latest report, which emphasises not only that, if Birmingham is to tackle its housing agenda, it needs to develop a much more vibrant, community-based housing approach, but that, crucially, since the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives took over the council, the neighbourhood agenda is now slipping
</p>
<ul>

<p>
<a name="60308-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">Does she not agree that, if Birmingham is to tackle its housing agenda, the council must learn to let go?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="60308-02_spnew7"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. In fact, there should be strong support for community-led programmes to devolve much of the decision making to local neighbourhoods, as he and the Anne Power report have advocated, and Opposition Members should ask some questions of Birmingham city council.
</p>

 (Con): Great cities, such as Birmingham, have a regenerated heart&#151;the magnificent Bullring, with its caf&#233; culture and its luxury apartments&#151;but, sadly, most first-time buyers simply cannot afford to live there. In the face of the decline in the number of first-time buyers in this country&#151;from 500,000 in 1997, down to 320,000 last year&#151;the Government are proposing to help just 100,000 of them with shared equity in the lifetime of this Parliament. Why such poverty of ambition?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="60308-02_spnew9"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 I find the hon. Lady&#039;s question astonishing. We are proposing very strong and ambitious programmes to build more houses, which this country needs. In fact, 190,000 new households are being created each year, and we are building only about 160,000 new homes. We need to build more new homes, including in the west midlands, but she is opposing new development in her constituency and arguing that it should not take place there but elsewhere. If Opposition Members keep opposing new homes in their constituencies, we will never get the new homes that first-time buyers and the next generation need. That is the challenge to improving affordability.

<p><a name="st_o30"><a name="60308-02_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Jim Fitzpatrick): </b> 
 Exercise Osiris 2 allowed London&#039;s emergency and health services to practise their response to a chemical attack on the tube. Home Office and other Ministers were closely involved in the subsequent analysis of lessons, which were incorporated into our emergency planning programme and contributed significantly, with other action and exercises, to building the quality of preparedness that we saw demonstrated in London on 7 July last year.

 May I thank the Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister for making briefings available to me? During Exercise Osiris, it was made clear that there would be further exercises, involving not just the emergency services, but the public. Since then, the tube has been attacked successfully, there has been a failed attack on the tube and I believe that there has been at least one foiled attack on the tube, yet there have been no further exercises on that scale, involving the public. Why?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="60308-02_spnew11"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 I may assure the hon. Gentleman that in the first instance lessons from Osiris 2 have been learned on procuring new equipment, amending procedures and introducing new techniques. A number of major exercises have taken place subsequently, not just in London, but in Newcastle and Birmingham, and we had Operation Atlantic Blue in conjunction with the US and Canada in January this year. Three major counter-terrorism exercises are held in the UK every year, as well as smaller regional exercises and table-top exercises. There is an ongoing examination of our contingency planning and preparedness. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman received a briefing earlier this week.

 I thank the Minister for his response, but does he agree that in light of the number of armed service personnel serving in Iraq this is a growing problem, despite the evidence that it may be reducing?

 Under homelessness legislation, since July 2002, applicants seeking help from a housing authority who are unintentionally homeless and vulnerable as a result of serving in Her Majesty&#039;s forces are in a priority needs category, and are owed a main homelessness duty. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Ministry of Defence have commissioned research from King&#039;s College, London on the extent, causes, impact and costs of rough sleeping and homelessness among ex-service personnel, as well as on ways in which that can be prevented.

<p><a name="st_o63"><a name="60308-03_spmin8"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It is very important that we get hospitals with financial deficits back into surplus. However, we must be clear about this matter, and a review of the past few years shows the difference that investment and reform have made. Under this Government, waiting lists have fallen by something like 400,000. Whereas almost 300,000 people used to wait 15 months for their operations in 1997, no one now waits more than six months.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o64"><a name="60308-03_spnew17"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b>

 Nigel Crisp gave his reasons for standing down in his statement yesterday, but let me say that he was a superb public servant who, in the past few years, has overseen a transformation of the health service. Moreover, we should get the question of deficits in context. The total deficit is less than 1 per cent. of the NHS annual bill, but the most important fact is that 50 per cent. of that deficit is in 6 per cent. of trusts. It is true that there is a substantial financial deficit in the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s area&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, but there have also been massive real-terms increases in the amount of money going in&#151;money that he voted against. That is why we have to have proper systems of financial transparency. We are putting in a huge investment, but it is for local hospital organisations to make sure that they balance the books. In fact, the majority of them are doing just that.

<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 814</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Sir Nigel said that he had wanted to stay for at least another year, and that he wanted to leave when things were &quot;on the up&quot;&#151;something that I am sure that the Prime Minister feels some sympathy with. He also said that the NHS&#039;s structural problems were getting worse, that managers were under less pressure to get the finances right, and that financial problems were now being revealed. What responsibility do Ministers take for such matters?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o67"><a name="60308-03_spmin10"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Ministers are responsible, but both Sir Nigel and Ministers can be extremely proud of the following achievements in the national health service&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I know that Opposition Members do not want to hear the fact that there are 80,000 more nurses in the national health service and 30,000 more doctors; that waiting for cataract operations is down from two years to three months; that now no one waits for heart operations for more than three months; that cancer deaths are down by 14 per cent., saving 43,000 lives; and that deaths from heart disease are down 30 per cent., saving 83,000 lives. Yes, of course there are problems in our national health service, like any health care system in the world, but if we compare today and the levels of not just funding but achievement with 1997, the issue for the national health service today, in part thanks to what Sir Nigel has done, is how we improve it, not what it used to be in 1997, which was whether we could save it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o68"><a name="60308-03_spnew19"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b> 
 In public, the Prime Minister gives us these lists of success; in private, he knows that things are going wrong and is sacking the chief executive. Is this not just the latest example of mismanagement in the NHS? The Government set up primary care trusts; now they are scrapping half of them. They introduced strategic health authorities; now most of them are going. They have poured money into the NHS, but there is an &#163;800 million deficit and the outgoing chief executive said that things are getting worse, not better. When will Ministers take responsibility for their failures, instead of seeking to blame others?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o69"><a name="60308-03_spmin11"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Sir Nigel certainly did not say that the national health service is getting worse not better. The national health service, on any basis, as every independent report has shown, is indeed getting better. The reason why I read out the achievements of the past few years is because it used to be the case that literally hundreds of thousands of people waited more than a year on in-patient waiting lists; no one does today. It used to be the case that waiting lists went up every single year; they have fallen by almost 500,000 in the past five or six years. Just today, we are announcing at Barts the largest scheme that is going to mean fantastic opportunities for patients and clinicians throughout that part of London. Every penny piece was opposed by the right hon. Gentleman and the Conservative party. So, when he says that the national health service has challenges and issues, of course it does, but no one believes that the national health service is not better today than it was eight or nine years ago, and that is the result of not just investment and reform, but the fact that when he was still advocating the patient&#039;s passport to take money out of the NHS, this party stood by the NHS, stood by its values, stood by its principles and will make it better still.

But I have to say to him that I still think that there is a major challenge&#151;this is what the energy review will answer in the next few months&#151;as to whether we can really make sure that we meet both our energy needs and our environmental targets without nuclear power in the mix. That is something that we will obviously have to consider over the next few months, but let me just make one thing clear: the Sustainable Development Commission asks whether nuclear power is the answer, but no one has ever said that it is the whole answer.

There is the renewable energy that I was just talking about a moment or two ago. There are all the issues to do with energy efficiency, where again the Government are investing a large sum of money. Our Government are investing about &#163;600 million this year in various forms of clean technology.

Even though the economy has been growing far faster than the level of emissions, it will be highly challenging to meet that target. That should not diminish our pride as a country in having met our Kyoto targets, which were substantial, and in the leadership role that this country is playing round the world in tackling climate change. As he knows, in the end the single biggest thing that we can do, apart from giving leadership in the UK, is to make sure in international terms that America, China and India in particular are all working together.

 I have not had an opportunity to study that recommendation, but I sympathise with the position in which farmers find themselves, which is why we established the code of practice, particularly when they are trying to restructure their own businesses. In meetings in the past few months, we have looked carefully at how we can respond to that concern in a way that is consistent with the interests of consumers, too. The code of practice should be adhered to, and I know that many parts of the farming community believe that it has been broken. We will carefully examine the matter, and if necessary, we will take further action.

 I cannot comment on the funding of the particular service in my hon. Friend&#039;s area, but her general point is absolutely right. We are putting a great deal of money into supporting work on domestic violence, and we have established domestic violence courts. Women are more willing and able to come forward and report domestic violence, and the police and the courts treat such matters much more seriously. As we roll out domestic violence courts across the country, I hope that those benefits will become more widely spread.

 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. Although, as he rightly implies, voices have been raised strongly against nuclear power in recent days, many people, including, for example, the Energy Research Centre, believe that it is important that nuclear power is part of the energy mix. We need a clear-sighted debate on the energy security needs of our country in a world in which security of energy supply is becoming increasingly difficult. We also need to take a hard-headed look at not only what we want to happen on greenhouse gas emissions, but what can practically be done in order to reduce them, and we should take the necessary decisions on that basis. As my hon. Friend has said, it is important to recognise that many sensible people who have looked at the issue over a significant period of time believe that nuclear power should be part of the mix.

<a name="60308-05_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">I should like to outline my personal experience, which has urged me to try to introduce the Bill. My husband Steve died of cancer 14 years ago. At the time we were a family with three small children and, having had nothing to do with the benefits system, I was unaware that there were benefits to which we were entitled, which would have helped us at a difficult time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-05_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Anyone who has been through the earth-shattering diagnosis of terminal illness will say that money is the last thing on their mind. However, it helps enormously with all the bills that accrue when nursing somebody who is terminally ill. Many people choose to die at home. It is an enormous help to know that some support is available with, for example, cleaning, personal care and extra food that is especially palatable for someone who feels ill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-05_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Over the years I have met many people who, like me, were unaware of the benefits to which they were entitled. There does not appear to be one particular person or delivery system to take responsibility for ensuring that patients and their families know that there are benefits that they are entitled to claim speedily. Consequently, I tabled an amendment to the Health Bill, which we considered recently, and I am promoting the Bill that we are considering now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">Coincidentally, days after I had done that, the Public Accounts Committee report entitled &quot;Tackling Cancer: Improving the patient journey&quot; was published, and I shall give the House a brief summary of its findings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-05_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">The report found that terminally ill cancer patients were often not made aware of the non-means-tested disability benefits that they could have claimed to alleviate financial hardship. That was estimated by Macmillan Cancer Relief to involve more than &#163;100 million over a six-month period. The report also highlighted the fact that three quarters of patients were given no information on financial benefits by the NHS or anyone else. However, research published in the report showed that nearly half those people would have welcomed such advice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-05_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Research carried out by Macmillan Cancer Relief in 2004 estimated that in 2001, terminally ill patients with six months or less to live failed to claim benefits worth &#163;106 million over a six-month period. A cynic might ask whether the Government do not want people to claim those benefits, but I do not believe that that is the case, because they have put in place measures to ensure speedy delivery, which is welcome. What we do not have in place, however, is a system for the delivery of information. Hon. Members across the House are worried that no one has been given responsibility for this, either now or historically. The problem has existed for a long time.

This is a sensitive topic involving health and benefits, and I want a firm assurance that the information will at least be given to patients, whether they choose to use it or not. At present, many people are denied that choice through ignorance. We must not allow our sensitivity to such issues to result in people not dying well.

After all, those are the health professionals most closely connected with the patient and their family. They are the professionals needed to sign the DS1500 form that will trigger the speedy delivery of the benefit. Doctors are paid by the DWP for each form filled in, but the patient or their representative has to require the doctor to issue and fill in the form. How can they do that if they are unaware of the benefit? This is a miserable and frustrating cycle of ignorance and deprivation.

The forms should be simple and sensitively worded so that the patient or their representative can decide whether to choose to use the system instead of languishing in ignorance. Let us not allow our sensitivity to a patient&#039;s plight to give us an excuse for inaction.

<a name="stpa_14">New GP contracts were introduced in April 2004. That might have been an ideal time to have considered this additional small responsibility.

<a name="60308-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_18">The House, or at least some Members of it, will no doubt recall that a Road Safety Bill was last presented to the House in November 2004, but unfortunately, it fell before the general election. Although this Bill essentially brings back the same measures, it has been improved in two significant ways. First, there are new offences of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving and of causing death by driving while unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured. On Second Reading of the previous Bill, there was a lot of debate on those matters. Secondly, the Bill contains a new offence of keeping an uninsured vehicle and a power to immobilise vehicles that do not meet insurance requirements. The power will be used to stop the owners of cars and lorries driving them when it is clear that they are not properly insured. I shall return to those measures later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_19">I should also point out that two measures in the previous Bill have now been enacted elsewhere. First, drink drive information may now be taken at the roadside, which avoids the need for the police to go back to the police station when they stop someone, and secondly, in order to bear down further on uninsured drivers, the police have been given new powers to use automatic number plate recognition cameras linked to the databases of insurance companies to spot uninsured vehicles. Across the country, police forces are now using ANPR cameras to stop cars, and they can tell whether they are licensed and insured. In the autumn I saw that being done in Birmingham, and it is highly effective. It was surprising how many people were caught in the hour or so that I saw the system being used. It is an important way of tackling uninsured drivers and will increase the likelihood of people who are driving on the road without being properly insured being caught.

Because mini motor cycles do not comply with construction and use regulations, they cannot be registered as road vehicles such as motor bikes, and thus are not allowed on the roads.

<a name="stpa_20">There is no doubt that those machines, some of which can go at 30 or 40 mph if not more, ridden by people who should not be driving anything on the road, let alone a moto, have the potential to cause immense damage, if not death. It is important that we are absolutely clear about the law. As I understand it, the law says that those vehicles are not allowed on the highway, which includes the pavements, so if a police officer finds someone driving one there, they have the power both to arrest the individual and to remove the machine. If the law lacks clarity or if there is any impediment, we should look into that before something serious happens. My hon. Friend has my assurance that we will look into the problem. It may be possible to do something during the passage of the Bill, but this may simply be a matter of making it clear to the police that there are already powers and that they should use them. If that is not the case, I should like to know what the problem is. There is no doubt that those machines are a source of irritation., and anyone buying one and putting a child on it is grossly irresponsible.

<a name="stpa_22">Nearly six years ago, in March 2000, we set out plans to reduce deaths and serious injuries on the roads by 40 per cent. by 2010, and by 50 per cent. among children. The latest figures, for 2004, showed that the number of people killed or seriously injured had fallen by 28 per cent.&#151;about 13,000 fewer casualties each year than in the mid-1990s, which is significant and more than halfway towards our target.

<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 830</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_26">The Bill has four key themes. The first is the need to deal with bad or irresponsible driving, whether it consists of speeding, drink-driving or carelessness. The second is the need to deal with motorists who break the law by driving without insurance, or using vehicles that are not roadworthy. Thirdly, we want to make it more difficult for foreign drivers to escape penalties for a specific range of driving offences in this country. Fourthly, we have proposed measures to raise standards and improve awareness. Let me say now, for the benefit of Members who may seek to intervene, that I will deal with those themes in that order.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_27">Research shows that all drivers consider themselves to be better than average. I do not know whether that applies to everyone who is present today, but apparently it is the case. Nevertheless, poor driving is a key factor in many accidents. For example, nearly a third of car occupants who die have been involved in single vehicle accidents&#151;accidents involving no other vehicle. Unfortunately, statistics suggest that the number of such accidents is increasing. It therefore seems sensible to bear down on some of the possible causes. One moment of carelessness or lack of attention can lead to serious consequences.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_28">Clauses 20 and 21 introduce new offences of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving and causing death by driving while unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_29">Much of our Second Reading debate on the earlier Bill, which my hon. Friend missed out on, concerned precisely those issues. Until now, while it was possible to convict someone for causing death by dangerous driving, if the driving was merely careless, it was not possible to convict. It is also important for us to be able to deal with drivers who are not insured, have not paid their tax or are disqualified. Until now a high level of proof has been required for conviction, and the clauses will make a substantial difference in that regard.
</p>





<p><a name="st_18"><a name="60308-07_spnew3"><b> Kitty Ussher  (Burnley) (Lab):</b> 
 I am very heartened by what my right hon. Friend is saying, as will be the family and friends of Levi Bleasdale and all those affected by her tragic death in my constituency. She was three years old when she was killed by a hit-and-run driver last year. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will understand my shock, and that of many of my constituents, at the lack of custodial sentences available for those who kill through careless driving. Does he share my outrage at the Conservatives&#039; attempts to water down our provisions in the other place? Will he commit himself to reintroducing a charge of causing death by careless driving with a maximum sentence of five years, triable in a magistrates court?
</p>





<p><a name="st_19"><a name="60308-07_spnew4"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 We will do that. I think it important for magistrates courts to have that disposal. As my hon. Friend is doubtless aware, conviction for causing death by dangerous driving will carry a sentence of up to five years.
</p>

<a name="stpa_30">It is of course for Parliament to determine the penalties, and the range of penalties, but I do not think that I am the only Member who thinks it important for the courts to regard someone who kills someone else using a car in the same way as someone using any other means of killing people.

<br>&nbsp;<br>of cases similar to that raised by my hon. Friend, in which constituents have lost young children, and someone has been convicted but justice is not seen to have been done. It is equally important for drivers to realise that the minute they sit behind a wheel they are driving something with the potential to cause death or serious injury.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_31">There has been a good deal of support in the House for the creation of that new offence. If the measure is passed, it will be on the statute book by the end of the year or the beginning of next year. The courts will have adequate powers; I hope that they will convict if the evidence justifies conviction, and, in particular, that the punishment will fit the crime. Taking a life is taking a life, no matter how it is done.

Will he congratulate the Institute for Advanced Motorists, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year? Does he agree that it is not a fuddy-duddy organisation, but an organisation for young and new drivers, and for very good drivers? Only last year, its president, Nigel Mansell&#151;a man of great driving talent&#151;recognised that it was appropriate for him to take the IAM course. His lead should be followed by every Member of Parliament.
</p>





<p><a name="st_21"><a name="60308-07_spnew6"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I have sometimes been tempted to take the course myself but have not got there yet. I agree that the institute is very important, and people should be encouraged to take its courses. I believe that some insurance companies give their clients credit for having taken them. In my experience, pointing to a financial advantage sometimes helps people along the way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_32">The Bill also seeks to change the law relating to drivers who are not insured. The present law allows illegal drivers to be prosecuted only for disqualified driving, driving without insurance or driving without a licence, unless their driving was at fault, in which case a charge of careless or dangerous driving would be applicable. Under the new proposals, a driver who was on the road illegally&#151;without insurance&#151;would be liable if, but for his presence on the road, an accident and consequent death would not have occurred, even if the standard of his driving was not at fault.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-07_para7">
<a name="stpa_33">That is a major step forward. It deals with a particular cause of concern throughout the country: people who steal cars, or do not bother to insure their cars. If such people are on the road and a fatal accident occurs, it must be right to enable the courts to act.

<p><a name="st_23"><a name="60308-07_spnew8"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Yes. A substantial body of case law in relation to that and other matters allows the court to hear the evidence and then come to a view as to whether someone is guilty of that offence. Careless and inconsiderate driving is defined in the Bill. The hon. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 832</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Gentleman is right: before someone can be sentenced, they have to be convicted in law beyond reasonable doubt, so the courts are well used to determining these matters. For example, prosecutors have to decide whether there is sufficient evidence that someone has caused death by dangerous driving or careless driving. The court has to decide whether that is the case, but it would be wrong of us not to give courts the option of being able to convict someone where the evidence points clearly to the fact that their conduct was such that the natural result was someone being killed, even though they perhaps did not intend that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-07_para8">
<a name="stpa_34">The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that the new proposal goes further than existing law, but I think that it is fully justified. The courts will, of course, be able to hear the evidence and come to a view. However, as with all these things, if he is making a bid to get on to the Committee that will scrutinise the Bill, he can no doubt explore the issue at greater length there.
</p>





<p><a name="st_24"><a name="60308-07_spnew9"><b> Mr. Peter Bone  (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> 
 Does the Secretary of State agree that the current situation is that if someone pleads guilty to careless driving, the court is in many cases not even told that someone died?

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60308-07_spnew10"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I will need to take some advice on that. The hon. Gentleman may be right but, in my view, when passing sentence, a court needs to be aware of all the circumstances. There is a world of difference between careless driving resulting in knocking over a flower pot and careless driving resulting in someone dying. The offence I have just described relates to someone who should not be on the road&#151;because their car is not insured, for example. The Bill goes a lot further. It would be inconceivable in such cases for the court not to know that there had been a fatality.

<p><a name="st_26"><a name="60308-08_spnew0"><b> Dr. Brian Iddon  (Bolton, South-East) (Lab):</b> 
 In many cases, a driver who kills commits a multitude of offences, but the feeling among families of the victims is that not all those offences are totted up. The three new offences that my right hon. Friend referred to a few minutes ago have a maximum penalty of two years&#039; imprisonment. Is it his view that if a driver has committed multiple offences, the court should tot up the sentences?
</p>





<p><a name="st_27"><a name="60308-08_spnew1"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 What to charge someone with is a matter entirely for the prosecutors in each case. It is not uncommon, as my hon. Friend knows, for someone to be charged with a number of offences. If they are convicted of all of them, the court has to take that into account. Equally, in some cases, someone is charged with one or two offences, rather than the lot, because that is what the prosecution thinks it can get a conviction on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_35">I strongly believe that decisions on whether to prosecute and what to charge someone with are matters for the independent prosecution authorities, not for Ministers or Parliament, but it is for Parliament to set the range of offences and decide what is the mischief that we are trying to get at. That is what we are attempting to do.

<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 833</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>walked in front of him, he hit them, knocked them down and, unfortunately and heaven forfend, killed them, after the Bill had been enacted, what would the difference be in the way he was treated?
</p>





<p><a name="st_29"><a name="60308-08_spnew3"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 As I explained earlier, the position would not change as regards someone who was driving along and was insured. The question would be whether they were driving carelessly or dangerously. Under the Bill, if someone were driving carelessly because they were not paying proper attention or doing something that reduced their attention to the road, they could be charged with causing death by careless driving. On the other hand, they could be blameless. If the person driving along was not insured and there was a fatality, then, depending on the circumstances, under the additional measure to which I referred, it might be possible to charge that person with an offence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_36">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that much depends on the circumstances of each case. We are plugging a gap because, until this Bill, hopefully, becomes law, it is not possible to charge a person with causing death by careless driving. Nor is it possible in every circumstance to get at someone who should not be on the road in the first place and whose car is involved in an accident involving a fatality. All those issues will no doubt be explored further in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_37">I have mentioned uninsured driving. Continuous registration has helped. The additional powers to which I referred earlier have helped in tracking people down and dealing with them where they have broken the law. Equally, electronic registration in the renewal of tax discs, which we introduced just last year, is helping to catch people who try to skip a month on their insurance, for example. However, the Bill also introduces a new offence of being the keeper of a vehicle, the use of which is not insured. Unless people have registered a statutory declaration and the thing is off the road, there will be an offence of keeping the car where it is not insured.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_38">The Bill increases penalties for careless and inconsiderate driving. The fine doubles to &#163;5,000. As I said, clause 30 defines careless and inconsiderate driving for the first time. There is already a statutory definition of dangerous driving. For using a hand-held mobile phone while driving and for failing to have proper control of a vehicle, a mandatory endorsement is introduced. For repeat offences of using a vehicle in a dangerous condition, there is mandatory disqualification if the offence is repeated within three years. That is a minimum of six months&#039; disqualification.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_39">Excessive speed contributes to just over a third of fatalities&#151;that means about 1,000 deaths every year&#151;as well as being a factor in another 40,000 injuries. Several police forces now offer &quot;low-end speeders&quot; the option of going on speed awareness courses, and that will be in the Bill as a disposal available to the courts. The Association of Chief Police Officers is putting in place a national programme of awareness courses, which, of course, we welcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_40">The greatest reduction in such casualties would come from reducing speed across the board, and that is where speed cameras come in. I believe that, on any view one cares to take, speed cameras are saving lives and

Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) raised the point&#151;we need to do more to ensure that the punishment fits the crime. A graduated system of penalties from two to six points, rather than the present system, would ensure that a distinction was made between someone who was just over the limit and someone who was driving way over the limit.

<p>
<a name="60308-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_41">I said last time&#151;the Bill provides for this&#151;that the Government would undertake consultation. Under the Bill, we have to consult, and people will be able to respond.

Obviously, when we consult fully, we will see what people have to say. After that consultation, there will be proposals.

I recognise that people have strong views on this proposal, and the last time we consulted on it, the division was about 50:50, with slightly more in favour of graduated penalties. If the Bill is passed, the next stage will be to consult on specific proposals, and depending on that consultation, we will put them before both Houses and they will be voted on. We must ensure that people appreciate that keeping their speed low is the important thing, but when someone does break the law, the

 In some areas, under the current system, drivers who speed at, for example, between 31 and 40 mph in a 30 mph zone might not be prosecuted unless and until they reach 40 mph. Under a system of variable endorsement levels, might not more such drivers end up being prosecuted because the endorsement level is less? I am not saying that that is necessarily an unwanted consequence, but might it not be one?

 I am not sure that that will be so, unless the general policy changes on how such cases are pursued. This is a classic case of different views being held in all parts of the House, and I am sure that we will have a decent discussion in Committee. I still tend to the view, which is the Government&#039;s, that we should have a graduated response, but I shall be interested to hear what Members have to say. All of us know of people who have been done for going just over the limit, and we must contrast that with someone who drives at 60 mph in a 40 mph zone, which is an extremely serious offence.

 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for giving way. I am intrigued by his earlier example of somebody driving at 66 mph in a 30 mph zone. Under the current system, surely such a person would be prosecuted through the courts, rather than receiving a fixed penalty from the police. In fact, it is quite possible that they would be prosecuted not just for speeding but for dangerous driving. Will his new measure take people who are guilty of driving at higher speeds out of the court system and away from public scrutiny?

 No. I think that I gave the example of someone driving at 66 mph in a 40 mph zone, and if I did not, I apologise. As it happens, 66 mph, according to guidelines from the Association of Chief Police Officers, is on the cusp in terms of being sent to court, so such a person might or might not be sent to court. I used that example because the point is that someone who does 66 mph in a 40 mph zone could get the same number of points and the same fine as someone who does 36 mph; I ask the House to reflect on that.

<a name="stpa_45">There has been a change in Britain&#039;s culture in terms of drink-driving. Generally speaking, the figures have come down since the 1970s, but alcohol is still a factor in about one in seven of all fatal crashes, accounting for some 500 deaths a year. What is worse, 20 per cent. of such offenders are repeat offenders. The statistics also show that younger, predominantly male drivers are more likely to be under the influence of alcohol. So we are giving the courts the power to make repeat drink-driving offenders re-take their driving test. That will require secondary legislation, but the principle needs to be dealt with in the Bill. That way, repeat offenders will be kept off the roads until they have completed the necessary medical examination. We will also enable the use of alcohol ignition interlocks, which have been shown to be effective in discouraging re-offending. I hope that all these measures, backed up by others such as advertising, will get across the message that drinking and driving kills.

 I agree that driving under the influence of anything that impairs judgment&#151;drugs are the obvious example&#151;is just as dangerous as the specific example of alcohol. The difficulty, as I understand it, lies in developing road-side equipment that can detect the presence of drugs; however, people can of course be taken to a police station for a blood test. A number of people are working on this issue because, sadly, as my hon. Friend knows, people driving under the influence of drugs is as much of a problem as people driving under the influence of drink.

 My view is that we need to concentrate on those people who are breaking the law now. As my hon. Friend knows, the lower the level is set, the more difficult it is to justify, because people may have low levels of alcohol in their bodies for all sorts of reasons other than the fact that they have had a drink. The biggest problem we face is from people who are not just over the limit, but way over the limit. That is why the measures in the Bill are important.

 The problem for much of continental Europe is that they have much higher rates of offending. They have a low limit, but it is not actually enforced. The French Government have a big problem with this issue and have stepped up detection significantly in the past few years. What matters is that people need to know that there is a strong likelihood that they will be caught. We have been working with chief constables, who have to decide where to target their resources. I strongly believe that the police should target drink driving, because it is a problem, not only at Christmas time, but throughout the year.

<a name="stpa_47">The second theme is measures to stop people who drive without tax and insurance. Continuous vehicle registration has helped and the House may be interested to know that vehicle licence evasion has fallen by 400,000 since 2002, which means that the revenue lost from evasion has dropped by &#163;60 million in the same time. The Bill allows the regulation of registration plate suppliers to be extended to Scotland and Northern Ireland. It also enables us to share driver and vehicle data with foreign authorities. That is important, because one of the themes that has emerged, especially with more and more foreign vehicles being driven in this country, is the lack of access to information about who owns them. We need to do more to build co-operation across Europe on that issue. I hope that those measures will command support on both sides of the House, although I understand that in certain parts, co-operation with Europe creates some difficulties.

<a name="stpa_48">When we first published the Bill, it enabled the Department to require the surrender of paper driving licences, probably some time after 2008, to allow them to be replaced with photo-card driving licences. That part of the Bill was removed in the other place. We will reintroduce that important measure, because the police need to be sure that the person they stop at the roadside is producing their own documents. Last year alone, the police brought to the DVLA&#039;s attention approximately 1,200 cases in which individuals had set up more than one identity, and some of them had many identities. All of us know that the paper driving licence is reasonably easy to manipulate and therefore misrepresent. We should therefore introduce a photographic licence that has better security and makes such deception much more difficult. I am sorry that the Conservatives in the other place are opposed to that: I hope that the Conservatives here will take a more realistic view. The police and others rely on driving licences and they should be as secure as possible. We do not plan to make the change immediately, but at some point it will be necessary to recall paper licences and replace them with licences that are more robust.

 That is not a debate that we need to have because I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. I refer him to what the Home Secretary said when we last debated identity cards. We are not planning to designate ID cards in that way, and they will be separate. The photographic licence would be a separate requirement for different reasons. At some stage, biometric information will be required and, given that the same information will be required for both passports and driving licences, it makes sense to co-operate on them, but the two documents will be distinct.

<p><a name="st_71"><a name="60308-11_spnew6"><b> Chris Grayling: </b> 
 I very much agree and hope that Ministers, and all those serving on the Committee, will discuss that in detail. It is one way to tighten the measure. The removal of a vehicle and its return only when a heavy fine and the cost of insurance are paid is one way to address that.
</p>





<p><a name="st_72"><a name="60308-11_spnew7"><b> Tom Brake  (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD):</b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman regret, as I do, that the Home Office has withdrawn funding for a special scheme called &quot;Scrap it&quot;, which enables local authorities to take those vehicles off the road extremely quickly?
</p>





<p><a name="st_73"><a name="60308-11_spnew8"><b> Chris Grayling: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman puts his finger on a problem. The Government are always asking our local authorities to take on responsibility after responsibility. Those may be desirable responsibilities, but many areas do not receive the funding for them. The decision about whether a local authority should tackle the problem of abandoned vehicles, for example, depends on whether it can afford to divert money from other key services.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_64">We completely support the new penalty for causing death when unlicensed, uninsured or disqualified. No hon. Member could disagree with that, although there is an aspect of the measure that could be strengthened. However, the Government could have taken much tougher action against such drivers in other ways. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) last year highlighted the problem of people who commit multiple offences while driving and who shelter behind false addresses. I am grateful that Ministers are willing to talk about that now. My hon. Friend has campaigned on the issue for months. Police forces around the country have made noises about it for months and have made a little progress. The measure is overdue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_65">The problem essentially is that offenders are registering their vehicles behind false addresses. There are a number of addresses in Essex, for example, at which dozens of vehicles are registered. When a driver commits an offence&#151;whether going past a speed camera at high speed, parking illegally or something else&#151;and the authorities try to track down the users of those vehicles, they find themselves dealing with the front address and have no possible means of finding the owners. That cannot be right and it must be tackled.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_66">Officers dealing with those problems on the front line say that they do not have adequate legal backing to impound such vehicles if they find them. They are uncertain about the powers that exist. The Bill is an opportunity to provide them with much greater clarity and, perhaps, with powers to seize vehicles at the roadside if they are stopped and for automatic confiscation. However, I am sure you would agree, Madam Deputy Speaker, that it cannot be right to have vehicles on our road that rack up thousands of pounds in fines with a brazen disregard for the law. I have seen a photograph from Bedfordshire of a couple of young men in an old car driving past a speed camera, both leaning wide out of the windows and sticking two fingers up at the camera as they go by. That is the kind of brazen disregard for the law that we must tackle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-11_para9">
<a name="stpa_67">Likewise, I want to see clearer measures to tackle the massive problem of untaxed vehicles. Local authorities and local police do not often have the resources or the ability to deal with the problem in the way that they might wish. I want to see tougher action still against unlicensed drivers. There are measures in the Bill, but more could be done. We need much tougher penalties on hit-and-run drivers. We heard one or two examples from Back-Bench Members about the devastating impact of hit-and-run driving. It remains the case that if someone is involved in an accident having drunk too much alcohol, the law provides an incentive to drive away at speed. A person may be less likely to be disqualified as a result of leaving the scene of the accident than if he stays and is breathalysed. We should address that. There is no excuse whatever for motorists driving away from the scene of an accident. We should prosecute those who do with the toughest force of the law, and that should include long disqualifications.

<br>&nbsp;<br>death by careless driving and to give him the increased prison sentence for driving without a licence. If the two sentences ran consecutively&#151;my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was asked about that&#151;the driver could be imprisoned for up to seven years. It would not compensate for a life lost, but it would be much more than the six weeks, or whatever, that the driver got.
</p>





<p><a name="st_75"><a name="60308-12_spnew1"><b> Chris Grayling: </b> 
 The hon. Lady misses the point. I am not talking purely about fatal accidents, but about minor accidents as well.

<p><a name="st_76"><a name="60308-12_spnew2"><b> Ms Keeble: </b> 
 It was a tragic case.
</p>





<p><a name="st_77"><a name="60308-12_spnew3"><b> Chris Grayling: </b> 
 Of course, and it needed to be prosecuted with the force of the law. Having read the case, a charge of dangerous driving should have been seriously considered. As I recall, the driver was unlicensed, and the measure that we support to tackle the problem of unlicensed drivers would do the job. However, it is not always about dealing with accidents that cause death. We also need to deal with accidents in which there are serious or relatively minor injuries. There is no excuse whatever for any driver who is involved in an accident simply to drive away. There are times when the law provides a perverse incentive to do so. If someone has drunk too much, has a minor accident and drives away, he is probably slightly less likely to be disqualified for a year than if he stops and is breathalysed. That cannot be sensible. There is no excuse for driving away from the scene of an accident.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_68">We also need to change the rules under which the DVLA operates when false addresses are used. I had a case in my constituency recently of a family barraged with legal notices because the previous owners of their house had not changed the address on their driving licences. They did that entirely deliberately so that they could use false information to commit offences with impunity. Yet the DVLA is not allowed under current rules to amend its records without written notification from the licence holder. If I move house, commit offences everywhere and leave the people who bought my house to pick up the problems that that causes&#151;police and bailiffs knocking on the door, and so forth&#151;the only person who can get the details changed is me, and since I am the offender I am hardly likely to do that. I hope that we can also tackle that problem.

<p><a name="st_78"><a name="60308-12_spnew4"><b> Dr. Pugh </b> 
: The hon. Gentleman may not be aware that the DVLA has a sophisticated database that enables it to take a registration plate and work out who the owner is, but it does not enable it to go the other way by starting off with the owner and finding out what cars are registered in his name. That would be a small technical change that would approve things ahead of legislation. There is no case for not doing it.

<p><a name="st_79"><a name="60308-12_spnew5"><b> Chris Grayling: </b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to grips with the serious challenge posed by people who systematically ignore the law on tax, insurance, drink-driving and related issues. The Bill is therefore a missed opportunity. We will work constructively in Committee to address that, and we will try to introduce measures to strengthen the provisions against the most lawless drivers. I hope that the Government are willing to work with us constructively as we seek to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_70">There are three areas in which we want to change the detail of the Bill including, first, the most controversial part of the Bill&#151;the provision to introduce much tougher sentences for careless drivers. I understand clearly and in detail the Government&#039;s motivation for proposing a change. There is a serious problem with the distinction between the offences of careless and dangerous driving. We are all aware of instances in which the Crown Prosecution Service has not pursued a dangerous driving case so the offender has escaped with a sentence that appears much too lenient, given the crime that was committed. We therefore understand why many families are angry when a motorist&#039;s actions lead to the death of a loved one but that individual is charged with dangerous driving and escapes with only a fine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_71">Those families and the organisations that work with them have made a powerful case to all hon. Members in the past few weeks. We accept the need to change the current system, but we have genuine reservations about the detail of the Government&#039;s proposals. When we debate those proposals I hope that Members on both sides of the House will accept that our concerns are genuine and not party political. We are not interested in playing off the interests of motorists against the interests of road safety, as we have a duty to get these things right. I have two concerns about the proposals, including the use of the term &quot;careless or inconsiderate&quot; in the wording of the proposed new offence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_72">In framing legislation, the House must find the right balance between acceptance that people make mistakes, sometimes with terrible but unintended consequences, and the need to ensure that if people act in a way that they can reasonably be expected to know is unsafe they can be held to account when their action results in tragedy. That is not an easy dividing line for any politician to find, and I accept that there is a dilemma facing Ministers. There are serious difficulties. How do we judge whether someone should have looked a little harder when leaving a junction? How do we judge someone who swerves to avoid an animal and kills a cyclist instead? Is someone driving just within the speed limit on an icy road on a dark morning&#151;conditions that could be considered dangerous&#151;driving carelessly or dangerously? I do not believe that this country&#039;s tradition of fairness and justice makes it sensible to provide in law for long sentences for careless drivers. What does &quot;inconsiderate&quot; mean? Are we going to send someone to prison for five years for being inconsiderate? We therefore have serious reservations about the drafting of the offence. We will debate it carefully in Committee, and introduce proposals to improve the current system.

<p><a name="st_81"><a name="60308-12_spnew7"><b> Chris Grayling: </b> 
 I am afraid that I simply do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. Sometimes on the road people make snap judgments that are wrong and that have devastating consequences. There is no intent to kill. There may have been misjudgment&#151;with greater experience, they might have avoided that misjudgment&#151;but that does not make them criminals who deserve a long prison sentence. We must make suitable provision in law. There are cases in which people slip through the net, and in such cases the penalty should probably have been stronger. However, I am profoundly uncomfortable with the introduction of a penalty that is so wide-ranging that it drags people who have committed an offence in the circumstances that I have just described into the net of a long prison sentence.
</p>





<p><a name="st_82"><a name="60308-12_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport  (Dr. Stephen Ladyman): </b> 
 May I clarify something so that I can respond properly to the hon. Gentleman later? Is it the principle of the offence of causing death by careless driving about which he is concerned, or is it just the detail of the way in which we have defined &quot;careless&quot;? If we manage to agree on that detail in Committee, will he withdraw his objection?
</p>





<p><a name="st_83"><a name="60308-12_spnew8"><b> Chris Grayling: </b> 
 It is the principle of the word &quot;careless&quot; that is the problem. If the Government can define in detail a form of words with which we are comfortable we are happy to look at their proposals. Traditionally, there has been an acceptance in British law of the dividing line between carelessness and dangerousness. The way in which that dividing line operates is not satisfactory, as it is handled differently by the courts and the Crown Prosecution Service. I therefore have reservations about &quot;careless&quot; and &quot;inconsiderate&quot;, particularly the latter word, which is very loose indeed.

 I am grateful to the hon. Lady, as she has steered me towards the second part of my argument. I do not want to rehearse this afternoon what should be a careful and thoughtful discussion in Committee. The fine detail of the definitions in the Bill is properly a matter for Committee. I am simply seeking to emphasise the fact that we are not comfortable with the idea of the offence of careless or inconsiderate driving being subject to a substantial penalty. We hope that there will be a constructive debate in Committee that will find a way forward, as I accept the principle behind the Government&#039;s proposals.

<p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>punishment apply only to accidents where there is a fatality? Someone may be found guilty of causing an accident in which the victim dies, and that may merit five years in prison. Why is that different from an accident in which someone is paralysed for life? There is no attempt in the Bill to make provision for such a case, so I would welcome an amendment to the new provision for heavier punishment to include people who drive while uninsured or disqualified and cause serious injury, such as a lifetime injury that prevents someone from working again. That is an omission on the Government&#039;s part. The hon. Lady is right. If someone who is driving without insurance or a licence and thus flouting the laws of the road runs someone over, disfiguring them for life, why should the penalty be any different from the penalty for causing a fatality? I hope that Ministers will give that due consideration in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_74">I hope that we have a constructive debate in Committee and that everyone in the House accepts that we share their motivations, as well as the motivations of campaign groups, so that we secure justice for the victims of utterly unacceptable behaviour on our roads. However, we do not want to criminalise people who make a misjudgment. Whether we like it or not, people in our society make misjudgments which, with hindsight, they probably should not have made. However, there was no intent, and they made a mistake. I want to make sure that there is a key difference between making an horrendous mistake and doing something that is utterly unacceptable.

<p>
<a name="60308-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_75">My second area of inquiry concerns the Government&#039;s plan to use alcohol interlock devices in cars to reduce a driver&#039;s disqualification period. I am sceptical about that: I appreciate that it has been piloted, and that there have been discussions with the insurance industry, but I want serial drink-drivers to be taken off the road and given long bans. They should not have the right significantly to reduce their disqualification periods simply by placing a piece of technology in their cars.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_76">We do not know whether alcohol interlock devices are foolproof. Ideas are certainly in circulation about how one can get round them, and I have had a couple of conversations about that in the past week. I have no idea whether the devices can be circumvented, but I am not sure that I want to put that to the test, as history shows that people can be pretty ingenious when it comes to getting around technological barriers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_77">I see no compelling reason to go down that route, or to believe that society will reap huge benefits as a result. We will merely be introducing yet another system that has to be managed and organised, at a cost to the taxpayer. I appreciate that motorists will have to pay for the piece of kit, but public officials will have to organise its installation and the courts will have to have a follow-through process to make sure that it is installed. The proposal will cost the taxpayer, come what may, and who will administer and supervise the process? We should keep serial drink-drivers off the roads, and I am not convinced that alcohol interlock devices are the right way forward.

<a name="stpa_79">Thirdly, I was pleased by what the Secretary of State had to say about safety on level crossings, and I am glad that he is thinking positively about it. We thought that the measures added in the Lords were constructive, but we believe that they do not go far enough. The House should be clear that driving a car across a level crossing that is closed and has its warning lights flashing is an offence that should be treated with the utmost severity. Some horrendous railway accidents have been caused by cars on level crossings, and sometimes the circumstances mean that it is impossible for the law to do anything. There was a tragic incident near Newbury in 2004, when it is believed that a motorist sought to commit suicide by parking in front of a train. No new laws can prevent such acts, but we should take a very different view when a driver is intent simply on dodging the crossing and avoiding delay.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_80">My hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) and I have watched the Network Rail presentation of CCTV footage of absurdly dangerous behaviour by motorists at level crossings, and I suspect that Ministers have done the same. I shall describe one example to the House. One CCTV excerpt showed a level crossing with a queue of cars. A clearly impatient driver pulled out of the queue and drove around the other cars to the crossing, which had a half barrier rather than a full one. The driver steered through the barrier, only realising at the last moment that a train was about to arrive. He braked hard, and reversed quickly to get out of its way. The car missed the oncoming train by a matter of feet. Had the two collided, there might have been a multiple-fatality railway accident. Such driving can only be described as absurdly dangerous, with a wanton disregard for the safety of passengers on the train.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_81">If that were an isolated incident we might not argue for change, but such driving is not rare. A couple of weeks ago, I received a written answer from the Minister of State to the effect that there are 20 or so collisions each year involving cars and trains at level crossings. Many more incidents go unreported, with vehicles coming close to collision or with drivers simply getting away with jumping the lights and the gates.

<p>
<a name="60308-13_para9">
<a name="stpa_82">My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), who will wind up the debate for the Opposition, has told me that there have been 22 such incidents at one crossing in his constituency in the last year alone, and about 75 in all across the county of Shropshire. Therefore, we think that their lordships were right to say that the problem needed to be addressed, and the Government were wrong to question their arguments. I am delighted that Ministers have had a change of heart, and we look forward to the amendment that they will introduce.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-13_para10">
<a name="stpa_83">The amendments tabled in the Lords contain a provision to issue six penalty points to drivers crossing a level crossing when its barriers are down, but that does not go far enough.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>from driving. In my view, it is as dangerous to drive across a level crossing when the gates are down as it is to drink and drive. There is no reason why there should be a noticeable difference in the punishments available for the two offences.

<a name="stpa_84">As has always been our intention, we will introduce in Committee our idea of how an amendment to that effect might work. However, given what the Secretary of State has said today, I hope that we can have a constructive debate and end up with a sensible basic measure to improve safety on level crossings that we can all agree on. If motorists behave in a way that is totally thoughtless and reckless, the consequences can be serious&#151;for them, and for the many innocent people on trains that go through level crossings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-13_para12">
<a name="stpa_85">Finally, there is one big assumption behind the Bill that causes us anxiety and which we think will make it difficult to make its measures work. The Bill assumes that the police will deal with the problem of enforcing all the new penalties, and the Secretary of State said as much in his opening remarks. He mentioned the new force of traffic officers on our motorways, but he must realise that in many parts of the country, barely a handful of police are on duty at any one time. They have to cover large areas, and in too many places it is still very likely that people will get away with bad driving.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-13_para13">
<a name="stpa_86">The fact is that in many parts of the country, there are too few officers to do the job, and that is why many of the root causes of danger on our roads go unaddressed. The same is true of untaxed vehicles: in many areas, the police simply do not have the time to follow up every report of untaxed vehicles on street corners or in driveways filled with scruffy cars. I know that from my own constituency experience, but on a Saturday night, those same cars might well be the ones that are used to ply the unlicensed taxi trade, or driven around by people with a reckless disregard for the law and for the safety of others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-13_para14">
<a name="stpa_87">That is why we must reform the way in which our police work. We need to make sure that they have the time to tackle problems such as I have described, and that they can do so systematically, not on an occasional basis. It is also why we need simple and achievable ways to tackle the problem posed by people who brazenly ignore the law. Once again, I believe that the Bill could have done much more in that regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-13_para15">
<a name="stpa_88">For instance, the Bill could have proposed ways to highlight whether a car was insured, so that all uninsured cars could be easily and automatically impounded. I heard what the Secretary of State said about notification cameras, which can spot registration plates and check them off against insurance registers, but other countries have much simpler systems&#151;for example, a disc on a windscreen&#151;to show whether a vehicle is insured. The Department has not displayed enough in the way of ideas, innovation or smart thinking when it comes to ways to tackle that a serious problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-13_para16">
<a name="stpa_89">The Bill could also have strengthened the sanctions available to police dealing with the problem of systematic offenders hiding behind false addresses and ignoring penalty notices. I hope that changes can be made to it in the later stages of its passage through the House that will tackle that problem. Moreover, the Bill 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 851</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>says nothing about tackling vehicle cloning: that is a major problem for many people, and we have to deal with it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-13_para17">
<a name="stpa_90">The Bill is a patchwork of bits and pieces&#151;some of them good, some less so. Sadly, that is the hallmark of a Government who have proved themselves to be very good at tinkering but not always so good at setting out a clear and long-term vision and strategy for our transport system, and for road safety in Britain.

 I am grateful to have a chance to contribute to the debate and to give an extremely warm welcome to the Bill. I think that the remarks of the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) were somewhat churlish, as I believe that it contains a variety of measures that will give the police a much wider range of sanctions for many more offences than is currently the case. It will enable them to do many of the things that the hon. Gentleman described, and it will be for them and the local authorities to work out how to use the measures to improve road safety.

<a name="stpa_91">The hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell said that the Bill did not have a strategic vision. I disagree: it maintains a clear focus on what is needed to improve road safety and deal with the different problems that arise. Moreover, implicit within it is a recognition that we need a culture change in our attitude to driving. The hon. Gentleman did not mention that, but running through the Bill is a much stronger awareness of the fact that a person who gets into a car is getting into something that can be a dangerous weapon. Cars can be responsible for very serious accidents, as well as being a statement of our personal freedom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_92">The Bill requires a culture change among the public. I ask the Government, as they move it forward, to make sure that information is issued about the change in responsibilities and that there are awareness campaigns to change attitudes to speaking on mobile phones while driving, children wearing safety belts in the back of cars, and speeding. The Opposition have a real responsibility to be party to that as well. Let us take the example of the debate about speed cameras. I suppose that we are not meant to be party political at this point, but I have heard, particularly from the Conservative party, constant criticism of speed cameras. The assumption is that they are there to raise money, when we all know&#151;certainly, this is the case in Northamptonshire&#151;that many people walking around today would be dead were not it not for speed cameras and the move to bear down on speeding. A good number of young people have been spared very serious injury because speeding has been reduced.

I refer to the proposal for a new offence of causing death by careless driving. I do not understand how it is possible to talk tough on driving and then say,

I hope that, in Committee, they will suddenly see the light, have a road-to-Damascus conversion, as they have on so many other things, and support this important proposal.

<a name="60308-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_94">Over the years, many colleagues have pressed for a new offence of causing death by careless driving, because we have all heard the most harrowing tales of deaths caused by careless driving in our constituencies. I pay tribute to the predecessor of the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone), who, as he knows, campaigned, as he has, on behalf of his constituents, and to many other Members who are still on the Labour Benches and who have done a vast amount of work over the years.

<a name="stpa_95">I took up the matter in a private Member&#039;s Bill following consultation with young people in my constituency. It was one of those cases of seeing further when one sits on the shoulders of giants because colleagues have done much more work than I have. The young people chose it as the piece of legislation that they most wanted to see on the statute book, which is interesting, since many of the briefings sent to us by outside organisations pick up on the fact that driving and road safety issues have a particular impact on young people and are of particular concern to them.
</p>

<a name="stpa_96">I thank the schools that took part in the consultation and supported the private Member&#039;s Bill: Kingsthorpe community college, Duston school, Weston Favell school, Northampton School for Girls, Thomas Becket school, Roade school and Unity college. In particular, they were moved by the story of Alexine Melnik, a constituent of the hon. Member for Wellingborough. She was a teenager who was killed by a careless driver. Her killer escaped with a derisory sentence. The schools met with Alexine&#039;s brother and parents, who joined them in lobbying the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart), to get such a measure on the statute book. They followed the process through, and I hope that they will be able to come to the Committee to see the legislation they have campaigned for go through.

 I share some of the concerns expressed by the hon.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that point. In working on my private Member&#039;s Bill, I had to talk through that issue with a number of people, and, if he is happy for me to do so, I will deal with his point later. Certainly, there is an argument to be made. The details of how the measure is to work have to be spelled out, but the case for having such an offence on the statute book is overwhelming and well understood by the public, as well as being supported, I am happy to say, by the Government.

<a name="60308-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_97">Other than local cases, one reason why young people in my constituency supported the measure was the statistics on the number of young people killed in road traffic accidents each year. As we have heard, many of the people killed by careless drivers are children. A recent case that has been particularly highlighted took place in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher). A little girl was holding her mother&#039;s hand when she was killed. In 1999, some 191 children under the age of 14 were killed on the road. Road accidents were probably the biggest single category of fatal accidents among children. In addition, 42,051 children under 15 were injured. The statistics also show that young drivers are much more likely to be involved and injured in accidents. A total of 64,000 drivers aged 16 to 24 were involved in road traffic accidents during the last year for which figures were available. Although young people account for only 4 per cent. of the driving population, they account for 13 per cent. of accidents on the roads.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_98">The hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell also mentioned the need to focus on where accidents take place and which children are most at risk. I believe&#151;I am sure that the Minister of State will confirm this in his winding-up speech&#151;that the children most at risk are those in inner-city areas. There is a close correlation between poverty and road deaths among children. It is possible to consider speed limits in those areas and make sure that we tackle issues in areas where children are most likely to be killed or injured. With those kinds of measures and sanctions in place, the graduated penalties in the Bill are the right way to go about dealing with the very real problem of speeding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_99">The offence of causing death by careless driving will address the burning sense of injustice held by the families of people killed in such accidents. A survey for the Department for Transport found that, when people were killed in road accidents and a conviction secured, only 20 per cent. of victims&#039; families thought that justice had been served. So, even when the driver was caught and convicted and the victim&#039;s family at least had their day in court, there was still an overwhelming sense that justice had not been served.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_100">In addition&#151;this comes partly to the points made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell&#151;there is a credibility gap in relation to offences and penalties in the existing law. There is nothing between causing death by dangerous driving and quite minor traffic offences. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there is always room to consider carefully which charges can be used, but in the case of the child in the Burnley constituency, the driver could not be charged with dangerous driving, so he was charged with only the most minor offences. Imagine the feelings of someone who sees their child killed and the driver done for an offence such as driving without a licence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-14_para10">
<a name="stpa_101">In the context of the penalties at the court&#039;s disposal, I welcome the new offence and the prison sentence that attaches to it. In my private Member&#039;s Bill I proposed a sentence of 10 years, but the five-year prison sentence fills the credibility gap by increasing the sanctions available to the courts.

<p>
<a name="60308-14_para11">
<a name="stpa_102">A further aspect is the likelihood of being charged with dangerous driving, which relates to a point made by the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell. From the briefings that we have had, which I am sure he also received, it seems that more and more traffic offenders are not being charged with dangerous driving, which has a high threshold. They tend to be charged with relatively minor offences, even when their driving mistakes were caused by gross negligence. The new penalties should help to redress the balance in the patterns of charging up till now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-14_para12">
<a name="stpa_103">Against that background, I welcome the new offence of causing death by careless driving. It was introduced at Committee stage in the other place, and the penalties were reduced on Third Reading. I understand that at one point their lordships thought that they were removing entirely the possibility of imprisonment. In fact, they removed only the ability of magistrates courts to impose a prison sentence, but that reduced the effect of the provision. That flies in the face of the public demand for tougher sanctions for causing death by careless driving.
</p>

<p><a name="st_89"><a name="60308-15_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bone: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is making a powerful speech. Does she accept that even with the Lords amendment, the new offence of causing death by careless driving will reach the statute book and in most cases a prison sentence would be available to the judge if the person were found guilty?
</p>





<p><a name="st_90"><a name="60308-15_spnew1"><b> Ms Keeble: </b> 
 The offence would be on the statute book, but the penalties would be weaker and the magistrates courts would not have the option of imprisoning offenders. The possibility of community sentencing would also be lost. Outside organisations are concerned about the impact that that would have.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_104">There is a further point. The hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell talked tough about dangerous driving and bad drivers, but resiled from that when it came to some of the details. I hope he will reconsider. If we tell people that they must pay more careful attention to their driving, and if we take the bold step, as my right hon. Friend pointed out, of saying that they will otherwise go to prison, there is a need for consistency and care in the message that we send out and in what we tell drivers to do. If we blow hot and cold, people are left not knowing where they stand. That also dilutes the effectiveness of a Bill that deals with the range of driving behaviour, introducing more penalties and sending out robust messages about what people ought to be doing when they are in cars.
</p>





<p><a name="st_91"><a name="60308-15_spnew2"><b> Chris Grayling: </b> 
 Does the hon. Lady not accept, though, that we in the House have a duty not simply to send messages, but to make good law?

<p><a name="st_92"><a name="60308-15_spnew3"><b> Ms Keeble: </b> 
 I entirely agree. The courts should have at their disposal a proper range of offences and penalties. There is clear consensus among everybody except the lawyers that there is a major gap between imprisonment for causing death by dangerous driving and the minor traffic offences&#151;except, of course, in the case of drink driving. There is a great gap in the middle as regards what the courts can do. It is important that they have available a range of offences and penalties&#151;what the courts do is down to them&#151;that properly recognise the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 855</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>different types of accident and levels of culpability, and that delivers to the public a sense that justice will be done if their loved ones are involved in an accident.
</p>





<p><a name="st_93"><a name="60308-15_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mark Harper  (Forest of Dean) (Con):</b> 
 If the law was changed as the hon. Lady hopes and the court had the power to impose tough sentences in cases of careless driving, the expectation would be set that that would happen. If, having considered all the circumstances, the court decided that what happened was a momentary lapse and did not merit a prison sentence, is there not a danger that victims would have an even greater sense of injustice if the penalties available were not used by the court?
</p>





<p><a name="st_94"><a name="60308-15_spnew5"><b> Ms Keeble: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. When there is an accident, it is often difficult for people to accept that no one was to blame. If a relative is killed, they might never be satisfied with what happens afterwards and might always feel that no price is high enough to pay for the death of their relative. People must be supported through that process, by agencies such as Victim Support. That is a different matter from the proper range of penalties that should be available to the courts, that fill the credibility gap and that meet the public&#039;s sense of justice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_105">The courts must receive proper guidance about the powers that they are to be given. I would not dare to interpret the case cited by the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell about a driver avoiding an animal and hitting a cyclist instead. There must be proper guidance about what constitutes culpable carelessness. Everybody who has driven has had momentary lapses. The question is when that is culpable and when it is a case of driving without the due regard and attention expected of a careful, competent and considerate driver. All that can be dealt with in guidance.

<a name="stpa_106">Earlier, I raised the issue of driving under the influence of drugs. It is acknowledged that there are problems in testing for that. I urge my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the Department, in their work with the Home Office, to ensure that progress is made in developing a scientific test that can be conducted at the roadside. I understand from the Library notes that the roadside tests include walking along a straight line, touching the tip of one&#039;s nose and standing on one leg. To people who have seen the consequences of an accident resulting from someone driving under the influence of drugs, citing such evidence in court seems a less than convincing argument or test.
</p>





<p><a name="st_95"><a name="60308-15_spnew6"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 I want to make sure that my hon. Friend realises that that test is used only to indicate to a police officer that somebody might be under the influence of drugs. The person will be taken back to a police station, where they will be tested properly and convincing evidence produced.

<p><a name="st_96"><a name="60308-15_spnew7"><b> Ms Keeble: </b> 
 I understand that, but I hope that we might develop, even as a rule of thumb at the roadside, an approach that is more convincing than such tests, which are subjective, as I think is commonly recognised, and are inadequate given the problems of drug taking that exist in society, particularly among younger people.

More focus is needed on that area, as well as on deaths involving drink-driving, which have increased by 2 per cent. since 2002.

I am sure that the hon. Lady is aware that pedestrians or cyclists who are hit by drivers travelling at 35 mph as opposed to 30 mph are twice as likely to be killed.

Perhaps we need to await the official Conservative Opposition policy, but I understand that the Conservative spokesman in the other place argued in favour of banning equipment that could block or jam signals, but also argued that we should perhaps not be so worried about equipment that can detect signals.

The Government must explain in more detail why they do not support that proposal. We want to see a decrease in deaths and serious injuries, and PACTS evidence suggests that 65 lives a year would be saved as a result of reducing the limit to 50 mg and that 230 people a year would be saved from serious injury.

That would be sensible because, according to the Red Cross, 57 per cent. of deaths caused by road accidents happen in the first few minutes after a crash before the emergency services arrive, and up to 85 per cent. of those could be prevented if first aid were administered immediately. The Minister will be aware that on Second Reading in the other place, Lord Davies of Oldham said:

<a name="stpa_123">I hope that the Minister is able to clarify what progress has been made on that and whether the Government&#039;s hand will be forced, to some extent, by what is going to happen in 2008 with European Union legislation relating to commercial drivers having to demonstrate that they have basic first aid skills.

<a name="stpa_124">I hope that the Minister can clarify another matter that was raised on Second Reading&#151;the use of rear seatbelts for 14 and 15-year-olds. I understand that there is a gap in the provisions that could be sorted out simply by making it the driver&#039;s responsibility to ensure that they wear seatbelts.

<a name="stpa_126">Will the Minister clarify, first, whether he is willing to accept that change and, secondly, whether he would be willing to accept a stronger provision requiring that the Secretary of State &quot;shall&quot; ensure that retro-reflective tape is fitted? HGVs have been involved in a significant number of accidents, which would presumably be reduced by adding such reflective strips. In 2001, there were 9,000 collisions in which an HGV was struck by another vehicle. In 34 per cent. of those cases, the HGV was struck on its side. It is not unreasonable to assume that a significant number of those accidents could have been avoided, or their seriousness reduced, as a result of fitting that tape. That would cost about &#163;100 to &#163;150 per vehicle&#151;not a significant extra cost given that the retail price of a new vehicle is in the order of &#163;100,000 and that it could make a great difference in terms of reducing road accidents and improving road safety.

<a name="stpa_127">Given the scale of road accidents and deaths&#151;nine per day&#151;Liberal Democrats argue, as we did in the Lords, that there is a need for a road accidents investigations board, similar to those that exist for aviation and rail, to investigate the accidents that occur. Some of those will be one-offs, while some will not. Sometimes there will be a problem in a particular location. In other cases, it will be difficult to identify a pattern when looking at individual accidents, but by looking at the totality it may be possible to draw conclusions from them. My hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), who considered this when he was our transport spokesman, found that Sweden has a similar organisation, which noted that because Sweden is a rocky, mountainous country, there are often large rocks

It is unacceptable that the limit on unclassified roads is 60 mph, which is completely inappropriate in many cases. The Committee is the right place to discuss those issues.

<p><a name="st_108"><a name="60308-17_spnew0"><b> Dr. Brian Iddon  (Bolton, South-East) (Lab):</b> 
 This week, my Select Committee&#151;the Science and Technology Committee&#151;is taking evidence in New York and Washington. I pulled out of the visit at the last minute because I had promised several of my constituents that I would not only push for a change in the law in this policy area but bring their concerns to the Floor of the House and try to express some of their grief.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_131">I want particularly to discuss clauses 20 to 33, as amended in the other place, on new offences, increases in penalties, and other provisions about offences. Since my election to Parliament in 1997, I have been outraged by the outcome of several trials following serious road traffic accidents that have resulted in the death of my constituents. The first family that I dealt with was the Willis family, whose son Gareth was killed at the age of 21 on 22 May 1999 in a head-on crash on the crown of a bridge by a hit-and-run driver while riding his motorcycle. His son, Joseph, aged seven, was a pillion passenger. Although he was thrown off the bike into a field and badly injured, he fortunately survived. However, the car driver ran away from the scene of the accident, although he gave himself up the following day.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_132">Initially, the 31-year-old driver was given a 30-month sentence for causing death by dangerous driving and banned from driving for five years. Half the sentence was suspended for community service. The driver had had only two driving lessons, was driving at more than 50 miles an hour in a 30 mph restricted area without a licence or insurance. He had several previous car crime convictions and had been drinking earlier that day.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_133">Gareth&#039;s family were devastated by their loss and especially by the sentence&#151;so much so that they came to see me. The Attorney-General referred the case to the Court of Appeal and the driver&#039;s sentence was increased, but only by one year. Regrettably, the appeal was heard on 16 November 2000 without the family being informed or invited to make an oral impact submission, which they were entitled to make, about the effect of the accident on the family.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_134">Another tragedy with which I have dealt was the death of eight-year-old Billy Joe Dean in the village of Stoneclough, which lies between Bolton and Bury. A 40-year-old male was riding his 1,000 cc Suzuki motor cycle on 24 August 2002, having just left a public house. Evidence was given in court that he accelerated to such an extent that he performed a wheelie as he approached a double bend. The motor cyclist lost control of the vehicle, which glanced off an approaching Porsche and hit Billy Joe as he was walking along the pavement. Billy Joe died almost immediately from his injuries because he was crushed by the motor cycle, which flew through the air and hit him against a garden wall. The accident shook the village of Stoneclough and the BBC chose it as one of two cases of causing death by dangerous driving that it included in a documentary, which was broadcast with a view to getting the change in the law that the Bill tries to establish.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_135">The motor cyclist received a six-year jail sentence for causing death by dangerous driving, driving without insurance and driving while disqualified. The sentence was reduced to five years in the Court of Appeal. He was also banned from driving for eight years. He had badly injured himself in the collision and submitted a guilty plea in court. Like the Willis family, the Dean family learned of the reduction of the sentence on appeal through reading about it in the <i>Bolton Evening News.</i> Both families were outraged at the outcome of the trials and the way in which they, as indirect victims of their sons&#039; deaths, had been treated by the British judicial system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_136">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 increased the maximum penalty for causing death by dangerous driving from 10 to 14 years, but the courts hardly ever apply the sentence at the top end of the range.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_137">Six other tragic accidents, which occurred in my constituency or a few yards outside its boundary, led to the deaths of three-year-old Amicie Nwokeochar on   15 November 2003; 36-year-old Lisa Halligan and 28-year-old Michael Jeffries, killed in the same accident on 1 May 2004; 13-year-old Carla Bate on 8 August 2004; nine-year-old Ellesse Ruth Gore on 19 October 2005; 46-year-old Ellen Newman, killed, like Billy Joe, on the bends in Stoneclough village on 5 January this year, and 45-year-old Laura Entwistle on 21 January this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_138">I have been closely involved with the Nwokeochar tragedy, which was caused by a gentleman who was a few weeks away from his 90th birthday. I have applied for an Adjournment debate to bring to light the safety record of older drivers and I shall therefore not dwell on that incident today. I am also involved with the family of Ellen Newman. They recently approached me for help.

<br>&nbsp;<br>of such tragedies often find it hard to accept the significantly reduced sentences that are given when the driver enters a guilty plea. That is a problem. Victims&#039; families also know that prisoners can be released on a Parole Board hearing after the half-way point of the sentence. They will be released on licence two thirds of the way through a sentence in any case. In some cases, the drivers are released from prison not long after the trials, when the families continue to grieve. I do not believe that those families ever stop grieving.

<a name="stpa_140">When a person&#151;they are nearly all young men&#151;drives a stolen car without a licence or insurance at high speeds in restricted areas, especially if he has previous convictions for road traffic offences, or has taken alcohol or other drugs that affect his ability to drive, and kills another person, often leaving the scene of the accident, the courts should inflict a severe sentence, which takes account of all the offences committed on the day. Drivers who kill while committing multiple offences should be charged with a greater offence than causing death by dangerous driving. The offence of vehicle homicide has been floated in some quarters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_141">&quot;Dangerous Driving and the Law&quot;, an evaluation of the operation of the Road Traffic Act 1991, which was commissioned by the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions and published in 2002, reports that 46 per cent. of the dangerous driving offences that it examined were committed by multiple offenders&#151;those, mainly young males, who have previous road traffic convictions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_142">It is clear to me from hon. Members&#039; contributions, including mine, since the 1997 general election, that the    law on serious traffic offences is regarded as unsatisfactory. We reflect the view of the public, who are rightly outraged by a legal system that considers death and injury to be less serious if it is caused by someone driving a motor vehicle. Those who commit crimes such as petty theft or burglary regularly receive more severe sentences from the courts than those who kill&#151;often wilfully&#151;on our British road system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_143">For those reasons, I welcome the new offences, for which the Bill provides, of causing death by driving while unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured, with a maximum sentence&#151;hopefully, in each case&#151;of two years. An amazing 1.2 million drivers&#151;one in 20 motorists&#151;regularly drive without insurance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_144">In England and Wales, an indictable offence of manslaughter is available but few prosecutions are made under that heading. RoadPeace believes that the proper charge following a culpable road death is manslaughter. However, I welcome the fact that the Bill allows, for the first time, an alternative verdict to be brought when prosecution for an offence of manslaughter fails.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_145">The test for dangerous driving in section 2A of the Road Traffic Act 1988 is defined thus:

</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para15">
<a name="stpa_146">It can be difficult to obtain a conviction of causing death by dangerous driving under that definition, as police forces throughout the country will confirm.

<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 864</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para16">
<a name="stpa_147">Trials collapse for various reasons, including a lack of convincing evidence produced by either the police or the forensic services, failure of witnesses to convince either a judge or a jury of the driver&#039;s guilt, and sometimes a badly handled prosecution case. Even in successful cases, the sentences applied are often low, given that the driver&#039;s behaviour has resulted in one and sometimes more deaths. The courts do not appear to appreciate that the maximum sentence that is currently available is 14 years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para17">
<a name="stpa_148">The lesser offence of dangerous driving is an either-way offence, with a maximum penalty of only two years&#039; imprisonment. The summary offence of careless and inconsiderate driving is available in two forms: driving without due care and attention, or driving without reasonable consideration for other road users. Clause 23 increases the maximum penalty for the offence of careless driving from &#163;2,500 to &#163;5,000. I welcome that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para18">
<a name="stpa_149">A new indictable offence of causing death by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs was introduced, on the recommendation of the 1988 North report, by the Road Traffic Act 1991. A further indictable offence of causing injury by furious driving was introduced by the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, and right hon. and hon. Members might have noticed that the Bill retains that rather curious offence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para19">
<a name="stpa_150">The lesser charge of careless driving often appears inappropriate, particularly in cases in which there has been a fatality and the evidence points to the fact that there has been an element of dangerous driving. The gap between the higher offence of dangerous driving and the lower offence of careless driving is seen by many, including me, as just too great. That is why I support the introduction of the new offence of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving, with a maximum sentence of five years, as set out in clause 20.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para20">
<a name="stpa_151">That is one of the more controversial aspects of the Bill. It is almost exclusively opposed by the legal profession, as it will make accidental conduct seriously criminal and worthy of imprisonment for the first time. However, the Crown Prosecution Service has stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;The new offence will be valuable in bridging the existing gap between causing death by dangerous driving and careless driving. In the most difficult cases that fall very close to the line dividing these two offences, it will enable prosecutors to place both offences on the indictment, thus allowing the jury to make their assessments of the facts.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para21">
<a name="stpa_152">Research has found that the introduction of a new offence of causing death by careless driving was favoured by only 55 per cent. of those who responded to a postal survey&#151;not a great percentage. Nevertheless, most right hon. and hon. Members who have contributed to this debate since I came to the House in 1997 appear to believe that the consequences of a motorist&#039;s action, especially in provable cases of dangerous driving, should be taken into consideration by the courts. Although the present law allows that, the courts tend to behave differently. Even with a charge of careless driving, the fact that death has been a consequence should be a serious consideration in some cases, but at present it is not, even though it has been allowed by the law in England since the Simmonds appeal in January 1999.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para22">
<a name="stpa_153">It is my opinion that the most serious cases of road traffic accidents involving death and serious injury should be dealt with by the Crown court; the majority

</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para23">
<a name="stpa_154">Probably one of the most difficult cases that I have been closely involved with is the Haque case. My constituent, five-year-old Hishamul Haque, was killed at the Camelot theme park at Charnock Richard, near Chorley in Lancashire, on the evening of 18 April 2004. The Haque family had travelled with their relatives and several children to the theme park in three cars during the morning, and had spent the entire day enjoying themselves at Camelot. They decided to return to their cars at about 5.30 pm, where they had some refreshments. Then, a game of football began in the almost empty car parking area. On the fringe of the car park are larger bays for the parking of coaches and buses, and the two areas are separated by another area which is marked by broad white lines and is used as a service road to the car parks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para24">
<a name="stpa_155">A service bus entered the car park just after 6 pm and proceeded to drive along the service road. The bus driver admits seeing the group playing football to his right, and also admits having seen Hishamul Haque chase the football out of the crowd in his direction and obviously across the path of the bus. The driver&#039;s explanation was that he kept to the left of the service road to avoid a collision with the young boy, who was running from his right towards the bus. However, the driver did not brake to stop the bus, and neither did he sound his horn. He also claims not to have seen or heard Mr. Haque, the father, shouting and gesticulating at him about the approaching danger. Tragically, it was too late and Hishamul was crushed by the front and rear wheels of the bus. The collision occurred in the part of the car park reserved for coaches and buses, to the left of the service road.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para25">
<a name="stpa_156">There has been a dispute about the speed of the bus. The driver claimed that he was driving at between 10 and 15 mph, while Mr. Haque claimed that he was driving at between 30 and 35 mph. Other witnesses, and evidence from a police reconstruction of the accident, support the driver&#039;s account. Lancashire police arrested the driver on a charge of suspected manslaughter. However, following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, the driver was charged with causing death by dangerous driving. Before His Honour Judge Slinger in the Crown court at Preston on 9 December 2004, the defence was successful in applying for the proceedings to be dismissed on the ground that the evidence did not meet the test for dangerous driving in section 2A of the Road Traffic Act 1988, to which I have just referred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-17_para26">
<a name="stpa_157">Obviously, the family were devastated by this decision, and they came to see me for advice. I arranged a meeting with the Crown Prosecution Service at Preston to discuss Judge Slinger&#039;s decision. On 13 to 15 February 2006, a trial was held in Chorley magistrates court before Judge Ward, and the driver was acquitted of a careless driving charge.

<p><a name="st_109"><a name="60308-18_spnew0"><b> Mr. Greg Knight  (East Yorkshire) (Con):</b> 
 We can all support the aims of the Road Safety Bill, because safety should be paramount on our roads at all times, and all classes of road user have a part to play&#151;not only vehicle drivers but pedestrians, cyclists and passengers. Safety on our roads cannot be achieved merely by soaking motorists with fines and penalty points. The most effective approach is a mixture of education, incentive and, when a transgression has occurred, punishment, whether against a motorist for speeding, a cyclist for ignoring a red traffic light or a pedestrian for jaywalking&#151;that is, stepping off the kerb into the highway when it is unsafe to do so. This is an ongoing battle, and it will not be won by the passage of the Bill. However, Members in all parties will have played their part if, during its parliamentary passage, we seek to improve its scope.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_159">I turn first to the Bill&#039;s contents, before making one or two observations on matters that are&#151;for the moment, at any rate&#151;outwith its scope. Some of its provisions are non-contentious, and rightly so. The provisions on road safety grants are to be welcomed. It is right and proper that the income from fines should be used for local transport facilities, or to fund road safety improvements. Similarly, I welcome the provisions for graduated fixed penalties, and on graduated fixed penalty points. Those proposals make sense; graduations should certainly apply to points as well as to fines. Indeed, when the breach of the law has been minute, or there are exceptional circumstances, there might be a case for nil points being imposed. I hope that that is something we can examine in detail in Committee. Flexibility is important so that, as far as possible, punishment always fits the crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_160">I have some concerns about vehicle examiners giving fixed penalty notices. When the Minister responds, I hope that he will address them. The police are trained in road traffic matters and the rules of evidence. Consequently, an honest policeman doing his job has a sense of fairness and justice when dealing with a motorist. If we give the power to issue fixed penalty notices to vehicle examiners, what training will they have? Will they be required to maintain a notebook in which to write down any comments made by a motorist that may be relevant in any plea of mitigation? What guidance will be given about when and where they should operate? Will they still need to be accompanied by an experienced police officer? If not, what powers will they have to stop a vehicle on the highway? I hope that the Minister can answer those questions when he addresses us later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_161">Clause 5 and schedule 1 clearly envisage a system in which fixed penalties are issued when the offences are detected remotely&#151;that is, when video footage is viewed and vehicles that may not have insurance or a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 867</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>valid MOT are identified. Will the Minister consider formulating guidelines so that provision can be made for a camera to photograph and monitor vehicles before they are stopped by vehicle examiners on appropriate occasions?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_162">During busy periods, it would make sense for vehicle examiners to have someone viewing a screen showing vehicles some distance away so that vehicles that have insurance and a current MOT can be allowed to pass without being pulled over. Vehicle examiners could then focus on those vehicles that have already been identified as perhaps being shady in some respect or as being on the road unlawfully. Where a law-abiding motorist is going about his business, every effort should be made to prevent him being stopped unnecessarily and thereby having his journey time lengthened. I think that that makes sense, and I hope that the Minister does, too. Will he reassure the House that if these examiners are given the powers envisaged in the Bill, they will not suddenly appear in every constituency setting up road blocks and stopping traffic merely to raise more money for the Government? I hope that they will have a duty to behave reasonably, not oppressively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_163">The provisions in clause 11 relating to financial penalty deposits will be welcomed on both sides of the House. They are clearly aimed at foreign truckers who are competing for work with British truckers. Foreign truckers are, generally speaking, able to put cheaper fuel in their vehicles, and once they get to this country they often flout our laws and ignore fines when they are imposed. I warmly welcome the provisions in clause 11, which are long overdue. Most law-abiding motorists will welcome them too. But will they be used only against heavy goods vehicles, or will they also be used against private vehicles?
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_164">I shall give the Minister an example. Some years ago, I was introduced to an American gentleman who was over here studying. He revealed that his studies were expected to take three years or so. He had brought over an American vehicle, a Chevrolet Corvette. For those who do not know what that is, it is a powerful sports car. His idea was to use his American car with American plates while pursuing his studies and to sell the car over here when he concluded them and returned to America. I was appalled and alarmed to discover that he had allowed his insurance and the American equivalent of vehicle excise duty to lapse, but had kept the car on American plates. He thought it was a rather good wheeze to have motoring on the cheap while he was in the UK. That sort of behaviour is to be deplored. I know that it does not occur on the same scale as heavy goods vehicle drivers ignoring their fines, but does the Minister intend clause 11 to catch people who are in the UK for the time being and are using a vehicle registered overseas which does not have valid tax and insurance? Those cases ought to be caught by clause 11.

However, I took my driving test 40 years ago, and if I had been required to learn the basics of first aid then, I would probably have forgotten them by now&#151;so I would not welcome having to advise an injured person I came across by the roadside about the first aid attention he should receive.

I agree, but I am alarmed that the Government are sanctioning a change in the highway code, and it will recommend that cyclists wear a cycle helmet. That sits ill with the fact that the Government are saying that as a matter of policy they are on the fence. In that case, why does the highway code argue that cycle helmets are necessary? If the highway code says that, there is a danger that soon lawyers will be arguing that if a child is knocked off a bike by a motorist who is guilty of careless driving, any damages in a civil case should be reduced if the child was not wearing a helmet. If the highway code is to be altered in that way, Ministers need to reflect again on their position.

<a name="stpa_169">I realise that the explanatory notes do not form part of the legislation and that they are for the guidance and benefit of Members, but in paragraph 86, on page 16, the Government set out their view of the scope of the provision on insurance:

Although the owner of a motor vehicle, even one undergoing restoration, ought to have insurance&#151;especially if the vehicle is valuable&#151;at present there is no requirement to insure that vehicle. Will that situation change, and if so, will it change both for vehicles subject to SORN and for those that are exempt?

 The right hon. Gentleman was kind enough to give me advance notice that he was thinking of raising that point, which I know he wants to explore further in Committee. The answer to his question is no; the intention is that it will not be necessary for such vehicles to be insured.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;If the vehicle has already been disposed of, the regulations may provide for a sum to be paid to the vehicle&#039;s owner provided the claim is made within a prescribed period.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_174">That sounds reasonable. Presumably, the sum to be paid will actually be a proper recompense for the seizure and crushing of the vehicle and not a paltry amount that reflects only 10 or 20 per cent. of the vehicle&#039;s value. I am assuming from the wording that there is good will behind the provision, and that the Minister intends the regulation to recompense the owner properly. He is nodding, so I am obliged to him for that assurance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_175">Clause 45 refers to the range of particulars to be included in the vehicle&#039;s register. We all understand why it is desirable to include mileage, to stop clocking&#151;the unlawful practice, mainly but not exclusively, of some second-hand car dealers, who realise that if they wind back the odometer they can vastly increase the vehicle&#039;s value on the second-hand market. I welcome that aspect of the provisions, but I hope that they will not be used for an identity card-like collation of personal information. I hope that we do not reach the point where, for example, the vehicle keeper has to give his passport number or date of birth. I realise that the form already includes a space for the date of birth, but the information is voluntary, not compulsory. If the Minister intends to broaden the provisions to make vehicle keepers give far more personal information, I hope that he will tell the House so on Second Reading, rather than let that intention emerge in Committee.

<a name="stpa_180">I am disappointed that the Bill does not deal with a number of other issues, which I hope we shall have time to debate during the remainder of its passage. One is the question of flexible speed limits, which are in force on the M25 to improve road safety and traffic flow. I think that they have largely been a success, and that there is an overwhelming case for trialling them on other roads, not necessarily just in a downward direction. I know that the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) is a little agitated at the thought of 80 mph speed limits on motorways, although that is the speed in France and, where a speed limit operates, in Germany; but I think we should consider trialling flexible speed limits on motorways where, on a clear day with light traffic flows, overhead signs could indicate that motorists were allowed to travel at 80 mph.

There are occasions&#151;when it is foggy, or there is snow on the ground&#151;on which the speed limit on a motorway should be reduced to below 70 mph. I think that we should trial the system of flexible limits to see where it takes us. I do not believe that it would lead to the consequences envisaged by the hon. Gentleman if it were applied when traffic flows were light and road conditions good.

<a name="60308-19_para13">
<a name="stpa_181">I also think that we should consider introducing flexible speed limits in the vicinity of schools. I know that a certain organisation has conducted a letter-writing campaign asking all Members to support blanket speed limits in villages and blanket 20 mph speed limits near schools. I think that it has something of a case, but I do not support the one-size-fits-all suggestion. There a number of villages in my constituency in which I would not want a 30 mph speed limit to be introduced, because the roads passing through them can safely carry traffic at a higher speed.

<a name="60308-19_para14">
<a name="stpa_182">However, I think that we should consider using flexibility, particularly with the advent of electronic speed signs and flashing warning signs, which are now available to us but were not a few years ago, and at trialling 20 mph zones outside schools, although not during the school holidays, because an inappropriate speed limit will be disobeyed by motorists. If they feel that the speed limit is not just they will ignore it, but we could try it an hour or so before school commences, or 15 minutes before schoolchildren come out and for an hour after the school day has finished. That is what I would like to see. Let us try flexible and temporary speed limits where appropriate. They will signify to the responsible driver, when he sees the flashing &quot;20&quot; sign, that school children are about to be in the vicinity. I think that most drivers would respond to that positively.

I would happily vote for Scots to have the ability to set their own time zone, and for us to maintain British summer time 12 months a year in England and Wales, in the interests not only of road safety but of tourism. I represent an area that includes the beautiful town of Bridlington. Lighter evenings encourage tourism and reduce energy costs, because there is a better matching of waking hours and daylight hours.

 Road safety is a policy area that has benefited immeasurably from cross-party consensus for many years. For decades, Labour and Conservative Governments have adopted the approach of long-term strategy tied to demanding targets for casualty reduction. Over that time, there has been great success in achieving those targets. It is remarkable that we have reduced in absolute terms the numbers of people killed or seriously injured on our roads over two decades in which the amount of traffic on our roads has continued to grow every year. As policy makers, we are entitled to congratulate ourselves on some success, but we need to ponder the amount of death and carnage still seen on our roads. More than 3,000 lives are lost every year, with 10 times that number seriously injured. We are entitled to say that we have had successes and that our policy works, but more remains to be done. That is why we are debating a new Road Safety Bill today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_195">We are keen, these days, on making decisions based on evidence. There is evidence that adding some measures to the Bill would save more lives. The first was mentioned by the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight). Changing the clocks&#151;our time pieces, not the odometers on our cars&#151;twice a year may be a wider issue than can be addressed by a road safety Bill, but the Transport Research Laboratory estimated in 1999 that having lighter evenings would save some 100 lives and prevent 2,000 serious and other injuries a year.

 I rise simply to put it on the record that not every Scot is opposed to the scrapping of Greenwich mean time. My hon. Friend is correct to say that many lives would be saved, and a proportion of those lives would be Scottish. On that basis alone, I am in favour of scrapping it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_134"><a name="60308-21_spnew1"><b> Mr. Kidney: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_196">The right hon. Member for East Yorkshire gave different figures, and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents has recently updated its estimate. It says that 130 lives would be saved and up to 2,500 injuries prevented every year. I appreciate that it is a reserved matter, so this Parliament would make the decision, and that it has wider implications than just road safety. More lives would be saved in the workplace, and it would have massive benefits for the economy, especially in tourism, sport and leisure.

<p><a name="st_135"><a name="60308-21_spnew2"><b> Mr. MacNeil: </b> 
 Perhaps we could have a compromise, with the clocks being changed back to Greenwich mean time a month or five weeks either side of midwinter, instead of the present seven weeks before and 15 weeks after?
</p>





<p><a name="st_136"><a name="60308-21_spnew3"><b> Mr. Kidney: </b> 
 That is a generous offer, but I suspect that it will not be decided by this Bill. I urge the Government to consider seriously whether we should have that debate and whether we could all agree on a proposal for change. We have heard Scots voices in this debate that suggest that the objections to the change are not uniform.

<a name="60308-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_197">I am grateful to Richard Allsop from PACTS for another piece of evidence. Last year, it was estimated that if we reduced the maximum drink drive limit from 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood to just 50 mg, we could save 65 lives a year. That is a modest change for a valuable saving. I hope that Government and Opposition Front Benchers will give serious consideration to that change, unlike in the last Parliament, when we considered a similar Bill. After all, it would put us back in the mainstream of maximum limits, because at the moment we are out on the edge when it comes to comparison with the legal limits in other countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_198">Allied to the drink-driving limit is detection of the people who drive with excess alcohol in their blood. I am a member of PACTS, which I mentioned earlier, and it recommends that we move away from waiting for people to commit an offence before we can test whether they are drunk while driving. We should move towards not random testing, whereby the police can stop anyone they like, whenever they like, for any reason, but to targeted testing, whereby, if the police have intelligence that there is a concentration of people driving with excess alcohol in their blood, the police can conduct tests in the area to try to detect them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_199">Those hon. Members who were part of the previous Parliament have largely seen such provisions before. It is pleasing to acknowledge that the Government listened to the debates and arguments during the passage of the previous Road Safety Bill, as far as it got, and that they have made improvements in the Bill. It is a shame that one of those measures&#151;the sentences that magistrates courts could impose for the proposed new offence of causing death by careless driving&#151;was watered down in the other place, and I hope that we can review that decision during the Bill&#039;s passage, to restore something that is strongly supported by hon. Members and the public generally.

 I was not here for the opening of the debate because I was attending a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association seminar. Would it be a good idea to invite the Minister to try to bring together groups, such as RoadPeace and Brake, with Members of the other House to hold a small seminar to find out whether they can get their minds together and agree a way for the courts not to be denied information about cause of death, so that it can be taken into account where it is relevant to the penalty?

<p><a name="st_138"><a name="60308-21_spnew5"><b> Mr. Kidney: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman and I used to co-chair PACTS&#151;I think he still does, but I do not&#151;and I thank him for that constructive suggestion. He missed the speech of the hon.

Gentleman suggests might have some appeal to his hon. Friend.

<a name="stpa_200">Further piloting of the alcolock is a very good suggestion. It is a way for the law to address the offender&#039;s specific problem before the courts. The more we can do that, the better in sentencing offenders in future. However, as well as those measures, I certainly agree with the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell about the need for more effective road policing. I remind the House that the Department for Transport, the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 877</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>jointly announced a road policing commitment in January last year, and the House needs to monitor the effectiveness of that announcement and ensure that we are getting the effective policing that we were then promised.

<a name="60308-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_201">I support more use of rehabilitation courses for drink-driving offenders, so I welcome the simplification of and extra incentives for those rehabilitation courses under clause 34.

<a name="60308-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_202">During debates in Committee on the previous Road Safety Bill in the last Parliament, I argued for further extensions of speed awareness and driving improvement courses for other road traffic offenders. Those courses help to address the offender&#039;s specific problem and try to put it right for the future, rather than simply sentencing historically for an offence that has been committed previously. Those courses are constructed to look forward to try to ensure that the same behaviour does not occur again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_203">I also support the proposal in the Bill for graduated penalty points. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said that when he first consulted on that idea more than a year ago the opinion of those who responded was quite closely balanced. More than a year later, the balance has shifted much more towards acceptance of graduated penalty points as part of sentencing procedure. However, the sticking point remains, as the Secretary of State well knows, the concern that many hon. Members have&#151;I am very much one of them&#151;that sending out the message that breaking 20 mph limits and 30 mph limits, even by quite a small amount, is less serious. Breaking the speed limit in precisely that way could have the greatest possible effect on other people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_204">After all, as other hon. Members have said already, hit a child pedestrian at 20 mph, or even 30, and the child may survive, but drive at closer to 40 mph, and there will be less chance to take avoiding action and the injuries that occur will be probably fatal to the child. With a penalty of two points each time, it will take six offences, instead of the current four, over three years for drivers to tot up enough points to lose their driving licence. The idea that that message will incentivise them to be careful on roads with those speed limits is misplaced to say the least.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_205">On the proposed new offence of causing death by careless driving, I recognise the concerns of those, including the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell, who say that punishment should be commensurate with the guilty act and not with its consequences, but to take a vehicle out on a road is to undertake a responsible activity. As I set out, it is foreseeable that hitting a person with a vehicle will cause injury&#151;perhaps fatal injury&#151;and that should be within the driver&#039;s contemplation. The existence of the offence will underline the responsibility that we all assume when we get behind the wheel. Of course, imprisonment for committing the offence is not compulsory or obligatory but will be reserved for those who have clearly failed, by the greatest amount, to shoulder their responsibility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_206">On specific aspects of driving that need attention, young drivers are most at risk of causing or being involved in road crashes. The insurance industry knows 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 878</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>only too well about that preponderance. Some imaginative schemes exist, such as the offer by some insurance companies to reduce the premiums of those who go on to take pass plus as well as their driving test. Norwich Union has a novel pay-as-you-drive insurance, which encourages people to stay off the most dangerous roads or off the roads at the most dangerous times of the day.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_207">Coming along behind those measures&#151;this has a slightly more general application&#151;are technological solutions, such as intelligent speed adaptation. Imagine when it will not be possible for the driver to exceed the speed limit because of how the vehicle is controlled. That will allow us to throw away all the speed humps and speed cameras, which must surely be attractive to many people and worth giving up the joy of breaking the speed limit. Such technology goes wider than measures that affect just young drivers, but it is important that we are young driver-aware in education, publicity and policing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_208">When we debate the Bill in Committee, I hope that we will give more attention to protecting cyclists, as seems likely from previous contributions. We want to promote cycling. It is a healthy activity, both for the cyclists and for the environment of the world that we all occupy. However, cycling on our congested roads is a dangerous activity. Let me give an example from my postbag. When my constituent, Alastair Semple, was knocked off his bike by a car at a roundabout, he found so little sympathy that the police were not even going to prosecute the car driver for careless driving until Alastair collected sufficient evidence, including photographic evidence, to persuade them that a prosecution was merited. We need more cycle lanes, stronger policing and better education for drivers and, I confess, for cyclists too. We need more publicity from the Department like the advert &quot;Think bike&quot;, which relates to motorcycles and is, I think, successful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_209">It has been estimated that around a third of road casualties occur as a consequence of people driving in the course of their work. We need to create a stronger focus, through the Bill, on employer responsibility for training and education, and, frankly, for not putting their workers under impossible time pressures. There are excellent examples of good employer practice, and we need to ensure that more employers, especially those in small and medium-sized enterprises, get the message and behave equally responsibly. The Bill goes with the grain of the national strategy for reducing casualties, and for that reason it should be supported. It has been improved as a result of consideration in the last Parliament, but it remains capable of further improvement in this one. I hope that in Committee we will have an opportunity to debate some possible improvements that can be made.

 I agree with the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake), who raised the issue of pedicabs, which are unchecked and unregulated, and cause major problems on our roads. There is no recourse for anyone involved in an accident with them, and that issue should be tackled as a matter of urgency. The hon. Gentleman and my right hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>I appreciate that refresher courses would be required, but if someone has learned something there are some aspects that they will never forget. If that training saves one life, it is worth while, but I recommend that we go a stage further. Some of our European neighbours and many other countries make it compulsory to carry first-aid kits in all vehicles, which benefits everyone if a vehicle is involved in an accident or, indeed, if the driver and passengers witness an accident. I urge the Government to consider making it a legal requirement to carry first-aid boxes in cars.

However, there is a speed camera in my constituency at the bottom of the M11 exit to the Redbridge roundabout, where accidents have gone up by 300 per cent. since it was installed. Either it is the wrong place and needs to be moved, or one must assume that it is there for other reasons. Speed cameras should be there to make our roads safer, and for no other reason. Hon. Members have spoken about the blight of mini-motorcycles, which is a huge problem. In my constituency and, I am sure, in others, one sees very young children with no head gear or training driving unlicensed vehicles on the road. We have read in the press about many accidents and, indeed, fatalities. That must be stopped. It is not simply a matter of asking our police force or, indeed, local authorities, to enforce a ban&#151;new legislation is required to bring mini-motorcycles into line with other road vehicles.

The 20 mph limit has saved many lives over the years, and it will continue to do so. As we have heard, the question of whether a child is hit at 20 mph or 30 mph can make the difference between serious injury and a life and death situation.

<a name="stpa_220">The right hon. Member for East Yorkshire referred at length to his dissatisfaction with traffic humps&#151;so-called sleeping policemen&#151;and I agree with much of what he said. In a previous existence&#151;as well as while being a Member of this House&#151;I found that residents often felt that sleeping policemen were a panacea. They think that if there is speeding in their neighbourhood, they should get some traffic humps. If someone is tragically killed in an accident, the answer is always traffic humps, but it is not always the right answer. The emergency services have grave reservations about sleeping policemen. I might not go as far as the right hon.

<p><a name="st_144"><a name="60308-22_spnew5"><b> Mr. Harris: </b> 
 I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, although I would be more cautious. I would suggest that, if someone suffers an injury from driving over a road hump or if the vehicle itself is damaged, the driver might be going a bit too fast. About a year ago, a friend of mine in my constituency&#151;an elderly gentleman&#151;complained about a series of road humps in Ardencraig road in Castlemilk. He told me that they were a waste of time. I said, &quot;Why&#039;s that?&quot; He said, &quot;When my daughter&#039;s driving me to my house in the afternoon we have to slow down and it takes ages.&quot; So, perhaps road humps are more effective than the right hon.

 The hon. Gentleman is speaking a great deal of sense about road humps. I agree that the people who complain that their cars are damaged are obviously going far too fast. One of the problems that I have come across in my constituency is the displacement of traffic on to roads that do not have road humps. I can think of an example involving four roads that are all parallel. Two of them have traffic calming involving road humps and the other two do not, and all the traffic has been displaced to the two that do not. The issue of traffic engineering is complex and must be thought through very carefully.

 The hon. Gentleman is right. That is where the role of local authorities is crucial. There is no point in considering a single road and deciding on a solution. A strategy has to be considered so that if traffic calming is implemented on one or two local roads, the knock-on effects on nearby roads are taken into account. In my experience, Strathclyde regional council, where I used to work, had a good record of doing exactly that&#151;as does Glasgow city council.

<a name="stpa_221">There is another point that I want to mention, and I appreciate the range that you have allowed to Members taking part in the debate, Mr. Deputy Speaker, because these are important issues, although they are not specifically mentioned in the Bill. A new practice that has unfortunately become more widespread in the past 15 or 20 years, although it was not heard of many years ago, is residents parking their cars on pavements. When I worked as a press officer for Strathclyde regional council many years ago, it was interesting that many of the residents who demanded road humps for their area were exactly the same people who parked their cars on pavements that were supposed to be used by pedestrians. Road engineers had, and have, a sensible response to the practice. If people park their cars on the road&#151;where they belong&#151;and thus reduce the width of a residential road, through traffic must slow down so that it can navigate the road safely. It makes absolutely no sense to widen a road by parking on the area intended for pedestrians and at the same time to ask for road humps.

Friend would not subscribe to that sentiment, far less give voice to it, which is just as well given that when Reginald Maudling, a previous Conservative Home Secretary, used the phrase in the House, he was promptly attacked by Miss Bernadette Devlin&#151;I do not propose such a course of action today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_223">There is no other aspect of public life in this country in which more than 3,000 deaths a year would be remotely acceptable or tolerated. If that number of deaths occurred on the railways or British domestic airlines, the situation would not be allowed to continue. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) talked about the number of people who are devoted to examining safety on the railways and airlines. We, as a society, have come to accept the number of deaths, but that should be at the root of our attempts to address the problem.

 The hon. Gentleman expresses support for a proposal that I advocated earlier. Would he be willing to put his name to an amendment that would introduce a road accident investigation board that could examine the pattern of road accidents and try to find solutions, as is the case for aviation and rail?

 I will resist that temptation because such a body would simply be another quango and would create more bureaucracy&#151;I am not instinctively in favour of such developments. Additionally, given the number of accidents that take place, such an investigation unit would repeat its investigations each time that one occurred. On balance, such a publicly-funded and unelected quango would not achieve a great deal, but I look forward to hearing the hon. Gentleman&#039;s arguments in Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_224">When the Bill becomes an Act, its success will depend on the greater acceptance and use of speed cameras. I declare an interest at this point because I have six penalty points on my licence. I was clocked on the M6 in December 2003&#151;I will not tell hon. Members the speed&#151;and five months earlier, I was caught by a speed camera on the A9. Even though the offences were five months apart, I found out about both endorsements in December 2003 and thus went from having a completely clean licence to having a licence with six points on it in two weeks. I reveal this partly in case someone else reveals it first and, secondly, because it has made me think carefully whenever I drive. I need my car to do my job.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_225">After such a fright from getting six penalty points on my licence in such a period of time, I have driven more carefully since the end of 2003 than at any other time in my life, and I have speed cameras to thank for that. I did not enjoy being caught, but it is an inevitable argument that even where speed cameras do not save lives&#151;for example, the stretch of motorway where I was caught is not a particular accident blackspot&#151;getting caught has led directly to a change in my behaviour. That outcome should be welcomed as a direct result of the proliferation of speed cameras in this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_226">There is a huge amount of media outrage, and it was suggested earlier that some Opposition Members are not as enthusiastic about the proliferation of speed cameras as some Labour Members. We see evidence of the <i>Daily Mail</i> Big Brother agenda every time new speed cameras go up. The George Orwell analogy is so over-used that I wonder whether any of the sub-editors have read &quot;1984&quot;. I do not remember Winston Smith being clocked for doing 80 mph on the M6. &quot;1984&quot; was about slightly more important freedoms than the freedom to break the law and endanger other people&#039;s lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_227">I am not in favour of restrictions on individual freedoms. For example, I did not vote to support the 100 per cent. ban on smoking in public places, but there is no such thing as the right to break the law. That should not be tolerated by the House. If speed cameras can contribute to a change in the culture whereby speeding becomes unacceptable, in the same way as drink-driving has become unacceptable, speed cameras will be seen historically to have made a major contribution to the safety of our culture. It is often said by the anti-speed camera lobby that speed cameras turn ordinary law-abiding citizens into criminals. They do not. Law-abiding citizens turn themselves into criminals by choosing to break the law by speeding. That is an unpleasant message to give, but it is fact.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_228">I want to challenge my hon. Friend the Minister on part of clause 18, which outlaws speed assessment equipment detection devices. I know exactly the kind of devices to which that refers, but could there not be a wider interpretation of the word &quot;device&quot;? Last year the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 884</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>AA published its new road map of Britain, which included the precise location of every stationary speed camera in the country. Whatever the protestations of the AA, the only reason for publishing the exact location of every speed camera in the country was in order to warn its members, the purchasers of that map, when they may get caught speeding. In other words, it was a device enabling people to break the speed limit on long stretches of road, and then to slow down when they were approaching a speed camera, in order to avoid prosecution. I hope that the clause will outlaw such a measure.
</p>





<p><a name="st_151"><a name="60308-23_spnew5"><b> Stephen Hammond  (Wimbledon) (Con):</b> 
 One could take the alternative view&#151;that the measure was telling people how to conform to the law.
</p>





<p><a name="st_152"><a name="60308-23_spnew6"><b> Mr. Harris: </b> 
 I could take that view, although I will not. That is exactly the argument that the AA used when it was justifiably criticised for producing such a reprehensible publication.
</p>





<p><a name="st_153"><a name="60308-23_spnew7"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Before my hon. Friend digs too deep a hole for me to climb out of, although the AA received a great deal of publicity for having produced that document, it was based on a document produced by the Government. We publish the sites of all speed cameras, as does every camera partnership. The reason we do that is in line with the argument suggested by the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond)&#151;we want people to know where the blackspots are, where the cameras have been located, so that they can address their offending behaviour and drive safely at those sites.
</p>





<p><a name="st_154"><a name="60308-23_spnew8"><b> Mr. Harris: </b> 
 That brings me to another point. I do not think that most drivers would respond in such a way. Personally, I do not believe that speed cameras should be visible from the road. Having speed cameras aimed at catching lawbreakers but painting them black and yellow&#151;there are lines on the road, but they have to be there&#151;to warn people that they are about to be monitored is completely self-defeating.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_229">The hon. Member for Ilford, North mentioned a problem in his constituency on the approach to a roundabout from a slip-road off the M11, where accidents had increased by 300 per cent. since a speed camera was installed. I do not know anything about the particular circumstances, but I wonder whether the reason for the increase is that the visibility of the camera forces drivers to slow down too quickly, perhaps causing cars to bump together. There is a simple answer: do not make the cameras visible. If somebody is driving within the speed limit at all times, they have no need to know where any of the cameras are. The idea that either the Government or the AA are making the locations of cameras known in order to safeguard people pushes the limits of credibility. The AA performed a service for particular drivers, as it knew that drivers needed to know the location of cameras in order to hit 80 and 90 mph between them.

<a name="60308-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_230">Another device that is used to beat speed cameras is special reflective number plates. There was an advert in Glasgow a few years ago&#151;it has now been removed&#151; next to the Clydeside expressway promoting reflective number plates that it said were guaranteed to beat speed cameras. Of course, there may be some loophole that

<p><a name="st_155"><a name="60308-24_spnew0"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 I shall give my hon. Friend the clarification that he seeks now. The Bill is intended to make legal devices that simply tell people where the cameras to which he refers are. In addition, however, a covert activity of speed detection is carried out by the police using radars. What the Bill makes illegal is devices allowing people to tell where such covert activity is taking place.

<a name="60308-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_231">Finally, I come to mobile phone offences and clause 26. Although once again the civil libertarians might say that the current law, which prevents drivers from using a mobile phone&#151;at the moment, there is only a fixed penalty&#151;and clause 26 are some sort of infringement of civil liberties, I have found among my own voters that that is not what concerns people. People are concerned that the law is already flagrantly flaunted and rarely enforced. Outside this Palace earlier this week, I watched a van driver turn off Westminster bridge and left into Millbank, stopping at the traffic lights in front of police officers and speaking on his mobile phone as he went.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_232">Of course, I welcome the measures in the clause, and I believe that people who use their phone irresponsibly while driving should have their licences endorsed. If that ultimately means disqualification, so be it, as that is their choice. However, the clause will only be as effective as the current law unless police officers do some serious enforcement. That is the only thing that will prevent people from using their mobile phones while they are driving. While it is obvious that people who use their mobile phones while driving are not being prosecuted or challenged, there is very little inducement for law-abiding motorists to fork out the money to have a hands-free kit installed in their car. That is what the Government should be encouraging people to do, and it will happen only once people who refuse to do it are held to account.

<br>&nbsp;<br>routinely commit large numbers of moving road traffic offences that principally involve speeding, but that also include dangerous driving such as jumping red lights. They get away with it because their vehicle details are incorrectly registered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_235">That matter involves blatant discrimination. Law-abiding members of the public who correctly register their vehicles rightly pay the penalty of the law when speed cameras or police officers catch them, while people who incorrectly register their vehicles get away with driving extremely dangerously. In my constituency, for example, the A505, which runs from south of Leighton Buzzard to north of Dunstable has a 50 mph speed limit, but drivers have recently been recorded driving at speeds of up to 119 mph on that road. One driver did 82 mph in a built-up area in Dunstable, where there is a 30 mph speed limit, while another jumped a red light six seconds after the light had turned red. I can also show the Minister ample photographic evidence of drivers making rude gestures to speed cameras because they know that they cannot be touched as the law currently stands.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_236">Since I raised the matter in an Adjournment debate on 8 December, five people have been involved in fatal accidents and three people have been seriously injured in incidents in Bedfordshire involving cars with incorrectly registered details. The tragedy is that some cars have been caught doing outrageous speeds on many occasions&#151;one vehicle has been clocked by speed cameras on 73 occasions and a motor bike has been caught 61 times. It is obvious that death and serious injury could be prevented if the police were able to act on the ample evidence provided by speed cameras.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_237">To give the Minister an idea of the scale of the problem, Bedfordshire police recorded 1,000 offences in December this year on which no action could be taken because it was impossible to trace the vehicles concerned. Those offences resulted in more than &#163;30,000 of outstanding fines, many of which have lapsed under the six-month rule. The public expenditure implications are important, and I am sure that the Minister wants all fines to be collected.

 May I urge the Minister to seize the opportunity provided by the Road Safety Bill to address the problems of unidentified and untreated sleep disorders among drivers, as a means of improving road safety? The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) mentioned this issue earlier. The Bill, and the Department for Transport&#039;s &quot;Tiredness kills&quot; campaign, include welcome measures&#151;the Secretary of State mentioned picnic areas&#151;to address the problem of sleepiness in tired but otherwise healthy drivers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_255">However, those measures fail to educate or regulate the estimated 4 per cent. of the middle-aged population who suffer from the sleep disorder known as sleep apnoea, and who might be unaware that they have a medical condition, as such conditions are not checked for under the present licensing system. Sufferers of obstructive sleep apnoea have been shown to have a worse driving performance than healthy drivers who are over the alcohol limit.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;For many years prior to my car accident there were periods during the day when I felt utterly exhausted. Unknown to me I was experiencing poor quality sleep every night and to an extent it was affecting my whole life. My ability to concentrate was poor. In August 1997 we had been out walking in the morning, had a light lunch (no alcohol), a further walk in the afternoon, and I was driving home when I apparently dozed off and next thing was that we hit a tree at about 60 mph. Fortunately, neither I nor my wife was seriously injured, although I was taken by ambulance to hospital with an aggravated spinal complaint.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">The car following me up the hill was being driven by an off duty traffic policeman on holiday. Being first on the scene he checked for alcohol then asked several questions from which I subsequently realised (after diagnosis with sleep apnoea) that he was obviously familiar with the condition. Previous visits to my GP had not revealed anything untoward, it was put down to long and irregular hours (I suspect more than likely the general lack of understanding of the Sleep Apnoea condition).&quot;</p>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_257">The prevalence of sleep disorders is significant and growing. As obesity is a contributory factor to OSA, the incidence of the disorder is likely to increase. The largest British survey to date of drivers of heavy goods vehicles studied 900 drivers over two years and found that one in six had severe OSA. It also found that one in three HGV drivers had moderate OSA. Awareness of sleep disorders among members of the public, drivers and employers of professional drivers is unacceptably low.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Bill that we are discussing. We cannot have a general discussion about sleep disorders. That would be more appropriate for another occasion, perhaps even an Adjournment debate. She must somehow relate what she is saying to the Bill, and not just by vaguely alluding to the fact that sleep disorders may cause road accidents. She must propose what might be done in the Bill to address the issue.

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker; I do beg your pardon. I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention. I will cover the point that she raised later in my speech, as well as outlining what I would like to see in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_258">As I was saying, awareness of sleep disorders among members of the public, drivers and employers of professional drivers is unacceptably low, given the associated risks. Indeed, the Department is well aware of that. In 2004, an expert workshop convened by the Department for Transport on driving and medical aspects of excessive daytime sleepiness concluded:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;The key issue was how to address the undiagnosed, but potentially high-risk, driver with a sleep disorder . . . The major focus should be on identifying and treating unrecognised patients rather than just addressing the issue of driving in those already known to have OSA&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_259">I am concerned that from the answers to parliamentary questions that I tabled in the autumn, it would appear that the DFT has not undertaken research into the medical status of individuals involved in sleep-related traffic accidents, nor kept a record of the number of accidents where a sleep disorder was a contributory factor. That suggests a fundamental gap.
</p>





<p><a name="st_163"><a name="60308-25_spnew4"><b> Tom Brake </b> 
: I hope it will be a helpful intervention if I suggest that sleep disorders are the sort of thing that the road accidents investigation board, which could form part of the Bill, could investigate.
</p>





<p><a name="st_164"><a name="60308-25_spnew5"><b> Mrs. Riordan: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention and agree with him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_260">Additionally, the licensing system needs to be more robust. Research undertaken by the Institute of Advanced Motorists and published in February 2006 found low awareness of the effects of medical conditions upon driving among occupational drivers and their employers. In a survey of 1,000 drivers in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, seven out of 10 said that their employers neither offer nor require medical check-ups. It is also worth noting that although the symptoms of sleep disorders can be managed cheaply and effectively, enabling most drivers to return safely to driving, there is a failure to provide those medical services, which results in a disincentive to report to the DVLA.

<p><a name="st_165"><a name="60308-25_spnew6"><b> Mark Hunter  (Cheadle) (LD):</b> 
 The hon. Lady has raised a number of important points, but the key is surely that the Bill does nothing to address concerns about driver sleepiness as a result of the sleep disorders to which she has referred. Would the hon. Lady agree that a major disadvantage of the Bill is that it does not envisage strengthening the process of awarding licences or reviewing medical fitness to drive? Would she also agree that those issues need to be considered by the Department for Transport and that a regular review of medical fitness is required to deal with the problem?

<a name="stpa_262">It must be communicated to drivers who experience persistent sleepiness that in addition to the short-term measures outlined in the Bill, such as stopping at a safe rest area or drinking a high caffeine drink such as coffee, they may need to seek medical help to establish whether their sleepiness derives from a sleep disorder.

<p>
<a name="60308-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_263">Secondly, the Department should take steps to inform drivers about sleep disorders and their responsibility to report any concerns they may have over their medical fitness to drive. The processes of awarding a driving licence and reviewing fitness to drive should be strengthened to increase the likelihood of sleep disorders being identified in drivers. Lastly, the DFT should collaborate with the Department of Health to ensure the speedy diagnosis and treatment of drivers with sleep disorders to help to remove the existing disincentive to report symptoms or to seek medical health.

 When the Secretary of State opened the debate he pointed out that the national road safety figures were improving, which is welcome&#151;but unfortunately, in my constituency they are doing anything but that. Last year there were 20 road fatalities&#151;about four times the national average&#151;and this year, sadly, there have already been four deaths. It is only March, yet we are already approaching the national yearly average, so it would be gratifying if the number did not increase at all this year.

<a name="stpa_264">There is a mixture of reasons for those accidents. The coroner has not yet reported on many cases so we cannot talk about them, but in one accident involving young drivers the report has been made and the cause was drink-related excessive speed. My constituents were affected particularly by the prevalence of multiple fatalities, especially of younger drivers, and I shall discuss some of the remedies to prevent such accidents.

<p>
<a name="60308-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_265">One good thing that came out of those tragedies was the good response of the local community. Mike Webb and Jimmy Martin, driving instructors and members of the Forest and Wye Valley Driving Instructors Association, have put together, in their own time, an excellent presentation, which they have been taking to schools in the area, to get through to youngsters the importance of safe and careful driving, to try to save lives. They have been working with the fire and rescue service, the police and the county council&#039;s road safety team.

<a name="stpa_266">I am pleased that the county council has targeted highway improvements in its budget plans for future years, to ensure that our roads are safer. Local authorities will be bidding for road safety grants from the Department for Transport and it is worth noting that there are some straightforward physical changes that can be made, especially in rural areas&#151;for example, the proper installation of road drainage. In Gloucestershire county council&#039;s new contract, drainage will be a key performance indicator. It is important to make sure that there is no surface water on roads, as it appears to have been a factor in at least one of the casualties last year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_267">The Secretary of State mentioned the number of accidents that do not involve another vehicle. In my rural constituency, a number of fatalities occur when people lose control of their vehicle and hit a sizeable roadside tree. The county council is looking into the idea of cutting back trees, which will have several benefits. It will improve visibility, reduce ice cover&#151;because the road will not be in shade&#151;allow boundary features and road signs to be more visible, and provide more space for horse riders to get off the road if necessary. Neither measure&#151;proper road cleaning or control of vegetation&#151;would cost much. When we consider the financial costs of a road fatality, quite apart from anything else, such investment is sensible.

<p>
<a name="60308-25_para13">
<a name="stpa_268">The Bill includes proposals for road safety grants, for which local authorities will bid and which the Department will award based on the road casualty figures and the quality of the local authority&#039;s casualty reduction plan. I welcome the proposal for the grants. My only plea to the Minister is that the application and assessment process should not be painful for local authorities, or require huge amounts of bureaucracy. Furthermore, given the variety of road safety performance and geographical area, as well as the nature of the road network, there should be significant local flexibility when assessing casualty reduction plans. After all, local people have a much better idea of what needs to be done to improve road safety in their area.

<a name="stpa_269">The hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) touched on the statistics about young drivers, noting that young men account for only about 4 per cent. of the driving population, but for more than 30 per cent. of dangerous driving convictions. It is clear from the various meetings that we had following road accidents in my constituency, with young drivers in particular, that we need to do more than provide education and training in the theory and practice of driving. We should bear in mind the attitudes that young males bring to driving. For one thing, they think that they are invincible; unfortunately, when they discover that they are not it is often too late, and they, or others, pay the price. There are also societal factors. Young men are influenced by, for instance, magazines that emphasise the attractiveness of speed. We need to combat such influences.

It was the idea of a Surrey firefighter, Rob Green, who was the victim of an accident caused by a speeding uninsured young driver. The Bill may help to prevent such accidents. The driver hit Rob Green and his wife when they were travelling on a motor cycle. Sadly, Mrs. Green was killed, and her husband lost both legs

The first event was staged in Dorking. Groups of sixth-formers were bussed to a venue several times a day to see a production involving a filmed reconstruction of a genuine road accident in which a young person had been killed and others severely injured. The film used all the emergency services, and was shockingly realistic. I viewed it on a DVD with which I was supplied.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-25_para16">
<a name="stpa_271">Following the screening, the audience was addressed by the emergency service personnel who had been involved in the original accident: the firefighter who cut the passengers free, the paramedic who was first on the scene, the doctor who pronounced the young person dead, the policeman who had to visit her parents, and the victim of another road accident who had ended up confined to a wheelchair. Apparently the effect on the audience was profound. Subsequent research confirmed that the event had changed the young people&#039;s attitudes to driving, and made a noticeable difference to the way in which they conducted themselves.

 The hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that we should target certain age groups with certain messages. The increasing prevalence of accidents among born-again bikers is often overlooked. They acquire very fast machines in middle age, and late middle age. A road in my constituency, between Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Rempstone, is a death trap. The number of accidents there is significant. Should we not target groups of that kind as well?
</p>





<p><a name="st_171"><a name="60308-26_spnew1"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 My point was not exclusive, but the statistics show a notable prevalence of casualties and convictions for dangerous driving among younger people. In my constituency last year, a significant number of such drivers were young. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, however. All drivers need to think about the way in which they conduct themselves on the road. At many of our meetings following road accidents, many older and more experienced drivers were frank about the fact that they too might not have the right attitude to driving. They may have as much to learn as some younger drivers. Nevertheless, there is unmistakable evidence that young people account for a significant percentage of road accidents.

<a name="stpa_273">The pass plus course is one of the training opportunities for drivers, particularly new drivers. I have tabled some questions on that matter to the Minister, and raised it at oral questions. One of the things that I am thinking about is how to arrange things so that young drivers, in particular, see the benefit of undertaking such training. One of the blocks is that pass plus carries a financial cost. Sometimes, if a younger driver has just paid for driving lessons and is having to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 894</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>fund a car, taking other training is quite expensive. There is one obvious method to make that more affordable&#151;providing young people with significant discounts on car insurance, which is a significant cost, as a result of having done pass plus or other training.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_274">Many insurance companies offer discounts for pass plus, some of which can be quite significant&#151;but that is not always the case. I have spoken to a number of young people in my constituency who have taken pass plus or other training courses. For example, Sarah Rudge, a 19-year-old from Mile End, and Jonathan Jones, an 18-year-old from Pope&#039;s Hill, recently took a Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents course. I presented them with their certificates in my constituency office. I talked to them about what happened. They struggled to get improved insurance quotes, even though they had taken some training and demonstrated that they were careful drivers and approached driving with the right attitude.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_275">If it is not possible for the Government to fund pass plus for younger drivers, perhaps they can have talks with the insurance industry to look at the evidence from drivers who have taken extra training to see whether it has had a significant effect on the safety of their driving. If it has, perhaps they could try to get the insurance industry to assess the risk properly when they offer quotes. That seems a good way to encourage increased take-up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_276">The insurance companies have an incentive to encourage safer driving, particularly with younger drivers. If people have accidents in which they are seriously injured, which stops them from being able to work and means that they need significant support throughout their life, it can be incredibly expensive. I have been given one example of a 22-year-old driver who attempted to overtake at high speed and had a serious accident. Considering the medical costs, the damages for injury, the modifications to his housing, the fact that he was not going to be able to work for the rest of his life, and the fact that his previous job had been modestly paid, the insurance company was looking at a total claim of &#163;3 million. That may be exceptional, but in view of some of those factors, it is easy to see that the financial arrangements could be made to work in the right direction and encourage young people to become better trained and better qualified, and to approach driving with the right attitude. I urge the Minister to do that in conjunction with the insurance industry.

Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) was worth elaborating on&#151;his remark about what happens to drivers if they swerve to avoid an animal and cause a road accident and a death. In certain parts of my constituency, we have a significant deer population. The main roads through the forest are not fenced. A person can be driving perfectly safely and reduce their speed because they know deer are about&#151;but deer, unlike some other animals, can give no warning. They can come out straight in front of the driver. They are of a significant size. The driver reacts. There is no time to think&#151;it has happened to me; fortunately, there were no other vehicles in the vicinity. The driver swerves to avoid the animal and crosses to the other side of the road. At a different time, they could have caused a

<p><a name="st_172"><a name="60308-26_spnew2"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 I should make it absolutely clear that the circumstances that the hon.

Let us not create constructs that lead us to criticise this legislation for the wrong reasons.
</p>





<p><a name="st_173"><a name="60308-26_spnew3"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for that intervention, and I do not want to make too much of the issue. Some Members have focused today on what happens as a result of an accident, but however appalling such results are for the families concerned, in making law and setting penalties we have to consider the motivation and behaviour of the driver, regardless of the consequences.
</p>





<p><a name="st_174"><a name="60308-26_spnew4"><b> Mrs. James: </b> 
 Like many Members present today, I have several high-profile cases in my constituency involving young people who lost their lives. I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but I cannot let it pass. In the past year, three young people&#151;Lesley-Ann Morgan, her fianc&#233; and a friend&#151;lost their lives in a very serious crash in my constituency when returning from a happy family evening. The wedding of Lesley-Ann and her fianc&#233; had been soon to take place; now they are buried next to each other. Although their families have received a lot of support, they remain greatly concerned about the sentence handed out. The two young men in question, who were racing at speeds in excess of 70 mph in a 30 mph zone, could have been sentenced to 22 years&#039; imprisonment. We should never think that the families&#039; feelings should not take precedence.
</p>





<p><a name="st_175"><a name="60308-26_spnew5"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 I take that point, and it is clear that in such cases the right offence for someone to be charged with is dangerous driving, which addresses the question of intent. The hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) mentioned similar cases in his constituency, and his complaint seemed primarily to be about the sentences that the courts had chosen to impose. I do not know the details of those cases, but if the complaint is the sentences being chosen, giving the courts more options will not solve the problem, bearing in mind the fact that they are not taking up the options that they already have. The Crown Prosecution Service could perhaps do with some guidance in that regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_278">I welcome the fact that the Bill will allow an alternative verdict to that of manslaughter in cases where such a charge is brought; that is a sensible move. We should encourage the prosecuting authorities not simply to go for the easiest charge, for which they know they will secure a conviction. If they genuinely think that the circumstances merit the higher charge of causing death by dangerous driving, they should prosecute on that, rather than going for the easier charge. That would go a long way towards dealing with the admittedly tragic cases in which the CPS should have brought a charge of dangerous driving, but chose a different charge.

<br>&nbsp;<br>in having them. Speeding is a case in point. The cause of accidents in rural constituencies such as mine is often not speeding per se, but driving at inappropriate speeds. In other words, even if people are driving well within the speed limit, if they are approaching a bend, or there is poor visibility or dangerous weather conditions, they could still be driving inappropriately fast for the conditions. We can deal with that problem only if sufficient traffic officers are available to catch such people and advise them, or to take other action. Regardless of how many speed cameras there are, they are suitable only for catching people exceeding the speed limit. In many cases, driving at the speed limit is very dangerous, and we need to catch such people. That is not going to happen unless we have sufficient enforcement.

<a name="stpa_280">The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) and my right hon.

The other aspect of an early response to accidents is ambulance response times, which will never be as quick in rural areas as they are in urban areas, even when the system is working well. We have had some very slow ambulance response times, which I have taken up with the Minister&#039;s colleagues. An initial speedy response is important, and it is worth considering how we could build first aid training into the driving test. We could also consider how we could encourage all drivers to be more skilled in that area, without making it compulsory.

<a name="stpa_285">On the afternoon of 12 June 2004, 12-year-old Callum Deacon, from the Saffron lane area of my constituency, was out on his bike with friends in Asquith way. He was hit and, tragically, killed by a speeding motorcyclist. Significantly, the motorcyclist did not brake immediately, but carried on for a few hundred yards. Because he did not brake, there were no skid marks, so it was not possible to tell definitively at what speed he had been travelling.

<a name="stpa_286">Incidentally, I was encouraged by the remarks from my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) about the dangers associated with motorbikes. In our consideration of the Bill, we are right to focus not only on cars, but on motorbikes and to recognise the dangers for those who ride or are hit by them. Callum&#039;s body was catapulted 40 yd down the road, so we can well imagine at what speed that motor cyclist must have been going, but it was apparently impossible to prove his speed satisfactorily for the benefit of the courts to ensure a conviction for dangerous driving. The driver admitted careless driving, as he had not braked, but because there were no skid marks and because his speed could not be determined precisely, the judge very reluctantly&#151;he expressed his dissatisfaction at having to do this&#151;had no alternative but to rule that there was insufficient evidence to convict for dangerous driving, although that had been the charge.

It is not surprising that Callum&#039;s parents, Mandy and Ivan, who had to wait 20 months for that verdict, described it as an insult to his memory. Of course, they know, as we all know, that nothing can bring Callum back, but they have, very much to their credit, actively campaigned to ensure that drivers who cause death by careless driving receive an appropriate prison sentence in future.

 I am listening very carefully, and the hon. Gentleman says that the difficulty of assembling evidence was the reason for sentence imposed in that case. If the motor cyclist was charged with causing death by careless driving, given the difficulties with the evidence and proving the speed and so forth, he would not be given a prison sentence, because the judge would not consider that he had the necessary evidence in front of him. The danger is that we may hold out the promise of something that simply will not happen. If the evidence had existed, we would not need the new charge, because the motor cyclist could have been convicted of dangerous driving.

That gap is significant, and the Bill sets out to fill it.

<a name="stpa_288">As I have said, Callum&#039;s parents know that nothing can bring him back, but their campaign has been actively supported by the community in the Saffron lane area and by the <i>Leicester Mercury</i>. The right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight), who has some connections with Leicester, paid tribute to that paper earlier, and I do the same: it is has actively campaigned on behalf of Callum&#039;s memory, and its headline, &quot;Insult to our boy&#039;s memory&quot;, is very much a reflection of local feeling on the issue. As is typical of the <i>Leicester Mercury</i>, it very much reflects the community that it serves.

 My hon. Friend&#039;s constituency almost neighbours mine. Yes, the <i>Leicester Mercury</i> has an excellent record of campaigning on such tragic events. The Weir family of Donisthorpe in North-West Leicestershire, whose teenage son, a pedestrian, was killed late at night by a lorry driver who died of a heart attack some weeks later, were unable to get to the bottom of the evidence because of the lack of a charge. They will never know precisely and unambiguously what happened, because the inquest procedure was inadequate. They would certainly love to see such an offence on the statute book, although it will do nothing to ease their hurt.

 That example&#151;right hon. and hon. Members could no doubt give others&#151;adequately illustrates the gap in the law and, I believe, the overwhelming public support there will be for the provision when the Bill is enacted, as I hope it will be.

<a name="60308-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_289">To digress, I welcome the Secretary of State&#039;s remarks. In addition to strengthening legislation, he drew attention to the need for the courts to take seriously&#151;certainly far more seriously than they appear to do on occasion&#151;the causing of death by driving motor vehicles, whether it is by driving dangerously or, as the Bill provides, by driving carelessly.

I know that Callum&#039;s parents would agree that the sooner the Bill is enacted and implemented, the better. From the experience of other hon. Members and the examples given, I know that, like me, many people disagree fundamentally with the hon. Members for Forest of Dean and for Epsom and Ewell. There is a need to fill the gap.

<p><a name="st_183"><a name="60308-27_spnew7"><b> Mr. Peter Bone  (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> 
 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Leicester, South (Sir Peter Soulsby), who spoke on the very subject that I want to talk about. After five hours of debate, I am glad that we have returned to that important issue. I also very much welcome the agreement between Front-Bench spokesman to move forward so that we find the right law to deal with the problem. The Government should be congratulated on introducing the Bill, but it needs improvement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_292">I want to talk specifically about what has become known in my constituency as Alexine&#039;s law. Alexine&#039;s parents and family have taken a close interest in today&#039;s proceedings. There is a huge gap in the law between careless driving and causing death by dangerous driving. Let me spell it out: as the law stands, if someone pleads guilty to careless driving, the maximum punishment is a &#163;2,500 fine and discretionary disqualification; the maximum punishment on conviction of causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years&#039; imprisonment, an unlimited fine and mandatory disqualification.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_293">One problem with the current law is that the police and the Crown Prosecution Service are likely to accept a plea of guilty for the offence of careless driving to be sure of a conviction&#151;the very point that the hon. Gentleman made. In many of those cases, they should push for the offence of causing death by dangerous driving. However, that means that more evidence has to be gathered and more work done, and there is a chance that the defendant will be found not guilty. That is why we absolutely need something in between. It is not acceptable for someone to take another&#039;s life, even if unintentionally, then plead guilty to careless driving in the knowledge that they will escape with just a fine. Off the record, the police say that the best way to murder someone is with a car, as the penalties are not very high, even if the perpetrator is caught. Such a statement may appear ludicrous in the light of the picture that I have painted but, sadly, it is the truth. I thank the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) for the help that she has provided on the issue of causing death by dangerous driving. She has provided me with informative advice through letters and meetings, and I am grateful. I pay tribute, too, to Brigitte Chaudhry of RoadPeace who, with her colleagues, has worked hard to highlight the gap in the law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_294">As secretary of the associate parliamentary group for justice for road traffic victims I have met and listened to the victims&#039; families. I have been told of extremely sad 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 900</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and tragic cases in which young people have been killed, yet their killers have escaped with just a small fine because it is easier for the courts to prosecute someone who pleads guilty to careless driving than find the evidence to prosecute someone for causing death by dangerous driving. There are obvious budgetary pressures on the Crown Prosecution Service as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_295">I became aware of the huge gap between careless driving and the offence of causing death by dangerous driving when my predecessor, together with our excellent local newspaper, <i>The Evening Telegraph</i>, campaigned for a new law and a new offence of causing death by careless driving. On 7 June 2004, 17-year-old Alexine Melnik was tragically killed in a road traffic accident. Alexine, whose parents live in Rushden in my constituency, had her whole life to look forward to, but it was cut short. The person driving the car that caused the crash pleaded guilty to careless driving. He was given a &#163;500 fine and he kept his licence; 17-year-old Alexine lost her life. Alexine was returning from Great Yarmouth as a passenger in a car travelling on an A road on a hot, sunny afternoon. Her car was hit from behind&#151;both cars were travelling at a speed of about 50 mph&#151;and was knocked into the oncoming traffic. She lost her life, but the driver who caused the crash could not remember what had happened. He had been up since 4.30 am, and many people would conclude that he had fallen asleep at the wheel. There is clearly a case for stronger prosecution in such cases. It is not acceptable for lawyers in the House to say that there are sufficient laws in place, as those laws are not used. There is a gap, and we need to fill it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para13">
<a name="stpa_296">Alexine&#039;s family has been campaigning since her death for a change in the law so that a new offence of causing death by careless driving that attracts a custodial sentence can be introduced. As I said, the campaign is known locally as Alexine&#039;s law in remembrance of Alexine Melnik. If that law is introduced, although it will not bring her back, it will certainly mean that she did not die in vain. Mr. and Mrs. Peter Melnik and their family have campaigned tirelessly to raise the issue, and last March Mr. Melnik gave evidence when the previous Road Safety Bill was in Committee. The dedicated campaigning of the Melnik family and other families across the country who have been sadly affected by the gap in the law has made a genuine difference. It is their hard work, borne out of the tragedies that they have suffered, that has highlighted the issue to the Government and to Parliament. No one who heard Mr. Melnik&#039;s evidence could fail to be impressed by his integrity and determination to seek justice for families who have lost loved ones as a result of other people&#039;s bad driving. One can only marvel at the courage that Mr. Melnik and his family have shown.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para14">
<a name="stpa_297">As a result of lobbying by road safety groups and affected families, the Home Office carried out a consultation exercise entitled &quot;Review of Road Traffic Offences Involving Bad Driving&quot;. I believe that it is right that the views of the public are sought before elected representatives make decisions. In fact, I have been running a campaign called &quot;Listening to Wellingborough and Rushden&quot; since 2001. I felt that politicians of all parties had become a little arrogant and out of touch, and that they were happier to preach to people than to listen to them.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 901</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para15">
<a name="stpa_298">My campaign seeks the views of local people, groups and organisations, and then campaigns for change on their behalf. As part of the campaign, I contacted many people to make them aware of the Home Office&#039;s consultation, and urged them to submit responses in favour of the creation of a new offence of causing death by careless driving.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para16">
<a name="stpa_299">The response was huge, with people from all political parties supporting a change in the law. In my response to the consultation, I stated that I felt it was imperative that the new offence of causing death by careless driving needed to be created. I also said that people so convicted should face heftier punishment, which should include a prison sentence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para17">
<a name="stpa_300">There are two reasons for that, and the first is that a tougher penalty will act as a deterrent. As Mr. Melnick said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;We have a duty of care to others when we take to the wheel of a care. We cannot wash our hands of that responsibility when things go wrong and the outcome doesn&#039;t suit. If we are put through the pain and anguish of a proper and intensive investigation in order to establish . . . an understanding of what happened, I contend most people would consider it to be a minor inconvenience when compared to the trauma and finality of death.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">We are a civilised society and one of the cornerstones of it is the value and respect for human life. Just because we drive a car doesn&#039;t absolve us of the responsibility to uphold that value.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para18">
<a name="stpa_301">Secondly, the new penalty will give the victim&#039;s family a sense of justice. Although a life cannot be brought back, a small fine imposed by the courts is no justice for a family who have lost a love one because of bad driving. I was pleased when the Minister of State intervened earlier to make it clear that, with this Bill, we are talking about bad driving, not about people who suffer a lapse of concentration or who swerve to avoid a deer in the road. They will not be prosecuted, but at the moment those who drive badly get away almost scot-free.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para19">
<a name="stpa_302">I have raised this issue on many occasions in Parliament. In my maiden speech, I stated that I would do all in my power to bridge the existing gap in the law. I have addressed two oral questions to the Prime Minister, and several written questions to the Home Secretary. I was very pleased that, as a result of the Home Office consultation and the pressure brought to bear by MPs and the public, including Mr. Melnik, the Government introduced a new offence of causing death by careless driving in the Road Safety Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para20">
<a name="stpa_303">The provisions of the new law would have given the courts the option of handing down a custodial sentence of up to five years for someone found guilty of causing death by careless driving. That was a major step forward in closing the gap between the offences and the punishments of careless driving and causing death by dangerous driving.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para21">
<a name="stpa_304">There is well documented opposition to the heftier punishments associated with the new offence. Members of the legal profession have concerns about a custodial sentence because of the issue of intent. There are also concerns that a custodial sentence could be given when a person has committed an unintentional act rather than a deliberate one. Some people say that no one gets into a car with the intention of killing someone, but I believe that the courts should be allowed to decide whether to dole out the maximum penalty on conviction.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 902</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para22">
<a name="stpa_305">It may be that, in most cases, a prison sentence of five years is not appropriate, but we need to give the courts the option of deciding whether it is. They need the widest discretion, after hearing all the facts and evidence. We are always hearing from the judiciary that the Government dictate what they can and cannot do, but this Bill gives us an opportunity to give the courts the option of different punishments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para23">
<a name="stpa_306">When the House of Lords considered the Bill, it voted against a custodial sentence being handed out in a magistrates court, but the vote was very close. It was still in favour of the option of a custodial sentence if someone was convicted in a Crown court. I reiterate my belief that we should give both courts the option of different punishments. That includes a custodial sentence to be handed out on conviction. I urge the Government to adopt the right course of action and reverse the decision made in the House of Lords. I believe that the Secretary of State gave that assurance earlier.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para24">
<a name="stpa_307">I would like the new offence of causing death by careless driving and the maximum sentence of five years&#039; imprisonment to be part of the Bill. My main fear is that, if the Bill is left as it stands, people will plead guilty to careless driving in the hope that their case will be heard in a magistrates court, where there is no chance that they will receive a custodial sentence. That would still result in a weakening of the law because defendants would know that if they pleaded guilty to careless driving, they could get off with a punishment that was much less severe than the one that they deserved. Given the tragic and sad stories that I have heard as secretary of the all-party group on road traffic victims, that is just not acceptable. I urge the House to give the courts&#151;both Crown and magistrates&#151;the opportunity to impose a custodial sentence following a conviction for careless driving when a death has occurred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-27_para25">
<a name="stpa_308">I congratulate the Government on listening to the concerns of victims of road accidents and the House of Lords on introducing the new offence of causing death by careless driving. The new law needs to be considered in detail in Committee. It is very encouraging that Parliament is working as it should. Both sides have concerns, but want to move things forward. I hope that Alexine&#039;s law passes on to the statute book as quickly as possible.

If that number of people were killed in Iraq, there would be a similar response.

The debate has been constructive and this is an instance of

<a name="stpa_310">The Opposition welcome much of the Bill as a genuine attempt to reduce the slaughter on the roads and will take a constructive and, we hope, helpful stance in Committee. Although we extend that broad welcome to the Bill, we feel that it could be improved and will aim to achieve that wherever possible. It could be more imaginative and, in places, tougher. In seeking to achieve that aim, we hold it as profoundly essential that the number of tragedies on the road is reduced. We have heard numerous cases from hon. Members on both sides of the House. Tragedy is an apt word, because behind the crude statistics, human beings are dying, often in horrendous circumstances. That should be no one&#039;s fate and we should wish it on no one&#151;and no driver wishes it on anyone.

<a name="stpa_311">There was a terrible story last Christmas involving the death of a 16-year-old girl who was thrown from a car that was being driven by her brother when it collided with another vehicle in Oxfordshire. One cannot begin to imagine the grief of the parents who have to live with that every day. In February, three people from one family died after their car came off the road and plunged into a nearby river. Last December, just a mile from that scene, a father and a seven-year-old also died. The local constable Mick McCready said:

<a name="stpa_313">The problem involves huge numbers of people. The Minister has answered parliamentary questions that I have tabled. In 2004, there were 34.27 million substantive licence holders driving 25.75 million cars, 2.9 million vans and 434,000 lorries between them. It is pertinent to some of the clauses of which we strongly approve that the number of foreign-registered vehicles leaving the UK has rocketed from 671,000 in 1997 to 1,595,000 in 2004.

<a name="60308-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_315">As the answers to the parliamentary questions showed, the sheer number of drivers and vehicles requires drivers&#039; co-operation and collaboration with the authorities in order to improve road safety. With such large numbers, coercion will not work. I entirely agree with my right hon.

<b>8 Mar 2006 : Column 904</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>not go far enough, and it fails to take a holistic view of the problem. There should be a change of attitude in the way that we deal with road safety. To achieve the aim of reduced casualties requires a partnership not just between the enforcement agencies and road safety professionals, but with all road users, especially drivers. Road safety should not be an &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; problem, with one group aspiring to impose duties and obligations on another. It should be a shared enterprise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_317">That is where parts of the Bill are wrong. It follows a long line of legislation adding to the number of controls imposed on drivers and adding to the penalties. In this context, the vexed question of speed cameras arises. Ten years ago there were 200,000 speeding fines. That number increased to 2 million last year, bringing in more than &#163;114 million. All those revenues should be spent on road safety improvements. Whatever our opinions on the use of speed cameras, they have caused ill-will outside the House and are widely perceived as revenue-raising devices, not road safety devices. By resorting to a combination of draconian law and indiscriminate enforcement, there is a risk that we are losing the hearts and minds of drivers, when we need their co-operation to help improve road safety.

I should declare that my wife gave me a GPS device which tells me where cameras are. Unlike the hon. Gentleman, I am in the happy position of not having any points&#151;touch wood.

 I have cited the Haque case, which went from arrest on suspicion of manslaughter through the Crown court, where the charge of dangerous driving was dismissed, and ended recently with an acquittal in Chorley magistrates court. I have discussed that matter with the Crown Prosecution Service, which referred to the Kondeh Conteh appeal case. Kondeh Conteh was a man who was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving and who got off in the Court of Appeal, where it was stated that the case did not meet the threshold for dangerous driving. The definition is difficult to interpret, and the precedent set by such cases has caused problems.

<p><a name="st_188"><a name="60308-29_spnew1"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 That intervention is helpful. Perhaps we can examine the definition of dangerous driving, which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years, to see whether we can plug that gap. Hon. Members on both sides of the House have raised examples, and there is clearly a problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_330">We are concerned in principle that the sentence will depend on the effect of the action, which could be capricious.

 When a stabbing takes place, the victim might or might not die, which determines what the perpetrator is charged with.

The problem is that the gap between dangerous driving and minor traffic offences is too great.

<a name="stpa_331">The hon. Member for Glasgow, South touched on 20 mph limits. Picking up on the comments by my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire, we agree that there should be various speed limits and greater flexibility. I, too, have been impressed by the impact of self-illuminating signs that are triggered by vehicle movement, and I like the suggestion that more of those signs should be erected near schools. It is worth remembering that 70 per cent. of all accidents involving injury occur in urban areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_332">Fifty per cent. of deaths and injuries on roads occur on main roads, and many of those accidents are caused by car drivers overtaking lorries and creating head-on collisions. We should like to discuss raising the maximum speed for lorries on unrestricted single carriageway roads from 40 mph to 50 mph. That would lead to serious environmental gains. Moreover, it is ridiculous that modern lorries have to grind along in a lower gear given the new braking and suspension systems. There would be a safety gain because frustrated drivers would not be provoked to overtake at inappropriate moments.
</p>





<p><a name="st_195"><a name="60308-29_spnew8"><b> Mr. Tom Harris: </b> 
 Might not that increase the likelihood of accidents? Car drivers will still inevitably want to overtake, but they will be given far less time to do so because the vehicle that they are overtaking is going faster, leaving a much smaller window of opportunity.
</p>





<p><a name="st_196"><a name="60308-29_spnew9"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 There is a sporting chance that the hon. Gentleman will get on to the Committee, and we can discuss this in some detail. I do not agree with him. I think that holding lorries back to 40 mph is frustrating for car drivers. The figures are pretty dramatic. As I said, 50 per cent. of deaths and injuries occur on main roads, and many of those involve head-on collisions.

<a name="60308-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_333">We are looking to toughen up our amendment on reflective markings. That would be very effective. Forty-five per cent. of all fatalities occur at night. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) referred to the evidence from the University of Darmstadt that 37 per cent. of all side collisions occur because trucks were seen too late. The cost of reflective markings&#151;about &#163;100 to &#163;150&#151;is trivial compared with that of a new truck, which is worth &#163;100,000 to &#163;150,000.

<a name="stpa_334">My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr.   Scott) mentioned rudimentary first aid training. We are strongly in favour of introducing that in the theory part of the driving test. More than half of all road accident casualties occur before the emergency services arrive, so the actions of bystanders are vital. Research by Hussain and Redmond in 1994 showed that up to 85 per cent. of preventable pre-hospital deaths involve factors such as a blocked airway that could be avoided

That is far too short a time for an ambulance to arrive. All that one has to do, apparently, is to tilt the person&#039;s head backwards, although I am no medic&#151;I would not wish anyone to find me around at the time of an accident.

<a name="stpa_335">Drivers under the age of 29 make up more than a third of those involved in accidents, and drivers between the ages of 17 and 20 are six times more likely than a driver over 40 to be involved in a collision that causes injury. It is interesting that some of the new EU countries&#151;Slovakia, Slovenia, Latvia and Estonia&#151;have practical first aid tests as part of the process of learning to drive. We support proposals to make a few simple changes to the theory test that would impart vital life-saving skills and be of real benefit.

<a name="stpa_336">My hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) made some excellent points about young drivers. The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) touched on the good work that is done by the Institute of Advanced Motorists. We would like to discuss the idea of having different tiers of licence and different tests so that there is, in effect, a graduation process. It is somewhat irrational that we allow young people, who have probably taken a few driving lessons and passed their test having had experience only in towns, to be suddenly let loose on motorways, with no limit on the horsepower of the car. As the institute says, there would be real benefits in people continuing to develop their driving skills after passing the basic test. It is well worth pursuing discussions with the insurance industry to see whether that would have a financial bite. As the Secretary of State said, people might be more inclined to take it up if there is a financial gain. We would therefore like to pursue that in Committee.

<a name="60308-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_337">We are not happy about the way in which the Bill treats training as an alternative to punishment. We believe that that is psychologically wrong.

 The hon. Gentleman may be interested to learn that, in Cheshire, the police have employed such a practice for a long time.

That is a good idea.

 That is a helpful intervention. Any sort of training or driving course is a good idea. However, it should not be viewed as a punishment, but a sensible action and a progression from the basic test. It should be like getting scout badges, with the benefit of reduced insurance. However, that is the sort of detail that we could discuss further in Committee.

 It is good to follow the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson). From his tone and his description of the way in which Conservative Members will handle the Bill, we can all look forward to an enjoyable and constructive Committee stage. I suspect from the comments this afternoon that we will spend more time in Committee discussing the things that are not in the Bill than those that are. However, we must wait and see.

<a name="stpa_341">One day, I may write a book on parliamentary strategy. If I do, I shall dedicate a chapter to the tactics that the Opposition have to adopt when they agree with the Government. It is not the Opposition&#039;s job to agree with us or give us an easy ride. Broadly, they have three strategies. The first is the missed opportunity strategy, whereby they accuse us of not doing a pile of things that we could have done. The second is the Trojan horse strategy&#151;suggesting that we intend to do something that we have not included in the Bill. The third is the devil-in-the-detail strategy, whereby they say that they will explore the measure with us in Committee. All three were thoroughly deployed this afternoon.

<a name="stpa_342">Before I deal with specific points, let me start with the comments of the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling). He made some sensible points but appeared to try to build a case that the thrust of the Bill was not where it should be&#151;on the hard-core offender. He gave a series of examples of actions that are clearly against the law now. The problem is not to make them against the law because they are already illegal, but enforcing the law.

<a name="60308-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_343">The hon.

I can tell him that failing to stop after an accident can already attract a six-month prison sentence, a &#163;5,000 fine, a mandatory endorsement and a discretionary disqualification. It is already a serious offence, and clearly the law has to be enforced.

<p>
<a name="60308-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_344">The hon. Gentleman and several other hon. Members mentioned railway crossings. Several provisions on that matter were put into the Bill in the House of Lords, and we understand their purpose. However, we are not sure that they have really hit the mark or that they are necessary. There is clearly a case for the existing law on who is responsible for making improvements at level crossings to be clarified, and we intend to table amendments to that effect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_345">However, most of the debate on that subject today was about the punishment for jumping red lights at level crossings. We shall consider those points carefully and discuss them in Committee to see whether there is an issue there. I saw just such an incident a few weeks ago when I was waiting in a traffic queue at a level crossing in my constituency. It was a level crossing with double barriers, but the diagonal single barriers came down first, and someone drove down the outside of the queue of traffic and gambled on being able to cross the line before the second set of barriers came down. That is clearly the kind of idiotic behaviour that the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) described earlier, and the law on that has to be enforced. At the moment, however, the penalties for that kind of behaviour are the same as those for going across a red light anywhere. If we are going to change that penalty, we need to widen the debate and ask whether the penalty for crossing red lights in general are tough enough, rather than limiting the discussion to level crossings. That is something that we shall consider carefully and bottom out in Committee.

Let me remind the House that the theory test already includes a series of questions on first aid, so anyone who wants to be sure of passing that test needs to have swotted up on first aid. It is certainly the case that one does not automatically get a question on first aid because questions are chosen randomly from a body of questions available for the test.

I have already put the Driving Standards Agency and the Red Cross together to discuss that possibility. I have also said that if we can find some way of providing training materials, perhaps a DVD on first aid, we will look at ways of distributing it with the theory and hazard test DVDs that we sell through stationers around the country. We charge about &#163;8 for those DVDs, and the theory and hazard tests can be practised on one&#039;s computer.

We are talking to insurance companies, but even if they gave discounts I am not sure how much that would help, as many young people go on the road for the first time on mum and dad&#039;s insurance&#151;the kid will not have an incentive to do pass plus unless they are paying for their insurance from their own pocket. A broader campaign of education, targeting resources on younger drivers, looking into training for younger drivers and working with approved driving instructors to provide young drivers with the necessary experience might be more fruitful lines to explore, and I am talking to the DSA about those ideas.

<a name="stpa_354">Members raised a number of other issues. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South and the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire mentioned road humps. However, I have to say that if somebody drives so fast over a road hump that they are injured, I have not the slightest bit of sympathy for them. The road hump would be doing its job by slowing them down. Road humps are always installed in consultation with the emergency services and various designs are available to meet different needs.

<a name="stpa_355">My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Riordan) spoke about sleep disorders such as tiredness and sleep apnoea. One aspect of being moved from Department to Department is that Ministers&#039; crimes tend to follow them around. When I was a health Minister, my hon. Friend&#039;s predecessor initiated a debate on sleep apnoea to which I responded, so I am well aware of the issue. Primary care trusts are responsible for ensuring that services are available for the care of people with sleep disorders. We have launched a prominent campaign, advising all drivers to take at least 10 to 15 minutes&#039; rest every two hours. Only last week I made a pitch to an informal council of transport Ministers in Austria, suggesting that we launch a trans-European campaign on driver tiredness. I think that that would be an appropriate campaign for Europe to focus on.

<p>
<a name="60308-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_357">As I told my hon. Friend earlier, the road camera programme is aimed at areas where there is overt enforcement. We want people to know that there is enforcement in those areas, because we want them to control their behaviour at known blackspots. In addition, the police retain all the powers that they have always had to carry out covert enforcement. We encourage them to use those powers. We certainly do not want to legalise devices that would let people know where the police are covertly enforcing speed limits. We do not want radar detectors to be legalised, for example.

 Absolutely&#151;and they are. Not only are they painted bright yellow; we insist that they are placed where people can see them. Not long ago, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made a statement about the way in which we would change the use of cameras and the use of money. That is relevant to the view expressed by the hon.

 I am happy for my hon. Friend&#039;s local paper to advertise the location of the speed cameras and the areas of enforcement.

The moratorium was agreed in 2000, and there is concern that it will be overturned. If it is amended to permit case-by-case assessment, its very purpose will be in jeopardy.

<a name="stpa_377">I believe that to be a wrong assessment. V-GURTs have a unique property. They are not just any type of genetic modification; they have ramifications that could affect the entire planet.

<a name="60308-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_378">Why would anybody want to introduce terminator technology? There are two possibilities. They may want to prevent the contamination of non-GM crops by GM crops, thus resolving a fundamental concern about GMOs. Or, as most people suggest, the technology is designed to ensure greater profits for seed manufacturers by requiring new seeds to be purchased annually. However, the seed industry should not be painted as the villain in this picture. I have no interest in seed companies&#151;although I might like one, I do not have one&#151;but they are commercial businesses that have a duty to their shareholders and employees to make profits. Their decision-making process should, and largely does, focus on what is in the best interests of the company, rather than any wider audience.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_379">The decisions are taken within a framework of national and international law. Monsanto, the very large company that trades in seeds, has made a welcome decision not to use terminator technology, but the decision on what technology is acceptable is properly the remit of elected representatives in Parliaments such as this, and of Governments. It is Governments&#039; responsibility, not the companies&#039;, to determine the appropriate use of innovative and controversial technology.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_380">If terminator technology will prevent GM contamination&#151;that was an issue in my constituency in 1998, when the first GM trials took place outside Totnes and resulted in many people destroying crops and being sent for trial in Plymouth&#151;why do environmental groups not hail it as a great invention? It is partly because so little is known about the precise nature and behaviour of the technology. As Dr. Srinivasan and Professor Thirtle recently said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77">&quot;The nature of interaction of terminator varieties with other crops and species is not known. It remains to be assessed whether terminator varieties are, accidentally or otherwise, capable of rendering the seeds of (adjacent) non-terminator varieties also sterile.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_381">Gene silencing and gene instability could result in the seeds behaving in unexpected and unpredictable ways. Some scientists have speculated that the process will

<br>&nbsp;<br>render only 80 to 85 per cent. of the so-called suicide seeds sterile, leaving 15 to 20 per cent. carrying the gene in an inactive form. That clearly poses the danger of the gene spreading into other crops through cross-pollination. It has also been suggested that it would be impossible to ensure that all seeds were treated with the chemical&#151;for example, ethanol&#151;required to switch on the terminator gene. That obviously creates the potential for wide margins of error that could result in the unintended spread of those GM seeds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_382">In the worst-case scenario, terminator seeds would have more than the intended consequences of producing sterile plants. The technology could leak out and prove much more dangerous than the spread of other types of GM contamination. If the technology proved imperfect and spread, farmers could end up unwittingly planting sterile seeds that would diminish their crop yield, with disastrous consequences. How can we consider lifting the moratorium on that technology, when the evidence is so vague?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_383">Let us suppose that the technology worked perfectly and produced seeds that were always sterile. Should we then give it the go-ahead? Should the Government go to Brazil and say, &quot;Whoopee, we&#039;ve got the answer&#151;let&#039;s go ahead&quot;?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_384">I have no doubt that the Minister is aware that at least 1.4 billion people&#151;nearly double the size of the population of India&#151;mainly in developing countries, currently practice seed saving from one year to the next. That has been practised since crop civilisation began many hundreds of thousands of years ago. It is not only cheaper than buying new seeds every year, but allows the development of regional varieties particularly adopted to local conditions. Obviously, that practice would not be possible if people started out with a suicide seed. The seed collected from the crop would be useless and new ones would be needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-33_para13">
<a name="stpa_385">However, so long as farmers can choose not to buy such seeds, it could be suggested that there is no reason why the market should not determine the commercial success of suicide seeds versus fertile seeds, whether GM or non-GM. Could countries that wish to ignore such technology simply do so? The concern is that if all big multinational seed producers decide to use terminator technology and produce only suicide seeds, there is a real possibility that farmers may not have a choice about whether to buy into that technology in the future. The choice would have gone. The danger is that companies might produce only seeds with agronomic characteristics that also come packaged with a terminator gene. It might be that not only all new seed varieties came packaged with a terminator gene, but seed companies modified all their seeds, so that all existing varieties became terminator seeds&#151;suicide seeds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-33_para14">
<a name="stpa_386">It is worth remembering that innovation and development in seed technology are essential if we are to feed the world&#039;s rapidly increasing population, which it is estimated will reach 10 billion people in 2070. As Monsignor Bruce Kent said, the train has left the station; there is no way of stopping the population of the globe doubling by 2070. Therefore, we need seed

</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-33_para15">
<a name="stpa_387">Terminator technology has been a solution to the weaknesses of patenting law and its enforcement. It is clear therefore that if the moratorium on terminator technology is lifted, those companies will have understandable reasons to make the most of its obvious advantages for profits, particularly if we do not improve patent law. That could well result in the end of the local adaptation of varieties and community-based seed, which would clearly have adverse consequences for biodiversity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-33_para16">
<a name="stpa_388">In any case, agriculture is not a precise science, and it is inevitable that terminator seeds and normal seeds might become mixed up over time, particularly on small-scale holdings in developing countries, where land is not clearly separated by substantial fences or hedges. In such circumstances, accidental mixing or physical contamination could easily occur, and it would have devastating consequences if, as a result, the crop was significantly less than what had been planned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-33_para17">
<a name="stpa_389">It takes no great stretch of the imagination to envisage the horrendous food shortages and famines that could occur as a result in countries where food is already in high demand. In Africa, 90 per cent. of all seed planted is from farm-saved sources, and the vast majority of farmers are subsistence farmers. Thus those who live at subsistence level are most vulnerable and most at risk. The Kenya Small Scale Farmers Forum said in September 2005:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_78">&quot;We do not trust regulations or seed companies to ensure that GURTs seeds do not accidentally contaminate or get mixed in with conventional seed, or planted by mistake. But farmers planting sterile seed face disaster and hunger.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60308-33_para18">
<a name="stpa_390">For such reasons, many developing countries are vehemently opposed to that technology. A number of African non-governmental organisations released a statement on 2 February 2006, calling for the moratorium to be strongly reaffirmed, if not made concrete in an outright ban. The effect of terminator technology on developing countries is particularly worrying in the light of concerns that even if individual countries decide to ban the use of terminator seeds, the Government&#039;s institutions and structures in those countries are often not sufficiently well established to be able to enforce such a ban, and thus it may well creep in by the back door.

 In conclusion, I do not believe that terminator technology should be ruled out for ever. We cannot say that. What we do know is that there is insufficient evidence on how the technology would operate in practice, when one takes into account the possibility of gene silencing and gene instability, and cross-pollination if some seeds that carry the gene turn out to be fertile.

<br>&nbsp;<br>terminator seeds become mixed up with normal seeds, the scale of the catastrophe could be horrific. Once the technology is let out of Pandora&#039;s box, there is no putting it back. We must be more certain of the consequences before we release the genie from the bottle&#151;if the House will excuse the mixed metaphors. We can guess, however, that the consequences could be far-reaching and dramatic. This could be another historic turning point, as significant as the agricultural or industrial revolutions.

<a name="stpa_396">Terminator seed technology, which the hon. Gentleman described well, is still at the concept stage. It will not be with us in the foreseeable future.

<a name="stpa_397">As with all new technologies, terminator seeds present both risks and potential benefits, as the hon. Gentleman also acknowledged.

<br>&nbsp;<br>position, no country can be forced to accept terminator seeds. The Cartagena protocol on biosafety under the UN convention on biological diversity was developed to ensure that all countries that are signatories to the protocol can make their own decisions about whether to authorise a genetically modified organism for import.
</p>





<p><a name="st_239"><a name="60308-34_spnew1"><b> Mr. Steen: </b> 
 That is not quite the point. If the major seed companies that control 80 per cent. of the world&#039;s seeds produced only terminator crops, it would not be long before there was nothing else to buy, as there would not be a choice. The question whether or not a country signs up to the protocol is a red herring.
</p>





<p><a name="st_240"><a name="60308-34_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 It is not entirely a red herring. There are no companies, as I said, that are even thinking about commercialising such seeds. The strength of the countries that have come together under the Cartagena protocol make it very unlikely that the scenario about which the hon. Gentleman is concerned will develop. As I was saying, the protocol takes a strong precautionary approach, which means that countries can decide not to allow imports, even if there is lack of certainty about the extent of possible adverse effects. The protocol allows socio-economic considerations to be factored in.
</p>





<p><a name="st_241"><a name="60308-34_spnew3"><b> Mr. Horam: </b> 
 Is the Minister saying that a country must agree to the introduction of the seeds before they can be sold commercially there?
</p>





<p><a name="st_242"><a name="60308-34_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 That is absolutely right. The Cartagena protocol encourages all parties to share information on potential impacts&#151;socio-economic information as well as scientific, technical, environmental and legal information on genetically modified organisms&#151;which will assist in informed decision-making. There has been talk in the media recently of the moratorium on the use of terminator seeds&#151;indeed, the hon. Member for Totnes referred to it. The House may find it helpful if I read out the decision made at the fifth conference of the parties.
</p>





<p><a name="st_243"><a name="60308-34_spnew5"><b> Mr. Steen: </b> 
 There is no point in one African country deciding not to go down that road, as the seed will just blow over its border. That is the problem.

<p><a name="st_244"><a name="60308-34_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 That is exactly why it is important that those countries have come together in the protocol. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, developing countries in particular share common concerns.

<a name="60308-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_399">As the hon.

No GMOs can be marketed until they have been approved by a rigorous assessment procedure. Decisions on each GMO are considered separately against a list of criteria laid down in the legislation. Like any GMO, one that makes use of terminator technology would be approved only if the evidence showed that it would not pose an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment.
