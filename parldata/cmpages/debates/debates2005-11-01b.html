 (Con): If he will make a statement on the Government&#039;s position in the budget negotiations on the United Kingdom&#039;s rebate from the European Union. [23241]

<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="51101-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  (Mr. Jack Straw): </b> 
 We are committed to working for a deal at the December European Council. Our position on the abatement remains as set out by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister in this House on 20&nbsp;June.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="51101-01_spnew0"><b> Daniel Kawczynski: </b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for that answer. Does he agree that securing the rebate was a tremendous achievement by Mrs. Thatcher and that it would be incorrect to give it up, as certain Cabinet members have suggested in the press, while fraud accounts for between 7&nbsp;and 10&nbsp;per cent. of the EU budget? Does he agree that if we gave up the rebate, every penny piece, which should go to our schools and hospitals, would go on fraud in the European Union?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="51101-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I was in the House when the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, explained what she had done, and we were very unimpressed. She had to go for a rebate because of the consequences of her disastrous economic policies, which plunged Britain into recession, put 3&nbsp;million people on the dole and made the United Kingdom one of the poorest countries in the whole of the European Union. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am surprised that Conservative Members are laughing about 3&nbsp;million people being unemployed. That was the reality 20&nbsp;years ago, and many of our constituents remember it, which is why they have refused to return a Conservative Government since 1997. Thanks to this Government, far from being one of the poorest nations in Europe, we are now one of the most prosperous, so the context for negotiation has changed.

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 708</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>House and when he meets European colleagues. Will he raise the profile of the fairness of the budget distribution within the European Union and emphasise that the issue concerns not only an abatement or budget rebate, but finding a fair system that allows us to pay our fair share, which is no more and no less than our major partners?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="51101-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 We intend to have detailed discussions for the first time since the June Council at the General Affairs Council, which will meet next Monday 7&nbsp;November. My hon. Friend is right that fairness is the issue. The current abatement is an anomaly, but it is an anomaly on an anomaly, and the most profound anomaly is the structure and funding of the common agricultural policy. That is the reason why we are seeking a review mechanism within the next financial perspective to ensure major and significant reforms of the CAP and a better distribution of the funding of the overall EU budget.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="51101-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Eric Forth  (Bromley and Chislehurst)</b> 
 (Con): Will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Foreign Secretary tell us whether the rebate is non-negotiable in those terms? Alternatively, will he reassure the House and the people of this country that if there is no reform of the CAP, there is no question of renegotiating the British rebate? Will he please answer those questions unequivocally?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="51101-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 What I can tell the House unequivocally is that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) has said, the rebate is currently fully justified. We are seeking a fairer system of funding, and if the reason for the rebate&#151;the unfairness over time of the CAP&#151;were to fall away, the case for the abatement would fall away. However, I will not anticipate the consequence of the discussions that will take place over the next two months.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="51101-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. John McFall  (West Dunbartonshire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): May I support the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) by asking the Foreign Secretary to dismiss any suggestions that the rebate should be discussed before the bloated CAP programme is rectified? There should be a common EU-US policy on the Doha round in Hong Kong to allow developing countries at least half a chance of getting their goods into the rich man&#039;s network. It is only after those things have been achieved that we can even begin to discuss the rebate.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="51101-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 We are bound to discuss the rebate in the context of the future financing arrangements for 2007&#150;13. That is unavoidable, because the current arrangements are on the table, where they have been since last June. I fully share my right hon. Friend&#039;s concerns about the structure and fairness of the budget, which is why we refused to reach a deal at the June Council and have clearly set out what we regard as an acceptable context for a deal in December.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="51101-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Graham Brady  (Altrincham and Sale, West)</b> 
 (Con): We are four months into a presidency that lasts six months&#151;two thirds of the way through&#151;yet last week I was told in a written answer that the Government have yet to present any presidency proposals for the 2007&#150;13&nbsp;budget. When the first ministerial discussion is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 709</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>held on 7&nbsp;November, will the Foreign Secretary at least make it clear that the UK will make no concessions, including on the rebate, merely on the promise of a review of farm spending in 2008&#150;09?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="51101-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 We set out the circumstances in which we are willing to reach an agreement. The House has the reassurance of not only what I promise here but our refusal to do a deal in June because the offer from the Luxembourg presidency was not acceptable. We need a budget that is fair to all, takes account of the changed circumstances&#151;happily, the UK is a much more prosperous nation now than it was 20&nbsp;years ago&#151;looks forward and shifts more funding towards the future of Europe, especially research and development, rather than its past, namely, agricultural spending. No responsible Government would anticipate the precise nature of any deal, or outline it until it was done.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="51101-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Michael Clapham  (Barnsley, West and Penistone)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend knows that the EU budget was set in accordance with the strategic objectives that were identified, one of which was prosperity. In identifying that, the need for investment in training and education, small and medium-sized businesses and research and development was also recognised. If the spat on the rebate ends with the budget not being signed over in December, what will be the effect on that objective? Is it likely to have a detrimental impact on growth in the EU?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="51101-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 If there is no deal on the budget this or even next December, under the treaties, existing budgets are simply rolled over so that the budget&#039;s current structure is frozen, including the disproportionate amount that is spent on the common agricultural policy. We want a more significant proportion of spending to be devoted to research and development. I am pleased to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say that we have the support of the president of the EU Commission, President Barroso, but we have a long way to go before we convince all our EU partners, especially France and other countries that are heavily dependent on agricultural subsidies, that that is the way forward. That is the purpose of the negotiations in the next seven weeks.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="51101-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. John Redwood  (Wokingham)</b> 
 (Con): Will the Foreign Secretary hold urgent talks with our French partners about the matter? Does he agree that, unless we can remove the French obstacle on the agricultural budget, the EU can make no sensible proposal through the trade commissioner to help the Doha talks, and that we will therefore do nothing to help the struggling third world, which needs to export into our markets?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="51101-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I have urgent talks all the time with our French colleagues&#151;that is the easy part. It is more difficult to get them to agree with the position that we and other member states have taken. Agricultural subsidies and the Doha round were discussed at the special meeting of the General Affairs Council two weeks ago today. France sought a change in the negotiating mandate for the Commission and it was not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;successful. The existing mandate was confirmed. We realise&#151;and others in Europe would do better to realise&#151;that the level of subsidy for farming is proportionately higher in Europe than in the United States.

<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="51101-02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Europe  (Mr. Douglas Alexander): </b> 
 We welcome Ambassador Eide&#039;s report and, in particular, his recommendation that a final status process be launched in Kosovo. That should reinforce regional stability and strengthen democratic, multi-ethnic society in Kosovo. The international community will remain engaged throughout the process and in implementing any settlement. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary will chair a discussion on Kosovo with EU colleagues on 7 November.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="51101-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Devine: </b> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend for his answer. What contact has he had with the Kosovan authorities about the return of people displaced by the conflict?

<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="51101-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 May I take this opportunity to welcome my hon. Friend to the House and to his first Foreign Affairs questions?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">I had the opportunity on a recent visit to Kosovo not only to meet representatives of the Kosovan authorities but to visit the multi-ethnic village of Bablak, where I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was able to meet villagers who told me of their own&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experience of trying to re-forge a multi-ethnic community in the circumstances that followed the difficulties of recent years.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="51101-02_spnew2"><b> Mike Gapes: </b> 
 The Eide report makes sobering reading. It states that considerable work needs to be done on standards, particularly in regard to corruption, policing and judicial systems. Will the Government assure us that they will proceed with caution towards the final status, ensuring that any solution takes full account of human rights and of the judicial and policing systems in Kosovo?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="51101-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 I can give the House that assurance. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am also aware of the important work that the Foreign Affairs Committee has done on the western Balkans; it published a report earlier this year. Given the importance of the issues involved, we none the less welcome the ambassador&#039;s report. My hon. Friend is right to identify the fact that further progress on standards undoubtedly needs to be made. None the less, the conclusion of the ambassador&#039;s report was clear.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="51101-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. John Randall  (Uxbridge)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Minister agree that an important partner in our discussions on the final status will be the Republic of Macedonia, in the light of its own success in establishing a multi-ethnic state? Does he also agree that, before a final status for Kosovo can be achieved, the situation regarding the border area around Debelde should be resolved?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 711</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="51101-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is correct to acknowledge that certain border issues need to be discussed as part of the final status process. He is also right to pay due compliments to the work that has been carried out in Macedonia. Macedonia should offer us a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sense of possibility and optimism when we consider the challenges facing Kosovo, given the circumstances that afflicted Macedonia only a few years ago and the extent to which it has successfully managed to forge a multi-ethnic community in recent years.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="51101-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Crispin Blunt  (Reigate)</b> 
 (Con): Will the Minister&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confirm that self-determination would be wholly inconsistent with the policy of Her Majesty&#039;s Government when we intervened in Kosovo in 1999? Will he also confirm that the Government have learned the lessons of intervention without a clear exit strategy?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="51101-02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 I would be surprised if the hon. Gentleman was now arguing that we should have accepted ethnic cleansing being perpetrated on the borders of the neighbourhood that is the European Union. It is important to recognise that Kosovo&#151;along with other partners in the process&#151;has a responsibility towards the final status talks that are now taking place. It is not for me to pre-judge the outcome of the process at this time.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="51101-02_spnew8"><b> Mr. Denis MacShane  (Rotherham)</b> 
 (Lab): I welcome my right hon. Friend&#039;s approach, but surely, after six years, the time has come to say that we should let Kosovo be Kosovo. This bastard half-state is a child of the United Nations, without the authority of a state to pass laws or to accept the responsibility of developing good relations with its neighbours, and it cannot continue much longer. Belgrade cannot have a veto.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for consultation with Kosovo&#039;s neighbours in Macedonia, and for infrastructure development to allow economic growth to take place. Another five or six years of this non-status for Kosovo will make matters far worse. The time has come to say that Kosovo should become independent and accept the responsibilities of independent statehood.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="51101-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 I certainly recognise that the status quo needs to be taken forward. That is why, notwithstanding the challenges that were identified in Ambassador Eide&#039;s report, it is now right to take the final status process forward. Independence for Kosovo remains one of the options, and it is the one that 90&nbsp;per cent. of Kosovan Albanians are keen to secure. However, it is not for the British Government to pre-judge the outcome of the final status talks.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="51101-02_spnew10"><b> Angus Robertson  (Moray)</b> 
 (SNP): Does the Minister agree that much good work has been done in Kosovo in recent years by the global conflict prevention pool, supported by the Foreign Office? That being the case, and with much work still to do in Kosovo, will he explain why the budget line for the Balkans has been slashed? While he is at it, will he also explain why the budget lines have been slashed for central and eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, India, Pakistan and Kashmir? The list goes on. Why is money being siphoned off from the global conflict prevention pool strategy to pay for the quagmire of Iraq?

 This issue has already been the subject of some debate in the House. Indeed, I participated in such a debate with the hon. Gentleman only last week.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="51101-02_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Europe  (Mr. Douglas Alexander): </b> 
 We have been at the forefront of efforts to establish what happened in Andijan on 13&nbsp;May. Our ambassador and his embassy team have visited the area, spoken to eyewitnesses and met NGOs. Our ambassador has spoken repeatedly to the Uzbek Government. We remain as convinced as ever of the need for a credible, external inquiry. That is why, under our presidency, the European Union has adopted a series of new measures against the Uzbek Government, including an arms embargo and a targeted visa ban.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="51101-02_spnew12"><b> Mr. Hands: </b> 
 I appreciate what the Minister says about&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the arms embargo, but is it not incongruous that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his Government should support Uzbekistan&#039;s continued membership of the NATO partnership for peace programme?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o30"><a name="51101-02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 The NATO partnership for peace process relies not just on the will of one country, the United Kingdom, but on a number of other members of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NATO. I respect the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, but I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think that we have taken what opportunities are available to us to register our profound concern at the failure to establish an independent inquiry and to take the practical measures that have been outlined through the European Union.

<p><a name="st_o31"><a name="51101-02_spnew14"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): It would appear from the various e-mails that the Uzbek embassy kindly sends me that it has already made up its mind about the relative guilt of those who were shot. Is it not about time that the international community took the Uzbek regime much more seriously and tried to do something about it, rather than showing it far too much leniency as it has done in the past?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="51101-02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 I assure my hon. Friend that we take extremely seriously both the monitoring of the trial and, more generally, the need for an independent inquiry into the events in Andijan. We have led the international efforts to co-ordinate monitoring of the trial on behalf of the European Union, and we expect verdicts on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15&nbsp;defendants in only a few days. I assure my hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend that the matter will continue to be of concern to the British Government.

<a name="stpa_o1">As for the specific efforts made by the British Government, I have already mentioned the imposition of an arms embargo under the British leadership and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presidency, and the visa restrictions imposed on those deemed to have been responsible for the disproportionate use of force in Andijan. All technical meetings have been suspended under the European Union&#039;s partnership and co-operation agreement. We will of course support the reorientation of the Commission&#039;s funding programme for Uzbekistan to promote an increased focus on poverty reduction along with democracy, human rights and civil societies.

 Burma continues to be of great concern to the EU. The UK led the way in strengthening the common position last year, and Burma was addressed by the Council of Ministers in June and July this year.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o36"><a name="51101-03_spnew0"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 Burma is a brutal regime that persecutes, imprisons and murders its opponents, tyrannises its people by trampling all over their human&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rights, and peddles heroin and amphetamines worldwide. Are we working with EU colleagues such as France, Denmark and Greece to force Burma on to the agenda of the UN Security Council so that it can intervene, as it has intervened in equally appalling regimes such as those of Afghanistan and Cambodia? Is that not what an ethical foreign policy is all about?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o37"><a name="51101-03_spnew1"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the massive human rights abuses in Burma. We regularly discuss Burma with our EU partners, and we are also having discussions within the United Nations.

<p><a name="st_o39"><a name="51101-03_spnew3"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman knows, given that we have discussed Burma on a number of occasions, it is the UK&#039;s long-standing policy not to encourage trade or investment in Burma. We favour multilateral targeted measures against the Burma regime because we believe that they have greater practical impact and send a stronger political signal. Certainly, we regularly raise our concerns about Burma with our Association of South East Asian Nations partners, who perhaps have greater influence than do we in the west. We should not overestimate the effectiveness of western sanctions on the Burmese regime; they have not had any significant impact that we can see to date. We continue to keep our policy under review, but we need to ensure that it consists not just of sanctions.

 Clearly, the European Union and the British Government, which holds the EU presidency, are concerned that charges have been brought against Mr. Pamuk, the individual whom I believe my hon.

But is it also important that this House take note of, and is respectful of, the views of that author, who said that he did not want the charges brought against him to stand in the way of Turkey&#039;s progress toward the European Union. While not in any way diminishing the difficulties that he continues to face, all of us who have a genuine concern for human rights in Turkey see continuing progress toward a European future for Turkey as the best way to secure human rights not just for him, but for other members of the Turkish population.

I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope that they get the message: if they do not, the Security Council will take account of operational paragraph 13, which states that a further report would be compiled and that, if necessary, a further meeting would be held to consider further action.

Inflation has reached 360&nbsp;per cent. in the past year and is still rising, but the Government of Zimbabwe have just seen fit to reject offers of United Nations assistance. I discussed that yesterday with Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and I strongly endorse the statement that he issued yesterday which expressed profound concern about the situation in Zimbabwe.

That being so, I am afraid that we do have to follow common courtesies in respect of our relations. The other option would be to break off those diplomatic relations.

If Israel understands the animosity that exists world wide towards the segregation of that city and the way in which it is happening, and if it weighs the balance between measures it can take to defend itself and the detrimental effects that that segregation has, then I am sure that the Israeli Government will come down on the side of saying, &quot;Look. We don&#039;t want to put up more barriers to a peaceful, viable neighbour in the shape of Palestine. We want to try and help to facilitate that as a viable country that can thrive.&quot;

 The Government are working with our European partners and now, increasingly, with the United States and the Russian Federation to ensure that the Iranian Government become fully compliant with their obligations under the non-proliferation treaty. There are significant questions about the purpose and capability of Iran&#039;s nuclear programme. As yet, there is no conclusive proof that it is to be used as a nuclear weapons programme, just significant questions, and we need to be careful about what is made public and about the basis on which we make those judgments.

I commend the approach taken by the Government of China. In all the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discussions that I have had with them they have sometimes taken a different view, but at every stage they have acted responsibly, and no permanent member of the Security Council wishes to see a nuclear-armed Iran.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision regarding the sale of green belt land, and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">A few weeks after being elected to this place, I was invited to visit one of the farms in my constituency. Contrary to perception&#151;representing a Leeds seat&#151;there is a substantial amount of farmland in the middle of my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">During my visit to Wrinkle Wood farm, I learned much of the situation in which farmers find themselves. I was told by the farmer, Mrs. Jennie Clayton, that she had been approached by a company called English Land Partnership, which had bought the plot opposite, at Cookeridge Pastures, and was selling the land on the basis of future development of the site.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">I was confused because I was under the impression that the area was designated as protected green belt land. Mrs. Clayton showed me a letter and the video&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that she had been given. I saw the grand plans for housing that the company had produced. Indeed, it was selling plots in this fictional development. I learned that this was the practice of land banking. I had never heard of it, and when I speak to others their reaction is the same.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">According to investor.words.com, land banking is the practice of acquiring land and holding it for future use. In reality, land banking is the practice of purchasing green belt land for a reasonable and often low price, and selling it off in plots for a substantial mark-up to private investors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">Ironically, I am presenting the Bill in the year that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;green belt is celebrating its 50th anniversary. It is the 50th anniversary of the first Government circular telling councils to designate areas of green belt land.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Land banking companies generally purchase green belt land for a very reasonable price but are all too reluctant to reveal exactly how much they have paid for it. Research shows that the land, if purchased at the average rate in a particular area, can be sold off for an extraordinary profit margin. Land bankers can often sell land for up to 100&nbsp;times the price that they paid for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it. In my constituency, our research shows that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;average selling price for a 2,500&nbsp;sq ft plot of land in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Yorkshire and Humber area is &#163;115. However, similar sized plots in my constituency are being sold by English Land Partnership for &#163;18,750.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">The problem is that investors have virtually nothing to gain and everything to lose with such purchases until the land is given change of use. Then, when they have tens of thousands of pounds tied up, they realise that there are no plans for homes. Their only chance to get their money back is to get permission for development. That can put unacceptable and potentially unethical pressure on local authorities to review green belt areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">The success of land banking from the companies&#039; point of view is that their development plans may become self-fulfilling prophecies. Of course, having made a fortune from their sales, they need to push the process through to its logical conclusion. That becomes a benefit and not a necessity. There is a huge question 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 729</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>mark over the character of the so-called land banking companies. All too often it is merely a get-rich scam that is being peddled by fly-by-night companies, set up to carry out the scurrilous process of land banking. There have been instances of companies being investigated for fraud and partners being banned from being directors or managers of companies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">The real concern is the selling practices of land banking companies. There have been cases where investors were told that planning permission would be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;granted within a year. In other cases, investors were assured that they would see a return on their investments within a year. The companies involved simply say that they are liable only for statements made in writing by one of their directors, thus turning a blind eye to sales people, who are often self-employed and who are making misleading claims about the likelihood of change of use.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">There are disgruntled investors not only in this country. The Australian Government are taking action against the land banker, Stephen Cleeve of the European Land Sales Partnership under the Australian Fair Trading Act. The situation in this country, however, is more complex. When approached by a solicitor acting on behalf of disgruntled investors, the Department of Trade and Industry replied that it cannot, or will not, take action against land banking companies because they are partnerships, not companies. The DTI only has the jurisdiction to investigate companies, not partnerships. Officers from the Serious Fraud Office visited farms in my constituency, but the SFO is not interested in investigating such companies, despite the mounting evidence against them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">That is why we must seek to amend the law. The central purpose of my Bill is to protect the green belt, which covers 13&nbsp;per cent. of England. Wales has only recently introduced its own green belt policy, while Scotland has a broader concept of green belt. The Barker report, which said that 140,000&nbsp;extra homes needed to be built every year, has given rise to further fears that new development could eat into the green belt. The Bill would strengthen green belt legislation, as it would seek to enshrine green belt status in statute, and it would enable local authorities to designate green belt land with enhanced protected and legal status. It seeks 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 730</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to devolve decision making about green belt status to local authorities, removing the Secretary of State&#039;s power to overrule a local decision to refuse planning permission or designation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-06_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">The Bill would effectively outlaw the scurrilous practice of land banking, and would require that designated green belt land can be sold and marketed only as protected land, not under the guise of any future&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development. It has the support of members of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all parties and of people from all four corners of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country. I am delighted to have the backing of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, whose head of policy, Henry Oliver, said:


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;These companies are playing a reckless, cynical game with one of our most important environmental assets.

<a name="stpa_12">I am pleased that the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davies) has agreed to be a signatory to the Bill, as his constituency borders my own. The issue was raised last year by the former Labour Member for Milton Keynes, North-East, Brian White, who reported that a company called ELS stood to make &#163;3&nbsp;million from the sale of plots in Brickhill in his constituency.

<a name="stpa_13">When I left Wrinkle Wood farm after learning about the practice of land banking I pledged to do what I could to raise the issue.

Having&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concluded negotiations with both countries in December last year, European Union member states agreed that they should join the EU. They are scheduled to do so in January 2007, but if they are &quot;manifestly unprepared for membership&quot;, EU member states can decide to delay entry by a year. The Commission is responsible for monitoring both countries&#039; preparations and has just produced thorough reports on them.

Bulgarian growth has consistently been double the EU average over the last&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;five years, and successive Governments have successfully halved unemployment over that period. Romania has brought inflation down from more than 100&nbsp;per cent. in the late 1990s to around 8&nbsp;per cent. today, and has successfully attracted more foreign direct investment than any other state in south-east Europe.

There are some important general issues that both countries need&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to address. Corruption remains a serious problem in both countries, undermining public and business confidence, and they need to take urgent and vigorous action to tackle it. Part of the problem lies in their justice systems, which need further reform. Bulgaria must also tackle head-on the problem of organised crime. The daylight assassination last week of a high-ranking financier in Sofia demonstrated starkly the scale of the challenge.

 The Minister mentioned the assassinations in Bulgaria, but went through that point rather quickly although it is very important.

 I assure the hon. Gentleman that there are procedures whereby the European Commission is able to ensure the rigorous standards that all of us, as members of the Councils of Europe, are able to uphold in terms of potential accession to the European Union. I am not aware of the specific allegation to which the hon. Gentleman has referred, and if he wants to write to me, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will, of course, consider it, before passing it on to the appropriate authorities. The brevity of my reference to the recent assassination does not mean anything other than that we are dealing with it seriously. I have sought to reflect the due seriousness with which we regard the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;challenge of organised crime, which, as last week&#039;s reports drew out, is a significant issue for Romania and particularly Bulgaria.
</p>








<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51101-08_spnew2"><b> Mr. Wayne David  (Caerphilly) (Lab):</b>

<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51101-08_spnew3"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 I am certainly willing to welcome that. A broader question is how to address the practical challenges concerning high-level trials of those who are charged with corruption and legal changes, and I am convinced that the answer is to take forward the rigorous process that the European Commission set out last week in its report.
</p>








<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51101-08_spnew4"><b> Rev. Ian Paisley  (North Antrim) (DUP):</b> 
 The Minister knows that the Commission does not have a good record on scrutiny and cannot stop fraud in its own offices. How can it act as a superior to those new members?
</p>








<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51101-08_spnew5"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has raised the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important and historic concerns about fraud in the European Union that have been ventilated in this House on a number of occasions. Commissioner Olli Rehn from Finland, who is responsible for enlargement, certainly holds the respect of those Labour Members who want to see a European Commission that is genuinely rigorous in the pursuit of potential accession countries. If hon. Members were, like me, privy to the discussions on the accession of Turkey to the European Union, they would be in no doubt about the seriousness with which the European Council now regards the objective criteria against which candidate countries are judged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_27">Given Olli Rehn&#039;s personal statements and the terms of last week&#039;s European Commission report, it is clear that he personally and the Commission generally take seriously the rigour required by not only the European Council, but the citizens of Europe on countries seeking to join the European Union. In the coming months, the Commission will continue its rigorous monitoring of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;progress that both countries are making, targeting the areas of serious concern identified in those reports. If there is still a serious risk that either or both will be manifestly unprepared for membership in January 2007, the Commission can recommend delay by a year. And the Commission can also, if necessary, impose targeted safeguard measures to tackle problems in specific areas. We will need to consider the next Commission reports 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

 Is the Minister concerned, as I am, about child trafficking over the border into Romania and Bulgaria and then into western Europe? Is he aware that such child trafficking often involves child adoption and that millions of pounds pass through the hands of the gangs involved? The issue is not specifically mentioned in the report, and I wonder whether we should be concerned about it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51101-08_spnew7"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 We are concerned about both those issues. On child trafficking and people trafficking more&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generally, it has been suggested that one or both&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Romania and Bulgaria are both sources and transit countries for that outrageous and disgusting trade. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assure the hon.

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51101-08_spnew8"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 The matter is best addressed by more effective and deeper co-operation between member states of the European Union. Those of us who share the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ambition to stop that outrageous and unjust trade in humans must work together effectively, and the European Union provides an architecture that allows us to give practical expression to that shared commitment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_28">We are confident that both countries can be ready to join the EU on schedule in January 2007. However, they cannot afford to be complacent, not least in the face of the challenges that have been described. They need to take robust action now to address the concerns that the Commission identified in the reports. Of course, we will continue to provide bilateral and other assistance targeted at the matters that matter most. For example, we already have three advisers working in Romania on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tackling corruption. The accession coincides with ongoing discussions on the next financial perspective for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the EU from 2007&#150;13&#151;that was discussed in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chamber only this afternoon&#151;and the cost of the enlargement remains largely a matter for negotiation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_29">That said, most EU expenditure on Bulgaria and Romania has been provisionally agreed for 2007&#150;10, assuming that accession takes place on 1&nbsp;January 2007. That will total approximately &#8364;15&nbsp;billion over the next three years. Of that, roughly &#8364;5.5&nbsp;billion will be devoted to agriculture-related spending and approximately &#8364;8&nbsp;billion to structural funds. I stress that those are indicative figures. Of course, that is a significant amount of money by any standard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_30">However, as hon. Members will know, most of the costs of accession are borne by the new member states and the objective is to ensure that, over time, net recipients start to contribute to the EU budget. Spain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Ireland are good examples of that. Of the newcomers, Slovenia and Cyprus&#039;s purchasing power in terms of GDP per capita overtook that of Portugal this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_31">Let me consider clause 2. Under the terms of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accession treaty, the UK has the ability to decide the level of access it offers Bulgarian and Romanian 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 736</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>workers up to a maximum of seven years after accession. Clause 2&nbsp;gives the Government wide flexibility in deciding that. With accession more than a year&#151;possibly two years&#151;away, it is simply too early to decide what the level of access should be. We may want&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to continue the current work permit scheme. Conversely, we may decide to offer more lightly regulated access, along similar lines to that given to workers of the eight central and eastern European countries that joined in the 2004&nbsp;enlargement.

That never happened. Those people make a huge contribution to our economy. I say to my right hon. Friend, please do not leave it too late&#151;we left it very late last time.

 As my hon. Friend suggests, we showed considerable bravery at the time of the previous accession. I believe that subsequent events have justified that. I listened with interest to my colleague the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality when he discussed the matter on the &quot;Today&quot; programme this week. He made it clear that, on the basis of the recent figures that were published in June, the individuals in question have not been a profound burden on the UK welfare state or the taxpayer. Many have made a significant and valuable contribution to the dynamism of the British economy and the strength of the labour market.

<a name="stpa_32">The workers who come here are mostly young and do not all work in London&#151;only 20&nbsp;per cent. are based there&#151;but choose to work throughout the UK. They make a valuable contribution to our economy and our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;society. They are employed in a broad range of industries from health care to business administration to farming&#151;industries where there would otherwise be serious gaps in our labour market. They contribute to the UK&#039;s economic growth and our tax revenues without being a burden on the state. Of course, the position can change. That is why we intend to make a decision on the amount of access we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grant Bulgarian and Romanian workers on the basis of the requirements of the labour market closer to the date of accession and after consideration of other member states&#039; decisions. The Home Office, the Cabinet Office, the Department for Work and Pensions and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will all be involved in the process.

We want to consider all the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relevant factors at the right stage. That is why the prudent approach that we have taken in the Bill&#151;with its enabling clauses that will allow us to reach the right decision on the basis of the information available at the time&#151;is the correct one.

<a name="stpa_34">Of course, this process is evolving. Indeed, the option of delaying accession by up to a year is a good example of one such refinement.

This consensus has enabled the UK to play a leading role, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am proud to say, in driving forward a policy that is fundamentally in our interests, in the interests of our European Union partners and in the interests of the two accession states.

It is to those countries&#039; enormous credit that they have come so far so fast since they became free in 1990. They have had to relearn not only democracy and the market economy but the more fundamental principles that underpin a liberal society: the rule of law, tolerance and respect for freedom.

Much of the so-called acquis communautaire that these countries have to adopt is totally unnecessary and, indeed, damaging.

<a name="stpa_47">Whoever decides those questions must look both backwards and forwards. Some might say that, in certain cases, the accession criteria were assessed broadly for the great enlargement last year because the political imperative was, after so long, to make that enlargement happen. But given the immense challenges that lie ahead in respect of an enlargement involving Turkey, Croatia and the rest of the western Balkans, and perhaps Ukraine, we must not give those countries the impression that standards can be fudged. Turkey would be rightly aggrieved if we judged its success in meeting EU standards by a stricter measure than that which we used for other countries. We must make it clear that that will not happen.

 I shall deal with that point. One thing that we should learn from the previous expansion is that the Government&#039;s figures and predictions were entirely wrong, not least because the UK responded differently from our EU partners.

How have they revised their methods in the light of how wide of the mark the previous predictions were? The accession treaty provides for the suspension of the free movement of workers in whole or in part if member states undergo or foresee serious disturbances of their labour markets. Given what has happened since May 2004, we can anticipate that many Romanian and Bulgarian citizens will want to come to Britain. There are strong economic reasons why many may want to do so. According to the Commission&#039;s most recent figures, both Romania and Bulgaria, despite their high rates of growth, still enjoy an average gross domestic product per head of only a little over 30&nbsp;per cent. of that of the EU 25.

It is not only the politicians and the bureaucrats of the countries, but the people who need to be inspired to meet the acquis. The challenge now is even more difficult than it was five, six or seven years ago, because at that time it was conclusive that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;joining the EU was the right thing to do. In 1995,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1996&nbsp;and 1997, the EU was a forward-looking organisation that played an important role in the world, with strong economies&#151;especially in Britain after 1997&#151;and a sense of social responsibility and common purpose.

They supposedly lived under communism, although I think that they lived in a state that was nearer fascism&#151;it is a matter of political definition. They had no freedoms, there was little collective social responsibility and the state was isolated. That was not just political theory; it felt very real when walking the streets of Bucharest. I was there on a wet November day&#151;it bore some resemblance to parts of Newcastle or Glasgow on a bad day&#151;and noticed all the Soviet-style buildings that had been imposed on Romania, which is Francophile, if anything. Public services were poor and there were many beggars and other obvious signs of poverty on the streets. There was also a clear sense of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corruption and a fear of being caught out, because if that happened, those exercising the corruption could impose their will on the individual concerned.

<p><a name="st_71"><a name="51101-12_spnew2"><b> Mr. Nick Clegg  (Sheffield, Hallam) (LD):</b> 
 The Bill underlines an intriguing paradox. It is the latest step in a remarkable process of enlargement that the European Union has successfully prosecuted almost in spite of itself. Economic gloom has been prevalent in the European Union and there have been disagreements about foreign policy issues, such as Iraq. The ill-fated constitution has collapsed and there is malaise among EU institutions. Despite that, the European Union has somehow remarkably managed to expand in a few short years from roughly 350&nbsp;million citizens to about 475&nbsp;million citizens, and with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria the figure will soon be just over 500&nbsp;million. By anyone&#039;s reckoning, that is an extraordinary triumph of hope over pessimism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_75">Enlargement has always been driven by the geostrategic good sense of consolidating liberal democracy throughout Europe&#151;I say that in a non-partisan, if somewhat wistful, fashion&#151;and the moral duty to reunite a divided continent. It is thus ironic that such good sense and moral purpose seem to have prevailed at exactly the time when the European Union has been fractious and introverted, as has certainly been the case in recent years. While getting Bulgaria and Romania up to the starting line and launching the process of enlargement has been a remarkably positive process, one big question looms: how do we make enlargement and an enlarged European Union socially, politically and economically sustainable? Many difficult questions are therefore posed of existing members of the European Union, as well as the new applicants and members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_76">I have two general observations and one specific observation. First, enlargement and an enlarged European Union, as some hon. Members suggested, will not be possible unless the public and political case is made to electorates throughout the EU in more forceful terms than has been the case hitherto. We have seen the profound sense of unease and anxiety among electorates in other parts of the EU when voting on the European constitution, in which unrelated and, in my view, unfounded fears and anxieties about the process of enlargement were brought to bear on the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_77">We like to think that public opinion in this country is solid and uniformly enlightened. However, as the prospect of, for instance, Turkish membership hoves into ever closer horizons, I suspect that public opinion will equally prove to be more volatile than has been the case until now. Advocates of a more diverse and wider EU have a great incentive to unite to make the case not only for Romania and Bulgaria&#039;s accession, but for potential members elsewhere, lest we allow fear and anxiety to overshadow the benefits of enlargement more generally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_78">My second observation is that Romania, Bulgaria, the 10&nbsp;countries that joined in May 2004, Turkey, if it were to join, and any other potential applicant will not find that the EU provides the benefits for which they hoped if there is not a greater consensus about what the EU should and should not do. It is unrealistic to imagine that a highly integrated political and economic club of such a size and diversity as the EU&#151;now 25&nbsp;members, soon to be 27, and no doubt more after that&#151;can act effectively if it is afflicted by constant internal political bickering. That will take time to overcome.

<a name="stpa_79">The EU is in a moment of transition from one form of integration to another. No one on any side of the debate quite knows what that pattern of integration will be in years to come. We may require a new generation of political leaders. Change has already occurred, if in somewhat half-hearted fashion, in Germany. It is likely to take place in Italy, France and this country, too. Whoever is in charge in the future needs to re-create a consensus that has been lost. Without that consensus about the fundamental purpose of the EU, the glue that is necessary for such a diverse club to hang together will disappear. The risk of long-term disunity&#151;I suggest mischievously that that might be why some advocates of enlargement have always been so supportive of it&#151;in an organisation with such a large membership is real and needs to be addressed.

Is not the serious division at the heart of Europe about economics, as the elite try to thrust on it a neo-liberal version of the economy that people do not want?

</p>








<p><a name="st_73"><a name="51101-12_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clegg: </b> 
 I do not recognise that characterisation of the debates, which undoubtedly exist, about economic policy. If one compares any of the EU social and economic models with what exists in north America, one would have to agree that there is a degree of unity in the mix of economic and social policies that is, perhaps, a little more progressive than the hon. Gentleman&#039;s pessimistic analysis suggests.

That is why I urge the Minister to take very seriously the warnings and the potential use of safeguard measures set out in the Commission&#039;s report.

Not much time is left to change quite a lot in both countries.

<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51101-13_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clegg: </b> 
 Indeed. That is merely one on a long list of outstanding issues that need to be dealt with in Romania and Bulgaria. It reinforces the point that if one wants to encourage those countries to make those political reforms, and to apply pressure, one needs to exercise leverage at the best time, which is now. The effect of that leverage will be blunted if accession is guaranteed&#151;it may be a guarantee that is deferred by 12&nbsp;months, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a guarantee nevertheless.

 I imagine that it would be difficult to apply a perfect measure of consistency. In the last process, 10&nbsp;countries were allowed to accede in one bloc, and there is inevitably greater scrutiny when only two countries are under the microscope.

 I am pleased to take part in the debate. I have had a long-standing interest in Bulgaria and its people over many years. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first travelled to the country in 1985&nbsp;as a member of an Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation. It was the first democratic centralist country that I had visited. I was not enamoured of its politics, but I was enamoured of its people&#151;that was my experience and that of my colleagues&#151;and I have kept in close contact with Bulgaria ever since. On my return I was asked to be an officer of the all-party Bulgaria group. I accepted that invitation and for the past decade I have been the chairman of the group.

<a name="stpa_88">I hope that the House will forgive me for talking about Bulgaria in terms of my views on what has happened there. I have visited Romania, but I have more knowledge of Bulgaria. While the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) is in his place, I should say that I had not intended mentioning workers from those countries coming to the UK. The hon. Gentleman will remember, however, that last year there was a big row about work permits being issued to people from Romania and Bulgaria. I remember that the Opposition sailed the Sheffield whistleblower into a television studio to say how awful the system was. My right hon. and hon. Friends on the Government Front Bench then initiated an investigation into the issuing of work permits to people from Romania and Bulgaria. As a result, a hold was put on applications.

<a name="stpa_89">Within about two weeks of that decision being taken I received a phone call from an agency&#151;I suppose that that person would be called a gangmaster&#151;in Essex. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also received a call from Sofia. I convened a meeting because there was a crisis in Essex at the time. The gangmaster from Essex attended the meeting, as did a gangmaster who had flown over from Bulgaria. There were three Conservative Members present, who had come along because of the mess in Essex agriculture. It was fruit picking time and all the permits under the temporary agricultural workers scheme had been stopped.

<a name="51101-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_90">There had long been links with Sofia university, and for many years, under different Governments, students studying English at that university came to Essex to work as fruit pickers. They would earn some money and learn English in, as it were, the mother country. There were terrible problems at the time. I brokered a deal that involved the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne), who is now a Minister. I phoned them to explain that if we relaxed the stop on the temporary agricultural workers scheme so that the students could come to this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country and the fruit could be picked, everything would be all right&#151;and it would also ensure that there would not be another row in a television studio. As far as I am aware, the solution worked very well.

The Union of Democratic Forces came on to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scene in the early 1990s. The only part of its&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ideology that I could grasp was the fact that it was anti-communist&#151;I did not know where it stood either economically or on anything else. However, it was testing the changes that were taking place. In 1985, Tzum, the big supermarket in Sofia, had plenty of things on its shelves, but in the 1990s there were only broken biscuits. Because of the country&#039;s closeness to Russia, its economy was shattered by the changes in eastern Europe and it took a long time for it to recover.

In 2000, I was invited by General Secretary Sergei Stanishev, who has since been appointed Prime Minister, to his party&#039;s congress. I went to Bulgaria on a family holiday and stopped at Sofia for the 45th congress of the BSP&#151;quite an achievement, because the party had existed for only eight years.

He was also right to commend those countries for going through the acquis communautaire to such an extent. Of course, all 35&nbsp;chapters have to be agreed to and fulfilled; the acquis must be completed in full.

<a name="stpa_113">All the arguments have been eloquently expressed by the hon.

Those countries have been our partners for many years. I do not know as much about Bulgaria as my right hon.

When I was Minister for Europe, I visited it for only eight hours. Similarly, I visited Romania for only seven hours. When one is a Minister in those circumstances, one never quite gets a feel for the country. However, as those countries approach their accession, I imagine that there is a great deal of hope about their entry into the EU.

My hon. Friend offered me some good news: there is no backlog in dealing with the scheme&#151;most of the applications are processed in a few days and 90&nbsp;per cent. are processed in four weeks. That is a great credit to the Home Office, with which I and others hon. Members, including the Minister, who have heavy immigration case loads, often find cause for concern.

So, according to the figures that I have received&#151;I am sure that the Minister will correct me if they are wrong&#151;only a handful of those 232,000 people have gone on benefits.

 Mr. Deputy Speaker, I was definitely not going to dilate on this point. However, I should like to answer the hon. Gentleman. He has a huge role to play in his party because of his background. First, he needs to tell to the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West how to pronounce his name, because the hon. Gentleman said that he did not know how to do so. Secondly, the hon.

<p>
<a name="51101-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_119">On clause 2, I know that the Minister needs to consult the Home Office, and that the Home Office will have to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consult the Department for Work and Pensions, but I believe that we need to be much clearer on the issue. I know that my right hon. Friend cannot make a decision on it today, or give us an answer on it when he winds up the debate. This involves a long process, but it is important that we have clarity on the matter. He says that we must wait until nearer the time of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria for a decision to be made, and I understand why he does so. All that I ask is that we do not wait until a few weeks before accession, by which time the Opposition will have built up the kind of hysteria that we have just heard in the speech of the hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Altrincham and Sale, West. He spoke of the relatively low wages of policemen, and the hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) reminded us of the low wages of other people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_120">That will build up over the next two years. We must lance the boil at an early stage.

<br>&nbsp;<br>and Bulgaria&#151;principally the Roma who are already in this country and seeking asylum&#151;for the matter to be clarified to some extent. Let us not leave it until everyone becomes hysterical again; let us have a decision as near as possible to the final decision. Otherwise we shall be left where we were on 1&nbsp;May 2004, rushing legislation through the House and causing upsets among our European partners just before they come into the European Union. Clarity would be very helpful.

<p>
<a name="51101-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_121">My final point is the one made by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam. We must engage with the British people on the European issue. I know that the Minister has travelled a great deal over the last six months, and he performs his job superbly as the champion of enlargement. I raised this point in passing with the Foreign Secretary during Question Time today. It is all very well going to Alabama and bonding with Condoleezza Rice, but we have the presidency at least for the next eight weeks. We are pushing forward legislation before most of our EU partners. Let us engage with the British people. I know that it will be difficult to do it before the end of the year, but let us go out and campaign on Europe. Let us be proud of being good Europeans, and let us continue to show the leadership that we have shown over the past eight years in Europe so that we can fashion the future according to our vision of what we want to happen.

<p>
<a name="51101-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_122">I think that we should see enlargement as a significant success not just for the European Union, but for United Kingdom foreign policy over a number of years. When Britain, under Harold Macmillan, first applied to join the then common market, Charles de Gaulle&#151;who vetoed our application way back in 1963&#151;explained that British accession would mean


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;another common market . . . one that would be taken to 11&nbsp;and then 13&nbsp;and then perhaps 18 . . . It is not at all what France is doing or wants to do.&quot;</p>

<a name="51101-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_123">One of his Ministers, Jean-Marcel Jeanneney, added that if the grouping expanded beyond its original six members it would become a more free market, closer to the United States and increasingly Anglophone. In all those respects, he has been proved right. The European Union has spent much of the past 20&nbsp;years liberalising markets and admitting countries&#151;Nordic or eastern European&#151;where English is established as the second language. I think we should see enlargement not only as something inherently democratic that has widened the European Union, but as something that has benefited the United Kingdom as a whole and enhanced our collective vision of Europe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_124">We should also recognise, however, that enlargement of itself is not enough. I have been in the House long enough to see a number of accession Bills, including the one that enabled Spain and Portugal to enter the European Union. There is a danger that we shall leave the debate having accepted this Bill&#039;s Second Reading without a vote, feeling a warm glow about the forthcoming entry of yet another two countries to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European Union. We must recognise that a phenomenal amount of work has to be done within the EU, and with that in mind I shall make two brief points, the first of which concerns competitiveness.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-15_para8">
<a name="stpa_125">There is no point in bringing countries such as Bulgaria and Romania into the EU if we are to fall behind other parts of the world. It is very good that the Prime Minister and other Heads of Government paid attention to this issue last week at Hampton Court. However, we have to look to markets such as China, and to recognise that certain EU labour markets are in severe danger of becoming sclerotic. We must recognise that no one in the world owes Europe a living; we have to compete with the rest of the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-15_para9">
<a name="stpa_126">Secondly, unless we can learn how to reform the EU,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we will never make any progress. Perhaps the most important thing that will happen between now and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christmas break is the World Trade Organisation negotiations in Hong Kong. Last week, the French finance Minister&#151;not the French agriculture Minister&#151;made it clear that the common agricultural policy as it stands is a foundation stone of Europe that cannot be changed in any way. He used dramatic language, saying that if the CAP were reformed in any way, we would have future pandemics. I recommend that Members read the report of his comments in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 27&nbsp;October.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-15_para10">
<a name="stpa_127">We are not seeing any significant movement from the EU on the WTO negotiations on the CAP. It would be a real tragedy if the Doha development round collapsed because Europe was incapable of recognising that it can no longer sustain the CAP in its current form&#151;that it is no longer right in a world in which so many face starvation. Enlargement is of course extremely good news. For those of us who grew up in the shadow of the cold war and who were teenagers in the late 60s, when we experienced the frustration of the tanks rolling into Czechoslovakia, the later falling of the Berlin wall was probably one of the most fantastic days of our life. So it is wonderful that these countries are joining the EU, but let us not equate that alone with progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-15_para11">
<a name="stpa_128">An enormous amount of work has to be done in the EU to make it remain competitive, and to reform basic institutions such as the CAP. Every single cow in the EU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today attracts a subsidy of $2, yet many millions of people throughout the world are still scratching a living, and living on less than a dollar a day. So the livestock that one sees in a field on going down a country lane each receive twice as much in subsidy from the EU than many people in the world are living on, which is obscene. The House, the country and the Community must address these issues. If the French effectively stymie Peter Mandelson&#039;s efforts to achieve a successful WTO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doha development round, that will be a disgrace.

<p>
<a name="51101-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_130">I want to talk about clause 2, which deals with workers&#039; freedom of movement, and the regulation of workers from abroad. It is essential that all workers, foreign or otherwise, are regulated in their employment, and that they have the proper documentation and pay tax and national insurance. Foreign workers should be paid properly, at a rate comparable with domestic workers. They should not be used as a cheap labour force to undermine the wages and living standards of workers in the home country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_131">It is fine to use foreign workers to fill skills gaps and to make up employment levels when there is a shortage of labour. That happened here after the war, when a lot of people arrived to do the jobs for which we could not find workers. Many of the people who stayed here live in my constituency, and I believe that the experience has been a happy and valuable one for both us and them. Their presence has made ours a more diverse society, which is a good thing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_132">We should encourage foreign workers to join trade unions, and ensure that their conditions, protections and standards are the same as those enjoyed by their counterparts from this country. They must not be exploited, or used as a weapon to undermine wages in Britain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_133">Labour flexibility is not acceptable if it becomes merely a way to drive down wages. That could lead to difficulties in the EU. I have told the House before about my holiday in Portugal a few years ago, when I saw a building site with a sign in Portuguese that said &quot;No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexible Labour&quot;. If flexibility were to pose a threat to workers, it could lead to political changes that would go against the trend of the EU at the moment. Regulation must be used and properly enforced, for the protection of foreign workers and of our employment standards.
</p>

<a name="51101-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_134">I welcome the prospect of EU membership for Bulgaria and Romania. It will benefit those countries, and the EU as a whole. I strongly favour enlargement, as I think that it will change the nature of the EU, making it a much looser arrangement of democratic states. Indeed, that has happened already.

<p>
<a name="51101-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_135">That is my vision for the future of Europe. I do not want the EU to become a superstate, or an organisation driven by the Commission or the European Central Bank. I want there to be mutual co-operation across Europe between democratically elected Governments and their peoples.

<a name="51101-16_para7">

<br>&nbsp;<br>have made great contributions to European history and art. Before the second world war, Bucharest was regarded as the Paris of the east. Romania&#039;s language is derived from Latin, and its culture and tastes are like those of other European countries. Indeed, my favourite pianist is the Romanian Dinu Lipatti, and I own many&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDs of his wonderful playing.

<a name="51101-16_para9">
<a name="stpa_138">As I have said many times in this Chamber, Europe&#039;s problems have to do with economics, and primarily with agriculture. The economies of both Bulgaria and Romania depend heavily on agriculture. They are big producers of agricultural products, and it is possible that they stand to benefit from the CAP. Of course, it is not being extended to them immediately, or even to countries that are already in the EU. There is a serious problem with the CAP, which causes distortions in fiscal transfers across the EU. It is coming to the end of its life. It has to be challenged, because it continues to make rich countries net recipients of budget funds and poorer countries net contributors. That process could get worse unless we abolish it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-16_para10">
<a name="stpa_139">There is much talk of reform, and we have had many reforms of the CAP, but it has not essentially changed and still has a distorting effect. It is unfair to have a CAP benefiting rich western European nations and not being extended generously to poorer eastern European nations with large agricultural sectors. I look forward to a world in which there is no CAP and in which we have our own domestic agriculture policies and are free to buy relatively cheap food from Romania and Bulgaria, among others. That would be a sensible way forward after the CAP has gone.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-16_para11">
<a name="stpa_140">The future of the budget must be based on equity. If it is equitable for every member of the EU, we will all support it. At the moment, it is not. The only way to make it equitable is for receipts and contributions to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;budget to be proportionate to our relative prosperity, so that rich nations are considerably greater net contributors and poorer nations perhaps net recipients, although it may just be that all of us make contributions but richer countries pay proportionately more. If the budget is related to our prosperity, everyone will think it fair and it will be objectively equitable. The CAP makes that impossible, and it should go.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-16_para12">
<a name="stpa_141">I would also argue strongly that nations&#151;Bulgaria and Romania, in particular&#151;should be able to choose their own macroeconomic policies. They should be able to choose how to run their economies to make sure that they grow. They should not have imposed on them from outside a particular model of economic management that might be to their disadvantage, and which, I think, would be. If they could retain their own currencies for the foreseeable future, they could choose an appropriate parity, which would be to their advantage. If they could choose their own interest rates to suit their domestic economies, that, too, would be sensible. If they could choose their own fiscal policies&#151;levels of taxation and public spending&#151;that would be a good way forward. If they were not told that they could not use state aid to develop their industries, that would be a good thing. If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the EU says that they cannot use state aid, that might cause them not to grow and could damage their economies, making it more difficult for them to attain

<a name="stpa_142">The Bulgarian lev is, apparently, pegged to the euro&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the moment. I suggest that pegging is fine, but becoming a single currency, which gives no possibility of flexing the value of one&#039;s currency, would be a terrible mistake for Bulgaria and Romania, especially in their present relatively weak economic situations. A pegged currency is very different from a single currency. The peg can change from time to time, and we in Britain ought to retain that position, too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-16_para14">
<a name="stpa_143">Some new member states have had unhappy economic experiences, which are causing political difficulties for them. The same could be seen in Bulgaria and Romania if we are not careful. I look at Hungary, which has undoubtedly prospered in the sense that living standards have risen overall, but in which there has been a great division of rich and poor with 40&nbsp;per cent. of the Hungarian people now living in relative poverty in spite of its having done relatively well. What one sees in some countries is apparently socialist Governments who have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been driven to take the neo-liberal approach of privatising and liberalising their economies, resulting in great and growing disparities of income and wealth.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-16_para15">
<a name="stpa_144">Meanwhile, conservative Opposition parties have said that they do not want more privatisation or liberalisation but want to protect their welfare states. That is what is happening in Hungary. The astonishing thing there is that a conservative Opposition are being supported by a Marxist workers&#039; party against the nominal socialist party in Government. <i>The New Statesman</i> last week speculated that if Mrs. Thatcher was in Hungary, she would vote for the socialist party,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never mind its name, because it is pursuing extreme neo-liberal economics. The leader of the socialist party has made considerable sums of money out of privatisation. In any case, those are not the sort of policies that should be imposed on Bulgaria and Romania. They should be allowed to manage their own economies to maximise economic growth so that they may attain living standards similar to ours.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-16_para16">
<a name="stpa_145">If we impose economic policies on those countries and their economies are damaged, with greater disparities between people&#039;s incomes, it could breed disillusion that would not be healthy for the future of the European Union. If we want to be happy together, we must ensure that living standards rise in those countries, that we converge further, and that the poor are not left out.

<p><a name="st_93"><a name="51101-17_spnew0"><b> Mr. Anthony Steen  (Totnes) (Con):</b> 
 I first wish to make it plain that I support the Second Reading of the Bill and enlargement of the European Union. However, I wish to make several observations. Romania and Bulgaria will join the EU automatically in 2008, but Romania is hell bent on enrolling a year early and it has moved heaven and earth already to get itself into a better position to meet the acquis&#151;all 29&nbsp;chapters of it. Although it has been free of communism for only 16&nbsp;years, its transformation from a highly bureaucratic, centrally controlled country to a liberated free market democratic state is truly remarkable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_146">The Romanians have pinned all their hopes on a 2007&nbsp;admission to the EU. They believe it to be important for their psyche, their whole approach to life 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 764</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and their people, but as last week&#039;s comprehensive monitoring report by the European Commission makes clear there is still some way to go before they comply with all the necessary standards. Whenever Romania does join, it will be one of the poorest countries in the EU, with state monopolies still controlling vast areas of activity, and a poor quality of life evident outside Bucharest, which serves as a reminder of the legacy of communism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_147">There is a further reason why accession in 2007&nbsp;is desirable, and that is because if Romania is deemed not ready then, there is a real danger that it might feel that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the west and the EU had shunned it. The country could then sink into instability caused by unchecked corruption and the growth of widespread criminal activity. The present Administration has marketed the EU as the saviour to Romania&#039;s problems. There is a danger that some may feel let down when the Elysian fields do not materialise. But Romania has rejected the east and elected to look west. We must not disappoint it.I visited Romania both as a member of the European Scrutiny Committee and more recently as a member of the all-party European Union enlargement group, which enabled us to meet not just the Prime Minister, but also the Leader of the Opposition and many cabinet ministers. I subsequently spent five days as a tourist, visiting historic cities and exploring lesser known agricultural areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_148">The Romanians believe that the EU Commission may be giving them tougher obstacles to overcome than it gave the 10&nbsp;countries that joined the EU in May 2004. They argue that all eastern European countries share similar problems and that a more intense spotlight is now being focused on Romania and Bulgaria because they are just two new entrants rather than 10. The need to comply with the 29&nbsp;acquis chapters before accession has provided the necessary impetus and vital motivation to embark upon an enormous programme of change. The Commission&#039;s concern and ours should be that once Romania and Bulgaria have been admitted into the EU, there is precious little that can be done to force the pace so that the reforming zeal is maintained. The House tends to forget that there are only 5,000&nbsp;more officials in the European Commission in Brussels than employees, full and part time, in Devon county council. There is, therefore, a limited number of EU officials to enforce the requirements once Romania and Bulgaria become full members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_149">Chapter 24&nbsp;deals with co-operation in the field of justice and home affairs. Schengen and the EU external borders are highlighted as an area of serious concern, as is the fight against fraud and corruption, which is well known and well documented. There are signs that the situation is improving quite dramatically, but no high level official or Government Minister has yet been prosecuted and, as the monitoring report highlights, increased efforts are needed to ensure compliance in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;areas of money laundering, judicial co-operation in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;civil and criminal matters, the fight against drugs, police co-operation and the fight against organised crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_150">Corruption is not perhaps surprising when many public officials earn less than &#163;1&nbsp;an hour, and it is not unknown for some to earn only 50p an hour. Bribes are very tempting, whether to people in the local police force or in local councils who control local permissions of one

<br>&nbsp;<br>sort or another. We were told that a few years ago a bribe test of the police resulted in 70&nbsp;per cent. failing. That has now fallen to some 40&nbsp;per cent. However, some argue that until Romania joins the EU and starts to prosper materially, corruption will continue, including in the police and other forces.

<a name="51101-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_151">The US Department of State&#039;s report on the trafficking in persons, released in June this year, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;Corruption among law enforcement authorities remained a serious problem&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_152">However, progress is being made, and in 2004, Romania&#039;s lead police anti-corruption agency investigated 81&nbsp;police officials implicated in trafficking-related corruption; imposed administrative sanctions on 31&nbsp;officials; dismissed 10&nbsp;officials; and sent 40&nbsp;cases forward for prosecution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_153">Before Romania is admitted, it is essential that it sorts out its external border controls. Romania will form the frontier between the EU and Russia. It is a massive border, and it is Romania&#039;s weak spot. Once Romania joins the EU, its easternmost border will form part of the border to the entire EU area and we must all recognise our interest and responsibility in securing it. The EU must give massive funding, as well as provide border patrols, if security is to be increased to an acceptable standard. Currently the border controls are lax and people can come over from the east, from countries such as Ukraine or Moldova, without difficulty. Romania is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very much a railway station&#151;a transit area, just as Albania is a transit centre for southern Europe. The 2005&nbsp;second annual report by the International Organisation for Migration on victims of trafficking in south-eastern Europe said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;Romania is a country of origin for trafficking in persons. It is also a transit country for trafficking from the former Soviet Union.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_154">In 2003, a United Nations report listed Romania as one of the top 10&nbsp;countries of origin for trafficking in the world. Internal trafficking is also a problem in Romania, with children from the poor north-eastern region of the country being sold by their families to work on farms in more prosperous regions. However, the vast majority of victims of trafficking for purposes of sexual exploitation were trafficked from Romania to EU countries. It is vital, therefore, that we develop a coherent, effective, EU-wide strategy for coping with and eliminating trafficking.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_155">The trafficking in persons report from the US Department of State stated:


</p>

<a name="51101-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_157">The Romanian Government have significantly increased trafficking convictions and sentences. In 2004, 103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;traffickers were convicted, up from only 49 in 2003. However, those prosecuted are not the main players but those lower down the hierarchy, and thus the criminal networks are yet to be broken. The Government also created a national network of 52 judges specialised in trafficking cases, one for each tribunal and court of appeal. More needs to be done with regards to the screening, identification and referral of trafficking 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>victims, as Romania has no centralised mechanism. In addition, it has no common methodology for the documentation of cases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_158">Child trafficking is something that should concern the whole House. What one gathers from those in the know is that there is a rise in child trafficking on the pretext of inter-country adoption and a rise in the trade of young women and young boys. The Romanian Government have made amazing efforts to crush the trade in children, but in doing so, they have seriously antagonised organised criminal associations, which have tended to move out of Romania into Moldova or Ukraine. Let&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remember that it is believed that, between 1991&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and 2001, 30,000&nbsp;children were so-called adopted and &#163;1.18&nbsp;billion changed hands.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_159">The problem is even more severe in Bulgaria, where the fastest growing sector of organised crime is that involving children, of which the report makes specific mention. The organised criminal gangs that arrange for children to be sold on the internet under the guise of adoption are highly disciplined and ruthless. We are talking about criminal networks and corruption on a very grand scale, which Governments are virtually powerless to control.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_160">The global purchasing of people is a worldwide scourge, which will be brought to the fore in Europe once Romania and Bulgaria have attained full membership of the EU. It is necessary to consider a comprehensive policy for both destination and source countries and to ensure that anti-trafficking legislation is effectively implemented, of which the fight against corruption is an essential part. In granting Romania and Bulgaria membership, the EU must simultaneously put in safeguards on the corruption front. Chinese walls can and should be put in place, and stay in place, until corruption is squeezed out, rather than giving those trafficking gangs free access throughout Europe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-17_para15">
<a name="stpa_161">Chapter 7&nbsp;deals with agriculture. One must not forget that a large percentage of the population of Romania is still engaged in agriculture. It will take many years before sufficient funds are available for modern technology to make the best use of land. The distribution of food is minimal and food is routinely sold by farmers from horse and carts at the roadside. The Commission points out that, although Romania generally meets its commitments on a number of issues, increased efforts are needed on a number of others, including animal welfare, trade in live animals and animal products, and there is serious concern about animal disease control and public health.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-17_para16">
<a name="stpa_162">I recently witnessed appalling animal cruelty in a horse market in Transylvania, where a horse was so cruelly handled and pulled so fiercely on his reins that his mouth was pouring with blood as he trotted down the road. We now have the bird flu scare, and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals seems concerned with the way that the Romanians are killing poultry deemed a possible risk by throwing them alive into incinerators.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-17_para17">
<a name="stpa_163">I mention those issues not to find reasons for keeping Romania out until 2008, but to encourage the Romanian Government to do everything in their power, by changing laws now and helping to change attitudes; nor is it necessary to bring Romania and Bulgaria into the EU at the same time. One could join in 2007, and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>another in 2008. If we in the more prosperous countries are to help those who are less advantaged and raise their standards of living, we need to ensure that human trafficking and animal cruelty become things of the past: an important step forward for millions of people formerly under the communist yoke.

 I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen). I am reminded that a favourite adage of mine is that pessimism of the intellect should not breed optimism of the will. I hope that the pessimism of his intellect will breed the optimism of our will to welcome Romania and Bulgaria into the EU under the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accession treaty. I am also pleased to follow my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins), who sees the EU as the problem, when I see it as the solution to the problems that have been outlined in the contributions so far.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_164">I welcome the accession treaty. I take the admonition not to give a travelogue, but I visited Romania with the hon. Member for Totnes and the European Scrutiny Committee, and I had a chance to speak first hand to people at all levels of Parliament, the Government and non-governmental organisations there. As always, when I go to those places, I pop into a caf&#233; or two and have a chat with some of the younger people and hear their aspirations. I found a similar message to the one that I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found when we visited the countries involved in the last enlargement. There are problems and there is much to be done, but they view the ability to accede to membership of the EU as a very bright light at the end of a tunnel that they have been travelling through since the time when they were trapped in the previous regime and saw their lifestyles and standards deteriorate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_165">In welcoming particularly clause 1&nbsp;on the accession treaty, I accept that there is much to be done, including the things outlined by the hon. Member for Totnes, although we might find that what he said about agriculture is paralleled by the abuses that we have found in this country, even under our very strict laws on the treatment of animals. Neither their treatment of animals, nor their treatment of children and other members of their community will be accepted. That is where the EU comes into its own.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_166">Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North, I see the EU and its attempt to create a level playing field for all as a great benefit. We should not allow people to hang their political hats on the EU hook; they must conform to the process of accession. In fact, by 2007, Romania must adopt 29&nbsp;provisions of the acquis&#151;what a great difference that will make&#151;and then the transition funds and eventually the structural funds that will become available will help Romania to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do the very things that he says should be done. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certainly think that they should be done.

 I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman feels that my speech was pessimistic. It was based on my own observations.

</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>European Scrutiny Committee are in a positive vein, unlike those of some of his colleagues who travelled with us and encouraged people in other countries not to join the EU. Their admonition fell on deaf ears everywhere that we went, but he has never been guilty of saying such things. We should accept that there are problems and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall mention some of them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_167">We should ask why Romania is joining in 2007, rather than 2008, which could have been an option. One of the problems is that Romania will have to run very hard to catch up with our demands on tackling institutionalised fraud, whether small-scale bribery or large-scale fraud. When we met the President of Romania, he admitted that fraud was a major problem that he was going to tackle. The hon. Member for Totnes omitted to mention the fact that there was a rather garish picture of a former Minister in manacles on the front page of the national newspaper, which said&#151;I believe that this was the translation&#151;that he was shouting, &quot;The President of Romania has put me here, and I will ensure that he ends up in the same prison.&quot; The current President is clearly taking on board the need to tackle large-scale corruption and fraud in the institutions that previously ran the country. If his record as mayor of Bucharest is anything to go by, he will challenge and beat down that high level of corruption.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_168">It would be unreal of us to think that this is just about the relationship between Romania and the EU. Senior members of its Parliament made candid comments about the reason why Romania would join in 2007. They said that they would offer the USA a base there. When I asked, &quot;Do you mean a NATO base?&quot; they said, &quot;No, a USA base in Romania.&quot; If that is part of the equation, I am concerned. If Romania is to become involved in international defence, that should happen through NATO and it should be done in a way that does not single out any country as a partner in defence matters, while it is applying to become our partner in economic matters. Although I welcome the accession clause, I hope that the Minister will clarify whether a base in Romania will be offered to an individual country outwith the EU, rather than NATO, which is our common alliance. It might be that the politicians were expressing only an aspiration, but if that became a reality, it would be viewed negatively. It would be seen that there was a false contract between the EU and Romania if the purpose of speeding up accession was to hasten the provision of any form of military base for the United States of America.

<p><a name="st_98"><a name="51101-18_spnew3"><b> Michael Connarty: </b> 
 The Minister can check that out if he wishes because it was said to me not privately in a whisper, but in a meeting in Romania that was attended by other members of the European Scrutiny Committee.

<a name="stpa_169">The freedom of movement for workers, which is addressed in clause 2, is a fundamental aspect of what we are doing. If I am reading the Bill correctly, we will allow people from accession countries such as Romania and Bulgaria to come to the United Kingdom to work if they have an offer of employment. It has already been said that some 230,000&nbsp;people have already come here to work and are thus contributing and paying taxation.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_171">I am worried that some people who have come here from the 10&nbsp;accession countries in the last enlargement have already been exploited, even though they might be happy to get our minimum wage when they compare that with what they could earn in their own countries. However, we must consider the scenario that occurred involving a group of workers from one of the original 15&nbsp;member countries. They were bused into a work place and kept in isolation from trade unions in this country. They were doing highly skilled work in a power station in Wales, but the unions could not discover their wages or conditions of service. They were working under the posting of workers directive, which will obviously apply to workers addressed by clause 2&nbsp;because, when they come here to work, they should be covered by EU directives.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_172">If the posting of workers directive means that we will not know whether such workers who come to this country enjoy proper conditions because they do not have access to trade unions in either their country of origin or here, something is wrong, given that there is a pledge&#151;I believe that it was made when Mrs. Thatcher signed the Single European Act&#151;that every citizen in Europe should be treated equally. Unless we introduce safeguards, people who come here might not enjoy the same quality, class or status of citizenship as people in the UK. Indeed, they could be seen by many as people who are available for exploitation. The trade unions must meet that challenge.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 770</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>believe that we should consider why France, Germany and other EU countries have decided to introduce derogations regarding people from Bulgaria, Romania and the other 10&nbsp;accession countries coming to work there, while we have an open-door policy? Should we not be a little more selective about the skills that we need in this country?
</p>








<p><a name="st_102"><a name="51101-19_spnew1"><b> Michael Connarty: </b> 
 No. As we have done for people from the accession countries, we will allow people from Romania and Bulgaria to come here to use their skills and contribute to our economy. However, we still face a problem. If a joiner or plumber, for example, comes here from one of the 10&nbsp;accession countries, it is not suitable to give him the minimum wage. Joiners, plumbers and electricians should get the proper wage for their skills. The trade unions must try to do more to enlighten workers who come to this country about the conditions of employment and wages that they should expect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_173">The freedom of movement for workers also presents a question for the Government. The Government should provide all people who come to this country to work from the 10&nbsp;accession countries, Romania and Bulgaria&#151;including the 230,000&nbsp;who are already here&#151;with correct information about what they should expect for the skills that they are bringing. Everyone would benefit from such an arrangement. The people involved would be paid proper wages. It would mean that unrest would not be caused because of other workers thinking that their trades or professions were being undercut. We would thus have a much happier movement of workers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_174">The hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) asked whether we should screen people and look only for those who can bring high levels of skills to our shores. It would be wrong to do that because, as has been said, one could question whether we would be denuding countries of their doctors and nurses, for example. People should see the attitude of this country and the EU as allowing free movement for workers so that they can go to countries, develop their skills and become better qualified, and then take better skills back to their country. Experience shows that there is a short period of outward migration as countries accede to the EU, but people then return to their own countries with better skills and the income or capital with which they can try to build up those countries. I think that that pattern will be seen with the 10&nbsp;countries that have come in, as well as Romania and Bulgaria.

They were clearly of Asian or Indian origin. They said that they had been on the move for thousands of years and then landed in those countries and were, in a sense, frozen in time. They said that many of them were highly skilled. Indeed, it was pointed out that the Roma people brought the skill of metallurgy to

<a name="stpa_178">The explanatory notes say that there are different proposals for the freedom of movement of workers. They relate to two years, after the third year and after seven years, which, in a sense, is a get-out clause. I hope that we will not review that negatively and will always think positively about how we can include more of those people who might not at the moment be thought of as highly skilled workers, to whom the hon. Member for Ribble Valley referred. Our part in Europe is to put together an agreement among countries that relates to all people. Yes, we need to deal with fraud, inadequate administration and the unacceptable attributes in the accession countries, but we can lift those countries to a standard with which we are all happy.

 I was impressed with the contribution of my hon. Friend, and he makes his point well. It is easy to find scapegoats and frighten people if everyone who is of non-British origin is seen as different, threatening or less beneficial to our society. If we make Europe wider by allowing people to come in from countries that have been frozen out for a long time and, as a consequence of their suffering, have created societies that we do not applaud, it is possible, as part of that enterprise, to give them a standard of living and an aspiration to achieve the sort of relationships that make us happy. Regardless of how we fall out over economics or policies such as defence, if we set out on that journey&#151;the treaty is a step along the way&#151;we will build a Europe of which we are all proud, irrespective of whether we believe in the EU as it stands or some other arrangement for the countries of Europe to work together.

 I will support the Bill, but want to take the opportunity to sound a note of caution. I first visited Romania in 1982&nbsp;and have visited it a number of times since. On that first visit, we were shown many villages&#151;the Potemkin villages&#151;that were special and of a much better standard than others throughout Romania. Foreigners were shown a restricted amount of the country. We were only meant to see the nice bits and not the problems that it faced. Nevertheless, I could still see the terrible fear in people&#039;s eyes as they lived under a tyrannical regime under communism.
</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Her&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majesty the Queen put him up in Buckingham palace and gave him one of the highest orders. It was not just the Labour Government who were responsible, however. Others in the western world also ostentatiously f&#234;ted Ceausescu.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_180">When I visited Romania after the fall of communism in 1990, I was amazed at the differences. I walked along the boulevard of the Victory of Socialism, which is twice as long and twice as wide as the Champs-Elys&#233;es. It was built by Nicolae Ceausescu as a road to his palace, which is the biggest building in the world next to the Pentagon. Despite that ostentatiousness and the tremendous luxury in which he lived, the people of Romania were extremely poor. I saw people queuing for basic foodstuffs. The electricity supply was intermittent and, in many flats, only one electric light bulb could be turned on at various times of the day. It was George Orwell&#039;s &quot;1984&quot;. It was a terrible society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_181">Although I saw how ghastly that society was and although I think that Mr. Ceausescu was an appalling man, I am concerned about the way in which he and his wife were executed on 24&nbsp;December 1989. No matter how bad other evil brutes are, such as Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic, they are given a proper hearing and trial, but President Ceausescu was tried with his wife, Elena, in a kangaroo court. He was sentenced to death almost immediately and did not have the right to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a proper lawyer. The way in which the Romanian authorities carried out his trial and execution was wrong. I hope that they have learned their lesson from that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_182">I am pleased that Romania can join the nations of a new modern Europe, but there are problems. Communism has taken its toll. It had a destructive impact, not just on Romania, but on most European countries that experienced it. I saw it at first hand as a child in Poland. However, few of us will have forgotten the images that we saw on television in 1990&nbsp;of the orphanages in Romania and the appalling way in which those children were treated. Those institutions still exist. Outside modern Bucharest, children are kept in state institutions that are badly heated and lit, where they receive poor care. There are awful cases of neglect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_183">There is also terrible environmental pollution. The Ploesti oil fields and other industrial complexes have devastated the local environment. I fear that Great Britain and the other EU countries will have to stump up a great deal of money to modernise those facilities and ensure that the environment is brought up to the modern standard that one would expect of an EU country.

<a name="51101-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_184">The infrastructure is a shambles. The hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) stated that he was in Bucharest for only seven hours when he was Minister for Europe. That is the problem. Many Ministers get whisked to Bucharest, no doubt stay in a lovely hotel and see the best bits of Romania, but they do not see the shambolic state that it is in. If they were taken to villages like Scornicesti, Timisoara and Arad, they would see how backward the country is and the amount of money that it will need.

<a name="stpa_185">The Minister stated that &#8364;5&nbsp;billion&#151;I hope I have that right&#151;will be spent on improving agriculture in Romania and Bulgaria. He said, though, that that was not a definitive figure, and I understand why: the actual cost will be far greater. We all know that, with Government targets, the figures are in the end much higher than the initial projections. As my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) stated, Romanian agriculture is, with no disrespect to Romania, extremely backward. One can still see oxen and carts or ploughs rather than tractors. It is so far behind the United Kingdom that it will need a great deal of money to bring it up to our levels.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_186">That concerns me because I represent many hard-working, decent farmers in Shrewsbury and Atcham, including sugar beet and milk producers who are battling to save agriculture and trying to make a living. The Government are now talking about common agricultural policy reforms and, perhaps, lowering agricultural subsidies in exchange for an agreement at the World Trade Organisation. That is all well and good, but, at the same time as it is lowering subsidies for our farmers, the European Union will be pouring billions of pounds of investment into Romania and Bulgaria to get their agriculture up to our standards. That is a real concern. My priority is farmers in Shrewsbury rather than those in Romania.

 I am pleased to speak in a debate that has been at times&#151;let me put it this way&#151;rather detailed. It has homed in on some of the minutiae of accession and enlargement, and sometimes the big picture has been missing. That is a great shame because this is a truly historic development that we should welcome with open arms, but unfortunately some of the enthusiasm has been rather muted.

<a name="stpa_189">In the years ahead we will be reuniting our continent. The countries in question, and the previous accession countries, have not been knocking on the door of Brussels for a handout; they have been wanting a hand up. They want to work hard, earn their keep and play their part in our continent. We should never forget that the benefits that will flow to those countries through membership of the European Union are mirrored by the benefits that we will enjoy here.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_190">The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) rightly pointed out that it would be of benefit to Members to travel widely in the region. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had the good fortune to work in central Europe for over seven years when I was a diplomatic affairs journalist during the 1990s. Travelling back there as I do now, I can look back and compare what is now with what was then at the beginning of the 1990s. The transformation is extraordinary, and not just in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;of recent accession states.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_191">The hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) mentioned the challenges of border controls. I well remember standing on an Austrian police boat on the Neusiedler See doing a report for the BBC&#039;s &quot;Correspondent&quot; programme about those concerns. That border between Austria and Hungary was to be the outer border of the European Union. The Austrians managed that change; 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="stpa_192">Changes have occurred not just in the countries that have joined the EU; the changes in Romania and Bulgaria since the fall of communism have been profound. A point that has not been made, but which I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall come to later, is that the impact of accession is not simply on the countries in question; it has a ripple effect in their immediate neighbours. There has been no talk yet of the near neighbourhood policy and the consequences for the countries that border Romania and Bulgaria.

<a name="51101-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_193">I must confess that, like many people, I do not know a tremendous amount about the culture of Romania and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bulgaria. The hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) spoke in glowing terms about the culture of both nations, and I am sure that there is much to commend it. My impression of the countries was formed through sport. I well remember, in Romania&#039;s case, Nadia Comaneci, Ilie Nastase, Gheorghe Hagi and many others.

<a name="51101-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_194">I had to look in a book to find out that Romania is the home of the most eastern Romance people. They have emerged from the Ottoman and Hapsburg empires and the Ceausescu regime. They have tremendous cultural breadth, including not only the general Romania population but the Hungarian minority, the Roma and Sinti people, those that remain of the Transylvanian Saxon population, Vlachs and many other minority groups about which we know little. They will be part of our European home, and that is something we should celebrate. However, we should look closely at the map and realise that the EU will have a border with Ukraine, Serbia and Moldova. We have already had mention of Transnistria. Those are challenges, and we shall need to look closely at the consequences of what is happening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_195">Mention has been made of the Commission&#039;s 2005&nbsp;monitoring report. We should not ignore it because, despite my enthusiasm and the fact that I think this is a tremendous, historic development, there are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;challenges. On the political requirements, the Commission says:

<a name="stpa_196">but there needs to be progress in public administration, in tackling corruption, in improving the situation of disabled and mentally ill people and in fighting trafficking in human beings. Those are challenges on which the Romanian authorities need to deliver. They should be aware that those of us who are keen for their accession expect them to deliver and to improve the situation for their citizens in those vital areas.

<a name="51101-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_197">Bulgaria&#039;s position is similar to that of Romania. There is my football analogy of growing up with Balakov and Stoitchlov. I did not know much about Bulgaria&#039;s culture, but it is the first Slavic nation state in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;history. It has managed successfully to emerge from the shadow of Ottoman domination and Soviet domination, so it has a rich tapestry. Bulgaria has a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;significant Turkish community, which has formed the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minority coalition partner of most Bulgarian Governments since the fall of communism.

I counsel the Minister to be highly sceptical of advice from Conservative Members on this issue.

That opposition would have had devastating consequences in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my constituency and many others. The example of hard-working Poles and others is a credit to their homelands and to their homes in Moray and many other parts of the country. I am sorry that little or no mention was made of the opportunity, or the potential&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;benefit for the economy, that is provided by hard-working people. There has been no praise for the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hard-working people who have come here.

When I was based in Vienna in the mid 1990s I well remember the efforts of Alois Mock and Franz Vranitzky in moving Austria towards membership of the EU. That had a considerable impact throughout the wider Danube region. It was not confined to former communist countries thinking that they were on to a good thing. There was a general realisation that membership of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European Union was worth pursuing. I am disappointed by the Austrian Government&#039;s recent opposition to Turkish membership. It is ironic that one of the most vocal supporters of Turkish membership of the EU was none other than J&#246;rg Haider. That might be a surprise to some.

In 2004, the launch of the near neighbourhood policy would have an impact on Ukraine and Moldova. A little later, a second round of the policy was launched, which would include the south Caucasus&#151;Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. The policy does not mean that those different states will be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;able automatically to join the EU; it recognises the ripple effect that accession has as the EU moves further&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;east, bringing benefits to trade, standards of governments, human rights, law, cross-border control, combating drugs and human trafficking and to fighting terrorism.

When European business comes before the House, every effort should be made to co-ordinate so that Members of this place, such as the hon. Gentleman, the hon.

If the benefits of membership are obvious for both the richer and the emerging economies, and for both larger and smaller countries, it is ironic&#151;this will not be lost in time in the public consciousness in Scotland&#151;that Scotland is not part of an inward enlargement of the EU as well.

I am not sure why he should ignore the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative party. Our parties will be delighted to support the Bill. I hope that it will not be forced to a vote.

The journey was memorable for two things&#151;poverty and corruption. The Ceausescu regime was rampant, demolishing whole districts of Bucharest in the most controversial manner possible and creating agri-industrial complexes in the countryside. Today, such regimes exist only in North Korea or Zimbabwe, but the Ceausescu regime was in the premier league of tyranny. The poverty was incredible for a European country. Children begged at the side of the train for chewing gum, and even tourists had almost nothing to eat. I survived on tomatoes for an entire week, and gained the impression that a command economy was operating. The week after, people probably lived on cucumbers.

<a name="stpa_208">Corruption was evident as soon as I arrived at the border. The price of a visa was hiked up arbitrarily, from 40&nbsp;Deutschmarks to $40, then to &#163;40, because I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was a UK citizen. I recall Romania as a beautiful but depressive and slightly volatile country. The only place to go in the capital at night was a rundown 1930s-style club called the Athen&#233;e Palast, which offered truly ghastly entertainment. I believe, however, it is the club mentioned by the late Alan Clark in an interesting passage in his diaries about his trip to Romania in the late 1980s. The people were naturally friendly but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham said, it was a country run by fear. It was significantly poorer than Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and even the Soviet Union.

<a name="stpa_209">The status of minorities was extremely bad. I spent one afternoon in Transylvania with an elderly ethnic German who had been given electrode treatment in the 1960s because of his views and ethnicity, and was in a sad state. The atmosphere was oppressive. The only bookshop that we saw was stocked entirely with the volumes of Elena Ceausescu. The wife of the hated dictator was a chemist who specialised, bizarrely, in plagiarising the works of other scientists, which she claimed as her own. The relief caused by the December revolution in Romania was palpable, and a few weeks afterwards I received a 17-page letter from a Romanian I had met describing the conversation that he wished he had had with me. For an MP, a 17-page letter is a nightmare, but it was a revelation to me as a student, because it was a moving personal testimony that described in detail the nightmare of a life wasted at the expense of communism.

<br>&nbsp;<br>precursor to worse expulsions in the Balkans in the 1990s. Bulgaria was not subject to the obsessive and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crazy schemes of Ceausescu. In fact, one of the Romanians&#039; main grievances was their perception that they had fallen behind even Bulgaria. I returned to Romania in March 1990, when the revolution was only a few weeks old. The streets were filled with armoured cars, and it was still dangerous, with soldiers, paramilitaries and political activists all mixed together in a volatile atmosphere. Ironically, the &quot;people&#039;s palace&quot; that Ceausescu inhabited had just been opened up to the people, but the people did not like what they saw, and the experience evoked yet more hatred for the recently deceased dictator. The country was moving towards the leadership of the National Salvation Front, or FSN, and continuing single-party rule under Ion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iliescu. Many people simply wanted to leave, and I was almost crushed to death on the Bucharest to Timisoara train, which was full of people wanting to go to Belgrade before Yugoslavia introduced a new tougher visa regime for Romanian citizens. Only a few years later, of course, the flow was reversed.

<a name="stpa_211">Romania and Bulgaria have both had a tough passage since 1989. Fortunately, Britain has been a great friend to both of them since the beginning of democratisation. In researching my speech, I looked at the debates in the House in 1989&nbsp;and 1990. I was struck by the speed of the Government&#039;s response under Margaret Thatcher. For example, in January 1990, they announced the setting-up of the know-how fund to use British expertise to advise public and private sectors in the emerging democracies such as Romania and Bulgaria. Possible membership of the European Community was first mentioned by my right hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude), the present chairman of the Conservative party, in the House on 31&nbsp;January 1990.

<a name="stpa_212">Both Bulgaria and Romania have made huge progress in the 15&nbsp;years since. They are not fashionable parts of eastern Europe, and they do not have any cities as picturesque as Prague. Unlike Poland, they have not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;produced a powerful diaspora, and they lack geographical immediacy. Neither of them has ever been a democracy, in contrast to Czechoslovakia and Hungary in the 1930s. Throughout the first part of the 1990s, Bulgaria was wracked by political instability and strikes. The former communists remained a powerful influence. Although the end of the decade was more stable, there was little tangible progress in economic reform until the arrival of the Simeon Government in 2001. King Simeon&#039;s Government deserve to be thanked and acknowledged. A student whom I employed and helped to train on Wall Street in 1993&nbsp;went on to become Deputy Finance Minister in that Government in 2001, so in a small way I can say that I helped.

<a name="stpa_213">Romania, too, has suffered from long bouts of instability, poorly executed reforms and so on. In the early 1990s, as hon. Members have said, the country grabbed the headlines for all the wrong reasons because of its treatment of children, especially orphans. Crucially, both countries could have gone down the route to demagoguery, as happened in nearby Belgrade and, to some extent, Zagreb, but they wisely chose not to do so. Both were damaged economically by the sanctions on Yugoslavia&#151;Bulgaria was even hit by a cruise missile&#151;and both helped us out in Iraq. The

<p>
<a name="51101-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_214">Significant problems remain, and I shall address them briefly, as other hon. Members have already discussed them. First, corruption needs to be reduced. When I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visited Sofia in 1996, gangster culture and Government corruption were very much in evidence. I met a man who said that he ran Sofia airport. He said that the Americans were terrible at business, because they would not pay the price necessary to secure a contract. He contrasted their approach to business with that of the Germans and Italians, so it was an enlightening conversation. Corruption is still in evidence, and it is probably worse than it is in the 10&nbsp;countries that joined the EU in the past year. However, it has been reduced significantly in the past 10&nbsp;years, which is an encouraging trend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_215">Secondly, as has been said, efforts must be made to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue to improve the status of minorities, notably the Hungarian minority in Romania, the Roma in Bulgaria and Romania, the few remaining Germans in Romania, the Turks in Bulgaria, and the Vlachs in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romania. Those minorities add a great deal to the culture of those countries. Thirdly, we must accelerate progress on free market reforms. Fourthly, progress should be made in reducing violent crime, especially in Bulgaria, which has suffered from assassinations. Finally, both states must boost co-operation with the west on issues such as drugs and people trafficking.

 I agree that human rights and the other issues raised by my hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend must be at the top of the list. However, as a member of the all-party group of Bulgaria and a friend of the country, I believe that, like Romania, it needs to do far more on animal welfare. I raised that with the Bulgarian Prime Minister last Thursday, and I am glad that his Government are taking the subject far more seriously. People who visit Sofia are put off by the sight of bear baiting on the streets, which is something that one does not see in Prague.

 That is correct. Animal welfare was covered by my hon. Friends the Members for Shrewsbury and Atcham and for Totnes (Mr. Steen), but my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mark&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchard) is right to say that it must conform to European standards.

<a name="stpa_217">In conclusion, these accessions will add another 30&nbsp;million people to the EU. Compared to last year&#039;s accession states, Romania ranks second in size, after Poland. Romania and Bulgaria have been members of Partnership for Peace for about 11&nbsp;years and are now members of NATO. We should welcome them warmly and try to bring them round to the British view of the EU as a looser collection of states whose relationship is characterised more by free trade than by federalised institutions.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_219">Romania and the part of the world I come from, north Wales, have remarkably long links. In 1890&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth of Romania journeyed to Llandudno, where she set up her court for several months. As a consequence, several streets in that town were named after that event. There is a Roumania crescent, a Roumania avenue and also a Carmen Sylva drive. Since then there has been a great affinity between the people of north Wales and the people of Romania.

 It is true that a certain amount of socialism has been inflicted on Wales, but possibly not in the extreme form that Romania experienced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_220">Of all the European nations in the 20th century, Romania may have been the unluckiest. The century started with a period of civil unrest and ended with the impoverished legacy of Ceausescu&#039;s bloody rule. In the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interim there was the division of the country by the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, followed by several decades under communism, and the more extreme form of communism exemplified by President Ceausescu. It is a credit to the people of Romania that despite their travails throughout the last century, they remain optimistic about their future and want to play their part as a western nation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_221">It is particularly to the credit of the Romanian people that they look beyond the confines of the EU and have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recently become full members of NATO. The hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty) expressed some concern about the presence of the Americans in Romania. I remind him&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Americans are also members of NATO. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe that there is a delegation from America in Romania at present, looking to establish a NATO base near the Black sea.

<p>
<a name="51101-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_222">There are admittedly real concerns overshadowing the proposed accession of Romania, especially with regard to the development of the economy, public health and corruption. For that reason a safeguard mechanism has been built into the treaty of accession. However, having spoken recently to Romanians, I know that there 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 782</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>is great concern in Romania that the mechanism may be invoked to delay the country&#039;s accession by 12&nbsp;months to 2008. I, for one, hope that that can be avoided.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_223">Over the past 12&nbsp;months, particularly since last December&#039;s elections, democracy in Romania has made significant strides forward. There is genuine enthusiasm for membership of the EU, which has complemented other political changes in the country. If the process of accession is delayed by 12&nbsp;months, which may be the case under the terms of the safeguard mechanism, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;political impetus that Romania has enjoyed over&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the past few months may be lost. I would be reluctant for anything to damage the enthusiasm that has built up over recent history in Romania.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_224">Clearly, there are significant problems of corruption, which the Romanian authorities need to address, and under President Basescu they are doing so. It was pointed out by the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) that those who take a more jaundiced view of the European project would regard it as ironic that an institution whose Court of Auditors has repeatedly for the past 10&nbsp;years refused to sign off the annual accounts is so picky about corruption in Romania.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_225">The enlargement of the EU to encompass Romania and Bulgaria should be welcomed. It amounts to a widening of Europe, rather than the deepening that was so decisively rejected by France and Holland earlier this year. It sends out a message that Romania and Bulgaria are part of the European family, and that the EU is moving towards the outward-looking association of nation states, which is as it should be. If the EU had been more outward looking over the past 15&nbsp;years, the accession of Romania and other eastern European nations may have been accelerated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_226">The presence of Romania and Bulgaria within the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;body of NATO must also be welcome. Our security as a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continent and our relative peace over the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;past&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half-century are attributable not only to the European Union, but to the strong and effective Atlantic alliance. NATO and the EU are not mutually exclusive organisations, as they are seen to be by some on the continent. European nations should play their part in wider international arrangements; they should not simply be subsumed into the rigid corpus of a European state.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_227">In short, progress has already been made in Romania. Certainly, much more progress has to be made, but I am sure that the character of the Romanian people, which many speakers have touched on this afternoon, will prevail. The Romanians will play their full role as part of a Europe of independent nation states and as part of the stabilising political force of NATO. I welcome the Bill.

<a name="stpa_228">As the current chairman of the British-Romanian all-party group, I am proud to say that my association goes back to December 1989&nbsp;when the revolution was taking place in Romania. I was there and I remember only too well the enthusiasm of some, the doubts of many, and the fear felt by much of the population about the possible repercussions of what they had started. It was not until a few months into 1990&nbsp;that we began to realise that that fear had started to ebb away and was being replaced with hope and enthusiasm for that beautiful country, in terms of it developing to full maturity and giving its citizens the opportunity for a better life.

<a name="stpa_229">During the time that I have been a member of the parliamentary delegation to the Council of Europe I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been responsible for writing reports on Romania and Bulgaria, as well as other former Soviet states. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have written about corruption, about trafficking and about institutions. I know such institutions very well because I worked in asylums in Romania. I know what it is like to work with children and adults in long-stay institutions&#151;young men and women whose only existence had been among some of the worst horrors one could ever imagine; which would put to shame any human being associated with them; and which would defy any possible description that I could give. Nobody could suggest that that was a right and fit way to treat any other human being.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-22_para14">
<a name="stpa_230">During the 15&nbsp;years that I have been a regular visitor to Romania and Bulgaria, enormous steps have been taken by the people of those countries. A year ago, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrote a report for the Council of Europe about taking&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;young children out of institutionalised care. The situation is not perfect by any means&#151; a lot still needs to be done. Having said that, I worked with children with disabilities in this country, and many of their parents told me that even here they struggled for 20&nbsp;years or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more to get proper recognition of children with disabilities. For a long time, the only solution was to put them in long-stay institutions. That took us up until the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1980s, when we started to think about care in the community without providing the resources to ensure that the community could properly care. It would not do justice to what has been achieved to expect the reversal of the horrors of Ceausescu, and for that matter what happened in similar institutions in Bulgaria, in a very short space of time with nowhere near the resources that we had. Staff have been trained, mentalities have been altered, and people in the community generally want to see children back where they belong, wherever possible&#151;properly supported in their families.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-22_para15">
<a name="stpa_231">One of the failures of the past 15&nbsp;years in both countries has been that of EU countries to support the political process within political parties. Politicians lived in the expectation that they would win the next election, but they had no chance of winning the one after that. It was a question of their getting power, then using and abusing it in the knowledge that the overwhelming majority of people would reject them at the next

<p>
<a name="51101-22_para16">
<a name="stpa_232">Corruption is another problem in those countries. When the Romanian President was here last week for the Hampton Court meeting, I asked him whether the Romanian people were comfortable about the changes that were being proposed. He said that corruption will start to be proven to be dealt with when investors feel safe to invest in Romania and western countries and others invest large sums of money there without having to answer the niggling question of how much it will cost to get a particular deal. That process was started by former Prime Minister Nastase. I give credit to that Administration for doing two good things. First, they started properly to resource social care for children, albeit under a lot of pressure from the EU; and secondly, they tried to tackle corruption and create confidence in inward investment into Romania. The current Prime Minister and the Liberals are working hard to follow that commitment, and the current President is determined to make a great effort to try to pull off the coup of taking down someone in a position of power who is known to be corrupt. The willingness to find the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary evidence to do that has not been there in the past, but now the challenge is starting to be addressed realistically, particularly in Romania.

<a name="stpa_233">My first drive in Romania was along the road from Brasov to Ploesti. The British and Americans bombed the city of Ploesti heavily in the second world war. Many of its people have unpleasant memories of horrendous bombing, day after day, night after night, in 1943&nbsp;and 1944. When I stopped at the side of the road, I had never in my life seen such rich soil and agriculture. Romania has the largest cultivable space in Europe, bigger than Spain or even France&#151;4.5&nbsp;million hectares of rich soil where one can grow virtually anything. It is amazing that such a rich country was destroyed so stupidly by politicians who did not have an inkling of what they could have done with those resources. The country went from being gold-rich to oil-rich to land-rich.

I am heartened by the fact that many of the people whom I met in 1989&nbsp;and 1990, having left Romania, are now back there because they want to give their country some of the knowledge and opportunities that they have been granted elsewhere.

 We have had an excellent, albeit intimate, debate, and I welcome the Bill on behalf of the official Opposition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_245">I do not want to expose the Minister for the Middle East, who will wind up the debate, to internal grief, but when Greece joined the EU in 1981&nbsp;and Spain and Portugal joined in 1986&nbsp;the Labour party was not only against enlargement but against membership of the EU:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how times change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_246">The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) spoke eloquently about the inspiration of the people. We cannot accuse bureaucrats in Romania and Bulgaria of being inspired, but he is right that we must carry with us the inspiration of the people to ensure that Euroscepticism, which we saw in some applicant countries in the run-up to their votes on accession, does not emerge in Bulgarian and Romanian national newspapers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_247">Like me, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clegg) has had the benefit of being a Member of the European Parliament. He reminded us that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria will lead to a Europe of 500&nbsp;million citizens, and we warmly welcome that increase in the size of the marketplace. He addressed the question of how to make an enlarged EU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sustainable and, like my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen), referred to the Commission report and drew the conclusion that a great deal remains to be done.

<a name="stpa_251">The first report confirmed that there was evidence that that category had been exploited and described a serious failure in the operation of the scheme. The second report identified the exploitation of the scheme and recommended new management measures.

However, he stirred the Opposition&#039;s hearts by saying that it was better to broaden the European Union by bringing in new countries than to deepen it. I join him in wishing Bulgaria and Romania well and I hope that he shares our vision of a more open, more flexible and wider EU.

Member for Leicester, East said that the Bill was special and that it united all parties. I could not agree more. Perhaps he will reflect on my remarks about the Labour party&#039;s position on previous enlargements and thus form a more mature view of the Opposition&#039;s position. He referred especially to clause 2&nbsp;on the worker registration scheme. I hope that he accepts that I have dealt with that point.

I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concur with his conclusion that a phenomenal amount of work remains to be done but, as he said, the success of the EU and our membership of it depend on our being competitive. No one should owe any member of the EU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a living. We must be competitive and work hard at that.

<p>
<a name="51101-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_255">My hon. Friend also said that we need to reform the common agricultural policy and I agree that we expect great things of the Doha round.

<a name="51101-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_256">I was delighted to hear the remarks of the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins), who again drew attention to the need to reform agriculture and spread wealth around. He referred especially to poverty levels in Romania and Bulgaria.

<p>
<a name="51101-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_259">My hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) spoke with genuine passion and experience. He referred to a previous Labour Government&#039;s support for the former communist regime and the genuine fear that that inspired.

<a name="stpa_260">As I expected, the hon. Member for Moray (Angus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robertson), with whom I had the honour to serve on the European Scrutiny Committee, gave a warm welcome to the new applicant members and their accession plans.

<a name="stpa_261">I was impressed by the speeches of my hon. Friends the Members for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands) and for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones). My hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham reminded us that Greece will have an overland connection to Europe. Perhaps we can concentrate on improving that connection and get the Italians away from their obsession with a bridge over the straits of Messina, which I remember with some fondness from my days in the European Parliament. My hon. Friend raised concerns about corruption, minorities, drugs and people trafficking. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West spoke specifically about Romania&#039;s close links with north Wales but also commented on its being perhaps the unluckiest of all the applicant countries so far.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-23_para17">
<a name="stpa_262">The Minister for Europe said that the Bill enables the accession treaty to be implemented in UK law and approves provisions of the accession treaty in so far as they relate to the powers of the European Parliament. He also said that the Bill includes powers to make provision on the entitlement of Bulgarian and Romanian workers to work and reside in the UK. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;followed the words of wisdom of my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) on that with great interest. He said that there was a compelling outstanding question. The hon. Member for Moray can now write to the employers in his constituency to tell them that the Opposition are interested in such issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-23_para18">
<a name="stpa_263">We expect the Minister for the Middle East to announce in his winding-up speech when the Government will announce whether the entitlement for the workers from Romania and Bulgaria will be issued immediately or whether there will be a transitional period. Can we expect any more one-legged roofers and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electricians who are not in possession of all the equipment that they might need? If we are to raise the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expectations of workers from those countries, it is important to tell them now when the benefits will be extended to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-23_para19">
<a name="stpa_264">Several hon. Members raised anxieties about the EU budget. I should like the Minister to confirm whether the UK will block overall expenditure within a limit in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EU. Will the Government give a commitment to do that? Will the Minister tell us which other member states currently support our view? That will give an indication of whether we are likely to achieve that goal.

<br>&nbsp;<br>successful. I hope that she will recant because I hope that she will be served in London restaurants in future. It is time that we were told because the Conservatives claim that they will not oppose the Bill&#151;I welcome that&#151;but they want to have it both ways. They want to say that they support accession while peddling a rather mean line on workers. At the next municipal and European elections, I and many other hon. Members will remind the large, additional electorate of the identity of those who supported access from day one.
</p>








<p><a name="st_136"><a name="51101-24_spnew1"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 As always, the hon. Gentleman makes an interesting and positive contribution. We have asked a question, and we would like to know from the Minister whether the workers from Romania and Bulgaria will enjoy exactly the same terms as those from the 10&nbsp;new member states. I am sure that the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) will accept the point that we are making.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_265">I would also like to ask the Minister whether the two applicant countries will have the ability to meet the acquis communautaire in the same time frame that applied to the 10&nbsp;countries that have recently joined the European Union. Also, will he give the House his response to the points raised about avian flu? At least two ducks have been caught in Romania, and there is a fear that the infection could spread from migratory birds. Several of my hon. Friends have raised the very real question of inadequate border controls, and those of us who have poultry producers&#151;and, indeed, a number of wild ducks&#151;living in our constituencies want to know how the Minister will address that issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_266">Several points remain to be addressed, including the free movement of workers, and the vexed question of people trafficking. The hon. Member for Thurrock mentioned waitresses. A number of young women from Bulgaria and Romania will be applying to work as waitresses in various parts of the European Union, and they could be exploited in other ways. We would like to know what provisions will be put in place to prevent their exploitation in any other way than that intended by the treaty. We also want to hear from the Minister what his Government are doing to bring pressure to bear on Romania and Bulgaria, given that the European Commissioner for Enlargement has noted&#151;particularly in relation to Romania&#151;that no corruption cases have been prosecuted to date. No person, official or otherwise, in those countries should be allowed to be seen to be above the law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_267">There are many reasons why we support the Bill, but perhaps the most profound is that we believe that it will be a test of the Government&#039;s commitment to the European Union if they are able to answer our questions tonight and during the brief passage that I am sure the Bill will have through the House.

<p><a name="st_137"><a name="51101-24_spmin0"><b>The Minister for the Middle East  (Dr. Kim Howells): </b> 
 I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;welcome this evening&#039;s debate. The Minister for Europe, my right hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, South (Mr. Alexander) set the tone for what has been a very constructive debate, and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;welcome the largely positive speech from the hon.

<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 791</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_268">I would also like to say how much I enjoyed and appreciated the speech made by the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley). It was inspirational, and, if I had not already been raised a good Wesleyan in Trecynon in Aberdare, I might have taken up the cause of the Baptists in Romania. But that is a problem for history. I bet history is very glad that I did not take it up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_269">I am sure that the representatives of Romania and Bulgaria will have noticed the bipartisan spirit in which this discussion has been conducted. I use the adjective &quot;bipartisan&quot; carefully, because the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson) was a bit upset earlier by the idea that the discussion was between only three parties. He made a good point. This has been a very good debate, and it has drawn constructive views from all the parties represented in the Chamber tonight&#151;although I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notice that the Welsh nationalists were not present.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_270">The Romanians and Bulgarians can be sure that this country will welcome them into the European Union as equals and partners. Some concerns have been raised in the debate and I will try to respond to them, but let me start with some general observations. The United Kingdom has always been a strong supporter of enlargement. It is a policy that has consistently enjoyed cross-party support. Indeed, as early as March 1991, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then Prime Minister, John Major, argued that the ultimate destiny of eastern Europeans was membership of the then European Community. It is not difficult to see why.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_271">Successive enlargements have led to a stronger, more stable and secure Europe. We need only look at last year&#039;s accession of the 10&nbsp;new member states from eastern and central Europe to see the new economic opportunities brought by enlargement. The prospect of membership helped to boost the candidate countries&#039; economies. We have heard several accounts today, including that of the hon. Member for Moray, of the huge difference that membership has made in a short period of time. Such differences can be contrasted with conditions in some other parts of the world, where countries ought to have made similar progress but have not. This is proof of what the EU can do. Now, we see growth rates as high as 8.3&nbsp;per cent. in Latvia and 5.3&nbsp;per cent. in Poland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_272">This is a win-win situation. High growth provides job opportunities and helps to raise living standards in the new member states. It also provides new trade and investment opportunities for the United Kingdom. Indeed, since May 2004, British businesses have benefited from new opportunities in a market that has more than 70&nbsp;million new consumers. A good example is Tesco, which now has 25&nbsp;supermarkets in Slovakia. As&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands) reminded us, there are 30&nbsp;million people in Romania and Bulgaria to add to that market. That is an important consideration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_273">Enlargement also means that we live in a more secure Europe. It has led to closer co-operation on border control and on tackling organised crime. New member states have brought experience and knowledge of specific regional problems. Their expertise has enabled us to get one step ahead of the drug and human trafficking gangs working through eastern Europe. The arrests of sex traffickers in Sheffield last month came 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 792</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>about through co-operation with new member states&#039; police forces, which represented an enormous step forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_274">One of the most striking successes of enlargement is the way in which it has spread democracy and stability across Europe, as has been mentioned today. For many of the new member states, and for Romania and Bulgaria, military and authoritarian rule is still a recent memory. It was only 15&nbsp;years ago that people took to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;streets demanding change. Since then, the prospect of EU membership has driven and supported political developments. For many eastern Europeans, EU membership represents the final step in their country&#039;s transformation from dictatorship to democracy. Lech Walesa&#039;s statement on 1&nbsp;May 2004, when Poland became a member state, sums that up well:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;I fought for our country to recover everything it lost under communism and the Soviets . . . and now my struggle is over. My ship has come to port&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_275">Romania and Bulgaria are also coming to the end of their journeys. Their paths have not been easy. Tonight, we have heard some of the most moving accounts that we are ever likely to hear of what life was like under those authoritarian regimes. I found them a real inspiration. The House is constantly criticised from outside, but I do not know of any other venue in which Members can come together to share such a wealth of experience. I very much hope that this debate is reported and that the public pay attention to it. It is extremely important that that should happen but, as usual, the Press Gallery is a little empty. No doubt they are all watching the debate on television.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_276">It is clear that more work still needs to be done. However, the significant changes that have already taken place are a credit to the vision, energy and determination of the peoples and Governments of Romania and Bulgaria. I know that those qualities are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there. I was lucky enough to visit Romania three times, and to travel to the industrial areas of the north. The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kawczynski) is not here at the moment, but I should like to tell him that there are many hon. Members who have shared that kind of experience.
</p>

<a name="51101-24_para12">
<a name="stpa_277">The hon. Members for Altrincham and Sale, West and for Moray, and my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) spoke about the free movement of workers, which is an important issue. A decision on whether Romanian and Bulgarian nationals will be given complete access to the labour market will be taken closer to their countries&#039; accession.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_278">It would certainly be premature to make any decision now without sufficient information and planning. A final decision will be made after full consideration of the state of the domestic labour market, other member states&#039; decisions and further analysis of our own experience of the last accession. We will of course seek Parliament&#039;s approval before setting the terms of access.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_279">The worker registration scheme for A8&nbsp;nationals was an overwhelming success, and I think it will continue to be. We have heard some terrific tributes to it. The policy brought real benefits to the United Kingdom economy. I was glad&#151;as, I know, were others&#151;to hear accounts of the way in which economies far-flung from London had benefited.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-24_para15">
<a name="stpa_280">Skills shortages are not limited to rural areas. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remember that we suddenly noticed in Pontypridd that there were a good many Portuguese bus drivers. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 793</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>That was because the bus companies could not recruit drivers in our area, and it has made a big difference. We began to recruit rugby players from Samoa and New Zealand at the same time.

<a name="stpa_284">Corruption and organised crime are still serious problems, and I hope those who asked about them realise that we know that. There is no doubt that both countries need to take immediate action. We heard about some of the steps that have already been taken, including the important step mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly. We are working closely with both countries. There has been encouraging progress, such as the tackling of petty corruption in Bulgaria, but further efforts are needed in the fight against high-level corruption. The recent violent organised-crime killings in Bulgaria are a stark reminder of the problems that the country faces. Criminals cannot be allowed to act above the law, and there must be robust action to rein in such elements. We will give all the co-operation we can to ensure that that happens.

On accession, Romania will have the second-longest external EU border. The hon. Member for Moray gave us an important lesson in geography and culture. I could not write fast enough to take it all down, but it would have been great if I had been able to, because I could have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used it in pub quizzes. There were so many useful facts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_286">The hon. Gentleman explained how the borders had shifted. He gave a vivid account of being on a lake which, at the time, was on the eastern border of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European Union. I think he said that it was the Austrian-Hungarian border. That worked, and this will work. We must make sure that the resources are there, and that we share our skills and those of other EU states with the new member countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_287">The Commission pointed out that neither country currently has enough border infrastructure. Improvement is needed. Funds have been provided, but training and the updating of border facilities needs to be accelerated. We are working to help implement those reforms, and we are making progress as has been demonstrated by recent drug seizures. As a number of Members said, the area is on the trail from Afghanistan through Turkey and into western Europe. We know that more than 90 per cent. of the heroin used in Europe comes via that route. It is therefore a big issue for us and for the whole of Europe, not just for those countries. That is why it is so important that they can benefit from EU membership.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_288">We heard, from the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock), a moving account of the plight of children in Romania. I think we have all learnt from it. The plight of institutionalised children is of concern to all of us in the House. In Romania, the poor living conditions of so many children is a lasting legacy of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceausescu era. Although many aspects of his authoritarian rule have been eradicated, the issue still remains. We want to see rapid progress in improvement of conditions for children in both countries. The EU accession process has led to some improvements, but both Governments recognise that more resources and work are needed. The EU will continue to work closely with them to bring about substantial changes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_289">Cyprus, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia have already ratified Romania and Bulgaria&#039;s accession treaty. It is no surprise that those new member states have been the first to endorse the next stage of enlargement. They know what benefits it will bring to Romania and Bulgaria, and also to the rest of the EU.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We too should be ready to ratify the treaty as soon as possible. Enlargement is a real success story for the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United Kingdom: it has created new opportunities, and helped us to combat serious problems such as people-trafficking and organised crime.

 I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall briefly explain the purpose of the motion relating to the House of Commons Members&#039; Fund, and the purpose of the fund itself. There are two kinds of beneficiaries of the fund, all of whom are either elderly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members of it, or their dependants. Recurring as-of-right payments are made to those who are not entitled to a parliamentary pension because they left the House before 1964, or because, as widows or widowers of former Members, they have their small parliamentary contributory pension fund benefits topped up. In addition, some beneficiaries receive discretionary payments because of hardship and their personal circumstances. The discretionary payments can be recurring in order to improve a person&#039;s standard of living; more frequently, they are one-off grants to improve quality of life, or to facilitate a minor home adaptation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_299">The fund currently has some 120&nbsp;beneficiaries. The average value of the recurring payments is a modest &#163;2,000&nbsp;per annum. A handful of one-off grants are made each year, with an average value of about &#163;5,000&nbsp;per annum. Such relatively small sums can make a big difference in some circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_300">The fund is governed by a variety of Acts of Parliament that stipulate the basis on which payments can be made and the amounts payable. The legislation is exceptionally complex and not understood by anybody, including the fund&#039;s trustees. We undoubtedly ought to regularise the legislation at some future stage, and the trustees hope to work with others, including the Leader of the House, to do so in the coming period. But the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;legislation does require that we appropriate the contributions that all Members make each month, and the &#163;215,000&nbsp;a year that the Treasury contributes, in order to make such money available to pay for the grants that we make to Members as of right, and on a discretionary basis. This motion gives effect to that, and I hope that the House will support it.
</p>

 I shall not keep the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;House long. Since we last appointed a retired Member of the House as a trustee, the retired Members association has been set up. In future, we should perhaps consult the association and more widely in order to establish who the pension trustee should be. As it stands, we could well be contravening the terms of the Pensions Act 2004. I do not ask that a change be made tonight, but I do ask the Leader of the House to take cognisance of my comments.
</p>








<p><a name="st_151"><a name="51101-26_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 With the leave of the House, I shall deal with the one point that has been raised. Nominations to replace retiring trustees have come forward in the usual way. In fact, there is no legal obligation to consult any particular organisation, but we do take account of that point when there are new regulations under the scheme. A retired Members association would be an appropriate body to consult in such circumstances. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew)

 Through you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I should like to thank Mr. Speaker for allowing me this Adjournment debate tonight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_312">One of the things in this Government&#039;s record since 1997&nbsp;of which I am most proud has been the record investment in education, particularly in terms of capital work to renew our schools. In my Denton and Reddish constituency, we have certainly benefited from that investment. With the money, we are renewing the fabric of all our existing schools. We have a new primary school at Poplar street, Audenshaw, and another new school is planned to replace both Aldwyn school and Hawthorns school, again in Audenshaw. There is a possibility that we will have a brand new primary school in Dukinfield, and it is now also possible that we will have one in Reddish, in the Stockport part of my constituency. It is to the school proposal in Reddish that I wish to draw the attention of the House and of my hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend the Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_313">For any community, the announcement of a brand new primary school with modern learning facilities and an attached children&#039;s centre should be brilliant news. However, that theory takes no account of the total mismanagement of the issue by Stockport council over the summer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_314">First, the council&#039;s Liberal Democrat executive has decided that the new school will be developed on land at Harcourt street. The land, now a playing field, was a clay extraction site for the former Jackson brickworks. When the clay extraction process ended in the late 1960s, the massive hole in the ground was infilled with all kinds&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of rubbish. That, of course, was prior to the introduction of the 1974&nbsp;landfill licensing regime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_315">There are no records of precisely what was dumped at Harcourt street. To put my concerns into context, I wish briefly to take the House on a tour of my constituency. In the Tameside part of the seat, we have three other former Jackson Brick clay extraction sites. As at Harcourt street, those sites were all landfilled in the 1970s before the licensing regime existed, and were subsequently converted to playing fields.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_316">The first site is Guide lane, Audenshaw. I refer the House to a report of Tameside metropolitan borough council, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;This is a former clay pit and problems with landfill gas migration became apparent in late 1997. Landfill gas alarms were fitted in four properties after gas was found after a routine inspection. Following this the Council received funding to install a venting trench with extraction stacks.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_317">The next site is Windmill lane, Denton. Tameside council&#039;s report adds:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;The Denton IV landfill site was filled during the 1970s and is known to be producing landfill gas and leachate.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_318">The final site is Ruby street, Denton, and the report states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">&quot;This site, a former clay pit, was identified as a problem in 1989&nbsp;with gas found to be migrating from the site. Tameside received funding to install a gas extraction system across the site. The site remains closed off to the public and responsibility has been transferred to the Environment Agency.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_319">As if that were not bad enough, there is another Jackson&#039;s site at Adswood, in Stockport borough itself. It is also experiencing substantial problems with gassing and leachate. In the report that went to the council&#039;s executive, not a single mention was made of the fact that Harcourt street was a former landfill site&#151;even though it is clearly logged on the council&#039;s contaminated land register.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_320">I asked Stockport council what testing had been done to ascertain whether the site was safe for a new primary school. The council presented me with a so-called consultants report. First, the report got the location of the site wrong: it even refers erroneously to ground investigations at Bank Hall service station, Bootle. That is hardly a comfort to those of us seeking assurances from the report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_321">It transpires that, on that massive site, just six boreholes had been dug, and that four of those were abandoned at around 3&nbsp;m because of obstructions in the ground. So the whole basis of the approval of the site&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hinges on a two-borehole survey. The small print in the consultants report states that the


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;recommendations are based on the information gained at the position of the boreholes. If different conditions are encountered then further advice should be sought&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para13">
<a name="stpa_322">Given that only two full-depth boreholes were eventually dug, it is highly probable that different conditions could be encountered on the Harcourt street site.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para14">
<a name="stpa_323">Furthermore, I contacted the Environment Agency to see whether the council had sought its advice on this matter. In a letter to me dated 23&nbsp;September 2005, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was told:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">&quot;However, the Planning Authority has not consulted us about such a proposal on the Harcourt Street site&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para15">
<a name="stpa_324">That information was just not good enough to serve as the basis for a decision to site a new school.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para16">
<a name="stpa_325">Thanks to a superb presentation by those members of the public who have formed themselves into the north Reddish action group, Stockport council&#039;s scrutiny committee called in the executive&#039;s decision and asked for further site monitoring to be done. Unfortunately, the executive decision for the site was not overturned. The extra tests are crucial, but I fear they will be too little, too late, because the decision is made and we still do not know precisely what was dumped at Harcourt street.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para17">
<a name="stpa_326">Nor is it the case that there are not alternative or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;better sites in the immediate area&#151;there are. Residents themselves have suggested a number of possible alternative sites, and their suggestions should at least, one would have hoped, be given proper consideration by Stockport council. They were not: Stockport&#039;s mind was firmly made up in advance of the formal decision. In a letter to me dated 23&nbsp;August, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;director of education told me that one impediment to one of the proposed alternative sites was that it would require a


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;full environmental impact study, possibly costing as much as &#163;100,000.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para18">
<a name="stpa_327">The inference is that no study is needed at Harcourt street, which, as we know, was a former landfill site.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para19">
<a name="stpa_328">Those are my concerns about the site itself and how the council reached its crazy decision to site a primary school there. I shall turn briefly to matters relating to the two existing primary schools, which are set to close.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 803</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para20">
<a name="stpa_329">First, we are in the middle of a consultation period on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Fir Tree and North Reddish schools closure proposals. Given the Minister&#039;s letter to all local education authority chief executives, dated 6&nbsp;September, in which she informs them that Members of Parliament are to be considered statutory consultees for school reorganisations in their constituencies, she will understand my dismay that I am still awaiting official notification from Stockport council of the proposal in my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para21">
<a name="stpa_330">Secondly, I firmly dispute the estimated sale price of the Fir Tree site, a substantial site of between four and eight acres, depending on the amount of land the council is willing to have developed. It is only &#163;1.2&nbsp;million, with outline planning permission for housing thrown in. That is outrageous, despite protestations to the contrary in the local press by the rather ineffectual new council leader. Neighbouring Labour-controlled Tameside aims to raise land values of around &#163;1&nbsp;million an acre for such land with planning consent and, more importantly, succeeds in getting it. If Stockport sought to do the same, it would raise a substantial sum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para22">
<a name="stpa_331">On the basis of the council&#039;s projected capital receipts and the &#163;2.2&nbsp;million grant from the Government, there is a shortfall in total projected finances. The Lib-Dem Stockport council has excelled itself in committing to borrow the extra money. My point is that if it did not flog off the land on the cheap, it clearly would not need to borrow more money. What a double whammy that is for Reddish residents&#151;the council sells the land to a developer on the cheap, and the residents pay for the privilege.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para23">
<a name="stpa_332">Given that appalling situation, I asked for the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background information that would support the executive&#039;s decision to borrow the additional money. It beggars belief: it is four pages long&#151;one page for each of the two school sites to be sold and two covering pages of officer blurb. So much for the full financial options appraisal I was promised and hoping for.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para24">
<a name="stpa_333">I really did despair when it stated, on page 2&nbsp;that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42">&quot;in the time available to prepare this report it was not possible to enter into detailed consultation with the Council&#039;s planning, legal and education departments.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para25">
<a name="stpa_334">I was lost for words when I read that. The executive approved borrowing on the basis of a back-of-a-fag-packet report, when no detailed consultation with the planning, legal or education departments had even taken place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para26">
<a name="stpa_335">I hope that the Minister can intervene to inject some realism into the project. Stockport council needs to start again, and from the beginning. It is a complete and utter disaster. In the near 10&nbsp;years in which I served in local government before becoming an MP, I never saw anything bungled quite as this scheme has been. Executive members have railroaded through important decisions on the basis of sloppy reports and inaccurate information&#151;no questions asked, not even a little query. The proposal was just nodded through.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-27_para27">
<a name="stpa_336">The community&#039;s views have been ridden over roughshod in this shabby, sorry affair. Only in Lib-Dem Stockport could the council turn a good news story into the script for the ultimate disaster movie. I hope that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister fully appreciates the concerns of my constituents and that the people of Reddish want a new school with top facilities. The people of Stockport

<p><a name="st_164"><a name="51101-28_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Schools  (Jacqui Smith): </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne) on securing the debate. Changes in educational provision in an area, particularly when they involve some of the very difficult planning issues that he has outlined, are clearly of great interest to local people, and it is absolutely right that the local Member of Parliament should be involved. Despite his relatively short time in the House, it is clear that my hon. Friend takes his responsibilities to his constituents extremely seriously and is asking for&#151;even if he does not always get&#151;precisely the information that his constituents deserve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_337">As my hon. Friend mentioned, on 6&nbsp;September we formalised access to information with respect to educational reorganisations by revising the statutory guidance to local authorities to include local MPs in the lists of those whom the Secretary of State considers should be consulted about changes to schools. My hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend the Member for South Swindon (Anne&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snelgrove) is in the Chamber, and it was not least because of representations that she made about how she had been treated by her local authority in a similar situation that we made those changes and made very clear the need for local MPs to be consulted about changes to schools. If consultation has started, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish that it is frankly not on that he has not been consulted. He should have been.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_338">I welcome my hon. Friend&#039;s recognition of the Government&#039;s record investment in education. That will, of course, be continued under the &quot;Building schools for the future&quot; programme and our new primary investment programme. In England, the Government are supporting &#163;5.5&nbsp;billion-worth of capital investment in schools this year, rising to &#163;6.3&nbsp;billion-worth in 2007&#150;08. That is a sixfold increase in real terms since 1997, when the figure was under &#163;700&nbsp;million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_339">Stockport&#039;s local authority and its schools have been allocated nearly &#163;34&nbsp;million of capital support over the next three years. Overall, Government support for investment in the primary estate alone should rise to an estimated &#163;1.8&nbsp;billion in 2007&#150;08. I am therefore pleased that the benefits are being felt in the Denton and Reddish constituency, as well as across the country. As my hon. Friend has outlined, his constituency will benefit from new primary schools at Audenshaw and there is a possibility of a new school at Dukenfield.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_340">I am sorry and concerned to hear about the problems with the proposed new school in Reddish. I am sure&#151;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope and expect&#151;that Stockport council will take note of the very important points raised by my hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend and the north Reddish action group. The calling-in of the executive decision by the scrutiny panel is an important sign, but it is clear from what my hon. Friend said that considerable additional questions need to be answered. However, I have to say that the organisation of schools in an area is essentially a matter for local decision. It is the local authority that has the statutory responsibility for planning school places and for proposing to close schools and to open new ones.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 805</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_341">It may be helpful if I say something now about the current arrangements under which the proposals for changes in Reddish have been published. Before the Government took office in 1997, proposals for changes to schools often came to the Secretary of State for decision. We considered that such matters were best decided locally, and a new system was put in place by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. That is still the basic legislation today, and the relevant provisions in the case that has been raised by my hon. Friend include the provision that before a local authority may close a school or open a new one, it must first consult in the local area. Among those whom we advise should be consulted are any schools affected by the proposals, and parents and teachers in the area. The guidance was revised in September, when local MPs were added to the list, as were local district and parish councils where the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;schools are situated. Although the consultation is not a referendum, and the authority is not bound by the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;results, it is required to take the results of the consultation into account in deciding whether or not to proceed with its proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_342">If the authority decides to proceed, it is required to publish its proposals in a newspaper circulating in the area, and the notice must give details of how people may object to the proposals or comment on them. Anyone may make representations in response to the notice, whether or not they are directly affected by the proposals. If there are no objections, authorities may decide their own proposals themselves, but if there are objections the proposals go to the local school organisation committee to decide.It is then for the committee to approve or reject the proposals. It may also modify them, after consulting interested parties, but not to the extent that they are effectively new&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proposals. Modifications are usually to the implementation date, at the request of those bringing forward the proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_343">The committee may approve proposals only if it is satisfied that any capital necessary to implement them has been secured. As my hon. Friend pointed out, in the case of this project the authority has been allocated &#163;2.2&nbsp;million in targeted capital funding to build a new school, which is the total amount for which the authority bid&#151;so the Government have played their role in ensuring that new provision in the area is properly funded. Separate funding is also available for a children&#039;s centre. The total cost of the project is expected to be some &#163;5.5&nbsp;million, with the authority providing the balance. While the facilities to be provided are a matter for the local authority, we encourage the provision of enhanced facilities, suitable for the 21st century and a range of uses. It is in order to develop such facilities that we are investing record amounts in school capital and ensuring that developments are linked with extended service provision for children and child care.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_344">I shall continue with the process. If the committee cannot agree unanimously, the proposals are referred to the independent schools adjudicator for decision. The adjudicator&#039;s decision is final, subject to the normal operation of the law, for example, as regards judicial review. Since September 1999, Ministers have not been involved in such decisions. The proposals in Reddish will be decided under that system.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 806</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_345">The local authority cannot just close the schools in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reddish and build a new one. I understand that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consultation took place in the summer and that statutory proposals have been published in respect of the changes. I believe that the representation period will end in mid-November and that the school organisation committee is planned to meet to decide the proposals in December. I hear the concerns of my hon. Friend about the extent to which he has been involved in that consultation, and he has clearly shown his ability to represent his constituents. It is crucial that he and other members of the public are fully involved in the consultation on the proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_346">In deciding the proposals, the committee will be required to decide the issue on its merits, taking into account all relevant factors and the Secretary of State&#039;s statutory guidance on proposals to open and close schools. Among the factors that the committee will need to consider are whether the proposals will improve the standards, quality, range and/or diversity of educational provision in the area; whether the proposals represent a cost-effective use of public funds; whether the sale proceeds of redundant sites are to be made available and whether the Secretary of State&#039;s consent has been obtained where necessary; the views of parents and other local residents, including those who may be particularly affected by the proposals or who have a particular interest in them; the length and nature of the journey to the alternative provision; the extent to which the proposals take account of the needs of families and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wider community and promote community cohesion; and the overall effect of a closure on the local community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_347">My hon. Friend has made it clear that views about these proposals are mixed, to put it mildly. He has also made clear his concerns about the safety of the landfill site and about the scale of the capital receipts from the sale of the Fir Tree site. Although those are not matters for which I have policy responsibility as a Minister in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Department for Education and Skills, they are nevertheless very important in the consideration of the proposals, as he pointed out. If a school is to be built on a landfill site, that site must have a planning use class order that permits educational use. That is a local planning authority responsibility, but it is obviously very important, as my hon. Friend has spelled out, that suitable consultation has taken place with the public and other relevant agencies and that there is certainty and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reassurance for his constituents that the site is appropriate. I welcome his information that further investigations may take place&#151;it certainty sounds as though that would be important&#151;and I am sure that he will continue to seek local reassurance about the nature of that site or any other site for the provision of a new school for his constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_348">On capital receipts, the value of land is, of course, very much dependent on whether it can be developed, but my hon. Friend has drawn on some important evidence about the value of similar pieces of land in surrounding areas. It is true that an acre of land with planning consent for housing development can fetch up to &#163;1&nbsp;million. Again, although I have no direct ministerial responsibility for such matters, I understand that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister sets very strict rules to ensure that local authorities only sell land for the full market value&#151;if local authorities want to sell below 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 807</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that value, they need the ODPM&#039;s consent. Of course, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;share my hon. Friend&#039;s concern that, notwithstanding the considerable increases in school capital, value for money in asset sales must also be an important consideration for Stockport in developing such proposals. Hon. Members will also be aware that the Secretary of State&#039;s permission would be required for the disposal of any land used as school playing fields.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_349">Let me return to the procedures for the statutory proposals to close North Reddish infant and junior schools and Fir Tree school and build a new school on the Harcourt street site. As I said, if the school organisation committee cannot decide on the proposals unanimously, they will go to the adjudicator for a decision. The adjudicator would consider the proposals afresh, but would also be required to take into account the result of the consultation, any objections or comments made and the Secretary of State&#039;s statutory guidance on the factors that must be taken into account. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 808</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>As I have spelled out, those factors include the views of local people and the cost-effectiveness of the proposals. My hon. Friend raised concerns about those matters in his speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51101-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_350">Although I know that I have not been able to satisfy all my hon. Friend&#039;s concerns, I hope that I have spelled out the process in which I strongly anticipate that he will be involved. I expect that he will be able to represent his constituents&#039; views throughout the local decision-making process. Given his record up to now, I have no doubt that he will continue his important work to ensure not only that his constituents continue to benefit from increased school investment, but that local plans are carried forward in a way that both involves and reassures his constituents.
