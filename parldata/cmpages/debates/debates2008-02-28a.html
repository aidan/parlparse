 My Department is working closely with business to communicate the Government&#146;s regulatory reform programme. The Government have introduced two common commencement dates for regulations. In October last year, 200,000 businesses received simple guidance to support the changes coming in on the common commencement date. On 6 April this year, we plan to reach 1 million businesses with user-friendly summaries.</p>

 With my business background, I share my hon. Friend&#146;s aspirations in that field, but has he seen the recent press release from the Scottish Chambers of Commerce highlighting that the cost of regulation to business in Scotland has risen by &#163;600 million to &#163;4.2 billion in the past year, despite the Government&#146;s better regulation agenda and the Department&#146;s simplification plans? Does he agree that what we need is better regulation, not more regulation?</p>

 We take the better regulation agenda very seriously. That is why we published the simplification plans, which detail some 700 measures across 19 Departments and agencies that will save some &#163;3.5 billion by 2010. Some of the regulations detailed in the Chambers of Commerce burdens barometer report, from which I think he was reading, have significant benefits for the public, including the working time regulations as well as regulations on the child trust fund, disabled access to transport and so on. We take the business burden very seriously. That is why we produced the simplification plans and are acting in Europe on that agenda.</p>

 Low-tax, high-enterprise economies, particularly those in the far east, are powering ahead because the burden of Government regulation there is low and decreasing.

 In a globalised economy, we keep a close eye on regulatory regimes around the world. That is why the UK Government are leading the debate in Europe on better regulation and have been instrumental in the European Union&#146;s adoption of a target to reduce the administrative burdens on business resulting from EU legislation. We are conscious of the fact that it is not just a UK agenda but an international one.</p>

 Staffordshire trading standards has a brilliant scheme whereby it trains volunteer watchdogs to protect their local communities. One small sign of its success is that it was a volunteer who raised the following issue with me. Has the Department noticed the incidence of foreign fraudsters using website addresses that end in &#147;.co.uk&#148;, which misleads innocent dupes in the UK into thinking that they are trading with someone in this country, and are therefore protected by this country&#146;s laws?

 We have no plans at present to introduce mandatory social tariffs, but as the Secretary of State has said, we do not rule it out, should it become necessary. In our energy White Paper, we made it clear that energy suppliers should put in place social programmes to help the most vulnerable. Energy suppliers have responded by increasing the value of their programmes from &#163;40 million to &#163;56 million this winter, benefiting some 700,000 households and taking an estimated 70,000 out of fuel poverty. I recently had a meeting with all six major supply companies, which the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs attended because of his Department&#146;s concern about fuel poverty.</p>

 Is the Minister aware that the criteria that Powergen uses for its &#147;stay warm&#148; social tariff have recently been changed, with the result that many consumers are paying increased prices? The company spends &#163;4.4 million a year on that social tariff, yet it spends &#163;32 million a year sponsoring the FA cup. Does the Minister think that that is a good use of priorities, and of the profits that the company makes?</p>

 I am not going to attack a great working-class game, and make comparisons with football. As we made clear at our recent meeting, we welcome the social programmes and tariffs that are in place. Given rising public and parliamentary concern about energy prices we feel that all the supply companies have an obligation to do more for the most vulnerable, but of course the Government also play their part. Indeed, since 2000, the Government have spent some &#163;20 billion on fuel poverty measures, benefits and programmes of different kinds. However, there is a role for private companies, too.</p>

 The measures that the Government have already taken are important, but if we are genuinely to protect vulnerable groups, perhaps the biggest single thing to do now is to stop the energy companies&#151;the big six to which he spoke, which have been accused directly of collusion and price fixing&#151;effectively robbing the consumer. Is not reference to the competition authorities important, so that the public, and vulnerable groups in particular, know that they are not being ripped off and robbed by those energy companies?</p>

 All the independent analysis shows that we have the most competitive energy market in the European Union, and I can verify that through independent reports. However, I understand the public concern. Ofgem has announced that it will conduct an inquiry into the competitive market to make sure that it is functioning well. It is not complacent, and neither are we. If there is evidence of collusion, it should be presented to the regulator. The companies meet to discuss a range of issues, and I sometimes join those meetings, as does the Secretary of State. I do not feel that there is any evidence of collusion, but, if there is, it should be taken to the regulator.</p>

 Having just come from the Committee considering the Energy Bill, I like the idea of the Report stage almost being upon us. I only wish that were the case, as I listen to my speeches in Committee. Of course I recognise that there is widespread support in the House for greater action on social tariffs. My concern is to persuade the supply companies to move forward voluntarily. We are making progress, but there is more to do. There is a concern that if we mandated social tariffs, that might be the end of the matter: the companies would do that but no more. There would be no grounds for innovation, and that could be the downside of a mandatory approach.</p>

 I assure the hon. Gentleman that there will be a full and proper consultation process on closures. One inescapable fact must be addressed by all of us in the House&#151;that the Post Office is losing business. It has lost 4 million customers a week, and we must recognise that. It has lost that business partly because of the internet and people doing their business online, and partly because the Post Office itself lost business&#151;for example, in relation to TV licences from the BBC.

If they close, it will have a devastating effect on the rural economy.</p>

 All I can say to the hon.

Decent employers recognise that there has been abuse and they want to work with us to tackle it. It does the UK no favours to be accused of not tackling such abuses. The simple choice for us is this: if we think that there is a problem, we should try to solve it. We think that there is a problem, but the directive has to be right before the UK can sign up to it.</p>

 It is, of course, a crucial technology, but it is in its infancy.

 Notwithstanding the fact that the Post Office got wrong the name of one of the postmistresses in my constituency whose post office is due to close, that same postmistress then applied to have a pay point in the post office when it is removed, but the Post Office has said that it will remove all compensation from that post office if it acts within a year.

 I do not think it is correct to say that Post Office Ltd is removing all compensation from people in those circumstances. The Select Committee discussed the matter when compiling its recent report, and the general secretary of the National Federation of SubPostmasters said he thought it quite right for the taxpayer not to compensate sub-postmasters for business that they were not actually losing because they would replace it the day after closure. There is an adjustment in the compensation to take that into account, but it is not the case that all compensation has been removed.</p>

The procedure motion had a considerable amount of debate and it is for the House to go through the Bill, as it has done, day in, day out. We are three quarters of the way through the Committee stage, on day eight. There will be further debate, as the House will have heard, next week. It is for hon.

That has put a time scale on the Bill and added to the consideration of how it is handled not just in this place, but in the House of Lords. She mentioned the withdrawal of the two clauses on prostitution. She will know that we are engaging in what will be a six-month review into how we deal with the demand side of prostitution. It will not be a bad thing to look at how we deal with prostitution of a piece when we have considered the review of how we tackle the demand side of human trafficking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="80228-0004.htm_para27"><a name="08022876000206">The right hon. Lady mentioned post office closures, and she will no doubt have heard some of the discussions during topical questions to Ministers from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. She will know that there are about 14,000 post offices in this country and that there has been a drop in use of post offices because, for example, of the loss of the contract for television licences, because more people are choosing to get their tax discs on line and because more people are opting to have pensions or other benefit payments made by direct debit. Fewer people are using the post office and, therefore, there has been an increase in the taxpayer subsidy. She knows that the framework has been agreed and that up to 2,500 of the 14,000 post offices will be closed. There is the question of which post offices will be closed, and, as my hon. Friends said during Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform questions, there will be a consultation on which post offices are put forward for closure. It is important that that consultation is realistic and that it examines the individual circumstances of each post office, including the deprivation of the local area, transport to nearby post offices and the usage of the post office in question.</p>

I will add unfunded commitments on post offices, which I will report to my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, to the unfunded commitments on defence and health. Those unfunded promises are matched only by the promised tax cuts, and they do not add up.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raised the question of the consideration of amendments to the European Union (Amendment) Bill. As he knows, the tabling of amendments is a matter for individual Members and the selection of amendments is a matter for the Speaker. I do not want to trespass on the Speaker&#146;s territory, but I would assume that tabling an amendment that is about our leaving the European Union to a Bill that is about the Lisbon treaty would not be in order, as it would not be within the Bill&#146;s scope.

The House decided unanimously to refer the question of Members&#146; allowances to the Members Estimate Committee, which the Speaker chairs. Under its remit from the House, that Committee has been taking forward its review and on 25 February published how it will make progress. The Committee has invited all Members who wish to do so to give evidence, and it states that it will consider not just a root-and-branch review of the structure of allowances and reimbursements, but how there can be proper checks and auditing of claims made under the new process.

 I think that editorial decisions about news coverage of what goes on in the House are a matter for the broadcasters themselves. I think that we would all like more coverage of the House so that people outside can understand the work going on in Parliament, but in that respect, it is important for us to ensure that we debate things in a way that is not arcane and technical, but which not only contributes to the discussion but is understandable outside the House. I, for one, would suggest that we ban the word &#147;passerelles&#148;, but that is a personal view.</p>

 As I understand it, there is no constituency where it is proposed that every single post office should be closed. The notion suggested by the hon. Gentleman that some Members will find all their post offices closed, while others will find that all theirs have been kept open, is not correct. If there is a consultation about which post offices will close and which will stay open, it cannot be right to say that Members of Parliament who are also Ministers cannot represent the views of their constituents on how post offices in their constituencies are configured. Hon. Members can well understand that it is perfectly possible to agree to a situation where, of some 14,000 post offices, about 2,000 will be closed, and that there must be a consultation about which should be closed. To ban Members of Parliament from being involved in that consultation because they are Ministers would be completely wrong.</p>

We have not had any for a number of weeks, for one reason or another: for example, pressure on Government business time by Northern Rock and the fact that I took a view on the need to discuss Members&#146; pay at length.

 Before I begin my contribution, I should like to pay tribute to my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), for the work that he did, not only as Secretary of State for Wales, but as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Many people&#146;s lives in our country have improved because of his work.</p>

It is in fact the feast day of  St. Llibio, a sixth-century hermit from the island of Anglesey. Nevertheless, we can say that we are almost on the eve of St. David&#146;s day. Just a few moments ago, a large number of Members of both Houses were privileged to attend the St. David&#146;s day service at  St. Mary&#146;s Undercroft. I pay tribute to all those who organised the service, and particular tribute to the two schools who sang at the service&#151;the London Welsh school and the Welsh school from Abercarn. It was an excellent start to our deliberations on Welsh matters.</p>

It gives us an opportunity to debate and deliberate, and to celebrate our country. We have had a Welsh day debate since 1944, when the then Member for Ebbw Vale, Aneurin Bevan, addressed the House. It was in 2002 when I last spoke as Secretary of State in a similar debate, almost six years ago to the day. I reread my speech&#151;I do not do that often, to be perfectly honest&#151;and what struck me was that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies), made his maiden speech on that day, and I welcomed him to the House. Who would have thought that, six years later, he would wind up the St. David&#146;s day debate in the Chamber?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="80228-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08022876000295">I also reflected on what has happened in Wales in the six years between my leaving office and returning to it. Of course, we could talk, as we do in Welsh questions and on other occasions, about improvements to our public services&#151;to the health service and education&#151;and about the environment and local government. Those are largely now issues for the National Assembly for Wales. However, as the House of Commons determines the Assembly&#146;s finances, as Parliament must do, we, too, play our part in ensuring that our hospitals, schools and public services generally in Wales improve.</p>

 Of course I share the concern that if schools are not performing, they should improve. There is always room for improvement, but as I said yesterday in the House in reply to the shadow Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan), if one looks at the overall picture for education, and particularly for schools in Wales, standards in our schools have risen, certainly in my constituency. School buildings have improved and class sizes have reduced. Every Member who represents a Welsh constituency will have a good tale to tell. That does not in any way mean that we can be complacent. We have to look seriously at the inspector&#146;s report. That, of course, is ultimately a matter for Jane Hutt, the Minister for Education, Culture and Young People in Wales. I am sure that she will take any remedial action that is necessary. However, it is a devolved issue. </p>

There is no question but that in the past decade, an enormous amount of public money has gone into our services in Wales. That was possible because of a strong economy, which has been handled well, and because of low mortgage and interest rates. The effect of that, as every constituency Member of Parliament can say, is that there are many more people in work than there were a decade ago. Unemployment rates have fallen dramatically in every single constituency, and there are 130,000 more people in work than there were just over a decade ago. That is a good story for our people. It is against that background that we have had the money to give the Welsh Assembly to improve our services.</p>

She laughed and said, &#147;We&#146;ll see what we can do.&#148; Nothing has come to Wales.</p>

One of the things that I am concerned about is the way we market Wales, particularly as we are getting the Ryder cup in Wales and the Ashes match at the Sophia Gardens ground. We have a fabulous stadium and we have a world-beating rugby team. How will we market Wales as a wonderful venue for sport?

Thousands, too, worked in the steel industry. The hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Davies) will know how his constituency was dominated by steel. When I worked in Ebbw Vale for 17 years, virtually everybody, one way or another, was connected with the steel industry. But how that has changed. First, it changed to heavy engineering, a lot of which has gone too. In its place we now have lighter, more skilled jobs, and in our rural areas, very often tourism has replaced agriculture as the main employer. There have been enormous changes in the way in which people earn their living  in Wales.</p>

There is some doubt about that, not least because of the views that have been expressed on defence policy by Labour&#146;s partners in the Labour-Plaid coalition in the Assembly. I hope that he will reject their policies and give us the assurance we need that the project will go ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="80228-0008.htm_para2"><a name="08022876000360">Much has changed since we last celebrated St. David&#146;s day. Certainly, 2007 was a watershed year for Welsh politics. May&#146;s Assembly elections marked a fundamental shift in support away from Labour and, as I believe the Secretary of State agrees, marked a new chapter in the devolution process&#151;perhaps an unexpected chapter from the Labour party&#146;s perspective. Welsh Conservatives became the official Opposition, and our gains last May underline, I hope, our party&#146;s credentials as the only credible alternative to Labour. Not least, without wishing to rub in it in, last May represented Labour&#146;s worst electoral performance since 1918. On this St. David&#146;s day I, like the Secretary of State, look forward to the local elections in May&#151;and to a general election, if the Prime Minister, who seems to spend most of his time dithering, summons up his courage and manages to call one.</p>

I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank him for his courtesy and consideration to me throughout his tenure at the Wales Office and when I shadowed him on foreign affairs. He has always treated me with courtesy and respect&#151;behind the Chair, if not always on the Floor of the House. I wish him well, and I would like to put that on the record.</p>

He painted himself as a devo-realist and highlighted some of the problems that he has to deal with. I think he now realises that, far from diminishing, the work load at the Welsh Office has increased and is becoming increasingly complex. At the same time, the number of staff is increasing to support that increased work load. One could take the view that more work means that there is more activity, but this is not necessarily an improved deal for Wales&#151;it reveals a Government Department that is struggling to cope with a very complicated system that the Government themselves have created.</p>

specifically, Acts of the UK Parliament applying to England and Wales, subordinate legislation for Wales, and legislative competency orders&#151;I could go on. It is clear that the Government were not prepared for such a complicated system. We have struggled to get Welsh clauses drafted for Bills, Ministers have given confused and contradictory explanations of how the different processes should work, and legislation has been held up in Wales, in Westminster or sometimes in a bureaucratic black hole between the two institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="80228-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08022876000365">For me, it is crucial that an over-complex and unsatisfactory system set up by the Government does not damage the legislative process for Wales. That is why I have pushed repeatedly for protected time to discuss the Welsh provisions in Westminster Bills. I am glad that the Secretary of State and the Wales Office have now agreed on that, and I look forward to ensuring that legislation on Welsh matters, no matter what form it arrives in, is fully scrutinised and given the time that it deserves in this House. Let us face the truth&#151;this complicated legislative system was developed to bridge the gap between Labour MPs and Labour Assembly Members&#151;to try to pacify those holding increasingly divergent views and to fool those at both ends of the motorway, as was said in the debates on the original legislation to create the constitutional settlement. Nearly 10 years after the first devolutionary settlement in Wales, instead of getting on with the business of governing Wales we still have that constant pressure from internal politics and positioning, which I hope we will be able to put to rest at some stage. I still think that the right hon. Member for Neath was mistaken when he said that the Government of Wales Act 1998 settled the constitutional question for a generation, but we shall see.</p>

 It is precisely because this party is the party of the Union&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Hear, hear!&#148;] Hang on&#151;wait for it.

We share the view that when an issue can be best resolved locally, that is the course we should take. When, however, a UK-approach is needed, co-operation and collaboration should be the guiding principles. I am interested in working with the Secretary of State to see how we can improve our processes, so that Members are able to get accurate information at Government level on matters affecting their constituencies, without having to ask Assembly Members to table questions for them. There should be an open door in that case because there is a problem. Quite rightly, Members want to know what is happening in their constituencies, and if there are occasions when they are ruled out of order, or when there is no mechanism for them to do so, it is difficult.

I heard that the plans for the daily Welsh language paper <i> Y Byd</i>&#151;I hope the House will please forgive my pronunciation&#151;have been abandoned after receiving insufficient support. May I ask the Secretary of State what encouragement he has given to <i> Y Byd</i>? I met <i> Y Byd</i>&#146;s promoters at the Eisteddfod last year, and they were full of enthusiasm and hope.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. Perhaps it is apposite, therefore, to ask the Minister of State if he will comment on the matter when he makes his winding-up speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="80228-0008.htm_para13"><a name="08022876000383">Another important matter in Wales, which the Secretary of State did not touch on, is that of law and order. In my experience, during the past two years policing has become harder in Wales. We feel that police should be out on our streets in Wales doing what they joined the police force to do: fighting crime. Instead, we are finding that all four of our police forces are fighting red tape and bureaucracy. That is why this party has advanced policies to scrap stop-and-search forms, and would certainly reduce the bureaucracy that our serving police officers face every day.</p>

They have to use their cells to hold so many prisoners that even the Government are losing track of them. I do not know whether the Secretary of State is aware of this, but last month the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, the right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), had to write to me, informing me that he had provided me with incorrect figures on the number of prisoners who were being held in Welsh police stations. He corrected the figures, and had to revise the figure of prisoner nights upwards by 426. The total number of prisoners being held in custody cells last year in Wales was 4,200. That is a staggering increase, which puts unprecedented strain on police forces and budgets in Wales. I hope that the Secretary of State will make representations to his Cabinet colleague to consider this matter, because it has become such a burden that it is causing problems for many of our forces.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman knows that I was very vocal on that subject at the time. I thought it was a complete waste of resources, time and effort.

It remains a sad fact that there are no women&#146;s prisons in Wales, nor is there a prison in north Wales.

 The hon. Lady is pandering to my personal prejudices and views. There are too many women in prison, and that has a disproportionate effect because when a woman is locked up, the children are often deprived and put into care. We must be careful about our approach to women and criminality. When I examined the matter, I was pleased to visit some of the small prison units that were designed to ensure good educative processes as well as good rehabilitation facilities, which can be provided successfully in smaller units.

One of the perspectives that they communicated to us is that they do not have long enough to work with some of the girls and young women who pass through that prison, such as those serving sentences of four, six or eight weeks. It is not long enough to tackle some of the underlying emotional problems that drive their addictions and criminality.

 The hon. Lady paints a black picture of crime and justice in Wales. There are some good news stories, and she would realise that if she came to north Wales, especially north-west Wales, which has the highest detection rate in the United Kingdom. That is due to the extra investment in the police and in community support officers. Does she acknowledge that?</p>

 I was about to move on and cut out part of my speech because of the limited time available and the interventions that I have taken, but let me say that the hon.

The Assembly Government have introduced 252 NHS targets, and I have to ask whether that has improved health care. However, I want to draw attention to a positive matter. Jonathan Morgan, the shadow Minister for Health and Social Services in the Assembly, is moving towards securing the first Back-Bench measure of the Assembly Government. The mental health reform legislative competence order, which will provide specific patient rights in mental health care, has been laid with the Assembly&#146;s unanimous approval. I hope that that again shows the Secretary of State that Welsh Conservatives are leading the agenda, when they can, with practical policies for Wales, and I hope that he shares my wish that the measure reaches the statute book soon.</p>

Sadly, after 10 years of a Labour Government, I do not perceive matters through the same rose-tinted spectacles as the right hon. Gentleman because Wales remains the poorest area of the United Kingdom. The recent Joseph Rowntree Foundation report showed that no progress had been made on tackling child poverty in recent years. Worklessness and economic inactivity still blight too many communities in Wales. The figures that I mentioned in my intervention on the Secretary of State mean that many of our children still grow up in families where no one has ever worked. The decline in manufacturing has also badly affected the country.</p>

I hope that the Secretary of State will make time to visit that facility. Its headquarters is in my constituency in England, so I have a direct link with it. I was thrilled by its education project, which takes young people from schools into a laboratory to see how things work there. Unless we can enthuse people about maths, science, English and education generally, we will not have the skilled work force in Wales that we need to keep good companies of high worth with highly skilled jobs such as GE Healthcare.</p>

Economically and culturally, Wales has enjoyed a renaissance, after the grim decades of mass unemployment and business failure.

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80228-0009.htm_para13"><a name="08022876000422">One of the elements essential to Wales&#146;s success to date has been the huge real-terms rises in public investment, with the Welsh budget increasing to almost &#163;16 billion by 2011, some 130 per cent. higher in cash terms than in 1997. But that era is coming to an end. Britain has never had a period of such long and consistent steeply rising public spending. However, that cannot continue without unbalancing the economy, causing a return to the instability, high inflation and high interest rates that we inherited from the Conservatives and that plagued all British Governments for a generation and more. That is why the next comprehensive spending review period, from 2008 to 2011, will still see real-terms increases in public investment, but at a lower rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="80228-0009.htm_para14"><a name="08022876000423">That poses challenges for the Welsh Assembly Government, because their entire life has so far been spent under the umbrella of unparalleled real-terms budget increases. From now on, the kind of efficiency measures and reforms that Minister for Finance Andrew Davies is rightly insisting upon will be needed to reduce inefficiency and bureaucracy, and release funds significantly to improve front-line services. It will also be necessary to exercise much tougher choices over priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="80228-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08022876000424">Those who claim that the Government&#146;s public spending programme has inhibited the growth of the private sector are wrong. Huge public investment in private construction, for example, has stimulated it, while five times more Welsh private sector jobs have been created in the past 11 years than in the public sector. There are many other sectors in which Welsh businesses have themselves benefited and created Welsh jobs by providing services or selling products to the Welsh public sector on the back of rising spending since 1997. That is a stark contrast with the economic instability and public spending cuts experienced from 1979 to 1997, when huge numbers of Welsh businesses went bankrupt and unemployment soared.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="80228-0009.htm_para16"><a name="08022876000425">However, according to the Library, estimates show that public spending in Wales is equivalent to 59 per cent. of gross domestic product. The figure for Wales is higher than any other part of the UK except Northern Ireland, where it is 64 per cent., although the figure in north-east England is similar. The equivalent estimate for Scotland is about 50 per cent., while the UK average is about 44 per cent. Wales&#146;s ratio of public spending to GDP is broadly similar to, or perhaps slightly higher than, the highest ratio among OECD countries. In Wales, 23.7 per cent. of employees are in the public sector, compared with the UK average of 20.2 per cent. Again, that is similar to the figure for the north-east, but lower than the figure for Northern Ireland, at 29.1 per cent. All other areas of the UK have lower shares of public sector employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="80228-0009.htm_para17"><a name="08022876000426">Public spending is high partly to correct the legacy of historically high levels of relative deprivation, of sparsity, of geographic remoteness, and of the ill health that is a legacy of Wales&#146;s industrial heritage, especially mining. Moreover, our Government have, rightly, been deliberately moving public jobs from the overheated south-east to Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80228-0009.htm_para18"><a name="08022876000427">The argument that I make is therefore emphatically not for the cuts in public spending so beloved of the right, still less that the public sector in Wales is too big.  <br>

<notus-date day="28" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>28 Feb 2008 : Column 1276</b><br>
Indeed, I am arguing the exact opposite. The real issue is that the private sector is too small. If both Welsh living standards and the economic competitiveness that underpins our prosperity are to grow as we all want, the private sector needs to grow significantly and at a relatively much faster rate. To achieve at least equilibrium with the rest of the UK and the OECD countries, Wales must move towards a private sector of around 55 per cent. of Welsh GDP. To achieve that in the next 15 to 20 years, we will need year-on-year growth that is around 1 per cent. faster than the UK average&#151;no mean feat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80228-0009.htm_para19"><a name="08022876000428">It is no good simply leaving the task of catch-up to market forces and the private sector, as the right insists. They have a critical role to play, of course, but so does the Government in London and Cardiff, by targeting public investment not only on the &#147;soft&#148; side of public spending&#151;that is, on care and services&#151;but on the &#147;sharp&#148; side, on skills, infrastructure, technology, research and entrepreneurialism. At the height of the industrial revolution 150 years ago, Wales had in Merthyr Tydfil what was considered the most technologically advanced town on the planet, with the most productive ironworks in the world and the development of the first rail engine. We now need new Merthyrs for this century, leading the way in the new technologies of the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="80228-0009.htm_para20"><a name="08022876000429">Although we need higher labour productivity, Wales cannot and should not try to compete on cheaper labour costs, with China and India, for example, paying manufacturing workers just 60p an hour. As Rhodri Morgan has so eloquently said&#151;and as the Secretary of State repeated&#151;the Wales of the future will be a &#147;small but clever country&#148;, with private sector growth in the right areas, and raised levels of educational attainment, skills and innovation to add value. At present, although Welsh spending on research and development is rising, it remains too low, and this must be addressed urgently, with ever closer partnership between&#151;and ever more targeted spending by&#151;the Governments at Westminster and Cardiff, our universities, colleges and Welsh businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="80228-0009.htm_para21"><a name="08022876000430">Our vision is for a Wales that acts as a centre where companies can innovate in partnership with our educational institutions. I identify seven immediate priorities. First, we must secure graduate retention, develop technical skills and inspire entrepreneurship from school upwards. Secondly, we must make tough public spending decisions, with a moratorium on handouts and a switch to supporting greater competitiveness. Thirdly, we must compete in the high added-value areas such as financial services, electronics, nanotechnology, biosciences, molecular mechanics and information and communications technology, with many more start-ups and high-tech businesses. Fourthly, we must support vital new energies, including renewables and biofuels. Fifthly, we need to support our economy with a welfare system that gets people off benefit and into work, and provides our work force with the skills that they need to progress in employment. Sixthly, we need to ensure that we have a political, economic and social culture in Wales that is truly internationalist. Finally, we need smarter government, local and national, with a more dynamic Welsh public service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="80228-0009.htm_para22"><a name="08022876000431">Universities need to be at the heart of our economic growth.

The Government are moving forward with a feasibility study into the potential for a barrage across the Severn estuary that would generate fully 5 per cent. of UK electricity needs. It would be the biggest renewable energy project by some distance on our island, creating tens of thousands jobs, first in construction, then permanently.</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way, and I should like to praise him on his time in the Wales Office. There is a meeting on wind power tomorrow evening in Trefeglwys, one of my local communities. Does he agree that it is important to take local considerations into account and that, if there are strong feelings either for or against a wind construction in a local community, they should be taken into account in the planning process? In the past, the feelings of the community have not been considered in that way.</p>

 I welcome my right hon. Friend&#146;s remarks about the Severn tidal barrage. Is he aware that, should the Government decide, after the two-year feasibility study, to proceed with the project, it will almost certainly come to my constituency? Coupled with the recent announcement on the defence training academy, we could acquire  &#163;36 billion of investment in the Vale of Glamorgan  as a result.</p>

The Governments in Westminster and Cardiff should work together to develop innovative carbon capture and storage procedures, as well as ensuring that we have clean coal power stations and realising the enormous benefits that could be gained by exporting to countries such as India and China.</p>

We need to move tens of thousands more people off benefits and into work, tailoring support to their needs. Opportunities should be maximised by Jobcentre Plus in Wales and by the Welsh Assembly Government to match European convergence funding and to create many more new skills and job preparation schemes in west Wales and the valleys.</p>

When I say that the majority of people on incapacity benefit could work, and should work, it is not an attack on them. It is an attack on an outdated system that deprives them of the opportunity to share in the rewards of work that go far beyond financial independence, important though that is. Work is inherently good for people of all ages. It is good for their health, good for families and good for communities.</p>

Using all our institutions and talents, we must make the most of new skills, new technologies and new opportunities. We must re-prioritise our public spending to prioritise sharp rather than soft services, favouring skills, technological innovation and business support rather than free schemes. We must also rapidly grow the private sector so that it overtakes the public sector in size and creates a vibrant, more balanced economy and an even brighter, stronger future for a Wales that is reaching up to be genuinely world class.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to debate Welsh issues in this Chamber&#151;an opportunity that we too rarely have. May I also say what a pleasure it is to follow the right hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) and to put on the record my appreciation of his helpful co-operation with me when he was in office. Today, he has demonstrated his great knowledge not only of the Welsh scene and the opportunities available to Wales and Welsh people, but of the potential impediments to the necessary developments. He is very realistic in his assessment, but he is nearly always optimistic for Wales&#151;an approach that I greatly appreciate. The right hon. Gentleman will also be remembered for taking the devolution settlement in the right direction&#151;perhaps not at the pace that some of us wanted, but certainly in the right direction. He will be well remembered for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80228-0010.htm_para6"><a name="08022876000450">I should also like to put on the record how much I and other hon. Members enjoyed the service in St. Mary Undercroft.

I would also like to reflect a little on the homily preached by the archdeacon by saying how apt it is to celebrate the life of St. David and, indeed, to celebrate the Welsh nation on that special day. We should not be niggardly or parsimonious in our celebrations; we should be truly generous in pointing out that nationality is not just for our benefit, but something to share with others, including the United Kingdom and, indeed, farther and greater reaches across the world.</p>

He has served in various positions in government with great distinction. I must, however, raise some concerns about his role. I have no doubt whatever that the Secretary of State will work with colleagues in Westminster and Cardiff on transferring legislative competence to the Assembly, but I expect Wales&#146;s representative in the Cabinet to be passionate about devolution and committed to extending the Assembly&#146;s role. The Secretary of State&#146;s views on devolution, however, are on the record and I find it difficult to believe that he will be able to reconcile his past comments with the changes that Liberal Democrats  <br>

feel are necessary. The Government must do away with the halfway house that they have created, whereby Assembly Members have to come begging cap in hand for the power to make their own laws.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80228-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08022876000452">The Secretary of State has been keen to shake off his tag of being a devo-sceptic and prefers to call himself a devo-realist; well, here is a dose of realism for him. In the 10 years since Wales has had the Assembly a great deal has been achieved, often on a cross-party basis. Wales has rejected Labour&#146;s regressive top-up fee regime and has made bus travel free for the over-60s and the disabled. The Assembly has also made health spending a priority and has introduced a vital scheme to help Wales&#146;s post offices stay sustainable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="80228-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08022876000453">There are still many areas where the Assembly should be making decisions but cannot. For instance, Wales should be able to take a lead on combating climate change by developing its own immense natural resources of wave and wind power in order to provide clean renewable energy and by encouraging energy efficiency through setting better building standards and introducing smart metering. On large-scale energy projects, however, including new nuclear build, decisions still lie with the UK Government, not in Wales. Building regulations are also a reserved matter. It is frustrating because, with the right tools, Wales could become a Mecca for green energy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="80228-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08022876000454">As a realist, the Secretary of State should recognise that if the new devolution settlement works at the moment, it is built on shifting sands. There is a progressive consensus in Wales, but to protect it, the Secretary of State would do well to keep his eyes on what happens in Westminster.</p>

 I always listen very carefully to what the hon. Gentleman has to say and I know that he is a committed European.

 My hon. Friend mentions the environmental agenda. Does he agree that one disappointing aspect of the Secretary of State&#146;s otherwise excellent speech was a failure to prioritise the environmental opportunities for Wales? Our mutual friend, Mick Bates, Welsh Assembly Member for Montgomeryshire, and others have made it absolutely clear that by building on the Centre for Alternative Technology, the Cardigan Bay project, the Severn barrage and so on, Wales could become an environmental leader in Europe, consistent with being in the UK. The potential is absolutely enormous, particularly if the Government and the Welsh Assembly Government, working in tandem with the private sector, give the necessary lead.</p>

 Does not the piece of information that my hon. Friend has managed to tease out merely confound our understanding even further? I know that Plaid Cymru would like a change in the Barnett formula, but on not a single occasion have I heard a single Welsh Minister express agreement with that. Perhaps when the Under-Secretary of State winds up the debate he will tell us whether or not Welsh Ministers support their Welsh Labour colleagues, who presumably want the formula to be changed.</p>

 No doubt the Under-Secretary of State will devote a large proportion of his speech to the Barnett formula.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="80228-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08022876000494">Because of the geography and demography of Wales, its public services are more expensive to deliver. As a number of Members have pointed out, the country still suffers from a legacy of ill health stemming from its industrial past. The position is simple: Wales has greater needs, and they will continue to be ignored and neglected for as long as the Government continue to use the discredited Barnett formula. It has short-changed Wales for ages, as even its creator Lord Barnett now recognises. We must draw a line under that old, backward-looking funding system, and look forward to a progressive and fair system that takes account of the needs of Wales. In fact, I believe that the Prime Minister is already turning his back on the Barnett formula. The Big Lottery Fund now uses a needs-based formula to distribute grants, which gives Wales a much higher level of funding.</p>

 Absolutely. Then people would know that the system was fair, and not an arbitrary process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80228-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08022876000507">Welsh questions yesterday focused on cross-border health issues, which affect many of us on both sides of Offa&#146;s Dyke. We need to ensure not just that we have high-quality health care in Wales, but that our constituents can have treatment that is convenient for them. I greatly appreciated the Secretary of State&#146;s response yesterday, when I raised several cases with him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="80228-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08022876000508">We need to work closely with English hospitals. They rely on Welsh patients for sustainability, and if we work together we can safeguard services for people in rural areas on both sides of the border. Given that 14 per cent. of elective surgery in Hereford is performed on Welsh patients, we must work together to keep English border hospitals open and ensure that a service is provided for everyone. As I think will be clear from my earlier remarks, I am a passionate devolutionist, but that does not mean that we cannot co-operate for the good of our local communities. My Liberal Democrat colleagues in the Assembly have secured a debate on this important matter which will take place next week, and I hope that all parties both here and in Cardiff will work together to ensure that those vital cross-border health services are maintained.</p>

In such areas, post offices are much more than places where people can buy stamps. They provide a social service, and perform an important function in the community. I am particularly worried about possible closures of post offices that are also shops. In such cases, when the post office closes the community loses the shop as well.</p>

process of setting an arbitrary figure for closures and then working out which post offices should be included in it. Given the rural nature of much of Wales, I should like to be reassured that we will not face more than our fair share of closures because of the nature of the closure programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80228-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08022876000511">I asked the Prime Minister about the possibility of a moratorium on post office closures so that local communities could use the powers in the Sustainable Communities Act 2007. The Act applies only to England, but there are other powers in the strategy developed by the Assembly Government. Those powers must be given time to work. People are fed up with being told what to do by bureaucrats sitting hundreds of miles away. The Government supported the new powers; if they really support local decision making, why do they not put their money where their mouth is and let the people decide?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="80228-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08022876000512">Those same communities have also suffered badly in the past year from foot and mouth and bluetongue outbreaks. On foot and mouth, farmers will receive compensation from the Assembly Government, but the Assembly should receive compensation from the Westminster Government because it was an establishment licensed by DEFRA that allowed the outbreak in the first place.</p>

Poverty is still a big issue in Wales, which still has the highest percentage of UK pensioners living in poverty. This is a scandalous problem that can be tackled only by giving pensioners a citizen&#146;s pension, access to free personal care and a system of benefits that properly reflects the rising cost of fuel.</p>

In chairing the British-Irish Council and the Cabinet committee on the English regions, he has a pivotal role in bringing together and making sense of the hitherto asymmetrical and fragmented devolution across the UK.</p>

We continue to scrutinise the Secretary of State and the Wales Office and we look forward to him coming before us in the next month or so for that purpose. Through a series of inquiries, we scrutinise various Government Departments in respect of their policies as they affect Wales. Our major inquiry on globalisation and its impact on Wales, and our forthcoming cross-border inquiry focusing on health, education and transport will no doubt result in UK and Welsh Ministers appearing before us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="80228-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08022876000525">This is our principal preoccupation: an examination of how Wales relates to the rest of the UK and the rest of the world.

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80228-0011.htm_para28"><a name="08022876000543">The Secretary of State mentioned so-called second-class Members of Parliament. I believe that he is a Unionist and that his views and mine on the importance of Wales remaining an integral part of the United Kingdom are probably very close. However, I cannot see how it is possible to continue with the current arrangements whereby Welsh and Scottish Members vote on matters on which they do not have direct representation&#151;they vote on the health service, education and local government in England. As a Unionist, surely the Secretary of State recognises that that is bound to cause enormous tension and is likely to lead to the further break-up and disintegration of the United Kingdom. Preventing Members of Parliament from voting on matters that affect other nations within the United Kingdom will give strength to the Union, which most Government Members and all Conservative Members support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80228-0011.htm_para29"><a name="08022876000544">One of the first challenges created by this Government was the change to the funding formula for local authorities, which has left some local authorities much worse off. The changes were subtle, but the new formula for local government, which was set up by the Welsh Assembly, has channelled money away from rural local authorities into more urban ones. The methods were subtle but, for example, the weighting accorded to sparsity in the previous formula has been significantly reduced, and the manner in which sparsity is calculated has also been changed. Instead of considering how close a settlement is to the largest major town, the distance is calculated not by road but as the crow flies, which is disadvantageous in an area with lots of valleys.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="80228-0011.htm_para30"><a name="08022876000545">The formula has also altered the emphasis placed on the number of elderly people in an area. Previously, the number of elderly people was accorded a large weighting, which is right because, unfortunately, as we get older we become more likely to require the services of our local authority. Any formula that does not give significant weighting to local authorities with large numbers of elderly people will be fundamentally flawed. Monmouthshire has many retired people, so we are suffering the effects of that. There is also a fundamental fault in the method used for calculating deprivation. It is arguable whether deprivation should be a factor in deciding how much money local authorities have, but if that is the case&#151;and if it is given the emphasis that it is currently given&#151;the method for calculating deprivation must be seen to be fair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80228-0012.htm_para0"><a name="08022876000546">I believe that the fairest way is to look at the average household incomes of people in a given local authority area. This formula looks at how many people are claiming various different benefits. That is grossly unfair on places such as Monmouthshire, which has a high number of people working for low wages, often in tourism, as has been mentioned, or in agriculture, where many people might be earning less than the minimum wage. Yet under the local government funding formula, they are not calculated as being deprived in any way, even though they clearly are. Monmouthshire is not the great affluent place that many people think it is. In fact, the local authority area has two of the most deprived wards in Wales, and when I last checked, the average household income was only just over the average for the whole of Wales. I hope that this is one of the first issues the Secretary of State will tackle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80228-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08022876000547">I also hope the Secretary of State will look at the planning laws, and that when he does so he will look at the planning authorities. There was a recent article in the<i>  Western Mail</i> about the failings of the Brecon Beacons national park and, although I do not think that any politicians were quoted in the piece, in my experience the park has certainly been very slack indeed in replying to letters and it takes an arrogant and high-handed view towards Members who wish to question it about its planning policies.</p>

<p><a name="st_o307"><a name="08022876000548"><a name="80228-0012.htm_spnew0"><a name="08022876001270"><b>Mr. Crabb:</b>
 My hon. Friend is making an important point on national parks. Does he agree that one way to help them raise their game might be for them to become a little more democratic by having a proportion of their members directly elected by people living in the national park area?</p>

<p><a name="st_o308"><a name="08022876000549"><a name="80228-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="08022876001271"><b>David T.C. Davies:</b>
 I agree with my hon. Friend. That is an excellent idea, and I hope we might look into it&#151;perhaps the Secretary of State will take it up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80228-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08022876000550">The health service has been mentioned. I realise that the Secretary of State does not have any direct control over the health service, although I rather wish he did as I think he would do a much better job than any of the Welsh Assembly Members who currently have influence in that area. If he talks to the Health Minister in the Welsh Assembly Government, I hope he will take the opportunity to raise the issue of Tarceva. A constituent of mine has terminal lung cancer. If he lived in Scotland, or even in parts of England, he would be eligible to receive the anti-cancer drug Tarceva. I am told that, because of a discount given by Roche, it would be no more expensive to offer that than to offer some of the existing treatments, yet he has been turned down simply because of his postcode&#151;simply because he lives in Wales. Surely the Secretary of State agrees that that is completely unacceptable?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80228-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08022876000551">I hope that the Secretary of State will forgive me, but I will not be present for the wind-ups as I have a long-standing engagement with the Royal British Legion tonight, at which I shall talk about the military covenant. The armed forces are not a devolved matter, but I am sure he will take an interest in them in his role. In particular, I hope he will look at the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers, who are based in the town of Monmouth. A number of people from that fine regiment have been sent to Iraq to help with the rebuilding of that country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80228-0012.htm_para4"><a name="08022876000552">I know that Members have different views about whether it was a good thing to go into Iraq. Regardless of that, I think we all respect those who have put on a uniform and decided to serve their country in whatever capacity they are asked, and I should add that most of the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers officers are involved in rebuilding work, and they are doing a fine job. What is most outstanding about them is that they are all Territorial Army soldiers; they are not full-time soldiers, but civilians who leave their homes and families for six months to do this. Yet despite that enormous contribution, the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers have been told that they can no longer recruit because of a cut to the TA funding budget across the whole of the United Kingdom. At a time when we have soldiers fighting a war on two fronts&#151;in Afghanistan and in Iraq&#151;and it appears that more Welsh soldiers might be asked to put their lives on the line in the former Yugoslavia, it is unfair that the Government are reducing funds to the TA. It is also worrying that it is difficult for a constituency Member to raise these matters directly with commanding officers as they are told not to discuss matters directly with Members of Parliament&#151;in order to do that, they have to refer back to the Ministry of Defence and get all sorts of permissions, which can take a long time.</p>

 I have just had the privilege of spending some time in Afghanistan, and the armed forces there told me that there is a shortage of engineers in Afghanistan, not only for reconstruction but for dealing with improvised explosive devices.

 Well, I certainly would not increase them; that is a straight answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80228-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08022876000558">There has recently been much discussion of policing in this Chamber. The Flanagan report, which I hope will be implemented, has made many useful and worthwhile proposals that will get rid of some of the paperwork that police officers currently face. We do not have the same problems in Wales as inner-city London has, but we nevertheless have significant problems of disorder and antisocial behaviour, even in some of the market towns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80228-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08022876000559">One such town is Abergavenny, which is not the sort of place one would expect large-scale disorder. Yet young people have come to me and said that other young people are making it impossible for them to walk  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="28 Feb 2008">

<notus-date day="28" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>28 Feb 2008 : Column 1292</b><br>
the streets of Abergavenny in the evenings, and particularly at weekends. If the Secretary of State is ever passing through, I will be happy to show him the problems there. When I went out with the police in Abergavenny, I saw groups of 50 to 100 youngsters gathering on Cross street, with which I think the Secretary of State will be familiar, and intimidating passers-by, drinking cans of lager&#151;even though most of them were under age&#151;smoking and swearing. It was intimidating for elderly passers-by who wanted to enjoy a night out in Abergavenny and perhaps go to the local theatre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80228-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08022876000560">Under current legislation, it is difficult for the police to deal with such behaviour. Even when people are breaking the law, the police are not necessarily able to arrest, stop and search or even process them. Often, all they can do is ask them to move on&#151;if the right local authority orders are in place&#151;or confiscate alcohol, or take people home if they are clearly inebriated. That needs to change. Some of the Flanagan report proposals will help the police. Certainly where they have grounds for stopping and searching, instead of having to fill out long forms I hope that they will be able to use video camera evidence or to radio through details to the control centre, rather than having to go through the stop-and-search forms. As the Secretary of State might know, I serve as a special constable, and I have done quite a lot of stop and searches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80228-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08022876000561">The report says that it takes seven or eight minutes to fill in the forms, but my experience is that it takes much longer than that, because the person being stopped and searched often does not want to co-operate with the police. Outside Wales&#151;I am thinking of London&#151;people who are stopped often do not speak English, and although that is not their fault, it adds to the time it takes. Simple things such as inclement weather can also have an effect. When two police officers want to stop and search three people, it can take upwards of an hour simply to go through the forms and do the search&#151;that is much longer than stated in the report. Anything that can be done to reduce that time will be welcome, although I appreciate what is contained in the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="80228-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08022876000562">The report does not address two things. First, the Government announced that they would put in place an order to allow the police randomly to stop and search in areas where there is a threat of violence. Happily, we do not see such threats on a regular basis in Wales, but we can do, particularly at football matches. I am not clear how such a provision is any different from the section 60 powers that police already have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80228-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08022876000563">Secondly, when the police stop someone for a minor offence but are not going to make an arrest, instead dealing with them either by process or words of guidance, they will find out who a person is and quite often establish that he or she has a recent criminal record for a violent offence or for carrying drugs or knives&#151;they will be warned about that through their radios&#151;yet that in itself will not be grounds to carry out a search. The police are often stopping known drug dealers and people who have recently used a firearm or a knife but are unable to carry out a search even when that person is breaking the law. With all due respect, I hope the Secretary of State will use whatever influence he has to see whether that law can be changed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80228-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08022876000564">The Secretary of State will be aware that the Gwent area has a major problem with a lack of court facilities.  <br>

Newport has been promised a new courtroom for years, but it has not been delivered yet, and as a result additional pressure has been put on the courtroom in Abergavenny and, I imagine, on courtrooms in his area. People are not getting accessible justice. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) has mentioned that he has encountered a similar problem in his area, too. I hope that the Secretary of State will use whatever influence he has to ensure that promises about new courtrooms with modern, up-to-date facilities are implemented.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right. This is not a devolved responsibility, and I echo his comments because the fact that the promised courtrooms have not been constructed hinders the application of justice in Wales.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman. Following on from that, we must consider what happens to people who are going into the justice system and into prison. I do not believe that the figures bandied around are particularly accurate. The average figure for keeping someone in prison is much lower than people realise, because the figures generally used take into account the high cost of category A prisons. Nobody should put that into the cost considerations because, as far as I am aware, nobody&#151;not even Liberal Democrats&#151;thinks that people in category A prisons should be out and about on the loose. The actual cost of putting someone in prison is probably about &#163;25,000 to &#163;30,000 a year. One must remember that the vast majority of those entering the system are already on full benefits&#151;they are rarely those working in nine-to-five jobs and paying taxes&#151;so whether we like it or not, the net cost to the taxpayer is considerably less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="80228-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08022876000567">The Government should remember their own 2000 figure that crime costs &#163;60 billion a year, yet we spend only &#163;2 billion imprisoning people. Again on their figures&#151;those of the Carter report in 2003&#151;half that &#163;60 billion cost is down to 100,000 people, of whom only 15,000 are in prison at any given time. Based on the Government&#146;s own figures, if the prison population were to be doubled, the extra cost to the taxpayer would be about &#163;2 billion and the saving would be about &#163;30 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80228-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08022876000568">Clearly, I would not want people to be thrown into a Dickensian hell-hole&#151;if any exists in the Prison Service; I have not seen any&#151;but I would like more schemes of the sort that are used in Usk prison, in my constituency, that enable people to obtain vocational skills, which they can use when the leave prison. It is simply not possible to provide such skills in the space of a few months, because often the first thing that needs to be done is to address anger management problems, or alcohol and drug problems. People can then be taken into some form of educational process; it is not something that can be done in a matter of weeks or months, because it takes a year or two. I want a humane prison system that keeps people in for longer but treats them in a humane fashion and sends them out with the ability to live a law-abiding life.</p>

 I shall begin by congratulating my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), although he is not in his place at the moment, on an excellent speech. I add my words to those of many Members on both sides of the House about the service that he has given to Wales and Northern Ireland, and to the people of the United Kingdom when he was Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.

It is true to say that Wales has been transformed, and nowhere more so than my own constituency. West Wales had a reputation throughout the 1980s and through most of the 1990s as an economic blackspot. At times, it had some of the worst unemployment in the whole of the United Kingdom. Our services were not good and we were considered a peripheral area with poor communications. We also saw the erosion of the main pillars of our economy, because international changes were affecting us. For example, changes in agriculture saw more people leaving the industry as mechanisation was introduced. There was a squeeze in particular sectors, such as new potatoes, which faced competition from imports from Morocco and Egypt. The defence closure programme in the 1990s saw the then Conservative Government close several bases or radically reducing the number of staff. The energy industry also went through a period of severe contraction, which saw the closure of refineries, power stations and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="80228-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08022876000574">The last 10 years have seen a dramatic transformation.

We have had a 65 per cent. reduction in unemployment and the investment in infrastructure&#151;roads, new, refurbished and extended schools, and new and refurbished hospitals&#151;has led to a dramatic change in public services in west Wales.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman may be interested to learn that while average unemployment in the UK is 5.2 per cent., it is 5.4 per cent. in Wales. In west Wales and the valleys, it is 5.8 per cent. I know that those are not big differences, but they do show that Wales is slightly behind the UK average.</p>

 I refer specifically to my own constituency, where the fall in unemployment&#151;according to the latest Library figures and the claimant count figures&#151;makes us 11th out of 646 constituencies. We have seen tremendous improvement on unemployment and employment, and one reason has been the clear success in my constituency of objective 1 funding&#151;now convergence funding. The county council, the Welsh Assembly Government and the private sector have worked well together on some significant investments.

The technium in Pembroke dock was created specifically to bring together the private sector and universities in Wales to develop renewable and alternative energy, develop new products, improve existing technologies and spin out companies into larger premises. I was at the technium last week, where Welsh energy sector training, or WEST&#151;which brings together the private sector, universities such as Swansea university, Bangor university, the university of Glamorgan and the Welsh school of architecture&#151;highlighted specific areas in which it thinks the private sector can become actively involved. WEST is also getting involved, rightly, in encouraging the private sector to expand training for technicians in installing renewable technology and so on, because we in Wales must address the skills gap. It is important to have technologists&#151;not just graduates but people who have the hands-on skills required to develop a modern economy, particularly in renewable energy. We are trying to encourage people to install renewable energy in their homes, so it is important that we have qualified technologists to do so.</p>

In my constituency, apart from technium, a UK aerospace company in Pembroke dock is building wind turbines on a smaller scale for domestic and small commercial use. The Bluestone project will be heated and powered by a miscanthus-fired boiler system which will heat the water world and provide 1.5 MW of power. It will be the biggest renewable-fired system in Wales, and will be considered as a pilot for other large projects.</p>

Much of Germany&#146;s PV technology is manufactured in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas); I have visited the Sharp factory. Sharp management say that Germany is their biggest market, because of the feed-in tariff. We as a Government must address that issue, so that we can incentivise people.</p>

 On that point, I tend to agree that rejecting feed-in tariffs was a mistake by the Government, but it is a reparable mistake, and I suspect that it can be repaired through lobbying. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that in order to make feed-in tariffs effective, we need smart meters? I submitted to the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform a strong rationale for introducing smart meters. Does he agree that we should be lobbying for them in Wales and throughout the UK?</p>

 I do not argue with the hon. Gentleman on that point. Let me turn to energy prices and their impact on my constituency, and the wider issue of fuel poverty. In 2004, Brent crude cost $30 a barrel, but today it costs just under $100 a barrel. That has affected more than just our industry. Given that the price of oil has more than doubled, it is remarkable how resilient our economy has been, but the effect on our domestic energy market has been quite dramatic. Production costs for crude oil have not changed much, so there has been a significant increase in oil companies&#146; profits.  The latest figures show that profits for Shell were  $27.5 billion, for BP $16.2 billion, for Exxon Mobil  $40 billion, and for Chevron $4.8 billion in the last quarter of 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80228-0013.htm_para0"><a name="08022876000584">Energy suppliers&#146; profits have increased significantly, too. British Gas&#146;s profits are up 40 per cent. at  &#163;1.9 billion, and National Power&#146;s profits are up 41 per cent. at &#163;500 million. That high level of profitability has enabled huge investment in Pembrokeshire. Probably more than &#163;1 billion has been invested in the two liquefied natural gas terminals in the constituency of the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb), and there has been construction of a 120-mile high-pressure gas pipeline. That has undoubtedly brought local benefits. However, the real impact is on domestic bills. The average annual cost of gas has risen from &#163;370 to &#163;569&#151;a 54 per cent. increase. Electricity prices are up 38 per cent. Heating oil prices more than doubled over the period in question, too. The effect has been an increase in fuel poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="80228-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08022876000585">My right hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) last night hosted a meeting with National Energy Action Cymru, which gave us some interesting information. There is no question but that the winter fuel allowance has been a huge success in addressing and reducing fuel poverty, but given the high price rises&#151;it is unlikely that there will be significant falls&#151;the number of people in fuel poverty in Wales is likely to increase substantially. It increased between 2004 and 2006 by over 100,000, and for every 10 per cent. rise in energy costs, 48,000 more people in Wales go into fuel poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80228-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08022876000586">I agree with suggestions that the first thing that we should do is ensure that energy suppliers do not apply a surcharge to those who have prepayment meters. On average, people who use a prepayment meter pay  &#163;127 more than those who pay by direct debit, although they are among the poorest people. We should make sure that all the energy suppliers end that surcharge&#151;that penalty on being poor in Wales. and on using a prepayment meter. One supplier has already done so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="80228-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08022876000587">We should consider extending the winter fuel payment to those who are on benefits&#151;who are in receipt of jobseeker&#146;s allowance or some sort of disability payment&#151; <br>

but are below the age of 60. Not many people know about the social tariff, but it enables people to get 20 per cent. off their energy bill&#151;that is provided by the energy supplier&#151;and free insulation on their property if they can show that they are vulnerable and in fuel poverty. What is preventing that from being rolled out to far more people is the reluctance to exchange information between the Department for Work and Pensions, local authorities and the energy suppliers. That must be addressed.</p>

If the income of the oil industry and the energy suppliers were top-sliced, that could be dedicated to making the existing housing stock fuel efficient, thereby tackling fuel poverty and climate change and developing fuel poverty payments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="80228-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08022876000589">One of the issues that concerns me greatly is that people, in many cases retired, who live in rural parts of Wales and are not connected to the gas supply are totally dependent on oil-fired central heating. As I said, the price of heating oil in the past four years has gone from 20p a litre to 42p a litre, or even higher. We have not seen a change in the winter fuel allowance. I believe that the oil industry has a moral duty to start a social tariff, in the same way as have the other energy suppliers, in order to address that problem.</p>

 It is a great privilege to speak in my inaugural St. David&#146;s day debate. As a recent member of the Welsh Affairs Committee, it is a great privilege to have heard some of the speeches today. I have already learned a great deal. It could be asked why an English Member of Parliament is involved in a Welsh affairs debate. I have given part of the reason, by saying that I am a member of the Welsh Affairs Committee. I also spent five years of my childhood growing up in Wales, in the Afan valley in the constituency of Aberavon. It is a great privilege to serve on the Select Committee under the chairmanship of the hon. Member for Aberavon (Dr. Francis).</p>

Eventually it would turn up 10 miles down the road in Neath. There are other great memories, such as those of camping in the summer months in the hills round about. Wales is a fabulous place. It is a wonder to go there every year for my summer holidays, and in the recent recess I spent three days in Aberdovey. I hope that the purchase of the Penhelig Arms hotel in Aberdovey by Brains Brewery will not change the quality of the output. Tourism is vital for the Welsh economy. We have heard today how manufacturing is decreasing in Wales, so a reliance on tourism and the softer service industries is very evident.</p>

meant that a million manufacturing jobs throughout the United Kingdom have been lost since 1997. To identify that is to put ourselves in a position to create, as a nation, a new employment strategy. It is a matter not of being critical, but of critical appreciation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80228-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08022876000594">Manufacturing in Wales, as no doubt in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency, is very much linked to the aerospace industry, and that is why I hope that the Airbus project, which is experiencing many delays at the moment, will move forward. It is critical not only for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency, but for the west midlands and Shropshire, where many small and medium-sized businesses rely heavily on Airbus and other manufacturing industries supplying the airline industry.</p>

 I lend my support to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s observation about the importance of tourism for Wales. Montgomeryshire is highly dependent on caravanning and on visitors to tourist attractions such as Lake Vyrnwy and walking in the mountains. If the hon. Gentleman is implying that we should be a bit more forceful in advertising Wales as a destination within the UK for holidays, I certainly agree with that sentiment.</p>

 I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s support. If someone has a fortnight&#146;s holiday, they should first stop in Shropshire, whose tourism campaign I support, and then spend the second week in Wales. That is a perfectly reasonable compromise. I have been to Lake Vyrnwy. It is a great bird-watching location that is funded by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and it has a hotel that is undergoing major refurbishment as we speak.</p>

 I concur with the comments of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik). As I have said, I was born and brought up in Wales and lived around the Bristol area for quite some time. I used to be somewhat depressed when I heard people talk about going to see Roman remains to find that they were heading up the M4 to Bath instead of going over the bridge to Caerleon, which has one of the most fantastic sets of Roman remains and the most perfect amphitheatre in Europe, I believe. It is absolutely right that we have so many jewels in Wales to champion.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Some say that the Romans did not get past the western borders of Shropshire, but they did venture further, and there are some excellent Roman remains in parts of Wales. However, to return to my earlier point, I suggest that visitors stop in Wroxeter in Shropshire in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) and then move on to the wonderful Roman sites in Wales. That is a perfectly reasonable proposition. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones) rightly said that the Government should be doing more to promote Wales as not only a sporting venue but a tourism venue as well.</p>

leeks and politicians do not usually gel well; they are not something that politicians like. But on the serious point, it would be nice to see some leeks next time round, and I will participate in that, along with the Chairman of the Welsh Affairs Committee. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I have just said that I am willing to do so; I did not wear my own leek today because I did not want to embarrass Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80228-0013.htm_para9"><a name="08022876000600">There is no doubt a correlation between the standard of public services in health in Wales and those in Shropshire, Herefordshire and Cheshire. That is why I welcome the cross-border inquiry of the Welsh Affairs Committee. The people of Wales, who are paying more taxes than they have ever done before, are entitled to a full NHS, not only in acute services but in primary care services as well. The people of Shropshire should not have their health strategy designed because of Wales&#146;s deficits and shortfalls, but should have a health service designed for the special needs of that large county. That is why I have concerns that unless the people of Shropshire and north Wales have been consulted on the agreement between the west midlands and the Welsh Assembly, there will be great concern on both sides of the border about any movement of services. The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic and District Hospital NHS Trust and the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust need primarily to serve the populations around them. Yes, of course we want to share health services with Wales where possible. However, in Shropshire and the west midlands we cannot have a system designed for Wales when the majority of the services are meant to be delivered in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80228-0013.htm_para10"><a name="08022876000601">I touched on the issue of education earlier, during an intervention. It disturbs me that 16 schools in Wales are potentially subject to special measures and special interest from the chief inspector of schools for Wales; the number is double that of last year. I do not see that as progress. That is not a criticism of the hard-working, dedicated teaching staff of Wales, who do a wonderful job, but a recognition that teachers are being asked to do more with less. They are more often subject to bullying and harassment in the classroom and the Government need to take action. It is high time that the Government recognised the need to do what the Conservative party wants to do: provide a facility under which teachers accused, perhaps falsely, of bullying pupils are given protection until the case has been proven. It is important that in such circumstances teachers remain anonymous, so that their reputations are not ruined before their very eyes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80228-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08022876000602">It is also concerning that the gap between the best and worst schools in Wales has increased&#151;by 10 per cent. in the past year.

I am privileged that the armed forces mental health charity Combat Stress has a treatment centre in Newport, Shropshire&#151;not Newport, Wales. I have met former Welsh Guards who still suffer post-traumatic stress disorder from the conflict in the Falkland Islands. It is important that the Government do far more to provide mental health services, not only for those serving today but for those who will leave the armed forces in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80228-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08022876000605">We have heard today about policing and law and order. We can argue about whether crime is up or down in Wales, but we know from the Police Federation and their own articulation privately&#151;and sometimes, bravely, publicly&#151;that the police are burdened with paperwork and red tape as never before. We have heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies), who has not only political but personal and professional experience, serving gallantly as a special constable. It is in the interests of Wales, of the Government and of every individual victim of crime that the paperwork be reduced so that police officers get back on the beat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80228-0013.htm_para15"><a name="08022876000606">When the Labour Government were first elected, we heard about zero-tolerance policing. We do not hear that phrase any more; it has gone out of fashion. However, when we get down to the grass roots and basics of violent crime, we see that it starts at a very low level. If people think they can get away with low-level antisocial behaviour&#151;so-called petty crime, noise nuisance, or whatever it may be&#151;they graduate up to other crimes, and then graduate up again. The reason why we have a crisis in our prisons is that more and more people are committing crime&#151;it is a bit of a no-brainer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80228-0013.htm_para16"><a name="08022876000607">Given that the Government have decided, very belatedly, to build new prisons&#151;I welcome that, although it is partly because they are trying to catch up, and it is unfortunately driven by criticism rather than by a prison strategy&#151;I hope that we will see an end to early prisoner release. One could say that, in principle, there is a role within a reasonable criminal justice system for early prisoner release, with a normal probation board and Parole Board, and I would not argue with that. Unfortunately, however, many of the early release schemes that the Government have signed up to have been the result of the crisis in the prisons. Because there is no room in the prisons they are forced to release people early, and many of them, according to the Home Office&#146;s own statistics, go on to commit crime again. That cannot be a sensible criminal justice policy and it cannot be good for the people of Wales. I know that the Minister, being a reasonable man, will admit that that is the case, so let us have those prison places opened up as soon as possible.</p>

there is the knock-on effect on police cells in Wales. The hon. Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas) will know that over the past year or so there has been a real problem with police cells being full in Wrexham, as well as in other parts of Wales, because there has been nowhere to take prisoners. I hope that the Minister will deal with those points.</p>

Shropshire now has a direct rail link to London, which is great&#151;it is good for the people of Wales and good for the people of Shropshire. However, within the past few weeks Virgin Trains has announced that it is going to set up another London to Wrexham service via Chester. It is perplexing why Virgin Trains has suddenly shown an interest in having a direct rail link to Wrexham, and I hope that it will not, by design or by default, push out the new service that is coming through Shropshire. I understand competition&#151;I do not have an issue with that&#151;but there must be an holistic view of what is good for Wales.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Wales back to the Wales Office. It was a pleasure and an honour to serve with him when he was last there. I am pleased that his sound judgment, common sense and plain speaking will once again be heard at the Cabinet table.</p>

We should make things better when we pass legislation to benefit Wales, but we should not make it different simply for the sake of it. Every step of the way, we must continue to ask ourselves, &#147;Will this measure make life better for the Welsh people?&#148; If the answer is a sincere yes, we should forge ahead. If it is no, we should drop it and pursue other avenues that will yield real change for the betterment of the people of Wales.</p>

 They were introduced by the Labour party in Wales, as the hon. Gentleman knows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80228-0014.htm_para0"><a name="08022876000622">We in Wales will face a danger in the coming year from an unhealthy dynamic in Welsh politics. It is a dynamic that is already leading us into a blind alley, which goes by the grand title of the constitutional convention. I am told that the Welsh Assembly is to set aside &#163;500,000 for this self-indulgent, wasteful exercise in navel gazing. That pointless convention is supposed to test the waters to determine whether we should hold a referendum on more powers for Cardiff and when it can be won. I wonder whether the Assembly will make the same amount of public money available to those who want a referendum at a time when the Welsh people will say no to more powers in Cardiff. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will enlighten us in his winding-up speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80228-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08022876000623">I can save the Assembly that &#163;500,000; I can help them test the waters. I have a cunning plan. I will take the authors of the idea on a walk down Blackwood high street&#151;or any high street in Wales&#151;and ask people whether they believe that it is worth spending &#163;500,000 on the convention. People will be amazed that we can find that money when there are far more pressing needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80228-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08022876000624">Wales spends less per head on educating our children than England spends. People will think that we should close that gap. We spend far less than England on further education, and people will think that we should close that gap. Waiting lists for hospital admissions in Wales are longer than those in England. People will think that we should close that gap, too. On top of that, incomes in Wales are lower than elsewhere in Britain and much of Europe. People will certainly think that we should close that gap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80228-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08022876000625">West Wales and the valleys, thanks to the Labour Government, obtained European objective 1 moneys because our income levels were lower than those in the rest of Britain and Europe. However, after six years of that funding, we must ask whether our income levels are any better now. The answer is that they have changed little, and continue to lag behind the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80228-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08022876000626">So far, to a great extent, objective 1 has been a lost opportunity. The Irish used objective 1 money to upskill their work force and have gone on to become the tiger economy of Europe. We should follow their lead, but we do not. A look through the Welsh European Funding Office list of the largest objective 1 projects shows that the money has been used for agricultural food processing, tourism promotion, and a Royal Society for the Protection of Birds scheme called, &#147;Aren&#146;t Welsh Birds Brilliant!&#148; I have no doubt that those are worthy causes, and I do not want to denigrate them, but are we seriously saying that they are priorities for investing the European money that we have won for Wales?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80228-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08022876000627">Furthermore, the administration of objective 1 has been a bureaucratic nightmare, bound up in red tape. Only yesterday, the Welsh Local Government Association expressed frustration that, after 15 months of the new European structural fund programme, so little progress has been made.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is aware of my views on those matters. Those responsible in the Assembly have taken their eye off the ball. Objective 1, and the convergence fund that has now replaced it, should be about increasing income levels and raising the standard of living. To do that, it should be used for upskilling and training above all else.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="80228-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08022876000631">I believe in that. For me, politics should be about the common good, not responding to greed, selfishness and narrow personal interests. This great Labour party stands for social justice, fairness and equality of opportunity. In the past 10 years, the Government have brought great achievements to fruition. There are more people in work, a record amount of new jobs has been created, and full employment is a near reality. Our economy is strong, our people are more prosperous, and investment in health and education is at record levels. We have a solid base on which to build.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80228-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08022876000632">However, our economic future will be secure only if we invest in training and upskilling our people. We need to give the people of Wales the skills that they do not yet have in order to create the jobs that we do not yet have. Wales in the 21st century can become the dragon economy of Europe. When Labour came to power, at the start of the journey to reform Britain more than a decade ago, Tony Blair declared that his priority was education, education, education. He was right, but now we must take the next step. Now our priority should be training, training, training. Everyone will have to go back to school to improve their skills.</p>

My twin granddaughters, now aged 14, must develop the muscles between their ears if they want to get the right knowledge and skills to have a future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="80228-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08022876000634">The great challenges that we face in the coming years are not Welsh but global. We are part of a world in which powerful new economies such as China and India will challenge and overtake Europe and the United States. China enrolled 15 million students in tertiary education in 2004, but there the average industrial wage is but 60p an hour. Wales&#151;and, for that matter, Britain&#151;cannot compete if we remain a low-skill, low-wage economy. The only way we will compete is by retraining and upskilling. We have to keep ahead with new and innovative ideas, which we can fully exploit only if we have the skills to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80228-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08022876000635">The challenge to Wales will be all the greater because we are on the edge of Europe geographically, but we can be at the heart of Europe economically. There are some in other parties in the House who will happily mislead the people by saying that Labour is interested only in middle England. When I first heard that I wondered how the hopes and aspirations of people in middle England were different from those of people in Islwyn, for example, so I did some research. I did not find much difference. In fact, I discovered that people in middle England want a job and a decent education for their children. The people of Islwyn want that as well. People in middle England want a first-class health   <br>

They fail to remind us that those independent countries are now part of a greater Europe, sharing decision making and law making, and common goals and objectives. Countries such as Ireland, Belgium and Holland want to be part of an ever-growing Union; they do not want to secede from one. There is no logic in having Wales leave the United Kingdom, one of the big players on the European stage, to stand alone as a minor player with very little voice and even less bargaining power. That would be tantamount to the emasculation of Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="80228-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08022876000639">The separatists would have Wales end its long marriage with England only to enter a polygamous marriage with half of Europe in a Union that would include England. Are they really serious? If this were an Alan Bennett play or a Brian Rix farce, the men in white coats would be coming on stage now. I am proud to be Welsh, but separatism is nonsense. I want a Wales that is at the heart of Britain and a Britain that is at the heart of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80228-0014.htm_para14"><a name="08022876000640">Wales can and should have the ambition to be an economic powerhouse within the Union of Great Britain. However, to achieve that ambition we must face up to the challenge of creating a work force who are trained and equipped with all the skills necessary to compete on the global stage. No one who leaves education today, in Wales or anywhere else in Britain, can expect to have a job for life. Everyone will have to retrain and reskill throughout their working lives. No one should be left at home, existing on benefits, if they can work, retrain and upskill to get a job.</p>

The bread and butter issues are the economy, jobs, education, training, health, pensions and transport. Those are the issues that concern the people who send us to Westminster. Skills are the key to those issues. If we want the money to invest in education, training and so on, we must first get the jobs. To get the jobs, we have to invest in upskilling our people. Then they will get the jobs to pay the taxes and we will be able to invest in all the good public services that we want in our country. A highly skilled, highly paid work force will close the income gap and objective 1 will then be a resounding success.</p>

 I should like to add my voice to those of hon. Members who have welcomed the re-appointment of the Secretary of State. I congratulate him, and I am sure that he will do very well in the post. May I also unreservedly apologise to him for the slur cast by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams), who implied that the Secretary of State and I were converging politically? That will undoubtedly be damaging to him, but I hope that it causes him less anxiety than it might just cause me. Apart from the skilling bit, I disagreed with everything the right hon.

There are problems in Wales, but I am not saying that all is bad. There is less unemployment than there was, by a long chalk. The trouble is, however, that wages are low. We need to upgrade and upskill, as the right hon. Gentleman rightly said, in order to succeed. Emphasis will no doubt be placed on that in the coming months and years. I do not share the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s view that the objective 1 money has been a complete waste, but it has not been put to good use. It could have been used better.</p>

There are now 32 towns in Wales that no longer have a DWP office. A large number of jobs have already gone, and 28 of the 33 proposed closures are in the objective 1 area. This is part of the debate that we have just had on upskilling and our gross domestic product. These are big problems. The right hon. Gentleman asked what was different about Wales. This is different: no matter how many times we shout about the problems caused by job cuts in objective 1 areas, nobody takes a blind bit of notice and the cuts go ahead. That is one difference.</p>

How can we possibly say that we want to raise the GDP or the gross value added in the objective 1 area if this is happening?

Hundreds of them are going, including 35 in Porthmadog and 50 in Bangor. Some of them will undoubtedly involve voluntary redundancy, but a great deal of damage will none the less be done to the economy in various parts of the objective 1 area of Wales.

 The hon. Gentleman knows that there is much cross-party opposition to the closure of DWP offices in western Wales. Another possible threat to jobs is likely to be caused by the merger of national health service trusts in north Wales.

The merger would result in a drift of jobs eastwards from north-west Wales from the trust that covers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency and mine.

 Of course I agree with the hon. Gentleman and make no bones about that, but I am addressing another subject. I hope he agrees with what I am saying about that, as I agree with him on this.

DVLA workers in Swansea are paid &#163;15,725 in comparison with &#163;18,050 with workers over the border&#151;not in London, but just over the border. The total saving to the Exchequer from that is &#163;17 million&#151;money saved by underpaying hard workers down in Swansea. As Sian Wiblin of the Public and Commercial Services Union said:</p>

Reference was made earlier to the somewhat cynical way in which mention of compensation for Wales was included in the first draft of a speech, but disappeared the following week when it became clear that no election was going to be called. Last week, the Minister Elin Jones announced an &#163;8.8 million compensation package for sheep farmers in respect of the outbreak of foot and mouth in England last year. That is welcome, although Brynle Williams, representing the Conservatives in the Assembly, said that it somehow underpaid the farmers, selling them short. If he paused for thought, even he might realise that &#163;12.5 million paid in England and &#163;8.8 million paid in Wales is not too bad a comparative figure, especially when it comes from a budget rather than from the Treasury. Of course, we all know that the Government were directly responsible for the outbreak in the first place. Common sense dictates that the Government should have bailed Wales out, but in any event the money was found, and although I do not suggest it is a silver bullet that will immediately deal with all the problems, it will go some way towards dealing with them.</p>

 I have spoken to the Secretary of State about the matter, and I know that the Minister has been to see him about it. It has been raised on a cross-party basis. This is another instance of Wales being slightly different: we were not bailed out when we should have been, although the Treasury bailed out our counterparts in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="80228-0015.htm_para0"><a name="08022876000662">Finally, let me deal with the thorny issue of post office closures in Wales. A huge number of post offices have disappeared over the past couple of years, and it would be awful if we lost any more. As we know, post offices are a focal point for communities. I live in a village that contains one post office, which is also the village shop. The village is 5 miles from the nearest town, and although I have a car and can drive, other people are unable to make the journey. I believe passionately that we should halt the closure process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="80228-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08022876000663">According to the New Economics Foundation, on average a post office contributes &#163;310,000 to the local economy each year&#151;although obviously that does not apply to the one in my village&#151;and &#163;120,000 is spent directly on local goods and services. Each post office saves small businesses in its vicinity about &#163;270,000. In deprived urban areas, 61 per cent. of customers use their post offices to gain access to free community services, while 69 per cent. do so in rural areas. About 75 per cent. of post offices have a shop or other business attached to them, and are the only places where local people can withdraw cash.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="80228-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08022876000664">In March 2001 there were 1,399 post offices operating in Wales. By March 2007 there were only 1,146, 18 per cent. having disappeared. Of those closures, 127 were part of the urban reinvention programme: urban sub-postmasters were paid compensation for closing their businesses in a so-called rationalisation of the post office structure in urban areas.</p>

 I entirely agree. I also think that, as some council offices are having to close, a small amount could be paid to a post office to function as a one-stop shop providing information. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will work as vigorously as we can on a cross-party basis.</p>

There are problems ahead, and although they are avoidable, they are likely to hit Wales far harder than other parts of the United Kingdom because of the nature of the country.

 May I take the opportunity, like many others today, to pay tribute to the work of the former Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), who worked assiduously for Wales? We have had the odd policy disagreement from time to time, but he has always worked with patience and good humour and he is one of the best political campaigners I have ever come across. Wales is fortunate indeed in having my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) as his successor. His political skills are respected on all sides of the House. He also agrees with me that what matters most to the people we are sent here to represent are the services that Government help to provide to those constituents.

I hear about it from them pretty quickly and their strength of feeling is apparent. I recall that one such issue was the Government&#146;s ill-fated proposal for a single police force for Wales, a policy that was strongly opposed by Labour MPs in north Wales who, I believe, had a major effect upon the eventual decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80228-0015.htm_para8"><a name="08022876000677">Another such issue is the delivery of specialist services in our NHS.

Within that hospital is the Midlands and North Wales centre for spinal injuries, headed by my very good friend Mr. Wagih El Masry, a consultant who, with his colleagues, achieves miraculous recoveries for many people who suffer catastrophic injuries in accidents. His skills have been developed over decades and are shared in only eight other centres in the UK.   <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80228-0015.htm_para9"><a name="08022876000678">We all value medical services that are close to our homes but we understand that specialist skills can be developed only in specialist centres. Increasingly, the requirements of Royal Colleges dictate that those skills be delivered only in specialist centres. My constituents understand this and no constituent has contacted me to ask that those services should be delivered only in Wrexham. On the other hand, I have been contacted by constituents who are concerned that specialist services may be withdrawn from them because those services are based in England.

 I understand why a separatist party would require services that are currently delivered from England to Wales to be delivered only in Wales. The fallacy of the Plaid Cymru position is that it pretends that services currently delivered by specialist centres in England would continue to be delivered in an independent Wales. I have heard from Wrexham residents who have been treated at Broadgreen in Liverpool for heart surgery, at Christie hospital in Manchester for cancer, at Alder Hey in Liverpool for children&#146;s services or at Walton for neurosurgery. They are concerned that patients may be denied access to those centres of excellence simply because those centres are in England. I have been comforted by assurances given by the Minister for Health and Social Services in the Welsh Assembly Government, but we must assert the value of a national health service delivered across the UK.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has mentioned the Minister for Health and Social Services in the Welsh Assembly Government.

based in England. We must recognise that our system of health care is not separate from that in England and that we have a devolved system. We must develop working protocols to facilitate access to health care on the basis of need, when such care is best delivered across the border. Sometimes such protocols will be complex, but it will not be impossible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="80228-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08022876000684">We must also address the issue of a postcode lottery within the NHS. That involves more than Wales having different policies from England, because different primary care trusts in England have different policies. We need a policy across our national health service that the prescription of drugs for serious conditions and the treatment of serious conditions should be determined on a UK-wide basis, and such a policy should be agreed by the Labour party in all parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="80228-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08022876000685">Another policy area also requires a UK-wide approach. The issue was apparent in the previous Parliament, and it will be much discussed in the years to come. At present, however, this is the calm before the storm. In 2009, the UK Government are committed to reviewing the impact of the Higher Education Act 2004, which introduced variable tuition fees for England and devolved higher education funding to Wales. I opposed the measure at the time, because I am against variable tuition fees and because the higher education system in Wales is too small to operate without regard to the system in England. That is the matter on which I fundamentally disagreed with my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80228-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08022876000686">The system of student finance in the United Kingdom is hugely complex. In fact, it is more accurate to say that we have three separate systems for Wales, for England and for Scotland. For a student from Wales, the Welsh Assembly Government will pay the difference between the basic tuition fee and the increased fee permitted under the Higher Education Act 2004. It is therefore cheaper for a student from Wales to attend a university in Wales than one in England. I object to this policy in principle. It limits student choice, and it discourages students from choosing a course on the basis of which university and course is best for them. <i> [Interruption.]</i><i> </i>Is the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) indicating from a sedentary position that he is in favour of limiting the access of students from Wales to universities in England and Scotland? If so, that is interesting. I believe, on the contrary, that education is about broadening the mind, not narrowing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="80228-0015.htm_para14"><a name="08022876000687">Devolution of higher education funding to Wales was based on a false premise. Interestingly, it was repeated by the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) in evidence he recently gave to the Justice Committee&#151;he was discussing tuition fees, although he was referring to Scotland at the time. The false premise is that it is possible to have separate higher education systems in the different nations of the United Kingdom. The right hon. and learned Gentleman offered the following example. He said that Scottish Members voted in the tuition fees debate and the Bill was carried only because of their votes, and he maintained that they were not affected by the introduction of that legislation relating to England. That is simply not correct, as what happens to the university sector in England is of profound consequence to the university sector in Scotland&#151;that is currently a matter of great debate in Scotland. Equally, there is great concern within the higher education sector  <br>

At that time, consideration will be given as to whether to raise the current cap of &#163;3,000. If it is raised&#151;let us say, for argument&#146;s sake, to &#163;5,000&#151;there will be a further shortfall in the funding for Welsh higher education institutions, which the Welsh Assembly Government will need to fill if they are to maintain their policy. That is the train that is coming down the tracks but which everyone is ignoring at present. It is an issue of profound consequence not only to the higher education sector, but to Wales as a country and to the future of Wales. As we have heard, it is important that education and training is at the heart of what Wales will be about over the next few years, because if it is not we will be unable to compete with the developing economies in the rest of the world. </p>

I believe we should have a British system of higher education funding, and that the correct system for Wales, Scotland, England and Northern Ireland is the graduate tax. I have always favoured that, as I believe that students should make a contribution to their later wealth, that that should be paid at a time when they can afford it, and that it should be linked to their income when they are earning and not to the course they pursue. The graduate tax is a solution that would enhance access to education and links within the United Kingdom, and it would be a British policy of which we could be proud. When we approach the review in 2009, we should put the proposal on the table because higher education institutions in Wales need to know and feel secure about their future funding. They have big investment decisions to make. If they are to base their future position on planned investment, the issue will need to be addressed soon.</p>

The Alliance is a group of local government representatives backed by the Labour Back-Bench group on regeneration.

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point about the reasons why people go on to incapacity benefit. Does he share my concern about the role of some GPs in the process, who open the gate too easily for people to migrate from employment or other benefits on to long-term incapacity benefit?</p>

<p><a name="st_o358"><a name="08022876000702"><a name="80228-0016.htm_spnew1"><a name="08022876001321"><b>Mr. Davies:</b>
 There is great concern about such misunderstanding by general practitioners. They do not know the benefits system and sometimes think that incapacity benefit is an easy option. We need an education process for GPs, so that they can understand what they are doing when they sign people on for benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08022876000703">The next issue follows on from a point made by the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig). There is huge concern about objective 1 funding. It has provided masses of money and opportunity for Wales, and there have been improvements, but we have missed the boat. In Blaenau Gwent, we still have areas with boarded-up shops. The small and medium enterprises do not exist there at the moment and need to be encouraged. Our biggest concern is that convergence funding has now replaced objective 1 funding, and it has a time limit on it. What happens next? Blaenau Gwent still does not have sufficient sustainability and too many projects rely on objective 1 and convergence funding. When those funds are removed, those projects will be under threat. Significant numbers of people are employed through objective 1 funding. What will happen to them if and when we lose convergence funding? The sector of the economy that relies on project work and the development trusts is fragile, and it will be under threat very soon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08022876000704">I spoke in this debate last year on the issue of tourism and I mentioned a part of the Secretary of State&#146;s constituency, Big Pit, which is a huge draw. In Blaenau Gwent we want to be part of that. As I said to someone last week, the area is full of relics and I would be happy to welcome people who came to see them. Our industrial heritage and history is second to none. Who built America? Who sent coal, steel and iron all over the world? It was the south Wales valleys. Nor should we forget Nye Bevan and the creation of the national health service. However, 12 months after that debate, we have not generated anywhere near the capacity for tourism of areas such as Blaenau Gwent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08022876000705">Another issue affecting the community is energy. We heard earlier that Wales can lead the way&#151;the Severn barrage is probably one of the biggest examples&#151;but there is a problem with wind farms. Like open-cast mining, they give rise to nimbyism: &#147;Not in my back  <br>

yard.&#148; But when we look around us, especially on the mountain tops and at the tops of the valleys in our area, we see opportunities for positioning wind farms. However, I reiterate the point that has been made: it needs to be done with the people rather than against them. It is important that we bring the people along and that they support wind farms rather than trying to stop them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08022876000706">The issue of the Olympics has been raised. If hill walking is an Olympic event by 2012, could Blaenau Gwent please be considered? We have plenty of facilities for that, although maybe not for much else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08022876000707">In the past couple of months, many hon. Members, including the Secretary of State, have been approached by their police authorities, which have expressed concern about ongoing funding for police in our areas. My major concern is that we will lose the fluffy bits that people see as an add-on, such as the partnership and communities together meetings and the community part of policing. I hope that that is not the case. I have written to the Secretary of State about the police issues, and we have had assurances that those services will not be undercut. They are important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08022876000708">Beyond supporting community support officers and their project within policing, one area in which we have a significant lack is help for young people. I recently visited a rehabilitation centre in Bristol for those addicted to alcohol and drugs. People as young as 18 and 19 were in that establishment, and one of the things that came out of my visit was that those people had had no contact with anyone for much of their young lives due to family breakdowns, for instance. Alongside police work and education, we need to invest in youth workers. There is a significant lack of people who can deal face to face and one to one with young people to understand their problems and anxieties. With the loss of the steel and coal industries, young people have experienced a loss of identity. To bring back that identity and a sense of belonging, we need to look after them; as my grandmother used to say, they need to be given a cwtsh. They need to be taken close and looked after, because their families are failing in some respects to look after those children. Although the funds are there for policing, we need a lot more face-to-face work to be done in the community.</p>

 The important thing about that is how we promote those types of activity through schools. We do not see young children being told at primary school level what activities are available in the community. I agree wholeheartedly: to draw young people into such activities is wonderful. Having been part of the Scout movement, and having a young son in the Scouts now, I know that it is a fantastic organisation. The hon. Gentleman is right. Young people have so many opportunities that they perhaps do not recognise.</p>

It is easy to put a law in place, but how it can be policed I honestly do not know. There is a growing problem of young people on street corners with cans and bottles of alcohol. It is going to be a difficult one to police.</p>

We have heard a significant amount about post office closures this afternoon, and I support everything that right hon. and hon. Members have said. The Government have embarked recently on a nationalisation programme that I support 110 per cent. It is only one bank at the moment, but who knows? In terms of the post offices, one of my constituents, Peter Chambers, has come up with a possible solution. If we nationalise the lottery, run it through the Government and place the terminals in every post office in the country rather than in supermarkets, maybe that would help support the post offices by bringing businesses into them, in the way that we heard about earlier on. It would sustain their future in all our communities.</p>

 It is a pleasure for me to follow, for the first time, the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Davies). Our backgrounds have a great deal in common, and I should like to take up some of the themes that he raised. It is also a pleasure to congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on his return to office, for two reasons. The first has already been mentioned by the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes): now that my right hon. Friend is in office, he can indulge fully in what the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey decided was his passion for Welsh devolution, and his deep enthusiasm for the Welsh language. The second reason why I welcome my right hon. Friend back to office is that it means that his time will be fully occupied. It will be busy in the office, so he will have less energy and time for some of the activities to do with devolution in which he was involved, together with his comrade, the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig). That will be extremely beneficial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08022876000714">Sir Martin Evans has been mentioned. We are all very proud that the professor of mammalian genetics at Cardiff university has won a Nobel prize, together with others, and we are proud of the other winner of a prize in Cardiff. Sir Martin is a proud Welshman and he delights in his roots in the capital city. The best thing about the win is that his work, which involves embryos, is in an area in which there are boundless opportunities for development. There are possible future Nobel prize winners in a little-known firm in Newport called Lifeforce. It was founded by Professor Bradley Stringer and a man with an exotic Welsh name&#151;although he is Welsh&#151;Mr. Del DelaRonde.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08022876000715">The firm is in the business of parking immune systems. It is an exotic business; a sample of blood, in pristine condition, is taken from a healthy patient, and the white cells are extracted and kept in three different locations. When the immune system is attacked by disease, or is weakened by chemotherapy or radiotherapy, it is possible to expose the white cells to a natural growth factor that multiplies them into an army of healthy white cells, which are re-infused into the patient. That is an exciting possibility. Lifeforce in Newport owns world patents. It already has a link with the Fraunhofer Institute in Munich and a firm in America. It is one of only three companies that are in partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08022876000716">The possibilities are immense, if one thinks of how the technology could be used. It could be used for  <br>

AIDS patients. If someone who has HIV gets full-blown AIDS, and has a re-infusion of their healthy immune system, they could go back to where they were, with HIV, and with full-blown AIDS in remission. That is causing a great deal of excitement in the scientific world. The company is wholly Welsh. Its founder, the professor, is a former patent examiner in Newport. One of the crucial factors is that the firm has a link that has been approved, and unique patents. Approval has come from the Food and Drug Administration in America, and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK. There is the possibility of huge expansion in that field. We are talking about the medicine of the future, and I think that it will certainly rank with surgery, radiotherapy and various drugs as a cancer treatment in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08022876000717">That is one example of the great things that are happening in Wales. It is part of our pride in Newport, a city that is in a very healthy state. We are looking forward to the year of the general election, 2010, but there will be another major event in Newport in that year: the Ryder cup. There is so much activity going on in the town. Newport is being reborn; it will be Newport nouveau. There is a big new boulevard running through the town. The other day, my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, East (Jessica Morden) saw the plans for its new rugby stadium. The railway station is undergoing a major makeover.

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08022876000718">Yesterday a new 10-year drugs strategy was announced. It is unfortunate that we have not had a debate on it or even a statement. We had a statement in the House 10 years ago, when the previous drugs strategy was supported by all major parties. There was only one Back Bencher who objected. Before we embark on a second drugs strategy, we should look at the result of the past 10 years, acknowledging that the treatment target is the only target that has been met. We have not come anywhere near reaching the targets that were set for the reduction of drugs use, the reduction of drugs-related crime and the reduction in drugs-related deaths.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08022876000719">We should look at the experience of other countries. Portugal had a five-year drugs strategy in 2001, the result of which is that the number of drug deaths was halved in that country. In other countries, too, spectacular results have been achieved. Let me speak about my experience, as one constituency MP. Two people living in my constituency would be recorded in the statistics of the past 10 years, and both had similar experiences in the past 18 months. They went to jail because they were stealing to feed their addiction. They will be marked up as great successes because they went in as drug users and came out clean. That is the end of the happy story. The woman lived for a week after she came out of prison. The man lived for a day after he came out of prison. They both went back to taking heroin, at the normal dose that they had tolerated before, and they died.</p>

There has been a slight decrease recently in the number of deaths, and there have been improvements, which I would argue have come from treatment&#151;from the health outcomes. There is also optimism in Europe that we are moving away from the policy that we are all  <br>

signed up to as members of the United Nations&#151;a 10-year strategy that was designed to eliminate or reduce substantially all drug cultivation and drug use. That policy was adopted in 1998 and comes up to be examined this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08022876000721">There has been no progress whatever anywhere on the planet in achieving that end, yet we are still in denial. When the tough policies fail, we go on to other policies that continue to fail. A Bill that is to come before the House proposes that we should go for more policies based on the criminal justice system. There is one lesson that stares us in the face when we look at the experience of the past 40 years, since we started to get tough on drugs in 1971, when there were fewer than 1,000 addicts in Britain. We have had tough policies, we have imprisoned many people, we have done everything to eliminate drugs use, but there are now 280,000 drug addicts and that number is rising.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08022876000722">Other countries have achieved great success in reducing drug addiction. One reason to be optimistic is our realisation that we can no longer rely on the criminal justice system. That is counter-productive and wasteful. There is not a prison in the country where all illegal drugs are not used. However, schemes for needle exchanges, injection rooms and substitution are cheaper and they work. They produce good results and reduce drug crime and the number of users.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08022876000723">A new convention will come before Ministers in a month or two, based on changing from the criminal justice system to health outcomes. There is another splendid document produced by the same group of people, called the Rome Consensus, which has been approved by the Red Cross and Red Crescent in 130 countries and there is a chance of that going through the United Nations. There is hope that we can change our view, but it will be by changing our attitudes.</p>

What they got was not a strategy that worked but a babble of voices giving them different advice, with the result that there are now 5 million addicts in the CIS. A hospital outside Moscow, which I do not recommend anyone visits, is filled with children all born with AIDS, all the children of sex workers and drug users. We have seen that scourge spread across the planet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08022876000725">We can change our policy. In 2005, shortly before the election, the House decided to reclassify magic mushrooms in the same category as heroin. No main party opposed that because they did not want to be pilloried as being soft on drugs. Because of that lack of courage and failure to recognise the problem, we are acting as agents in continuing the scourge.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to identify a growing drugs problem in Wales, but I must disagree with him on abandoning the criminal justice system, which I agree needs to work hand in hand with health outcomes. Does he share my concern that we also need to deal with the sources of supply of these drugs, and that it is absolutely wrong that drug liaison officers have been withdrawn since the Serious Organised Crime Agency took over that role in foreign countries from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs?</p>

 Trying to deal with the source of supply is utterly futile. The Columbian authorities have been trying for 30 years, and we are seeing the Columbianisation of Afghanistan. The British taxpayer has spent  &#163;250 million in Afghanistan and the lives of many of our soldiers have been lost in trying to stop the drugs supply at source. The result is that the production of drugs in Afghanistan last year went up by 60 per cent. and the price of heroin on the streets of Britain is the lowest that it has ever been. It is a complete myth that the supply of drugs can be stopped at source.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08022876000728">This is an international problem, but we have our problems in Wales as well. However, I am optimistic about our situation. When I walked as a 17-year-old from Grangetown across the docks in Cardiff to Guest, Keen and Nettleford&#146;s nail factory where I worked at that time, the landscape was bleak, with cranes and railway lines, and now the place is transformed. We have a wonderful site&#151;the new bayscape with the Senedd, a jewel of a building.</p>

That is part of what has been going on for the first time for centuries. We have heard some bleak and jaundiced views about devolution, but for the first time for centuries young people, creative, talented and entrepreneurial people, from Wales do not have to come to London to earn their fortune. In fact, the flow is coming the other way, just as the flow of power is coming the other way. That is inevitable, and it will continue. If they say English votes for English Members, so it will happen. The process of devolution will continue, and it cannot be resisted. People may stand in the stream and say no, but the flow will go on from now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="80228-0016.htm_para24"><a name="08022876000730">We will see the results of that in the nation&#146;s growing self-confidence and the growing popularity of devolution. John Shortridge recently gave some figures showing that it was accepted in Wales by a hair&#146;s breadth, but now the opposition has declined. There are people who have been anti-devolution, who I can recall in 1979 being against the campaign and who will never have anything good to say about devolution, but we can look with optimism at what is happening in our country.</p>

The first of those two places, where Welsh life will be in its purest and best form, is the village school in Arfon in Gwynedd. The young children there speak Welsh with great fluency and understanding; language has come down the centuries continuously. It is a miracle that the ancient Welsh language still survives and is still there in such schools. The second place is another school, in Pillgwenlly, Newport. The children there are of every possible hue and from every part of the world. They will be saying their prayers and conducting their St. David&#146;s day ceremonies. During prayers, half the class will join their hands together in the Christian way, and the other half according to the Muslim tradition, but they will be saying the same prayers and singing the same songs in both beautiful languages of Wales.</p>

 It is a delight to follow the hon.

He may not be aware that St. Albans is the home of the Ryder cup&#151;indeed, the beautiful golf course there is known as the Ryder Cup golf course.

We all chewed our leeks and wore our daffodils with pride. Like other hon.

The civil disobedience that I watched as a child in the 1960s&#151;the daubing of the road signs in 1967, for example&#151;was of major concern to my parents.

Although my school was good at encouraging the Welsh language, and taught Welsh, that was not the case at many schools. The 1961 census showed that Welsh was on a huge decline. That has been reversed in a very short time and that is wonderful. Not many other languages could have achieved the renaissance that Welsh has enjoyed so quickly. Unfortunately, however, some of the questionable practices of Meibion Glyndwr and others resulted in cottage burning and the daubing of road signs in a wonderful shade of green. The old joke doing the rounds at the time was, &#147;Come home to a real fire&#151;buy a cottage in Wales!&#148; None of that did Wales&#146;s image any good at all and it made us a lot of enemies as well as friends.</p>

The appointment of regional Ministers, which some would say has been a great asset to Wales and the other regions, has also left us with a gaping hole. I was expecting&#151;I stand to be corrected if I am wrong&#151;that there was going to be a Select Committee for the regions that would give hon. Members the chance to question regional Ministers about what was going on in those regions, and indeed in Wales. That is a broken promise and a breach of trust on the part of the Government. This House should be able to hold the regional Ministers to account. The large amounts of funding that have profited Wales, and other areas, so well are fantastic, but we need to be able to talk to the regional Ministers and ask them exactly what is going on. My constituents&#146; taxes are going towards that funding process, and they would like to be able to find out what the regional Ministers have been up to and assess their roles and value.</p>

 It is an honour and a privilege to follow an Ely girl and to take part in our traditional Welsh affairs debate. It is close to St. David&#146;s day, the day of our patron saint, and a day when we should celebrate all that is Welsh and refer to our successes.</p>

They tended to be general in their subject matter, but I would rather focus my comments on a great success for Wales that was alluded to by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)&#151;the military training academy that is coming to St. Athan. That is something that we can all celebrate: not only the people of south Wales but the people of the whole of Wales. If we get our act together and get this right, not only through the investment coming to us, but through taking advantage of this investment and marketing it to ensure that we maximise the benefits for the people of Wales, it will be a once-in-a-generation opportunity for us all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80228-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08022876000747">I want to set out briefly exactly where we are on the question of the academy. The Government made a welcome and excellent announcement on 31 January, in which they said that they were releasing contracts to allow the lion&#146;s share of package 1 of the defence training review to proceed on course and on time. At moments, I thought that the world had caved in because all the reports we had through the media suggested that something had gone wrong and that Wales had lost something. In fact, this country made a huge gain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80228-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08022876000748">Within the last 24 hours, I have heard comments in this Chamber suggesting that package 1, which represents two thirds of the entire transformation of defence training in this country&#151;all the phase 2 and phase 3 technical training for the tri-service &#151;would not come to St. Athan. Yesterday, in this Chamber, it was suggested that it would not. Let me tell the House that it definitely is. In the words of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, whom I am delighted to see back in the place where he belongs&#151;although he is not there at the moment&#151;package 1 is absolutely safe. </p>

However, it did not, so the announcement on 31 January was that  <br>

the competition for the private finance initiative for package 2 had been withdrawn and closed. That does not mean that it is not coming to south Wales or that it is not coming to St. Athan. The transformation of the skills sets in that package is still going to take place; they will still be modernised, rationalised and relocated. If we get our act together on the investment to begin with, Wales is in a very strong position&#151;pole position&#151;to attract all, or a huge chunk, of the defence training programme.</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman well knows, cross-party support for winning the training contract and bringing it to St. Athan was very strong. He obviously knows something that I do not, however. Is there still a possibility of the second package coming to St. Athan? If there is, he is giving the impression that he knows the time frame involved. My understanding was that the process had been pushed out into the long grass and was probably not going to happen at this stage, or for many years to come.</p>

 Absolutely not. That is why I wanted to make this point today. It is important that we in Wales know exactly where we stand. There is no package 2 because there is no group of skills&#151;personnel management, logistics, languages, photography, policing, intelligence&#151;in a package going out to tender for a PFI. But&#151;and it is a big but&#151;all those skills are going to be rationalised. That was made absolutely clear in a written statement made on 31 January. My point is a simple one. The process will take longer, and the hon. Lady is right in that respect, but there is no reason why that work, or the lion&#146;s share of it, should not be located at St. Athan. In fact, there are not many other places that the work could go to.</p>

<p><a name="st_o370"><a name="08022876000752"><a name="80228-0017.htm_spnew6"><a name="08022876001333"><b>Mrs. Gillan:</b>
 I hope that what the hon. Gentleman is saying is absolutely correct. I understand, not least because the language college is near to my constituency, that one of the problems was that the skills sets could not be found. I would not want him to mislead the House or anyone else by saying that there would be any immediate transfer of any of package 2 to St. Athan. My understanding is that such changes lie many, many years in the future.</p>

 That is not so. The timetable for the transformation under the defence training review, which was arguably the most important part of the Government&#146;s strategic defence review, is the next five years. That applies to package 1, too. My understanding is that the problem was not the skills sets, to which the hon. Lady referred, but affordability and whether savings could be made from economies of scale from the project to base a whole-programme solution on one site. It is important to remain positive and ensure that we maximise our opportunities to get all the investment to Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80228-0017.htm_para14"><a name="08022876000754">We have won two thirds of the total investment under the defence training review. However, more than two thirds of the money and jobs will come to St. Athan. A higher proportion of package 1 is going to relocate to St. Athan. Under package 2, a much smaller proportion would have relocated. We therefore have more than two thirds of the investment.</p>

 In the light of package 2 having been kicked into the long grass, will the hon. Gentleman revise the employment figures that he and other members of the Labour party have been publishing in Wales? The Welsh people have a right to know the number of jobs that is coming to Wales.</p>

<p><a name="st_o373"><a name="08022876000756"><a name="80228-0017.htm_spnew9"><a name="08022876001336"><b>John Smith:</b>
 I would love to do that and I shall do so immediately. I qualify my remarks by saying that the final negotiations are not complete and will not be for some time. I hope that Main Gate 2 will be ready in spring, and we will have a clearer picture then. However, I shall give the revised figures. There will be roughly just over 1,000 trainers&#146; jobs&#151;in training design and general training provision&#151;just over 1,000 support jobs for training on the site; and 1,000 full-time military jobs on the site. That is approximately&#151;we must be careful&#151;3,000 jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80228-0017.htm_para15"><a name="08022876000757">Metrix has used the most conservative calculations to show that it will create at least 1,500 jobs in the wider community of my constituency of Vale of Glamorgan and south Wales generally. Metrix uses a multiplier of 0.5. That means that every new military job&#151;uniform or civilian&#151;that comes to St. Athan will create half a job in the community. The company therefore estimates 1,500 jobs and a total of 4,500. That is down from the original total of 5,500 but I stress that the estimate is conservative. The usual multiplier for military bases that move into an area and provide work is between one and a half and three times the number of military jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="80228-0017.htm_para16"><a name="08022876000758">The number of jobs that we get in Wales depends on us, not Metrix or anybody else. It depends on our preparedness to take up the jobs and the opportunities that come our way as a result of the process. If one read the BBC website on the day of the announcement, one would have believed that we had lost out. The calculation that I explained does not include the training of at least 6,500 military engineers every year at St. Athan. The jobs that that will create are not even factored in. It is a huge opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="st_o374"><a name="08022876000759"><a name="80228-0017.htm_spnew10"><a name="08022876001337"><b>Mark Pritchard:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman mentioned 1,000 trainers. Is he aware of a recent PCS survey, which revealed that 98 per cent. of trainers in other parts of the country who have been asked to relocate to Wales are either unwilling or unable to do so? In the national interest, it is important that the Government provide clarity on the issue. It is no good having trainees in Wales if there are no trainers.</p>

<p><a name="st_o375"><a name="08022876000760"><a name="80228-0017.htm_spnew11"><a name="08022876001338"><b>John Smith:</b>
 I am fully aware of that. We must consider the age profile of existing trainers, excellent though they are. Although the existing training is excellent, it is not what we want for the future. That is the problem. Training must change in its approach and in the technologies that we use. The methodology, too, must change. The old skills training is no good and the reason is the age profile. Nearly all the trainers are ex-military personnel who have transferred to civilian work, so they are getting on a bit. We are talking about a five-year programme, so how old will they be in five years&#146; time? However, a five-year recruitment period and having to train people was always factored in from day one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80228-0017.htm_para17"><a name="08022876000761">We hear about 5,000 or 6,000 on the jobs front, but that is a very modest estimate indeed from package 1, and we may still get the rest of the investment. We are currently talking about &#163;11 billion coming to Wales in a private finance initiative. If we get everything, the figure could be as much as &#163;16 billion or &#163;17 billion, which is a huge amount. Some &#163;60 million a year is going into the local economy in direct spend. But let me make what might be quite a startling announcement: that is not the real attraction of the investment and ensuring that we, the Welsh, get most of it is not the real challenge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80228-0017.htm_para18"><a name="08022876000762">Today&#146;s debate has been excellent. A number of colleagues in all parts of the House, including the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Davies) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), stressed the importance of upskilling the labour force, especially in technical skills, to allow us to compete with the rest of the world. The real attraction of the investment is that St. Athan in south Wales will be the largest centre of excellence for providing training in technical skills that are directly transferable to civilian work. As part of the military covenant, the qualifications that our servicemen and women will acquire, and which they justly deserve, will be exactly the same as those in engineering&#151;let us remember that that means aeronautical, mechanical and electronic engineering&#151;and ICT. Those are all the things that have been mentioned this afternoon and in which Wales will become the largest centre of excellence in Europe. It will become the second largest centre of excellence for such training in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="80228-0017.htm_para19"><a name="08022876000763">It is an honour to listen to my old friend the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent, because in a previous incarnation I had the privilege of trying to attract footloose investment into his beautiful constituency and into the whole of the beautiful county of Gwent. I therefore have an intimate knowledge of the barriers to attracting footloose investment into our country. We need high value-added footloose investment. Traditionally, we did well in mineral extraction and metal manufacture, but the high skills involved in those industries did not translate very well into the manufacture of white goods or the modern factory. Those jobs were reasonably well paid for Wales and solved our unemployment problem, but were not very good, in terms of under-employment and not upskilling people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80228-0017.htm_para20"><a name="08022876000764">That is the real challenge that our country faces. We have a unique opportunity to present ourselves as one of the largest centres of excellence in the world for some of the most sought-after technical skills in the world. That is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that we should grasp with both hands and ensure that we get as much as we can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80228-0017.htm_para21"><a name="08022876000765">We talk about jobs and investment, and there is not one company in the world that will not be interested in what is going on in south Wales, because it will achieve a critical mass of skills training. It does not matter that the training is in uniforms. The tutors will not be in uniforms for ever, just as the old RAF St. Athan and the excellent skills provided there in deep repair and aircraft maintenance attracted companies such as British Airways. It is no accident that British Airways is at Rhoose airport. It is there because of the centre of excellence that was just up the road&#151;frankly, it used to poach people from just up the road. It is no accident that General Electric went to Nantgarw. It went there because of the skills training at RAF St. Athan.</p>

They have had those experiences in their dealings with private businesses and&#151;significantly, given that the long-established provisions of the  1993 Act apply to the public sector&#151;they have also had problems with the public sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para4"><a name="08022876000777">People are also having problems using Welsh with third parties. Some hon. Members will know that the provisions of 1993 Act apply to third parties and private companies acting on behalf of public bodies. It remains problematic, as the third parties are not carrying out the language schemes approved by the Welsh Language Board for public bodies. In that respect, the 1993 Act is not working properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para5"><a name="08022876000778">All that is quite apart from the denial of workers&#146; rights to use Welsh in the workplace, as we saw unfortunately in the Thomas Cook affair last year. There is a long history to this problem and my hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy will remember the Brewer Spinks case in the 1960s. Those misunderstandings in the private sector can be resolved, as in the Thomas Cook case, very amicably, when the nature of the problem is appreciated and senior managers get involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para6"><a name="08022876000779">There remains a fair way to go. When public bodies are launching new documents or a new service, I frequently write to them, asking simply &#147;Where is the Welsh version?&#148;. All too often, I am met by embarrassment and excuses, although that is a good deal better than it used to be. When I first started to take an interest in language issues, I would have been met by hostility rather than embarrassment and excuses. I do not want to whinge too much, as there is often no need to write to ask for the Welsh version nowadays, as in many cases it turns up automatically. That is progress. I am not saying that we need to change everything today or tomorrow; we are talking about a process that will probably last many, many years.</p>

Members&#146; attention to a report that I commissioned about two years ago, which has just been published. It is called, &#147;Creu Cymru Gwbl Ddwyieithog&#148;, &#147;Creating an Entirely Bilingual Wales&#148;. It was written by Dr. Kathryn Jones of Cwmni Iaith&#151;a group of entirely independent academics, so there is no party political content in the report. As hon. Members who have looked at it will know, it is a hefty piece of work, comprising some 38 recommendations as to ways forward. I have distributed the report widely and I hope that its welcome by the Welsh Language Board and the Welsh Assembly Government will be replicated elsewhere. I hope that we will have a proper debate about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para9"><a name="08022876000786">Finally, let me add another detail. It is all very well commissioning large reports from experts. I was crossing the maes&#151;the square&#151;in Caernarfon late one night, returning from the office. As I saw all those people out there enjoying themselves, I wondered how one could reach them. It is all very well for experts and politicians to discuss this, but what about ordinary people? I struck on the idea of what I have called &#147;Wikideddfu&#148;&#151;wiki law-making, which is a user-generated site where people can add their thoughts on any matter of legislation, although it is about language at the moment. It is an edited site. If, for example, the Secretary of State were to put down his thoughts I could edit them, and he could re-edit them into their original form. After three months or so, we will see what the people have said. If I may make a modest claim, I believe it is the first site of its kind in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08022876000787">As those who are familiar with Wikipedia will know, entries are generated by users and we trust people to correct any inaccuracies.

That is the principle, at any rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08022876000788">I hope that we shall have a continual conversation on Wikideddfu over the next three months. I commend it to Members, and to anyone else in Wales who wants to contribute to this interesting debate.</p>

 Thank you for giving me the opportunity to contribute, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I apologise for not being present earlier. I was serving on the Committee considering the Education and Skills Bill, and I reminded the Committee that there are a number of ways in which the National Assembly can exercise its powers. For instance, it can use framework powers to introduce measures similar to Bills such as the Education and Skills Bill in Wales. It is entirely appropriate for the Assembly to have that option, and I know that many people in Wales will look to it eagerly to determine how the issues that the Committee has debated at such length will be dealt with there. The Assembly can apply its framework powers to a number of Bills, and I hope it will exercise its right to determine the appropriate form in which they can exist in Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08022876000792">We are very concerned about climate change at the moment, and we look forward to the Climate Change Bill, which will be introduced shortly. It contains a section on adaptation and mitigation, a subject with which some people may not be familiar. There are many different projections about the effect of climate change, but it is generally agreed that weather patterns are likely to become much more unpredictable, making events such as flooding ever more likely. There was a salutary warning to all of us last summer, when we saw pictures of those devastating floods on our television screens. I for one began to think more seriously about how we could cope with such events in our own areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08022876000793">I know that the Environment Agency in Wales has used the most up-to-date techniques to produce new maps pinpointing with great accuracy the areas that are likely to be affected by flooding, be it river or coastal flooding. A fortnight ago I visited the agency in Cross Hands to see what it was doing to identify areas at risk and to improve flood defences. Its staff explained the flood alert system, which can send messages to the telephones of people living in high-risk areas to warn them of possible flooding. I shall meet agency representatives again next week at the Llanelli flooding forum, a body that I have set up, to discuss how we can do more to increase awareness of flooding, and of the Environment Agency&#146;s system for dealing with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para14"><a name="08022876000794">Last summer we also saw frightening pictures of water encroaching on power substations and flooding ambulance stations. That brought home vividly the need to consider the relocation of such installations to areas that will remain free of flooding. Some of them are reserved matters&#151;for instance, a police headquarters is the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government&#151;while others, such as ambulance stations, are the responsibility of the Assembly Government, and organisations such as the utilities are in the private sector. This is a clear example of the need for joined-up thinking, and I call on the Secretary of State to raise awareness of flood risk and ensure that there are plans to allow the safeguarding or even the relocation of strategic structures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para15"><a name="08022876000795">We also need to make sure that we plan future development with our eyes clearly opened to the flooding risks. Now that the Environment Agency is a statutory consultee in planning matters, it gives detailed advice  <br>

on planning issues to local councils and to the Assembly Government. Currently, however, water companies are not statutory consultees, which is why, when I spoke on Second Reading of the Planning Bill, I emphasised to the Minister the crucial role of companies such as Dwr Cymru, Welsh Water, in assessing whether our existing infrastructure could cope with increased load from new developments. Clearly, where the infrastructure cannot cope, that can greatly increase the risk of flooding from river water and sea water, as well as foul water flooding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para16"><a name="08022876000796">I was delighted that the Minister replied that it was the intention that water companies should become statutory consultees. I very much hope that when the Assembly uses its powers to deal with the measures for Wales arising from the Planning Bill, Dwr Cymru  will become a statutory consultee for planning matters in Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08022876000797">I wish to refer to some important constituency matters that are relevant to the whole of Wales. We have a long tradition of heavy industry in my area, as do many areas of south Wales and some parts of the north. It is extremely important that we make absolutely certain that we provide the right sort of environment for these companies, which are facing fierce global competition. I call on the Secretary of State to do everything in his power to ensure that we create a level playing field and a welcoming environment that gives companies the confidence to invest further. We have seen a dramatic fall in unemployment in Llanelli over the past 10 years, but we cannot be complacent. We know that every company must plan and think ahead and we want investment to come to us, and not go elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para18"><a name="08022876000798">I would like to emphasise the importance of creating the right environment to encourage investment. Corus in my constituency has up-to-date equipment and, at the home of the first canned beer on this side of the Atlantic, we now have a sophisticated plant producing all manner of packaging. We also have the company Schaefler, which makes car components. It has taken the skills agenda on board and done a tremendous amount of upskilling of its work force. By doing that, it has been able to diversify and compete against its sister factories in other countries to win contracts for Wales. I would like to emphasise the need for us to develop the skills agenda in Wales because it is quite clearly the way forward for such companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para19"><a name="08022876000799">I would also like to mention a small company called Picton Sports, which has been able to make wonderful logos on t-shirts and jumpers for sports organisations locally. But, most excitingly, it is now exporting to Taiwan, a real achievement. This is an example of a new industry and we need to be absolutely certain that we do not help such firms only in the initial phases, when they are struggling to establish themselves. We must help them to expand and cope with some of the complications that they may encounter when they try to export across the world. These must be our priorities for ensuring the strength of the Welsh economy in the future.</p>

 I am very pleased to provide the final Back-Bench contribution to this afternoon&#146;s St. David&#146;s day debate,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="28 Feb 2008">

<notus-date day="28" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>28 Feb 2008 : Column 1332</b><br>
which has been interesting. I was particularly impressed with the speech made by the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Davies). It is fantastic that we have people like him in this House&#151;slightly different MPs who are free from the complexities of carrying a party label and can be a pure and authentic voice for their communities. That was demonstrated in his strong contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para20"><a name="08022876000801">I was also impressed by the speech made by my neighbour in west Wales, the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire (Nick Ainger), who is no longer in his place. He brought his expertise to bear, particularly in his analysis of the impact of the increase in fuel prices on our community in west Wales in terms of the increase in fuel poverty and the impact on the private sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para21"><a name="08022876000802">For me, the man of the match is the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), who made a powerful speech warning of the dangers of separatism. No matter where one stands in the devolution debate, we must take that message on board. There is no question in my mind but that separatism forms the beating heart of much of the current rhetoric from Cardiff bay, but it will provide the glide path to poverty and decline for Wales. We are stronger as part of a strong United Kingdom. That does not mean that I am against devolution&#151;I am not a Conservative party member who calls for the abolition of the Welsh Assembly&#151;but I sign up to the warning expressed by the right hon. Member for Islwyn this afternoon about the dangers of separatism for Wales in the long term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para22"><a name="08022876000803">I want to discuss two challenges for the Welsh economy. One of them has already been discussed in some detail&#151; namely, the skills of the work force in Wales. I want to discuss what needs to happen to upskill the work force to prepare us for the challenges of globalisation so that Wales can benefit from the opportunities offered by globalisation and the new kinds of jobs that will be available in post-industrial countries, such as Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para23"><a name="08022876000804">The fall in unemployment in Wales in recent years is a good thing. Conservative Members do not deny the long-term fall in structural unemployment in Wales in the past 10 to 15 years, which is welcome. However, we must recognise the stubbornly high level of people claiming incapacity benefit and the problem of worklessness. Office for National Statistics figures suggest that in the past 12 months the proportion of people who are economically inactive in Wales has edged up to almost 25 per cent.&#151;almost 25 per cent. of the work force in Wales is economically inactive, when we near as damn it have full employment in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para24"><a name="08022876000805">As for young people who are not in education, employment or training, I cannot understand how, at a time when more and more jobs are being created in both the private and public sectors, a growing pool of young people in this country, and particularly in Wales, are effectively doing nothing useful with their lives. I do not understand that situation, which is one of the challenges of our age that we must tackle. Now that he has returned to the Front Bench at the Wales Office, I encourage the new Secretary of State to discuss the issue in detail with his colleagues at Cardiff bay and here at Westminster to focus efforts on tackling that hard-core of young people who indulge in antisocial  <br>

behaviour and criminality, which have been mentioned this afternoon. We need to direct resources to tackle that problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para25"><a name="08022876000806">The other challenge for the economy concerns infrastructure. I disagree with the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire, who said that investment has been going into infrastructure in Wales. Yes, investment has gone into certain places, but we have not seen high quality, new infrastructure, which is needed throughout the Principality. Every year, the Institute of Civil Engineers produces a state of the nation report that analyses progress on improving infrastructure up and down the country. Every year, it identifies critical weaknesses in infrastructure in Wales. If I can be parochial for a moment, I shall point out that one critical weakness in Welsh infrastructure is the A40, which runs through my constituency and connects the east-west corridor through Wales to Ireland via the ferry service from Fishguard to Rosslare. The A40 is part of the strategic trans-European road network. People from Ireland have told me that the worst section of the strategic trans-European route is the section of the A40 that runs through Pembrokeshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para26"><a name="08022876000807">There has for many years been a campaign drawing attention to the need to dual the A40&#151;to upgrade that bit of road infrastructure. Unfortunately, despite pleas from the private sector and all the principal employers in Pembrokeshire for that piece of road to be dualled, the Welsh Assembly still closes its ears. It is not interested in discussing that. I ask the new Secretary of State to raise the issue with his colleagues in the Welsh Assembly. It forms an important part of the infrastructure of Wales, linking not only to the ferry port in Fishguard but to Milford Haven, which is now one of the UK&#146;s most important oil and gas ports with the two new liquefied natural gas terminals being built there, and to one of the most exciting new tourism projects in the UK: the Bluestone project in the constituency of the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire. That will create 600 jobs, and it will bring new people to Wales, which will place further burdens on the road infrastructure, so there is a need to improve it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80228-0018.htm_para27"><a name="08022876000808">Let me turn from physical infrastructure to the need for virtual infrastructure, and specifically broadband. I know we have been around the houses on this matter over the years, but there is still a problem in rural Wales with lack of access to broadband. The Government said at the start of the week that they needed to look at their role in the roll-out of super high-speed broadband throughout the UK, but parts of Wales are still stuck trying to get access even to simple, slow broadband. British Telecom has received significant sums of public money over the past 10 years&#151;tens of millions of pounds from the taxpayer&#151;to enable it to upgrade exchanges and to help in rolling out broadband in rural areas. In Wales, it has received more than &#163;5 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="80228-0019.htm_para0"><a name="08022876000809">Back in 2002, BT was claiming that thanks to the upgrading of exchanges by 2005 there would be 100 per cent. potential access to broadband in Wales. That has not happened because achieving that is about not only upgrading the exchanges, but improving the lines from exchanges to houses. Far too many houses in rural Wales are forced to have shared lines&#151;a digital access carrier system that prevents them from accessing broadband. There is an important question that needs  <br>

to be addressed: if true economic revitalisation is to come to hard-to-reach, peripheral areas such as mine, broadband will be part of the solution, and there is serious work to do to make sure that those parts of Wales can access such technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="80228-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08022876000810">Finally, let me say a few words about fuel prices. Last week, I spoke to two major hauliers in my constituency. It has become unfashionable in this place to speak up in defence of the haulage industry when there is so much emphasis on climate change, but we need to speak up for it. Road haulage is not going to go away, but British haulage companies could go away, to be replaced by foreign competitors who are able to buy fuel with significantly lower rates of duty attached. The last time I was at Cardiff West service station, it looked like a lorry park for Willy Betz as there were so many lorries from Germany there. There is an increasing number of foreign lorries and haulage operators on Welsh roads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="80228-0019.htm_para2"><a name="08022876000811">Welsh haulage companies are finding it increasingly hard to compete in what is a very difficult marketplace. One of the reasons why it is difficult is the huge increase in fuel costs. Let me make another plea to the Secretary of State: when he discusses potential changes in the Budget with his Cabinet colleagues, will he caution against the extra 2p increase in fuel duty in April? Welsh hauliers need that like they need a hole in the head at this time. There is a good case for holding off from that increase in duty.</p>

 This has been a typically stimulating, diverse and wide-ranging St. David&#146;s day debate. We have heard about matters as diverse as the Llanelli flooding forum and the fascinating-sounding Wikideddfu website, which I assure the House I shall log on to the instant this debate is over.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="80228-0019.htm_para3"><a name="08022876000813">The debate was predictably dominated by devolution and the delivery of public services. Those issues were encapsulated in the Secretary of State&#146;s remark that the system for conferring devolution upon the Welsh Assembly is complicated, but the importance is not in the process but in the services delivered by it. Everyone in the House would echo that&#151;some, perhaps, more loudly than others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80228-0019.htm_para4"><a name="08022876000814">It was a pleasure to see the right hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) in the Chamber again, and I add my welcome to him. He will perhaps be surprised to hear that I cannot adopt my usual abrasive style when responding to his remarks, because I agreed with a great many of them. He rightly said that it is necessary that Wales should grow the private sector, mentioning that he wished it to account for 55 per cent. of Welsh GDP. The Welsh economy&#146;s reliance on the public sector over the years has been marked. It is therefore strange that the Welsh Assembly Government, in fulfilling their obligations on the Welsh economy, decided to abolish the Welsh Development Agency, which was a paragon in attracting inward investment to Wales, and absorb it into the mechanics of the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>

costs&#151;the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) echoed the fact that Wales needs high-tech, high quality jobs. To that extent, the right hon. Member for Neath was right to stress the importance of universities. Those of us on the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs who visited China last autumn saw how its universities sector is an integral part of the Chinese economy&#146;s development. We could learn much from that. He will be surprised to hear it, but he and I are ad idem on a great many matters this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80228-0019.htm_para6"><a name="08022876000816">The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) made an interesting speech in which he referred to the need for &#147;watertight&#148; devolution in order to withstand an imminent Conservative Government. The suggestion appeared to be that the Liberal Democrats wish powers to be stockpiled in Cardiff bay to prepare for the day when the evil Tories take over once again. He also uttered the memorable remark, which will be entered in the big boy&#146;s book of Liberal Democrat quotations, &#147;I am all for making the present system work, but I am also all for changing it.&#148; Only a Liberal Democrat could utter that remark with a straight face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80228-0019.htm_para7"><a name="08022876000817">The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire also referred to the need to review the Barnett formula. At that stage, an interesting internal debate took place between him and his colleagues, the hon. Members for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) and for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), about how that could best be achieved. We did not intrude too much on their private grief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80228-0019.htm_para8"><a name="08022876000818">Typically, the hon. Member for Aberavon (Dr. Francis) made an interesting contribution. As we have heard, he is Chair of the Welsh Affairs Committee. As a member of that Committee, I value his chairmanship and I pay tribute to his hard work over the past months, particularly given the extra work imposed on the Committee by the process of scrutinising legislative competence orders. That is an important function, but we are going through a learning curve. He said as much when he remarked that, like the French revolution, it was too early to tell how it was progressing&#151;I think that is what he said. The learning curve is a steep one and we have not yet negotiated it fully. The first legislative competence order was a difficult process, and parliamentarians were heavily criticised by certain members of the Welsh Assembly Government for not nodding it through. I do not believe that it is any part of the function of parliamentarians to rubber stamp legislative competence orders, and I suspect that the Secretary of State and I are at one on that. It is necessary that LCOs receive proper scrutiny from this place, but they are only one of 13 methods so far identified of conferring competence on the Welsh Assembly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80228-0019.htm_para9"><a name="08022876000819">The other major weapon that is used to confer competence is the framework power contained in UK-wide bills. In that respect, I wish to draw the Secretary of State&#146;s attention to the troubling experience of the Planning Bill. It now contains Welsh framework powers, but they were not in the Bill when it was first introduced or on Second Reading. In fact, they did not appear until amendments were tabled towards the end of the Committee stage, which ran to 18 sittings. Those powers, therefore, had less than half an hour&#146;s scrutiny in Committee and I am sure that everyone would agree that that is not  <br>

acceptable. I entreat the Secretary of State to consider that and see whether the process can be improved in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="80228-0019.htm_para10"><a name="08022876000820">We then heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies) who made a wide-ranging speech, covering such matters as the local authority funding formula, the health service in his constituency and policing. He spoke with some authority as not only a member of the Home Affairs Committee, but a special constable&#151;and an assiduous special constable at that.</p>

Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire (Nick Ainger) referred to the concerns of his constituency and fuel poverty. He said that fuel poverty was likely to increase and suggested that there should be no surcharge on prepayment meters. He called, possibly controversially, for a top-sliced levy on the excess profits of energy companies. No doubt the Secretary of State will consider that and refer the matter to his Cabinet colleagues.</p>

Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) also made a wide-ranging speech and was assiduous in making contributions to the debate throughout the afternoon. He referred to his childhood in Wales and to his experience as a Marches MP. He also mentioned the importance of tourism as an integral part of the Welsh economy. Indeed, only this week, the Wales Tourism Alliance held a reception in the House. British tourism week is also fast approaching. It is perhaps unfortunate that the Welsh Assembly Government decided in their wisdom to absorb the Wales tourist board into the apparatus of government, so that we now have VisitWales. We also have VisitBritain, which is operated by the same people who operate EnjoyEngland. The Wales Tourism Alliance suggested that there was a conflict of interest between VisitWales and VisitBritain, and perhaps that matter could be revisited. <i> [</i><i> Laughter.</i><i> ]</i></p>

Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) gave the impression of not being a wholehearted supporter of devolution, but perhaps I do him an injustice. I agreed with him entirely when he stressed the Britishness of the people of Wales. I am sure that almost every hon. Member would agree that we are entirely comfortable with the concept of being both British and Welsh or, if one prefers, Welsh and British. It does not really matter in which order one puts them; it is very much the same thing. Possibly there are a couple of exceptions in the Chamber, but that is their private grief. He also said that we should not be doing too much navel-gazing about constitutional matters in Wales, and that we need to invest in upskilling. He is, of course, entirely right. He ended with dire warnings about the threats posed by separatism to the integrity of the United Kingdom.</p>

However, he did make a perfectly valid point about post office closures. He is right that particularly in rural areas, the post office is the focal point of the community.

He is entirely right that in north Wales we depend heavily on cross-border services, particularly medical services. I echo what he says&#151;we rely on the services of such important institutions as the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt hospital in Oswestry, Alder Hey children&#146;s hospital, the Walton centre in Fazakerley, the Clatterbridge centre, the Christie hospital and so on&#151;but I remind him gently, as I did in my intervention, that the concerns about Walton were generated by remarks made by the Labour Health Minister in the Welsh Assembly. Perhaps, as he has such influence, he could have a gentle word with her and point out that the concerns have not gone away entirely.</p>

He also banged the drum for the south Wales valleys and said that they had great tourism potential. The hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) made a speech in which he referred to his constituency and the exciting pioneering work done by Welsh researchers in biotechnology. He also mentioned his concerns about drugs and drug policy. My hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans (Anne Main) spoke about her childhood in Wales and the regeneration of Cardiff, which we all welcome. However, she sounded a cautionary note when she referred to social problems that she had observed and the need for stronger policing. The hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (John Smith) discussed the important development of the military training academy at St. Athan and the opportunities that it would afford for the local economy. He has campaigned for that development for some years.</p>

We in the Conservative party yield to no one in our support for the Welsh language&#151;it was that distinguished Welsh Conservative, Lord Roberts of Conway, who steered the Welsh Language Act 1993 through Parliament&#151;but I must say despite that fact that we must be careful that any further developments in Welsh language legislation do not have an impact on business or amount to non-tariff barriers to private enterprise.</p>

 It gives me great pleasure to speak as a Front Bencher in the Wales day debate for the first time. It is a great privilege to be a Welsh Member of Parliament, and an enormous privilege to address the hon. Members present today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80228-0019.htm_para20"><a name="08022876000833">There has been much talk of the St. David&#146;s day event held earlier today in the chapel of St. Mary Undercroft. The preface of the notes for the event mentions  St. David. He followed the Egyptian desert monks&#146; rule, which had a strong emphasis on hard work, abstinence from alcohol and refraining from unnecessary speech. There has certainly been no unnecessary speech today, there has been no alcohol in the Chamber, and there has been a lot of hard work. This has been a temperate, well-considered and well-informed debate. As our discussions have demonstrated, there is an enormous amount going on in Wales to celebrate. These are challenging but interesting times, and Wales is in an excellent position to weather the times ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80228-0019.htm_para21"><a name="08022876000834">Partnerships are the key. The Government, working alongside the Welsh Assembly Government&#151;and local government, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said&#151;have put in place 1,700 more teachers and 5,700 more school support staff than there were in 1998. There are 500 more consultants and over 8,000 more qualified nurses than in 1997, and 129,000 more people in employment in Wales than there were in 1997. I am not complacent, but it was refreshing that Members from all parts of the Chamber recognised today that many good things are going on in Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="80228-0019.htm_para22"><a name="08022876000835">I shall try to do justice, in a very short time, to all hon. Members who spoke, so I ask hon. Members to bear with me, and I apologise if I miss out any points. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was the first to speak, and he did so eloquently. He paid tribute, as did others, to my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) and the many kinds of work that he has done in government. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State also touched on the St. David&#146;s day event. At one point, it looked as though the debate was turning into &#147;A Question of Sport&#148;, as we talked about the Olympics and the Ryder cup among other things, but it was very enjoyable.</p>

Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) talked about the important role of servicemen and woman, and there is wholehearted agreement on that point across the House. She also talked about support for the defence training academy. I assure her that the Wales Office and the Welsh Assembly Government fully support moving ahead with that proposal. She also talked about a new chapter in the devolution process&#151;something that we find exciting and challenging&#151;and challenges for the Wales Office. To echo sentiments expressed today, our Department, like Wales, is &#147;small but clever&#148;.</p>

and the good measures that we have brought forward, including pre-briefings with Welsh Assembly Government and Wales Office Ministers, Public Bill Committee pre-scrutiny and evidence sessions, and the provision of ample time in Committee to discuss, through the usual channels, Welsh MPs sitting on Committees for Bills in which there are framework powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80228-0019.htm_para25"><a name="08022876000838">The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham raised the issue of Welsh identity. As many others have said, I am content to say that I am Welsh, British and European; that is sufficient. I do not agonise over it at all, and I do not think that Members need do so. The hon. Lady mentioned the Welsh-language paper, <i> Y Byd</i><i> . </i>The Welsh Assembly Government announced on 5 February that it will provide &#163;600,000 in the next three years to fulfil the commitment in the &#147;One Wales&#148; document. That is in addition to the &#163;173,000 currently being spent by the Welsh Assembly Government, through the Welsh Books Council, to support all Welsh-language newspapers and magazines. We will see what comes forward as a result of that.</p>

Friend the Member for Neath rightly recognised the importance of Labour&#146;s investment in the public sector in Wales, and challenged the private sector to grow through ambition and with support from Government for competitiveness and innovation. He spoke about new &#147;Merthyrs&#148; for this century, competing not on cost, but on high skills, innovation, investment in research and development, the buy-in from the university sector, the environmental industries, and internationalism. His speech reflected the determination of my right hon. Friend and of the Government to tackle the legacy of economic inactivity, a theme taken up by many other speakers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80228-0019.htm_para27"><a name="08022876000840">My right hon.

It was an excellent foray from the Labour Benches and a demonstration of his continuing political and intellectual intent and ability to drive Wales forward. He rightly praised, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon (Dr. Francis), the excellent work of Neath Port Talbot council, and called for a can-do Wales. That came from a can-do Member of the House.</p>

I agree with the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire about building up the partnership. Part of that is respecting the devolution settlement, and deepening, not broadening it.

We are determined to deliver for pensioners in Wales and we will continue to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08022876000845">The new Order in Council process has been the subject of some discussion. As my hon. Friend said, we were at an early stage of this new democratic process. I know that the Select Committee and the Wales Office are keen to monitor the process and the volume and see how we can make improvements along the way. We are all agreed on the necessity of making the process work. There is no better example of the importance of Welsh MPs to this place and of the role of this place in scrutiny than the work that is being carried out by all members of the Welsh Affairs Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08022876000846">The hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies) made a passionate case for English votes for English laws. We will have to agree to disagree on that. Some of the arguments for that were demolished, I understand, by the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). The armed forces and historic regiments, particularly in Monmouth, were also covered by the hon. Member for Monmouth in his contribution. He is right to say that we should not only treasure, but properly safeguard the servicemen and women in those regiments.</p>

He welcomed the Flanagan report, in which there is much to be welcomed, and he offered a couple of interesting suggestions for improvements on it, which I am sure will have been heard during the debate and by Home Office Ministers. He also spoke about vocational skills in prisons. We are concerned to ensure that those who go through our prison system come out with the skills that they need to go back into wider society.</p>

He majored on renewable energy and what we can make of it, which is a critical issue for Wales. The Wales Office, like the Welsh Assembly Government, is committed to driving that forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para8"><a name="08022876000850">The hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) talked about bullying in schools. All schools in Wales must by law have a written anti-bullying policy and the Assembly issues a document entitled &#147;Respecting Others: Anti-Bullying Guidance&#148; to all schools and LEAs. It is a major issue and the Assembly Government are keen to continue improving the way in which they tackle it. He also talked about cross-border issues and promoting tourism in Wales, which is close to my heart. I am sure that as he travels around Wales, not least in his role as a member of the Welsh Affairs Committee and with his knowledge of Wales, he will recognise in the dramatic changes in the architecture of Wales and the focus on the big country of Wales what great potential we have for driving forward tourism. He also welcomed the significant investment in rail in Wales. We have issues with rail in Wales, but we have invested in the valleys lines and in north and south Wales. For the first time in years we are putting money into rail.</p>

Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) talked about not having policy difference for the sake of it, and he is absolutely right. What is important is the value added; the difference that is made on the streets of Blackwood in Gwent and of Maesteg. He elaborated on his theme of a constitutional cul-de-sac, and he emphasised the need to focus on bread and butter issues on Blackwood high street. He talked tellingly about the importance of using objective 1 money to drive forward earnings, employment and the economy. I thoroughly agree with him. We have to make good use of it. My right hon. Friend alluded to Cicero, which we do not often hear in the Chamber. A senator remarked that when Cicero spoke they would say how well he had spoken, but when Demosthenes spoke they said, &#147;Let&#146;s march.&#148; My right hon. Friend combines both attributes, getting people to the barricades to make a difference on the streets of Blackwood.</p>

 I feel privileged to be given the opportunity to raise this extremely important issue tonight. Concentrated solar power is a concept of literally dazzling simplicity. It is an idea so simple, and with such extraordinary promise as a means of power generation, that it seems astonishing that in Europe we are only just waking up to its potential, more than 20 years after its first use in California.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para19"><a name="08022876000864">The technology is very straightforward. A CSP plant uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight and create heat. The resultant heat is then used to drive turbines and generators, just like in a conventional power station. Heat can also be stored in melted salts so that electricity generation may continue at night or on cloudy days. For once, no amount of hyperbole is excessive. CSP represents, as <i> The Guardian</i> stated recently,</p>
<a name="80228-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="08022876000921"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A vast source of energy that holds the promise of a carbon-free, nuclear-free electrical future for the whole of Europe, if not the world.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para20"><a name="08022876000865">I could not put it better myself. In terms of its scale, therefore, CSP is a world away from the concept of solar photovoltaic technology such as the domestic roof-top solar panels with which we are more familiar in this country. The only issue with CSP is that it needs direct sunshine, and lots of it, to maximise its potential. Needless to say, it is not a technology that we will be seeing too much of in Dartford&#151;or even, dare I say it, in Croydon, North.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para21"><a name="08022876000866">Europe&#146;s first commercially operating CSP plant has just opened in Spain, just outside Seville. It currently generates about 11 MW of electricity&#151;enough to power up to 6,000 homes&#151;but its operators hope that it will eventually produce sufficient power to meet the needs of Seville&#146;s 600,000 residents. The deserts of north Africa, however, offer us the greatest potential as far as CSP is concerned. Each year, each square kilometre of hot desert receives solar energy equivalent to 1.5 million barrels of oil. Indeed, it has been calculated that we could produce the world&#146;s entire electricity needs by covering less than 1 per cent. of the world&#146;s deserts with CSP plants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para22"><a name="08022876000867">Desert-based CSP plants have the added advantage of allowing fresh water for crop cultivation and land irrigation to be created through the desalination of sea water using simply the waste heat from the CSP plants. The partially shaded areas under the solar mirrors also have many potential uses, including crop cultivation. It is even possible to imagine some energy-intensive industries choosing to locate in deserts to take advantage of CSP technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para23"><a name="08022876000868">The key to realising CSP&#146;s potential, however, is finding a reliable and above all cost-effective means of getting the power from the deserts to major population centres in Europe and elsewhere. The technology does now exist. Using high-voltage direct current, or HVDC, transmission lines, it is feasible and cost-effective to transmit electricity for more than 3,000 km. With modern high-voltage DC transmission, only about 3 per cent. of power is lost for each 1,000 km.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="28 Feb 2008">

<notus-date day="28" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>28 Feb 2008 : Column 1344</b><br>
That means, for instance, that solar electricity could be imported from north Africa to London with a loss of power of only about 10 per cent. That compares extremely favourably with the 50 to 70 per cent. losses that have been accepted for many years in conventional alternating-current grids. Moreover, it has been calculated that 90 per cent. of the world&#146;s population live within 2,700 km of a hot desert and could be supplied with solar energy from there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para24"><a name="08022876000869">The Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy Co-operation, or TREC&#151;a group of scientists and engineers in Europe, the middle east and north Africa&#151;is trying to identify ways of exploiting the energy-generating potential of hot deserts. TREC is calling for the creation of an HVDC supergrid to enable the transmission across the region of energy derived from north African CSP plants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para25"><a name="08022876000870">Like a significant number of hon. Members, I strongly support the case for an HVDC grid. Such a supergrid could allow energy from other renewable sources to be transmitted across Europe. Britain could put in wind power, Norway hydropower and central Europe biomass and geothermal power. An HVDC supergrid could also be integrated relatively easily with existing HVAC&#151;high-voltage alternating current&#151;transmission grids. The potential is so large that one may consider the possibility of extending the use of clean solar electricity into areas where gas, oil and coal are currently the dominant sources of energy. It would, for example, be perfectly feasible to expand the use of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, extend the electrification of railways, make greater use of electricity-powered heat pumps, and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para26"><a name="08022876000871">Apart from the importing of solar electricity from desert regions, the proposed HVDC supergrid has several other advantages. The chief one is the security of energy supply: a shortfall in any one area could be met by spare capacity in another area or another country. It would also reduce wastage: surplus power in any one area could simply be transferred to where it is needed. Conversely, the impact of the variability of certain renewable technologies such as wind power could be reduced by being able to integrate supply across a wide area. The supergrid could also allow the UK to become a net exporter of clean electricity from our wide array of renewable sources, such as wind, waves and tidal power, which we possess in abundance. The economic opportunities that that would create for the UK are considerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para27"><a name="08022876000872">Of course, set-up costs are considerable. The estimated cost of a Europe, middle east and north Africa-wide HVDC supergrid comprising 20 transmission lines of about 5 GW each is about &#8364;45 billion, while the approximate cost of two 5 GW transmission lines between north Africa and the UK is about &#8364;5 billion. However, given that those costs would be shared among several countries and spread over many years, the cost to the UK Government would be reasonable. It is an investment that will begin to look more and more attractive over time as the cost of generating power from renewable sources falls&#151;assuming, of course, that the right package of incentives is put in place&#151;while world oil prices look certain to rise still further as oil becomes scarcer and more difficult to extract, quite apart from the obvious imperative to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para28"><a name="08022876000873">There is a pressing need for concerted governmental action to promote CSP and pave the way for an HVDC grid. Although CSP plants are being built and HVDC transmission lines are being installed, actions and changes in policies are needed to remove unnecessary obstacles and smooth the path for such developments. Those changes are needed mainly at the level of the European Union or beyond, but there are things that can be done in the UK. The UK Government can also help to influence the nature of decisions taken in the EU and elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para29"><a name="08022876000874">The first issue that needs to be tackled is the use of overt or hidden subsidies for non-renewable sources of energy. In a report published in 2004, the New Economics Foundation made a conservative estimate that worldwide subsidies for fossil fuels amounted to about $235 billion a year, and not much seems to have changed since then. Those kinds of support for old-style sources of power have the effect of tilting the playing field against the renewable sources of energy, including solar power, that we now so urgently need. All such subsidies should be removed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para30"><a name="08022876000875">The second challenge is to ensure that a proper price is paid for CO2 emissions. To a large extent, users of fossil fuels are still being allowed to use the atmosphere as a free dumping ground for carbon dioxide&#151;that must stop. The European emissions trading scheme has to work better than it has done up until now. In addition, there is a good case for introducing a system of tradable personal carbon allowances throughout the EU and beyond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para31"><a name="08022876000876">Thirdly, we have to ensure that the right framework of incentives is in place to encourage the growth of the renewable sector. Although CSP has quite a long history, its development has been held back because historically fossil fuels have been cheap. That means that it has not yet achieved the economies of scale and refinements in technology that will bring prices down, as is beginning to happen with wind power. If overt and hidden subsidies are removed from non-renewable sources of power, and if a proper price is charged for CO2 emissions, that will make a big difference to the economics. However, there may still be a need for some short to medium-term support for renewable sources of power, including CSP, in the form of feed-in tariffs. That system has proved to be very successful in Germany and Spain. By contrast, the UK&#146;s system of renewables obligation certificates has so far failed to produce the expansion of renewables that we so desperately need. Moreover, if countries in Europe, north Africa and the middle east are to benefit from the CSP technologies, an international framework of feed-in tariffs will probably be needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para32"><a name="08022876000877">Fourthly, we have to create a single market for electricity throughout Europe and beyond. It should be possible for any customer in the UK to buy solar power from any supplier in north Africa and the middle east in the same way that anyone in the UK can buy electricity from any UK supplier. Both the British Government and the European Commission are in favour of such development within the EU, but that does mean unbundling power generation from power transmission. They need encouragement to make that reform in the face of powerful economic interests that currently enjoy monopolistic benefits from the vertical integration of power generation with power transmission. Although the single market for electricity that exists within the  <br>

EU would be a great help, it would be even better if it were extended beyond Europe to the middle east and north Africa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para33"><a name="08022876000878">Finally, we have to put in place the necessary policies to allow for the creation of a single, integrated high-voltage DC grid across the whole of Europe, the middle east and north Africa, or at the every least across the EU. At present, HVDC lines are commissioned on a case-by-case basis without reference to any overarching plan. It would be better if the EU, in collaboration with countries in north Africa and the middle east, decided to take the lead in terms of building the HVDC supergrid across the region. A good second-best would be a Europe-wide supergrid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para34"><a name="08022876000879">It would probably be best if such a project were funded by several national Governments, which is feasible. We could not integrate the road networks throughout Europe without each country paying its own share, and the same thing could easily be envisaged for a HVDC supergrid. There is no reason why such a grid could not be up and running within 10 to 15 years if it got the right type of governmental backing. It could be done much sooner than that if we simply integrated the existing AC grid and upgraded it to the necessary standard. I am told that that could be achieved in five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para35"><a name="08022876000880">It is also possible to plan, design and build CSP plants fairly quickly, certainly compared with the process for conventional power plants. The lead-in time for building a CSP plant is about one year and the building time is about three years. Achieving that goal in the UK will require our Government, together with our partners in Europe, to make a strong commitment to CSP and the creation of an HVDC grid. Given the strong economic case made in the Stern report for strong, early action to combat climate change, I suggest that the Government have to act immediately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para36"><a name="08022876000881">I know from the comments made in the media by my hon. Friend the Minister that he shares much of my enthusiasm for CSP and that he appreciates the strong case for an HVDC grid. He has, however, expressed concerns about the long-term security of CSP energy derived from desert plants. While I understand those concerns, I do not necessarily share them. The first point to bear in mind is that CSP, even if we manage to exploit just a tiny fraction of its potential as an energy source, will help to increase substantially available energy supplies and thus diminish the risk of a global grab for energy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="80228-0020.htm_para37"><a name="08022876000882">Large-scale CSP production would also add to the global diversity of energy sources and reduce our reliance on conventional fuels. Oil is concentrated in a few small regions, but hot deserts and other areas with high levels of direct sunlight are widely distributed in the world, meaning that no country need be overly dependent on a few sources. The whole of the Mediterranean basin, for instance, has potential as a source of CSP production. It would be very difficult therefore to end up with an OPEC-style solar cartel.</p>

But the transmission grid can be designed to accommodate damage in much the same way that the internet was designed to be resilient in the face of military attack. Rather than rely on a few large transmission lines,  <br>

electricity may be transmitted over an interconnected grid of smaller lines. That means that electricity can always bypass difficult or damaged parts of the network. If necessary, transmission lines may be buried underground or laid under water where they would be much less vulnerable to attack. Airtricity, for example, has proposed a supergrid of this type across the whole of Europe, composed entirely of buried cables.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="80228-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08022876000884">In short, while we need to think through the energy security implications of expanding CSP production, we should not exaggerate them, or allow them to detract from the very strong argument before us in favour of CSP and the creation an HVDC grid.</p>

I would like to end my contribution by paying tribute to the work of TREC and its supporters, particularly Dr. Gerry Wolff, TREC&#146;s UK co-ordinator, in promoting CSP and the HVDC grid and in putting forward a powerful scientific and environmental case in support of them.

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="80228-0021.htm_para5"><a name="08022876000889">Of course, climate change presents a considerable challenge, which affects us socially, economically and politically, and it requires a paradigm shift in our method of sourcing competitive and reliable energy supplies in future. As my hon. Friend knows, we have a target to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent. from 1990 levels by 2050. That requires several radical and bold steps.</p>

same. The Government are committed to the expansion of renewables, and that sits alongside various other measures that we need to take, including on energy efficiency, civil nuclear power, cleaner use of fossil fuels through carbon capture and storage technology and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="80228-0021.htm_para8"><a name="08022876000892">As my hon. Friend said, the world has huge solar resources, on which concentrated solar power technology can clearly draw. I do not want to overstate the case because our role is currently modest, but the UK has participated in several European and international projects that examine the development and marketing of concentrated solar power systems. Work was carried out in the 1990s, when at least two small studies were commissioned on behalf of the then Department of Trade and Industry, and CSP plants now operate in California, Spain and other parts of the world. An organisation called SolarPaces has been set up by the International Energy Agency and is engaged in technology development, pilot projects and promotion in the relevant &#147;sunbelt&#148; parts of the world. Sadly, my hon. Friend was right to say that they do not include his constituency or mine. However, we in the UK have played our part in the work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80228-0021.htm_para9"><a name="08022876000893">The debate focuses on the key issue of how the UK could benefit from concentrated solar power. Unfortunately, we do not have sufficient sun resources for that technology in the UK. Therefore, for concentrated solar power to be of value here, it would be necessary to establish the HVDC transmission network that my hon. Friend proposed. I accept the argument that an HVDC network has the potential to deliver energy across long distances with minimal losses. However, building and maintaining an infrastructure of HVDC transmission lines and managing a network that feeds into national grids across Europe is an enormous and expensive task, as my hon. Friend acknowledged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="80228-0021.htm_para10"><a name="08022876000894">My officials have discussed CSP with international counterparts, and there is a general consensus that building the infrastructure would be costly. However, some of our European colleagues are engaged in developing that technology. For example, we believe that support for CSP in Germany is primarily for developing a manufacturing capability, rather than for applying the technology within national borders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="80228-0021.htm_para11"><a name="08022876000895">We believe that fair, open and well regulated markets are the best way for us to achieve the massive investment in the clean energy needed, and to create opportunities for the most efficient and cost-effective technologies and solutions to develop and succeed. Concentrated solar power could have a part to play along with other technologies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="80228-0021.htm_para12"><a name="08022876000896">Here in Britain, the renewables obligation&#151;our market mechanism for supporting renewable electricity generation&#151;has, alongside other measures, such as the low-carbon building programme, been successful in nearly doubling renewable generation since it was introduced in 2002. Current Government policy is already set to deliver &#163;1 billion of investment in renewables by 2010. The amount of renewable electricity eligible under the renewables obligation has almost trebled since its introduction, although I recognise that we started from a low base in Britain and that a lot more remains to be done.</p>

We also recently granted permission for what will be one of the world&#146;s largest biomass plants, which will be built in Port Talbot. As my hon. Friend knows, we are taking a hard look at the feasibility of a tidal power project across the Severn estuary and are currently in the stakeholder engagement process. If such a project is feasible, it could generate some 5 per cent. of Great Britain&#146;s electricity needs, and from a clean, indigenous resource. A full formal public consultation will take place in early 2010.</p>

I have outlined some of the things that have perhaps a more immediate short to medium-term application in Britain. On solar power, we see&#151;rather more modestly than my hon.

number of solar panels on the roofs of people&#146;s houses, which use a relatively cost-effective renewable technology. We also see the development of something that is as yet more expensive, but still important, namely photovoltaics, which produce not just hot water but electricity. We have a range of technologies that offer hope as we move forward.</p>

Friend that the Government will continue to follow developments in concentrated solar power and long-distance electricity transmission. He referred to a number of experts with whom he is in touch. If he has time, I should be happy to meet him and some of his colleagues so that I can become better informed. I again thank my hon. Friend for introducing this relatively novel but certainly very interesting debate about solar power. I congratulate him on his enthusiasm and his strong information base. </p>
