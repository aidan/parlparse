 Our cancer screening programmes are renowned as being among the best in the world, with some of the highest uptake levels. It is estimated that the breast and cervical screening programmes save around 6,000 lives every year. The cancer reform strategy, published last December, set out improvements to the programmes so that more women will be included and more women will be made aware of the benefits of screening, particularly in poorer communities.</p>

 No, we are not, but the hon. Gentleman identifies a problem that was contained in the cancer strategy. There are variations around the country. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will join me in congratulating his own PCT in Havering, where 79 per cent. of eligible women have been screened in the last five years. He is right about the disparities, which is why the cancer strategy asked all strategic health authorities to work with PCTs to identify how they can have more consistency and, in particular, how to get to those poorer communities. Even in the areas covered by institutions such as King&#146;s College hospital in London, which has a wide reach, there are still pockets of communities that those institutions are not getting to. That is a very important part of the cancer strategy.</p>

Will he ensure that that is now part of the routine exchange between doctors and their patients?</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to raise those issues. Personal budgets put maximum power and control in the hands of people using services and their families, recognising that they are best placed to make choices about where they want to get care from and allowing them to control their own care and support. Of course, we also must ensure the right balance between giving people that power and control, and appropriate protection in terms of the quality of the support that people receive.</p>

 Of course, this matter relates to how local authorities receive their finance from the Department for Communities and Local Government. Account is taken of a variety of factors when deciding about the allocation of those resources. When local authorities commission services from care agencies or organise services through them they must make adequate resources available so that domiciliary care agencies, or residential and nursing homes, can offer the quality care that people have a right to expect.</p>

 Of course, my hon. Friend raises an important point. First, the principle is that we should assume that individuals have the ability to make choices and exercise self-determination about their lives. Where someone clearly has difficulty making such choices because of disability or their health, family members are often better placed to make decisions about care and support than professionals ever will be. If family support is not available, what matters is that we put in place professionals and advocates who can ensure that money is spent in the best interests of the person. All the evidence from the individual budget pilots suggests, first, that where people have more control, they get better quality of life outcomes in terms of what they want in order to live an independent life and, secondly, that we get much better value for public money.</p>

 I compliment the Minister on producing a series of policy documents. The sadness is that there is a huge disconnect between the policy and its delivery. An elderly lady in North Yorkshire was discharged from hospital last week into the care of North Yorkshire social services. She was not able to make a cup of tea, to eat or to get to the toilet. Five days later, she is back in hospital with a broken wrist and dehydration. When will the Minister make two clear criteria for care of the elderly? First, nobody should be discharged from hospital unless they have 24-hour access to support. Secondly, the elderly in particular should receive rehabilitation before they are discharged into their own homes without any support at all.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises a serious point. I take personal responsibility for ensuring that he is well looked after in his retirement. The serious point is that the experience of that elderly lady in North Yorkshire is entirely unacceptable. The relevant local authority and health services need to get their acts together. There is no excuse whatsoever for older people being discharged from hospital and left without appropriate care in their homes. That is why we are reviewing the eligibility criteria and why, from April, we will radically transform the way in which social care is carried out in every part of the country, including Yorkshire. We are reviewing the eligibility criteria, as they mean that far too many older people are left alone without adequate care and support. The hon. Gentleman is right. Of course, we need to ensure that national policy supports an improvement in people&#146;s experiences. Equally, we need better local leadership to take responsibility for closing the gap between health and social services.</p>

 I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. Older people and their families tell us time and again that they do not have high-quality, easy-to-access information that enables them to make very difficult choices about their care or the care of a vulnerable relative. That is why at the heart of the transformation of the social care programme in every local authority area will be a new approach to information, advice and, where necessary, advocacy. That need for high-quality information and advice must apply to people who fund their own care as well as those who receive public funding.</p>

 A big issue in the care sector is the staff turnover rate, which is as high as 25 per cent. in domiciliary care, with as many as half those leaving the profession, or possibly more, doing so for good. As well as the severe implications for continuity of care, which the Government acknowledge is very important, there is a clear cost implication. Training costs &#163;980 per person and in 2004-05 local authorities spent &#163;20 million on advertising for vacancies and &#163;151 million on agency staff.

 May I say to my good friend that he raises a really important issue, because we need to address the status and value of people working in social care? The work force tend to be low-paid and low-skilled, and that is one reason why the Government are investing a large amount in training. It is important that some of that money gets through to the private sector, as 75 per cent. of social care is provided by organisations in the private and voluntary sectors rather than by local authorities. Moreover, in the new care and support system that we will need in the future, it is vital that we get right the leadership, management and commissioning of the work force.</p>

 The answers are no and yes: no, we will not force any GPs to open longer; and yes, there would be an adverse effect if we were to do what the hon. Lady suggests. Our negotiations with the BMA were based on getting GPs to open for an extra half an hour for every 1,000 patients on their books, which would mean that an average-sized practice would be open for an extra three hours a week. A much smaller practice would not be open for so many extra hours, while a much bigger one would be open for more. Our formula takes into account the fact that in many areas&#151;rural areas, for instance&#151;there is no need or demand for GPs to be open longer.</p>

are fine as they are. As a result of the process, we expect about 50 per cent. of GP practices across the country to be open for longer. That will get the balance right and probably, with the 250 new GP practices that we are introducing across the country, which will be open from 8 am to 8 pm&#151;150 of them, seven days a week&#151;it will give the required choice to customers who want to visit their GP later in the evening or on Saturday mornings.</p>

To me, that is in the same category as the comment of a BMA representative, who said that accountants did not open more than five days a week so why should GPs. The evidence is that where surgeries are open for longer&#151;for example, in Tower Hamlets, where they recently opened on Saturday mornings, or Kingston, where there has been such a service for much longer&#151;the people who visit them on Saturday mornings are indeed elderly people and mothers with young children, who welcome the choice of going there either in the week or on Saturday mornings.

In his own area, the primary care trust is at the moment out to consultation on where best to put the new health centre. He talks about stability in the system; his own primary care trust has seen a 20.1 per cent. increase in its funding in the last two years, and it is getting a 5.5 per cent. increase in the next financial year.</p>

 I have to say that the Minister&#146;s answer gives me only very modest reassurance about the intentions of the Department of Health. I implore him not to allow PCTs to have a one-size-fits-all answer, because although polyclinics may be very worth while in some parts of the country, in other more rural parts the local GP service&#151;the smaller service, which perhaps does not offer all the services that are available at the polyclinic&#151;is much more welcome, and much more appreciated by the people who use it, than a polyclinic at much greater distance would be.</p>

 I entirely agree that there should not be a one-size-fits-all diktat from Whitehall, and that is exactly why we are leaving it up to local primary care trusts to decide, at the local level, what is the best model for them to use in providing the new services to which we are committed. However, a health centre or polyclinic, or whatever people want to call it, opened recently in a rural area in Devon, near my constituency, and it is very popular. It offers complementary medicine&#151;the hon. Member for Bosworth (David Tredinnick) is no longer in the Chamber&#151;and a number of other services that patients welcome and benefit from.

 My hon. Friend raises an important point. As she is aware, we have a national suicide strategy in this country that has been effective in reducing suicides. We have made significant progress. She is absolutely right to raise the particular problem in her constituency and to demand action to deal with it. The number of young people who have died in a relatively short period of time in her constituency is frightening. It is very important that the relevant authorities in that area respond in a positive and collaborative way. We certainly have to take self-harm far more seriously than perhaps we have in the past.</p>

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="80318-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08031854000354"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision for the protection of gardens and urban green spaces; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08031854000158">Hon. Members may recall that last year I sought to close a loophole in planning law that has led to gardens up and down the country being prioritised for building. My private Member&#146;s Bill last year followed the extensive work done by my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark). I am delighted that he is a sponsor of my current Bill. Despite having support from hon. Members from all parties in the House, my Bill last year was talked out by the Government, who have so far failed to solve the problem. How I wish that they had listened more carefully to the impassioned, eloquent contributions from Government Members on the subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08031854000159">In my current Bill, I am once again asking for a simple provision to be made in planning law so that local councils can, where they feel it appropriate, protect gardens from being built on. Ministers claim that such a power already exists in changes that they have made to planning guidance, but the evidence from my constituency since the introduction of that and other guidance shows that the problem continues. In my constituency, 43 per cent. of all applications made have been to build on a garden site. In other areas, the situation is even worse. A survey of six local authorities&#151;Bradford, Chelmsford, Guildford, Nottingham, Oxford and Tunbridge Wells&#151;found that 72 per cent. of all brownfield site development was on gardens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08031854000160">The impact on the environment, infrastructure and people&#146;s quality of life has been disastrous. Gardens are a valuable source of biodiversity. They are a haven for wildlife and play a critical role in getting the balance right between the built and the natural environments. The gardens being concreted over are leaving a malign environmental legacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08031854000161">Just a few weeks ago, Sir Michael Pitt, who led the Government&#146;s review of last summer&#146;s floods, told the BBC that the garden grabbing surge had increased the risk of further flooding. He said:</p>
<a name="80318-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="08031854000355"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If it was just one house and one garden, this would not be an issue. It&#146;s the cumulative effect over time of many, many properties&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08031854000162">It would be a mistake for the Government to ignore Sir Michael and an even greater one to underestimate the strength of public feeling on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08031854000163">I ask colleagues simply to Google &#147;garden grabbing&#148; and see the fury that the issue is creating. Garden Organic has a powerful online campaign, to which people have sent their pictures and testimonials about the damage that has been wrought by current planning policy. The people contributing are not mindless nimbies; they are raising concerns about the environment  and infrastructure, which is plain common sense. Neighbourhoods with roads, parking spaces and drainage systems originally designed to serve a handful of properties are buckling under the unsustainable number of flats being built in back gardens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08031854000164">In my constituency, there is an application to demolish two family homes on Elmdon lane in Marston Green and to replace them with 71 new dwellings. Just think about the impact of that development. I am talking about a narrow, tree-lined avenue with a hump-backed bridge, where garden grabbing could lead to traffic levels increasing by 3,400 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08031854000165">Ironically, the changes that Ministers have made to planning legislation actually favour garden development. The combination of centrally imposed housing and density targets has left elected, accountable local authorities with little scope to defend their refusal at appeal. The Government repeatedly point to a &#147;brownfield first&#148; policy but, ironically, they themselves define &#147;brownfield&#148; for planning purposes, rather than for statistical purposes only, as they did originally. That has meant that the correct preference for genuine brownfield land to be given priority in the planning system is fatally undermined, because gardens are rich pickings for developers, who will favour gardens over a gasworks any day. This is borne out by the words of the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), who memorably told the House of developers flying over the back gardens of Sunderland in helicopters, looking for sites to develop and neglecting the genuine brownfield sites in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08031854000166">The logic for developers is that garden sites tend to be in areas of higher real-estate value. The end result is that two-bedroom flats are created at a price that is way beyond the pocket of first-time buyers. Also, small developments built in back gardens frequently fall below the threshold for providing affordable homes. The preference for blocks of flats on garden sites has meant that the genuine need for affordable family homes is simply not being met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08031854000167">Propertyfinder.com, a major property search engine, states that</p>
<a name="80318-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="08031854000356"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there is a large oversupply of two bedroom flats, many of which are lying empty and unsold...The lack of availability of larger homes has in turn affected their affordability as excess demand and insufficient supply has increased the gap between the price of a two-bed and a three-bed home.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08031854000168">So why are the Government repeatedly turning a deaf ear to this issue? Are they unaware of the environmental legacy that we are leaving? Do they have an innate wish to see gardens and green spaces being built on? Or is it simply that defining gardens as brownfield land was a drafting error that has given rise to an unintended consequence? I am a generous-minded sort of person, and I would like to believe that this last explanation is the correct one. If it is not, those involved in this planning legislation are guilty of environmental vandalism on a vast scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08031854000169">I implore the Minister&#151;on behalf of the 179 MPs on both sides of the House who signed early-day motion 2130 in the last Session, and on behalf of all those living in the shadow of inappropriate garden development&#151;to add a minor provision to the planning guidance that would simply allow councils to give a garden protection against development where they felt that it had a particular value or function in a neighbourhood. That would be a proportionate and reasonable way of addressing the growing problem. It would rely on the Government&#146;s trust in elected councillors correctly to judge where and when it was in the interests  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 Mar 2008">

of a particular neighbourhood to safeguard certain gardens. It would not be a blanket veto on garden development. If an application were appropriate, there would be no reason for it to be declined. If, however, it were inappropriate or detrimental to a neighbourhood, the council would be empowered to stop it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08031854000170">At the moment, councils are enfeebled when it comes to planning. The revised planning guidance in planning policy statement 3 has not given the protection that we hoped for. It focuses on gardens for new build, rather than conserving existing gardens. Any discretion that councils have over development is so compromised by the hierarchy of housing and density targets as to be meaningless. I asked the chief planning officer of my own local authority why the new planning guidance was so ineffective, and he made it quite plain that, in the hierarchy of different planning considerations, the absolutes of the number of homes needing to be built and the need to increase density had priority over the more subjective consideration of appropriateness. That is the fundamental reason why the new guidance is  so ineffective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08031854000171">Surely we have to do better. Ministers cannot bury their heads in the sand on this issue. All over the country&#151;in places like Derby, Stockton, Crawley, Cheltenham and Eastleigh, for example&#151;powerful local campaigns against inappropriate garden development are being mobilised, and the London mayoral candidate, Boris Johnson has promised to take the issue up in his campaign. I know that legislators in the House of Commons will show similar strength by amending the planning guidance so that local authorities can exercise a right to protect gardens from development, where it is inappropriate. If they refuse, they will be judged very harshly. I support the Bill.</p>

 The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) made her case in the way we have come to appreciate when she speaks moderately to a well-argued case, with statistics and facts marshalled in support. As she rightly said, this is a cross-party issue, and I have discussed it with my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), who is one of her supporters. I believe, however, that the hon. Lady is profoundly mistaken and that behind her modest Bill lies a very serious rejection of our obligation to provide new homes for the new generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08031854000173">I genuinely ask the hon. Lady to reflect on what Harold Macmillan, who built 300,000 houses a year in the 1950s, would have thought to be told that what was built then on gardens, green fields and people&#146;s private land&#151;he was right to build up British housing after the war&#151;should be blocked by legislation such as this. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I hear from a sedentary intervention on the Opposition side that some Conservative Members seem to think that nothing had been built on a garden&#151;in the sense of the land behind a house&#151;until the last few years. They really need to examine the facts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para15"><a name="08031854000174">The key figure is very simple. Since the 1970s, there has been a 30 per cent. increase in the number of households, but a 50 per cent. drop in house building. Current figures suggest that we will see 210,000 new households in Britain each year over the next 20 years, but we are not building more than 150,000 to 180,000  <br>

new homes a year. The main blockage remains land and the refusal of planners to allocate it for housing. I regret to say that the arguments in the Bill will make matters worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para16"><a name="08031854000175">All or most of our homes were built on what was once someone&#146;s garden or field and filled up a very pleasant view. In my own constituency of Rotherham, the house I live in was built under Harold Macmillan in the 1950s in what was previously someone&#146;s back garden. I can think of many other areas that used to be someone&#146;s big back garden, but that now provide homes for the people of Rotherham. Furthermore, if we look at any map of Victorian or Edwardian&#151;or even early Elizabethan, by which I mean Elizabeth II&#151;London, we will find that it used to be covered with gardens and fields, but people now live there. In the 1930s, when the population of Britain was half what it is today, those opposed to immigrants or asylum seekers said that we were full up, just as the racists in the BNP and Migration Watch say today, yet 90 per cent. of the surface land in the UK has no building on it at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para17"><a name="08031854000176">We use land in a far less efficient way than other countries. In Greater Paris, for example, there are 8,649 people living in each square kilometre compared to close to half that number&#151;4,779&#151;in Greater London. If we compare Manhattan and inner London, we see three times as many people living in New York as in London&#151;28,000 in each square kilometre in Manhattan as opposed to 9,000 in the same space in inner London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para18"><a name="08031854000177">Indeed, we have actually seen a decline in building on gardens&#151;the hon. Member for Meriden did not refer to it&#151;as new dwellings on previously developed residential land fell from 20 per cent. in 1990 to 15 per cent. today. In other words, it was the last Conservative Administration who permitted more garden grabbing&#151;not the slogan used at the time&#151;because Mrs. Thatcher understood that a property-owning democracy was good for Britain. Now we seem to want a garden protectionist oligarchy, which will deny to our children a right that all hon. Members have long taken for granted&#151;the right to own our own home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para19"><a name="08031854000178">I think that it is also a matter of equity. As the famous jurist, Sir Edward Coke said,</p>

 I am pleased to have the opportunity to open our last day&#146;s debate on my right hon. Friend the Chancellor&#146;s Budget, which deals with the very important issues of business and enterprise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para30"><a name="08031854000190">The Budget will help the United Kingdom tackle some of the biggest economic issues that we now face: uncertainty in international financial markets; intensified global competition; and the need to promote and support Britain&#146;s strong pro-enterprise culture. To steer the right course, Governments must listen and respond to the needs of British businesses. That is what we are doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para31"><a name="08031854000191">My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has brought forward a Budget designed to ensure that Britain&#146;s economy remains strong in uncertain economic times. These are such times. In every respect, the Budget also stands in stark contrast to the measures that others have proposed, which would weaken our economy by compromising economic stability, threatening the public finances in the process. That would be a real double whammy for our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para32"><a name="08031854000192">My argument today is that we should take no risks with our hard-earned stability. That is why this Budget sets a course for continued macro-economic stability, rather than putting it at risk with the unfunded spending pledges and tax cuts proposed by the Opposition parties. It promotes enterprise across the economy, rather than undermining key sectors such as manufacturing with huge cuts in capital allowances for investors, which the Conservative party has also proposed. That change would penalise investment at a time when we should instead support it. The Budget will help to deliver sustainable economic growth through greater business  <br>

 Given that money market conditions are very tense and tight on both sides of the Atlantic, will the Secretary of State comment on why the United States authorities are cutting interest rates, taking the position very seriously and pumping money in, while the United Kingdom authorities are not?</p>

 Every country must respond in a way that is appropriate to its own market conditions, and I believe that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England have taken appropriate action to support the United Kingdom economy as it enters an uncertain period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para33"><a name="08031854000195">The Budget&#146;s foundations, and indeed its ambitions, lie in the UK&#146;s strong and stable economic record since 1997. In the past 10 years, we have achieved unmatched economic growth. The UK is the only country among the G7 to have experienced no quarters of negative GDP growth since 1997. There have been 62 quarters of unbroken GDP growth in the UK, which constitutes the longest economic expansion on record in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="80318-0004.htm_para34"><a name="08031854000196">We have helped more people to progress through work. The UK&#146;s employment rate at the end of 2007 was also the highest in the G7. A record 29.39 million people are in employment, over 2.7 million more than in 1997. We have also kept inflation and interest rates low. In case we have all forgotten, I remind the House that before 1997 the UK had one of the worst inflation records in the G7. Now we have one of the best. As a result, interest rates have averaged 5.4 per cent. since 1997, about half the rate between 1979 and 1997, which has helped home owners and businesses to plan for the long term in a much more sensible way. So we enter this period of uncertainty, caused by upheavals in international financial markets, with our economy performing strongly and with growth forecast for each of the next three years.</p>

 Is the Secretary of State concerned about our trade deficit, which is the worst since records began, and about our worsening competitive position? Am I right in saying that we have fallen in the World Economic Forum chart from fourth in 1998 to about 11th now? Will he comment on those two very concerning factors?</p>

 I think that the UK remains a very competitive economy. That is borne out by the record levels of foreign direct investment in what is one of the most preferred locations for inward investment, which I think tells its own story. We have worked to provide a positive climate for business investment, raising national and international investment in our economy. Business investment has grown in nine of the last 10 years, averaging 5.3 per cent. since 1997&#151;compared, I am afraid, with an average of just 3.5 per cent. between 1979 and 1996.</p>

investment in what has been a Scottish success story? Whisky is already charged a higher rate of duty per unit of alcohol than other drinks. If the Government want to tackle binge drinking, surely they should target the drinks that are responsible for it rather than targeting whisky.</p>

 No doubt the hon. Gentleman has made a very strong constituency point. He takes a close interest in all such matters, not unreasonably given the constituency that he represents. It should be borne in mind, however, that 90 per cent. of Scotch whisky is exported, and that changes in duty relating to the UK will not affect the strong position of the Scotch whisky industry in international markets.</p>

Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham), the UK&#151;thank goodness&#151;remains a magnet for overseas investment. There was a stock of over a trillion dollars of foreign direct investment in 2006 and, in the same year, a flow of $140 billion of foreign direct investment. In that regard, we were second only to the United States. I do not believe that any of those things would have happened if Britain were still locked into the cycle of short-termism that had begun to characterise much of British economic policy in the 20 years before the Government came to office. If there is one thing on which Members on both sides of the House should be able to agree, it is that we should not return to those times.</p>

Everything that we seek to achieve as a country must have its foundations rooted first and foremost in greater enterprise and higher investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="80318-0005.htm_para2"><a name="08031854000203">This Budget sets a course that will help Britain become, I hope, the most entrepreneurial economy in an increasingly competitive global marketplace, creating an enterprise framework that responds to the aspirations of so many of our people to start and grow a business of their own. That aspiration is evident in a record 4.5 million businesses already operating in the UK, or in the growing number of young people who say they want to form their own businesses.</p>

 Of course there have to be proper safeguards, and a proper judicial framework and the rule of law within which all such activity takes place&#151;that will remain so&#151;but the hon. Gentleman and others will have to answer some important questions about how we deal with tax evasion. It is important that Revenue and Customs inspectors have the right powers to do that. If the hon. Gentleman has an alternative set of proposals that would avoid the need for the measures that we have set out, we should hear from him. We can then look at them in turn. Those who criticise should always have an alternative and, so far, I am afraid that I have not heard one.</p>

With the introduction of a new annual investment allowance from April, more than 95 per cent. of small and medium-sized enterprises will be able to write off all their capital expenditure on plant and machinery in the period in which it is incurred.

To help even more businesses prosper, we will now increase the investor limit from &#163;400,000 in one tax year to &#163;500,000 from April, and we will consult on the simplification of that scheme.

Support for community development finance institutions will also help businesses in poorer areas to access finance. Improvements to the operation of community investment tax relief will increase flexibility and confidence.

Ensuring smarter, proportionate regulation will be critical to the UK&#146;s future competitive position.

More than &#163;1.5 billion of cost savings have already been delivered to the economy through that mechanism.

However, it is important to recognise that the significant challenges that we face as a country include climate change, which must be dealt with sensibly and proportionately. For example, it would not make sense for us to say that we can make progress on climate change only if we scrap all the health and safety laws, or opt out of the social chapter&#151;as the right hon. Gentleman would probably propose. We have to strike a balance, but it is important that the Government have decided that we should have regulatory budgets, and this is not a consultation on whether but on how.

As the Chancellor and the Prime Minister have both said to anyone who would listen, the disintegration of sub-prime debt did indeed light the fuse that led to the explosion of Northern Rock and the fireworks that we are witnessing in today&#146;s markets.

He did the opposite.</p>

He has squandered a decade of economic prosperity. He has disguised growing structural problems and deferred decisions that could easily have been taken when things were going well. He used the decade to support his political ambitions over and above the long-term interests of the country. Now, thanks to him, the economy has no slack to cope with a downturn. It is unduly reliant on the City, and housing transaction costs are likely to prove an exaggerated downward force on the housing market.

 It would be inappropriate for me to repeat the words. I will steer my hon. Friend to the comment to which I am referring later. Some of the people who most wish that the Prime Minister would change his ways are people in business&#151;people working in the thick of the economy. Those same people were left battered and bruised by the Government&#146;s election gambits in the pre-Budget report last autumn.

It is no surprise that 92 per cent. of business leaders do not think that the Budget will restore consumer confidence. Some 65 per cent. say that it will be bad for their business, while an astonishing 73 per cent. believe that the Budget will actually contribute to the economic downturn in the UK&#151;and no wonder, considering that the Government will take &#163;1.7 billion in extra revenue from business over the next three years. That is in addition to the disastrous capital gains tax hike announced last August, and the small companies tax rise that was announced in last year&#146;s Budget but is coming into effect now.

Small businesses will still be hit by the rise in their corporation tax. Recent data from one business organisation indicate that on average small companies spend &#163;8,700 and 50 hours annually just on complying with basic tax regulations.</p>

I hope that they will go further than merely reviewing it, as the Chancellor said he would. The proposal was of course first announced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), the Conservative party leader, back in October 2006, so it has taken a little longer for the Government to copy the idea than it took them to &#147;borrow&#148; our inheritance tax proposals, but it represents progress none the less.</p>

measures aside, the White Paper is terribly thin on substance and bears all the hallmarks of a Government who have run out of not just ideas, but wriggle-room. There is a plethora of small policies and initiatives, including some very minor changes to the financing regime for SMEs, but they are certainly not the key to &#147;unlocking the UK&#146;s talent&#148;, as advertised on the document&#146;s front cover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="80318-0007.htm_para1"><a name="08031854000282">The most depressing part of the White Paper is a classic eye-catching initiative&#151;a high media campaign&#151;entitled &#147;spark an idea&#148;, with a corresponding &#163;12 million capital fund for female entrepreneurs. The Secretary of State mentioned that in his comments. Of course we welcome the focus on women in business, because one of the Government&#146;s biggest failures has been the failure to encourage women to establish businesses, resulting in the UK having one of the lowest rates of female entrepreneurship in the world. However, we are not convinced that the &#163;12 million will create the growth that the Government want. Also, as the fund is being distributed through Business Link, we will need convincing that the money will find its way to women, rather than just be lost in administration.</p>

Our competitiveness rating has dropped seven places in the international league table since 1997. We are falling behind other European countries in investment and research. While other countries have been developing a competitive business tax code, the UK has the unique distinction of creating a tax code that is longer than India&#146;s. The Chancellor has compounded that by adding a further 107 new technical tax changes in the Budget alone, which brings a certain Kafkaesque logic to the Government&#146;s pledge to simplify the system.</p>

 I first heard news of last week&#146;s Budget when I was in outer Mongolia, where I had been dispatched with the Foreign Office, well out of harm&#146;s way, along with my noble Friend Lord Malloch-Brown. Given that I am chairman of the all-party beer group, perhaps it was the best place for me, in view of the 4p rise in beer duty. In my brief remarks, I shall reflect on alcohol policy and the alcohol industry&#151;an important industry in our country&#151;the energy sector, the gambling industry, and non-domiciles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="80318-0007.htm_para7"><a name="08031854000293">There was a significant change in the policy on alcohol duty last week. All alcohol duty&#151;on wine, spirits, beer or cider&#151;was increased by a similar percentage. A promise was made that in forthcoming years there would be increases of inflation plus 2 per cent. on all alcohol. It is worth exploring the reasons for that. Up to now, the Treasury has said that alcohol duty is a revenue raiser, rather than an aspect of health policy. Indeed, last week my right hon. Friend the Chancellor referred to increased alcohol duty giving additional support for families and lifting more children out of poverty. He also mentioned in his remarks, which were backed up by the Treasury press release, that as incomes have risen, alcohol has become increasingly more affordable. He spoke about ensuring that alcohol duties keep up with rising incomes. For the first time, there was a hint that alcohol duties were being raised for health as well as revenue reasons. I would be interested in any clarification from Ministers on that point.</p>

Red Book suggests that &#163;8.6 billion will be raised in the forthcoming year, up from &#163;8 billion this year&#151;a significant rise, particularly from wine duties, which will apparently raise more than &#163;400 million extra. At the moment, our beer duty is the highest among those of comparable European Union countries, at nearly 40p a pint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="80318-0007.htm_para9"><a name="08031854000295">In the past few years, beer duty has gone up a lot more than other alcohol duties: by 26.7 per cent. since 1997, compared with a 3 per cent. rise for spirits, an 11 per cent. rise for cider and a 16 per cent. rise for wine. However, as beer duty has increased, the tax take has not increased to any extent at all. In 2004, &#163;3.1 billion was raised through beer duty; that has now decreased to &#163;3.05 billion for the current financial year. The actual amounts raised through beer duty undershot Treasury estimates by &#163;130 million last year and &#163;160 million the year before.</p>

A pint of Carling in a managed pub cost &#163;1.65 on average 10 years ago, but it is now &#163;2.32. The average price of a pint of premium lager in a multiple grocer was &#163;1.14 10 years ago but is now down to &#163;1.05. There has been a shift.</p>

 Is not the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that the increase in beer duty will not have much of an impact on off-sales, but will have an impact on village pubs? All the village post offices in constituencies such as mine have been closed by this Government. What next? It will be pubs. It is disingenuous to suggest that any increases in beer duty will have an impact on binge drinking; they are just another way of collecting more revenue, which will also hit a valuable service&#151;the village pub.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is ahead of me. Unless other measures are taken, the rises will reinforce the trend of the past 10 years of more off- sales and fewer on-sales. Ten years ago, the on-trade accounted for nearly 80 per cent. of beer sales; that has gone down considerably to just over 60 per cent. The measures will reinforce the trend from drinking in community pubs and towards more sales in supermarkets.</p>

In fact, Ernst and Young suggested that the entire pub and beer industry contributed a total of &#163;9 billion to Government revenue. The more that is drunk in pubs, as opposed to at home, the greater the Government revenue. The Government receive &#163;1.14 in taxes from a pint of beer in a pub, compared with 55p for every pint drunk in the off-trade. In themselves, the measures will, as the hon.

However, as St. Augustine said, &#147;Lord, make me virtuous but not yet.&#148; That is Tesco&#146;s position and the Government need to encourage it to take the further step.

In Canadian supermarkets, the minimum reference price of a bottle of beer is around 50p. We will hold a seminar, to which we hope to invite the supermarkets, the Treasury and the health lobby to ascertain whether we can reach a consensus. Without that, the increase in excise duty over the next few years will accelerate closures of village pubs&#151;we have reached more than 20 a week on some counts. The community pub will also decline, and that is where drinking is supervised and managed, and where people generally drink socially. Such decline could have bad implications for one of the industries that make one proud to be British. I therefore hope that the Government will act on supermarket pricing and stand up to the supermarkets, given that they are going down a specific road on alcohol duty.</p>

It would be better if Ofgem gave evidence to the Competition Commission in a full-scale inquiry into energy views, so that its views could be put against those of Energywatch, the consumer champion, which will sadly be abolished in a few months, and so that there could be a proper test.

It is at least arguable that our energy sector is dominated by a number of very large companies that not only produce but retail electricity and gas.

 I am grateful to have this opportunity to speak on behalf of my party on the Budget on the final day of our deliberations on that subject. This was a Budget with a big hole in the middle&#151;a Polo mint Budget. Its central feature, which will be experienced by all our constituents from next month, was the proposal to cut the basic rate of income tax by 2p in the pound and to double, rather than abolish, the 10p rate. That will have a profound effect on many of our constituents when it comes into effect next month. It is overwhelmingly the biggest change that people will experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80318-0008.htm_para0"><a name="08031854000320">The Prime Minister, in his characteristically uncollegiate way, took the central feature of this year&#146;s Budget and announced it as the central feature of his final Budget as Chancellor of the Exchequer last year, thereby leaving his successor with a relatively small number of measures to pad out the 50 or so minutes that he managed to spend on his Budget speech last week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80318-0008.htm_para1"><a name="08031854000321">The central feature&#151;the doubling of the 10p rate and the reduction in the basic rate&#151;is a hugely regressive measure that will impact adversely on more than 5 million households across the United Kingdom. They will be worse off as a result of the proposals, announced by the then Chancellor last year, that will come into effect next month. It is simply unbelievable that a Labour Government should choose to alter the income tax structure in a way that is most disadvantageous to people on low and middle incomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80318-0008.htm_para2"><a name="08031854000322">That feature was announced in last year&#146;s Budget, however, so let us look at what was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer last Wednesday. I think that it was Barack Obama, in the presidential contest in the United States, who observed that the tragedy of politics at the moment is that just as the issues are getting bigger&#151;he was referring to issues such as climate change and globalisation&#151;the political discourse seems to be getting smaller. I was reminded of that observation as I listened to the Chancellor on Wednesday, because his proposals were so timid, so meek and so lacking in purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80318-0008.htm_para3"><a name="08031854000323">I cast my mind back to the genuinely formidable Chancellors whom I can recall. Nigel Lawson, for example, was second only to Margaret Thatcher as the politician who shaped the 1980s. Many would argue that the present Prime Minister was not second in stature to, but parallel with, Tony Blair in shaping the politics of the past decade. These were politicians who, for good or for ill, had a big view of the kind of society that they wished to mould. They painted on a broad canvas. It was therefore somewhat demeaning to see the Chancellor of the Exchequer of one of the world&#146;s largest economies rising to his full height to announce not only that he was minded to introduce a policy on plastic carrier bags, but that if the supermarkets did not implement it in two years&#146; time, at that point he would really, really do something.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80318-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08031854000324">We can look back at those considerable figures, but I also see one in the Chamber now. The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) was the last Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer&#151;possibly the last ever, certainly the last for the time being. He was undoubtedly a big political figure, and he remains one today. I cannot believe that he would  <br>

have wished his legacy to be a threatened plastic bag levy two years in the future. This Budget reminded me of a 1950s Budget. It was full of good housekeeping, reminiscent of the days when Chancellors of the Exchequer often dealt in millions rather than billions of pounds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="80318-0008.htm_para5"><a name="08031854000325">Let us go through some of the measures mentioned when the Chancellor spoke about his priorities for our country. We should remember that this Government are spending &#163;1,700 million every day; that is the scale of public spending nowadays. When the Chancellor rose on his annual opportunity to speak for three quarters of an hour, he found time and space to accommodate the following announcements into his Budget: &#163;10 million over five years for science; &#163;26 million&#151;slightly less than a pound per UK household by my calculations&#151;for home insulation; and &#163;12.5 million for women entrepreneurs, which we have discussed this afternoon. I have never before heard a Chancellor announcing in his main Budget statement items of expenditure to the nearest &#163;500,000. Those are all laudable objectives, but the scale is so small and humiliating that it is indicative of a Chancellor and a Government who have lost the ability to shape the bigger picture.</p>

 But was it not the intention behind all those pages of Budget coverage with lots of little boxes for various initiatives to detract from the main story of the collapse of the Chancellor&#146;s overall financial competence?</p>

 The implication of that intervention is that financial competence existed in the first place, so in that respect the hon. Gentleman displays his characteristic generosity. He is clearly more of a details man than I if he went through all those little boxes in the Budget supplements, which go on for page after page. I am not sure, however, that they win as many votes for the Government as people would like to think when they cook up these ideas in the Treasury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="80318-0008.htm_para6"><a name="08031854000328">What, then, of the alternatives put before us? I was intrigued and bewildered over the weekend to read the centrepiece of the new tax policy by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), the Conservative shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury. As far as I understood it, it said that there was a possibility of the Conservative party cutting taxes by 2015. That, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is seven years away&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>We fought and won the whole second world war more quickly than the hon. Gentleman believes he might be able to introduce some modest tax proposals. I think it was Harold Wilson who said&#151;although perhaps not in these exact words&#151;that seven days was a long time in politics. I do not know how long the Conservatives think seven years is, but it seems an awfully long time to be thinking up some ideas for tax cuts.</p>

Instead, we have the worst savings scheme in history&#151;a pot of money tied up for seven years with a 0 per cent. return in interest and requiring two Conservative election victories before people get their money back.

 The hon. Gentleman really ought to give proper credit to the Tory party and put its long-term thinking on taxation in perspective. The Conservatives were, after all, the party that introduced income tax as a temporary measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="80318-0008.htm_para8"><a name="08031854000332">I have been trying to work out what the Conservative critique of the Budget really is. As far as I can work out, the Conservatives have two policies: the first is that taxes and spending are much too high under Labour; and the second is that taxes and spending will be identical under the Conservative party. We are left in a very strange position: we know that the Conservatives oppose every tax rise that the Chancellor announced last Wednesday, so they must have secret mystery alternative tax rises to make up the difference. We have not yet heard what secret taxes they propose to put in place instead, but we look forward to hearing about them later in our debate.</p>

 Is it inconceivable that a future Conservative Government would follow policies, which have been followed in many other countries, to restrain public spending a bit and keep taxes lower, but bring in tax revenues that were actually higher? Tax rates would be lower, but revenues for the public services would be higher, reflecting higher economic growth as a consequence. Does the hon. Gentleman not recognise that the steep increases in public spending and taxation are beginning to suppress the rate of economic growth, so that tax revenues consistently come in below forecast, as they have over the past seven years?</p>

<p><a name="st_o153"><a name="08031854000334"><a name="80318-0008.htm_spnew6"><a name="08031854000555"><b>Mr. Browne:</b>
 There were so many &#147;highers&#148; and &#147;lowers&#148; in that contribution that I will call it the Bruce Forsyth doctrine. I shall recommend it to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Front-Bench colleagues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="80318-0008.htm_para9"><a name="08031854000335">So far, I have come up with four Conservative suggestions on tax. Let us consider them, as they might inform the Chancellor&#146;s next Budget. The first was a supermarket car parking tax&#151;a policy dreamt up by an adviser to the Conservative party whose chauffeur drives around the block while he is inside the supermarket not collecting any plastic bags. That proposal appears to have been dropped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="80318-0008.htm_para10"><a name="08031854000336">As far as I can work out, the second policy is that &#147;normal people&#148; should be allowed only one short-haul flight a year. I have not heard whether that was confirmed by the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) in connection with his recent holiday in South Africa, but no doubt those on the Conservative Front Bench will enlighten us on that subject.</p>

Budget proposals. It says something about the career of the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) that that is considered his finest achievement in politics&#151;to have put forward a policy that is universally unpopular in my constituency. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="80318-0008.htm_para12"><a name="08031854000338">As for the final area, public spending, the Conservative health spokesman made the big announcement a couple of weeks ago that NHS expenditure would increase massively under the Conservative party. I was as intrigued by that proposal as many other right hon. and hon. Members must have been. I read the blog of the political editor of the <i> Daily Mail</i>, and under the headline &#147;From Untouchable to Unmentionable&#148;, he described how the proposal had gone down in the ranks of the Conservative party:</p>
<a name="80318-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="08031854000375"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I'm told that in the days following Mr Lansley's reckless assertion about health spending, Mr Osborne hit the roof and one Shad Cab heavyweight&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="80318-0008.htm_para13"><a name="08031854000339">that narrows the field, unless we include the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles)&#151;</p>

It is no wonder that <i> The Daily Telegraph</i>, the newspaper generally considered sympathetic to the Conservative party, ran the headline yesterday, &#147;Tories mired in confusion over policy on tax cuts&#148;. No doubt we will have some clarification later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="80318-0008.htm_para15"><a name="08031854000341">To assist the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan), let me make one modest proposal for how he might reduce public spending to fund some of his reckless plans. In recent months, the Conservative party has been shedding Members of Parliament at an alarming rate. As I understand it, the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling), the hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Derek Conway) and, just last week, the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) have all left the Conservative ranks, which were already smaller than those that Michael Foot managed to achieve during his electoral triumph in 1983. I venture that there must be some substantial savings to be made from reviewing the Short money claimed by the remainder of the Conservative party. That could go into funding some of the exciting new proposals on which I have touched.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80318-0008.htm_para16"><a name="08031854000342">The truth is that the Budget took place against an extremely worrying economic backdrop. An explosion of consumer debt has been secured on the rising value of house prices. The bubble, if it has not burst, is certainly deflating rapidly. As the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton pointed out, the Government&#146;s growth forecasts have been revised downwards and public finances are struggling. In the next financial year, the Government will borrow &#163;7 billion more than they envisaged only last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80318-0008.htm_para17"><a name="08031854000343">No one in my constituency or elsewhere recognises the rosy picture of the economy that the Government are painting. The measure of inflation, for example, is totally detached from reality. It is possible that the price of the iPod that the Prime Minister uses to listen to the Arctic Monkeys in the gym in the mornings has fallen in recent months, but pensioners in my constituency see rising fuel costs and soaring shopping bills, and their biggest outlay of all, the council tax bill&#151;about which the Chancellor had nothing at all to say in his Budget statement&#151;has virtually doubled  <br>

since Labour came to power. Replacing the council tax could have been the great centrepiece of a Budget dedicated to a fairer and greener Britain, but there was no urgency and no big-picture analysis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="80318-0008.htm_para18"><a name="08031854000344">According to a United Nations report published at the weekend, glaciers are melting at an unprecedented rate. The signs are all around us, but the Chancellor fiddles while the world gets closer to burning. My party believes that we need a proper green tax switch with serious measures to combat pollution, but&#151;and it is a crucial but&#151;that every pound raised in environmental taxation should be returned, in the form of income tax cuts, to the people on low and middle incomes who are struggling the most in the current difficult economic circumstances. It is simply not good enough to give green taxes a bad name and a bad reputation by using them to introduce, through the back door, extra revenue-raising measures to plug black holes in the Treasury&#146;s own finances.</p>

 We have made our policies entirely clear. Let me be uncharacteristically boastful, and point out that the whole drive for differential vehicle excise duties was a Liberal Democrat policy.

The Budget could have replaced the council tax with a fairer system for our constituents, a system that reduced the basic rate of income tax further as a consequence of environmental taxation, but instead we are piling extra tax on the households that are feeling the squeeze most.</p>

Yet most commentators believe, as reflected in the Red Book forecasts, that although growth will slow this year in Britain, it will rise again next year. I thought that my right hon. Friend was right to point to the fact that in every single quarter of every single year since 1997&#151;despite the turbulence that there has been in global markets at different points during those 10 years&#151;Britain is the only G7 country that has been able to avoid negative growth in any single quarter.</p>

Unless we are confident about it, the danger is that there will be a disproportionate response to what are currently serious problems.

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80318-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08031882000008">When I look across the Atlantic at the United States, I think it is a tragedy that the ugly sound of economic protectionism has returned in that country above all others, which has been built on confidence about its place in the world and openness in its markets. Incidentally, protectionism has returned across the political spectrum&#151;in both the Republican party and, sadly, the Democratic party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80318-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08031882000009">In Europe, protectionism is as much a commodity of the right as of the left. It is striking that whereas Chancellor Merkel in Germany and President Sarkozy in France push full-steam ahead on other aspects of reform, when they speak about economic reform the message becomes somewhat blunted. For them, defence of the national economic interest comes first. That is why European Commission President Barroso was right when he said in a recent <i> Financial Times </i>interview that the two things to resist in the current climate are the return of both protectionism and over-the-top regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80318-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08031882000010">Nobody doubts that the US sub-prime mortgage crisis, the Northern Rock collapse, the Soci&#233;t&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale scandal in France and the global credit crunch necessitate a re-examination of how financial institutions operate. A highly integrated global economy brings many benefits, but it brings big risks as well, as the current turmoil in the financial markets demonstrates. That is why we will need to hammer out a global agreement on ensuring greater transparency in the future. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister was therefore right when he called yesterday for a re-examination of how global institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, operate, to ensure that global stability is maintained. In a world of global financial movements, more global co-operation is what is required, not less. That is why it is also right to resist the tide of anti-Americanism and the wave of Euroscepticism, both of which are all too prevalent in sections of our society.</p>

because a key lesson to be drawn from the events of the past few months is that no country is now able to stand alone. Nor should we seek to do so because, notwithstanding the self-evident risks, open markets and free trade are the best way to deliver results. The economies that have done best in recent times are those that have been most open. To see that, we need only compare the performances of Thailand and Burma or, even more graphically, North Korea and South Korea; we need only look at the experiences of the countries of Asia or Latin America, which by opening their markets&#151;if not yet always their politics&#151;have produced the biggest reduction in poverty that the world has ever seen.</p>

 I should say two things to the hon. Gentleman. First, that is a good question to put not only to Labour Members but to his Conservative Front-Bench colleagues&#151;let us remember that the Conservative party also made a non-dom proposal. Secondly, as we seek to maintain economic prosperity and stability in the future, it is important that our policy formulation on not only regulation but taxation sends the message to global investors and institutions that Britain is open for business, rather than closed. Opposition and Government alike have a responsibility to ensure that that is not put at risk.</p>

Is it right for the Government to have taken so much from business in last year&#146;s Budget, the pre-Budget report and this Budget? Last year, the CBI was talking about &#163;5 billion, and another couple of billion has been taken this year. Is that not the wrong thing to do at this time?  <br>

 Of course it is right that we help business. The hon. Gentleman was talking about manufacturing in particular, and I have no problem with that. The best way to help manufacturing is not by artificially protecting it. We learnt a lot of lessons during the 1970s and 1980s, when Governments tended to develop a pretty poor record of picking winners, but people could be certain that losers developed a pretty consistent habit of picking Governments. We should bear that lesson in mind. Open markets and free trade are the best way of delivering results. Of course there are limits to the role of free markets and Governments have a responsibility to ensure that markets operate both efficiently and fairly, but equally, we must recognise that there is a limit to the role of Government and the centralised state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="80318-0009.htm_para9"><a name="08031882000019">The second area about which I wish briefly to speak is the Government&#146;s role in tackling poverty and inequality. For me and, I suspect, for all Labour Members, it is a matter of great pride that a Labour Government have presided over the biggest falls in child and pensioner poverty that this country has ever seen, but we must also be candid about the fact that, despite rises in living standards and falls in poverty, a big inequality gap still scars our country. The ossification of British society&#151; the slowing down of social mobility&#151;that set in over many decades will clearly take more than one decade to unfreeze. Unfreezing it means recognising, as Amartya Sen, the Nobel prize winner for economics has rightly put it, that families and communities can suffer not only economic disadvantage but cultural, social, housing and educational disadvantage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="80318-0009.htm_para10"><a name="08031882000020">The Budget&#146;s proposals to lift many more children out of poverty are welcome, but if we are not only to raise the glass ceiling but break through it, we must do more to empower individual citizens, especially the poorest, to exercise more choice and power in the way that better off people nowadays take for granted. Social mobility will not advance if we think that only wealth is unevenly distributed in our society. Power is also unevenly distributed. Equity demands empowerment. Never mind its succeeding economically, if Britain is to get moving again socially, people need more than just support from the tax and benefits system and they need more than just help getting a job, a house, training or child care. They need to enjoy far greater control and to have a bigger say in how they lead their lives. That is why I welcome what the Prime Minister calls</p>
<a name="80318-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="08031882000135"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a new politics that places power...in the hands of people themselves.&#148;</p>

For example, it could have allowed individual citizens, especially the poorest, to take control of their own budgets, not just in training, as the Red Book suggests, but in health, in old age and particularly in education. In those aspects of the public service where it is less easy for the individual to exercise direct control&#151;most of us are hardly in a position to choose our own police officers, for example&#151;the Budget could have set out how power could be relocated to local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="80318-0009.htm_para12"><a name="08031882000022">I would have liked to have seen the Budget be far more ambitious in seeking to make Britain more of an asset-owning democracy. We know that asset owning  <br>

works. Those with assets tend to spend less time unemployed, and they enjoy better health and greater independence in their lives. Indeed, evidence from the US suggests that home owners are far more likely to engage in local politics and local neighbourhood organisations. As Larry Summers once famously said, &#147;No one ever washed a rental car.&#148; Why? Because ownership encourages people to act responsibly and independently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="80318-0009.htm_para13"><a name="08031882000023">Spreading asset ownership is crucial to tackling inequality and speeding mobility. That is because the most substantial inequities in today&#146;s society are no longer between income groups but between those people who own shares or have a pension or own a home, and the people who rely purely on wages and benefits. That is why I welcome the Government&#146;s efforts to increase housing supply in general, and the Budget&#146;s proposals to make homes more affordable through new equity loan schemes in particular.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80318-0009.htm_para14"><a name="08031882000024">Of course Britain needs more social housing, of that there is no doubt. But given a choice, most people would prefer to buy rather than to rent. The US sub-prime mortgage problem should not be allowed to derail the ambitious Government plans to extend home ownership to far more people. More than 1.5 million social tenants aspire to own their own home, and it is progress that 95,000 households have been helped into home ownership through shared equity schemes, but far more needs to be done. With fewer people able to afford to buy outright, and more young people dependent on their parents for financial help to get on the housing ladder, further reforms are clearly needed.</p>

new Prime Minister, statements made by a new Chancellor that showed a grasp of the great issues facing this country. He cannot conceivably claim that we are discussing a Budget that does any such thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="80318-0009.htm_para22"><a name="08031882000037">We all realise, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) and the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) said and as others will reflect, that this was a mini-Budget. It was absolutely devoid of vision and almost empty of any particular measures of any great consequence or significance. The Chancellor appeared to be the victim of events and not in control of any of them. I find that alarming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="80318-0009.htm_para23"><a name="08031882000038">Let me be fair to the Chancellor, as I belong to the trade union of Chancellors of the Exchequer. He did some good things; I am glad that he got out the old Gladstonian red box. His predecessor so hated any hint of tradition that I feared it had been lost. The Chancellor&#151;unlike the Secretary of State for Business and whatever&#151;takes scrupulous care when describing the evils of the past to talk about the problems of the early 1990s and has not slipped into that irritating habit of describing past problems as though the Government were in any way an inheritor of what they talk about when they go back to the 1980s and early 1990s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="80318-0009.htm_para24"><a name="08031882000039">I shall not even criticise the Chancellor for being boring, although he obviously was; I shall credit him for trying to minimise interest in the Budget that he was announcing, and to reduce the prominence of his own role in what is going on. Unfortunately, he does have a prominent role, and so far he has not responded to events.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="80318-0009.htm_para25"><a name="08031882000040">In his Budget statement, the Chancellor repeated the word &#147;stability&#148; over and over again, with an almost soporific rhythm. The same word was repeated a fair number of times today by the Secretary of State, the name of whose Department I honestly cannot remember yet. It used to be called the Department of Trade and Industry, and no doubt it will be called that again one day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="80318-0009.htm_para26"><a name="08031882000041">Less than a week has passed since the Chancellor&#146;s speech about stability, but the economic environment in which business is trying to earn its living does not look very stable. Seismic events have taken place in the markets, and the future uncertainty is very difficult to read. The credit squeeze is becoming serious on both sides of the Atlantic, and it is clear that we are in  the middle of a quite unprecedented financial crisis. Everyone agrees that there will be a marked slow-down in economic growth, but no one knows the extent to which the financial crisis will have a knock-on effect on the real economy. There will be a slow-down, but how many jobs will be lost and how many businesses will fail? Will the financial crisis even lead to the recession&#151;that dreaded word&#151;which, although not with us yet, is certainly on the horizon?</p>

He stated that with an air of complacent confidence, but the biggest question marks of all hang over the inheritance left by the Prime Minister to his successor as Chancellor, and over the Chancellor&#146;s ability to produce measures to deal with the problems that have arisen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08031882000044">The events of the past day or two throw into stark contrast the reactions to events, and the decisions that have been taken, on either side of the Atlantic. There has been another bank failure, although I accept that the analogies between Bear Stearns and Northern Rock cannot be stretched too far. However, when the crisis finally came, the decision taken on the other side of the Atlantic was dramatic and rapid. Within a matter of hours&#151;and certainly within a very few days&#151;steps were taken for the US Government to intervene and reassure the many organisations that are creditors or counterparties to Bear Stearns. A private sector partner was found after only a couple of days and, with the business transferred into new private sector ownership, the risk to the American economy and taxpayer was minimised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08031882000045">On this side of the Atlantic, we had the much smaller problem of Northern Rock. In contrast with what happened in the US, decisions were taken here that were followed by several months of indecision. Ultimately, a bank that the Chancellor had said that the Government did not wish to nationalise was taken into complete public ownership. That was followed by the preposterous statement that it would be business as usual while a strategy about where to go from here was devised.</p>

However, it was still possible to read in the newspapers&#151;certainly at the weekend&#151;that Government-owned and backed Northern Rock was offering the leading savings rates in the market to any depositor who wanted to buy the equivalent of gilts with no risk to capital value, and receiving a rather greater return, so we have some way to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08031882000047">In the Budget, the Chancellor produced nothing to add to any air of authority. He gave no indication that he thought that serious global problems might be about to have a serious impact on the UK, and he did nothing to regain the confidence of the business community that he was either the person to do anything about it or in a position to do so. It is not as though there were no warnings. The Chancellor has had an awful lot of bad luck since he took over&#151;for which he has considerable sympathy from me. One bit of bad luck was taking over from the predecessor who is now his boss and who, certainly at the time of the pre-Budget report, gave every indication of not allowing the Chancellor to produce any scintilla of a measure of his own to deal with matters.

back to what I said in the debate on the Prime Minister&#146;s last Budget. I found that I had been talking about the risks to the American economy because of what was already happening in the American housing market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para6"><a name="08031882000049">By the summer it was clear that the American housing market was in a state of collapse and the beginnings of the credit squeeze were coming. Throughout the autumn, it was obvious that the impact of the credit squeeze on the British economy was becoming pronounced and that slow-down was imminent, so it cannot be said that the Chancellor had no time to prepare a strategy and that there was no opportunity to give us a greater description of how he would help to ensure that the British economy would not be too badly affected by the inevitable consequences of what is now happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para7"><a name="08031882000050">The content of the Budget was trite. The Chancellor followed the party line set out by his predecessor for the previous 10 years. Almost all the phrases, apart from the missing word &#147;prudence&#148;, were taken from the standard lexicon of the previous Chancellor since he took office in 1997. I have been trying to work out how they arrived at that modest package of measures. It seems to me that above all else, the authors&#151;who probably included the Chancellor, but more importantly, included the Prime Minister&#151;were dominated by the absolute determination to try to show that they would still comply with the previous Chancellor&#146;s fiscal rules. My advice to the present Chancellor is to stop doing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08031882000051">Nobody left on God&#146;s earth still believes in the previous Chancellor&#146;s fiscal rules, apart from him and such loyal acolytes as he still has in the Treasury helping to produce such things. The rules are completely incredible. The movement of the date of the cycles has been utterly ridiculous. Not only has the calculation of the national debt always excluded Railtrack and significant parts of the private finance initiative, which were due to come on to the books this year but for an accounting change that has been mysteriously delayed for 12 months because it cannot yet be accomplished, but it now calmly leaves out Northern Rock. Of course, the Government always intended to leave out Northern Rock. About three weeks ago, I received an answer to a parliamentary question saying that Northern Rock was contingent debt so it would not have to be counted. Given the danger that the Government may have made the statisticians slightly more independent than they were a year or two ago, there has been a change, but the Government are still coolly ignoring the debt as though it will be only temporary. We all hope that it will be, but we do not yet know how much will be called in.</p>

 To be fair, they never have been, but my hon.

serious reform of public sector pensions will be paid for by future Governments of every colour&#151;and by future taxpayers, but that is another matter. Things that should be in the rules have been left out, and keeping to the fiscal rules is a bit of an illusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08031882000054">It was obviously decided that this is no year to raise a lot of taxation, and I agree with that decision. Every Budget for some time now has raised taxation, as carefully and as stealthily as possible. If the rules were to be complied with properly, it would be necessary to raise billions of pounds in taxation&#151;the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested &#163;8 billion&#151;but it would have been most unwise to do so, given the extent of the economic slow-down that we will face. However, small or smallish amounts of taxation&#151;a couple of billion of pounds-worth or so&#151;have been raised to bring us just within the fiscal rules, taking us to just below 40 per cent. of gross domestic product, if the other forecasts are right. Again, that is a quite ridiculous guide to policy, and I do not think that it will work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08031882000055">The Treasury&#146;s borrowing forecasts have been totally and utterly unreliable for years now. I see no reason for believing that the forecasts in this year&#146;s Red Book are any more likely to be achieved than those in the Red Books for several years past, or even than those in the Chancellor&#146;s first attempt at a pre-Budget report last year. We will have a sharp economic slow-down. The figures in the Red Book for the likely take from corporation tax and value added tax are almost incredible. The practice of producing, for our delectation, a set of tables showing yet again an unfortunate and unforeseen rise in public borrowing next year, followed by a happy recovery two or three years later, has lost all credibility. If that was the core of Budget policy making, as it seems to have been, it was not rising to the urgency of events; it was not even a very sensible way of tackling the problem of the public finances, which should always be the first duty of a Chancellor presenting a Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para11"><a name="08031882000056">So where have we turned to for taxation this year? As the hon. Member for Taunton said, we have largely turned to the tax revenue-raising measures that the previous Chancellor put in last year&#146;s Budget and postponed for a year. Aside from that, a very old-fashioned approach has been taken. Labour Chancellors used to be more reluctant to go for fags and booze, but they did so this year. They have also turned to large cars. The mood has changed. The British have always had a puritan spirit, and that spirit is alive and well in the British media and among the British public. Although the British indulge in sin on a considerable scale, they always feel that they should pay tax on it, which is why we have always raised a disproportionate amount of our revenues from excise duties of one kind or another; that has been a popular feature of the British fiscal system for 200 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08031882000057">One problem was clearly described by the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan): parts of the industries affected&#151;the beer and pub industry&#151;are not in a great state to raise much more revenue. However, to be fair to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he did not pretend that the rises were to do with binge drinking and pleasing the <i> Daily Mail</i>, as I thought he would. I heard him give an interview, and he did say that the measures were intended to  raise money. The problem with taxes on beer and  alcohol is that they are somewhat regressive. They fall  <br>

disproportionately on the households of the less well-off, when the proportion of total income is taken into account. That, coupled with last year&#146;s changes doing away with the lower rate of income tax, undoubtedly make it a slightly regressive Budget for the second year running. The taxes on large cars are not sufficient to change the behaviour of people who can afford to buy them, so it is really a rather unoriginal way of raising tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08031882000058">Of course, income is also raised through capital gains tax and the tax on non-doms. I do not have strong feelings about either of those. Capital gains tax should be made more simple. I am worried about having a capital gains tax rate that is below the marginal rate on income tax; I think that we will see many of our accountant friends back in the business of turning people&#146;s income into capital gains. That was the backbone of many people&#146;s practices 20 or 25 years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08031882000059">I do not think that many non-doms will flee these shores, but I simply say that it is extremely unwise to consult on taxes. I do not understand why we have a pre-Budget report. We should have Budget purdah. I say: announce it on the day, and if the details are wrong, sort them out and correct them in the Finance Bill. I accidentally found myself in consultation on ending European duty-free travellers&#146; allowances. I had to listen to accounts of the number of airports that would close, and the tens of thousands of airport workers&#146; jobs that would be lost if I did not seek a derogation from the decision. I do not think that everybody will flee the City of London and go to live in boring islands overseas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para15"><a name="08031882000060">The capital gains tax change was unwisely made. It was wrong not only to break Budget purdah but to announce the measure in a pre-Budget speech that was really nothing more than a political extension of the exchanges in party conferences. It was wrong to announce, almost overnight, decisions on which no proper work had been done, and to do the work of getting the detail right&#151;for retiring entrepreneurs and so on&#151;in public, faced with a tremendous clamour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08031882000061">To conclude, what the Budget lacked was any notion of how the Government would face impending economic problems if the situation worsened. The Chancellor looks like a rabbit transfixed by the headlights. He is a boy standing on the burning deck and whistling inconsequentially the old tunes of his predecessor. There are many similarities between the British and American economies: we have had a housing boom; financial services are a large part of our market; and there is a credit squeeze here. This is no time to raise the tax on small businesses. We will have inflation and public debt as problems next year for sure; I hope that we have no worse.</p>

You have betrayed us on the Common Market and on so many other issues.&#148; I took that as a compliment, not just to me but to the right hon. and learned Gentleman. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08031882000063">Perhaps I am being too kind to the right hon. and learned Gentleman today, but if I may say so, his post-Budget speeches are improving. I have been in the House long enough to remember his speeches as Chancellor, when he stood at the Dispatch Box, doing an impression of a poor man&#146;s Brian Rix, pulling up his trousers and checking his braces to make sure that they were still in place. More than that, I remember some of the policies with which he identified himself and those that he supported. I pay tribute to him as a former Chancellor for the improvement in his speeches. He did not go so far today as he has on previous occasions, predicting the &#147;we&#146;re all doomed&#148; scenario that we have heard so often. He has not quite reached, if I may say so seriously, the standing of Nigel Lawson who, to his credit, when pressed by others, particularly on &#147;Newsnight&#148;, to help talk us into a recession and even worse, has resisted that temptation. The threat of recession is one of the issues that we must address in the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para18"><a name="08031882000064">In last week&#146;s response to the Budget from the Leader of the Opposition we barely heard reference to the problems that we see occurring across the pond. Are we to believe that since the days when the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe was Chancellor, right up to this week, no Chancellor of the Exchequer has had to take on board the challenge of globalisation and, particularly in the past week, the backdrop of turbulence, credit crunch and so on, and pretend that those factors do not exist?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08031882000065">I spent a great deal of time with my constituents at the weekend, and they are fully aware that times are difficult in the international context. They saw the Budget as well balanced and one that addressed the problems that we face in the United Kingdom, against the international backdrop that I mentioned. Yes, the Budget speech mentioned stability. Oddly enough, stability is important to people in my constituency, where employment matters, where we recall unemployment at 3 million, where we recall negative equity, and where we remember very high interest rates, not only on Black Wednesday but for many years around that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para20"><a name="08031882000066">I asked people whether they preferred the economic policies being pursued by the Government&#151;the low unemployment, the low interest rates, the low inflation and the rest&#151;and despite criticisms that they might have, which I hope to reflect in my speech, about some elements of the Budget, I know the choice that my constituents will continue to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para21"><a name="08031882000067">The Budget rightly focused on hard-working families and children living below the poverty line. The priorities were correct. I have some reservations, as I said, but I am a realist and I acknowledge the grim realities of the global economic slowdown signalled by the sub-prime mortgage crisis on the other side of the Atlantic. I hope, like my colleagues, to be constructive in the debate.</p>

Apparently, somewhere in the long documents that are produced as part of the Budget presentation, there was a reference to the fact that people with learning disabilities are obliged to fill in great long forms in order to find jobs. As co-chair of the all-party group on learning disabilities, I know that 65 per cent. of people with learning disabilities have made it clear that they want to work. If there are impediments to those people finding and keeping jobs, I am sure the Government, and especially the Department for Work and Pensions, will employ the sensitivity that that situation invites. Advocacy, which I have long supported in the House, especially when I was fortunate enough to get an Act of Parliament on the statute books, might apply in that situation and in others, as the Government rightly pursue their policy of making employment opportunities available to the great majority of our people, including those who experience disability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para23"><a name="08031882000069">There were many good points in the Budget. First, the high-profile restatement of the ambitious targets concerning child poverty will help galvanise the cause. The increase in child tax credit and the substantial increase in first-child benefit will help us towards the target and will help many of my constituents. Secondly, the plan to take more pensioners out of income tax, alongside the rise in pensioners&#146; minimum income to &#163;124, is welcomed by many. I am delighted to deliver that and other good news to my constituents in Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill. I would welcome Opposition Members joining me in that task.</p>

found constituents who thought the same way. I am beginning to think that Budgets are a little like football matches. We see a match, then read a report of it in the newspaper, and it is not quite what we thought we had experienced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para27"><a name="08031882000075">From an industrial constituency like mine that is suffering the effects of antisocial behaviour, I warmly welcome what the Chancellor has done, together with the measures taken by the Scottish Executive, in fairness both to the present Executive and the previous one, as well as the alcohol harm reduction strategy for England. Those measures are having some success and progress is being made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para28"><a name="08031882000076">I am sorry that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) is not in his place at the moment. I welcome the increases&#151;which, frankly, I thought rather modest&#151;in duty on alcohol, including spirits. The scotch whisky industry has not done too badly of late. Spirits make up many of the ingredients of the flavoured drinks that appeal to young people and cause mayhem. If we are to address the problem of spirits, we cannot ignore the fact that whisky is one of them. Not only were the rises right, but the revenues are being fed back into fighting poverty. We Labour Members welcome that aspect of the Budget; we recognise that the issue remains a challenge.</p>

Again, my hon. Friend the Member for Selby raised points that I want to make. I welcome the increase in fuel allowance. It is right that people&#151;especially the elderly&#151;should have the benefit of that increase, given that energy prices are so high. However, I do not want our welfare policies to subsidise the big profits of energy companies, and that prospect remains a big worry for me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80318-0010.htm_para30"><a name="08031882000078">I welcome what the Chancellor did on prepayment meters and social tariffs&#151;the increase from &#163;50 million to &#163;150 million. However, although some companies said that they were practising a social tariffs policy, people thinking that they really meant it were cheated. We need to consider such matters much more carefully. In other words, I want to say to the Chancellor and our colleagues on the Front Bench that given the problems of energy companies and the policies that they are pursuing, and given the role of Ofgem, we have to have a much more robust approach. In January, we will again have price rises, followed by massive profits in April. There will be another bonanza for shareholders and executives, but another winter of discontent for the less fortunate.</p>

However, before long we will face the same problem again. Incidentally, I would have encouraged the Chancellor to extend the provisions on the fuel allowance to families with disabled children and perhaps, in time, to other families with people who endure acute disabilities. Before we know it, it will be winter 2009, when winter fuel payments will be rolled back to the pre-Budge rate. I recognise that the commitment this year is a one-off, but I hope that each year the fuel allowance will be reviewed and a realistic payment will be delivered to those who very much deserve it.</p>

assessing the costs for people, especially the elderly, as they try to decide between heating and eating. The role of energy regulators needs to be reviewed. My hon. Friend the Member for Selby made a compelling case in saying that such matters should go before the Competition Commission; I certainly support that view. It is time that we made switching suppliers meaningful and not just a slogan.

What I want is meaningful stability, not just slogans. We hear grim talk about the old fabled man in the street, and platitudes about Government competence being not about how they perform when things are going well, but how well prepared they are to cope when things get tough.

The proposals in the Budget to continue with an excellent record on international development and overseas aid fit comfortably with the challenge of tackling poverty&#151;a challenge taken up by those on the Labour Benches and one of the reasons why I joined the Labour party at a youthful age and continue to support it with great pride.</p>

It is right that at this stage of the millennium our Government should address themselves to such issues. In presenting his Budget, the Chancellor had every reason to feel proud. Although my constituents accept that we have much more progress to make, and will remind me that that is what they want, they recognise fairness when they see it&#151;and this Budget was, above all, a fair one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08031882000085">The Chancellor has now presented himself as the steadfast helmsman steering us through the global economic storm, but I contend that in some key respects the Government&#146;s own navigation has contributed to the gathering gloom. To continue the nautical analogy, the squalls were apparent long before they hit us, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) said, and perhaps the Government were tardy in reefing their mainsail in time</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08031882000086">The Chancellor said that his Budget is responsible and that it matches increased spending with vital reforms. We all share that concern for reform and I welcome the examples of change that I have seen in my role as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. I always try to give credit where it is due. However, I have also witnessed too many examples of waste and inefficiency to share the Chancellor&#146;s supreme confidence in the certainty of savings that he promised us. I want to make that the gravamen of my contribution, which, I hope, will not be too long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08031882000087">Spending on health has doubled and there are many more doctors and nurses, as we were reminded, but hon. Members will perhaps not be surprised to learn that the statistics in the Budget speech do not reveal the full picture. There was no acknowledgement that productivity in the health service has fallen in recent years. Hon. Members might not trust me implicitly on statistics, but, on this occasion, they can also rely on the Office for National Statistics. Its latest completed figures show an average 2 per cent. decrease in NHS productivity between 2001 and 2005, which is worrying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08031882000088">Let me be clear: those who work in the NHS deserve to be paid a decent wage. We know that our lives and those of our constituents depend on them. They are not to blame for the inconsistency in outcomes. After all, the worst work on their behalf is often done with the best of intentions. For example, our Committee will shortly take evidence on the recent National Audit Office report on the new GP contract. There is the small matter that it cost &#163;1.76 billion more than the Government expected, and that a 2.5 per cent. decrease in primary care productivity accompanied the first two years of the contract. Of course, the Government had predicated the entire reform on a productivity rise. The contract for NHS consultants was a similar story, and the predicted productivity rises have yet to happen. The cost of out-of-hours care was, again, higher than forecast, and delivery struggled to fulfil expectations. That is constantly repeated in public service delivery.</p>

 Is not the lack of accountability a genuine concern? By the time problems come to light, as with the chaos about the Bicester asylum centre, Ministers and permanent secretaries have moved on, so that when people appear before the Public Accounts Committee they can claim, &#147;Not me, guv, it was the previous lot&#148;, and no one is accountable for the wastage.</p>

effective Budget scrutiny systems. I shall deal with that in a little more detail before I sit down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08031882000091">I do not take issue with the rosy portrait of reform that the Budget statement presented for the sake of blind opposition. There is no point in that. We all believe in reform and I welcome, for example, the proposal that long-term recipients of incapacity benefit should attend assessments of their fitness to work. That is good, but hon. Members listening to the Chancellor would be forgiven for thinking that his &#163;30 billion of savings a year are already in the bank. They are not. We have prepared numerous reports on the existing efficiency programme. The record on reform to date shows that savings are easy to predict but harder to achieve in practice. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), the shadow Chief Secretary, knows that well as he prepares for government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08031882000092">There are many wise men and women in the House today, but another, John Locke, wrote that</p>
<a name="80318-0011.htm_brev0"><a name="08031882000137"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;an unerring mark of the love of truth is not entertaining any proposition with greater assurance than the proofs it is built upon will warrant&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08031882000093">To put it another way, experience tells us that the Budget is counting on chickens with a poor record of hatching. As a giver of candid advice, I therefore say to those on the Treasury Bench, as many of us have many times, that public faith in public services will not withstand public failures to deliver genuine reform, which is what we need and want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08031882000094">The price of failure to deliver productivity gains and efficiency savings will be paid in higher taxes and higher borrowing. That price is paid by us all, but, as I said in last year&#146;s debate, the burden is felt most by those who can least afford to bear it&#151;the poorest and most vulnerable members of society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08031882000095">As hon. Members know, I believe that there is a strong moral case for lower taxation, especially for those least able to pay. Some hon. Members agree and others have yet to see the light. However, I believe that few hon. Members would dissent from the equally strong moral case for removing inefficiency and waste from public services. That is the case that we fought to further in our Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08031882000096">To give them credit, those on the Treasury Bench accept more than 90 per cent. of our recommendations, and hundreds of millions of pounds are consequently saved. That is an example of what parliamentarians can achieve when we work together, especially when we are supported by the National Audit Office. However, our scrutiny of public spending happens only after the event, to revert to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury made. We can encourage those who come next to imitate the good and avoid the bad, but we cannot head the problem off at the pass. That is true of many issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08031882000097">Today, the non-doms issue was mentioned. Evidence on that is mixed. I have heard anecdotal evidence to suggest that many middle-income earners are leaving the country. I welcome the concessions in the Budget statement, but, in a sense, I disagree with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe, who speaks with all the authority of a former Chancellor, because I believe that pre-Budget scrutiny would help resolve such issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08031882000098">We have debated the taxation of family cars. The public are only just waking up to the fact that their small family cars, not the large gas guzzlers, will be taxed. There was insufficient debate about the cost of the Iraq war and the Afghanistan operation. There is nothing more boring than listening to people saying, &#147;I told you so&#148;, and my right hon. and learned Friend and I voted against the war. However, it has cost the Government &#163;5 billion and it has cost the US Government $3 trillion. Another &#163;2 billion is set aside for what will happen in Afghanistan and Iraq. All such issues need to be debated more often and in more detail in the House as the Budget goes through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08031882000099">Let us consider what happens in Congress in the US. I believe that opportunities to unleash the collective wisdom of the House are far too limited compared with what happens in Congress, where the President proposes, but Congress disposes. There are literally hundreds of hours of line-by-line debate on the Budget. What emerges from Congress is different from the President&#146;s proposals. Our powers in the House are far too limited. It is true that we have the Budget debate and three days of debate on the Supply estimates. However, the Budget confirms spending plans that are set out in the comprehensive spending review, of which there is almost no systematic scrutiny. The estimates are debated only after the beginning of the year in which the spending takes place. There is therefore little opportunity to influence the Government, even if they are listening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08031882000100">Hon. Members who serve on departmental Select Committees will also recognise the difficulties because they have so much more to do on policy issues. They have difficulty in consistently devoting sufficient time to spending proposals&#151;indeed, they hardly consider them. Parliament was created hundreds of years ago primarily as a financial watchdog on the Government. It sat mainly during the whole Budget process. That power has atrophied and there is a huge scrutiny gap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08031882000101">Let me suggest a modest solution. I believe that the House should establish a Select Committee on the Budget, with the normal powers of Select Committees&#151;I ask for no more&#151;but with the specific purpose of considering the Government&#146;s spending plans. To allow the good sense and good faith of Members to have the greatest influence, hearings should be held well before plans take on the formal force of estimates. After all, voting against the supply of funds is tantamount to bringing down the Government. I do not suggest that; there is no nuclear option here. We need far less than that. My proposal would not shake the foundations of the constitution, nor would it significantly inconvenience the Executive. The Government would need to produce spending reviews by the summer recess&#151;a feat achieved in 2002 and 2004, and missed last year only because of the then Prime Minister&#146;s extended goodbye. Annual updates would not be difficult to provide. The NAO would be willing&#151;I know, because I have asked&#151;to assist the House by analysing the information and providing a commentary for the Committee to consider at hearings each autumn.</p>

 I can safely say that I have considerable sympathy for the points that the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) made about the need for the House to reassert control over the raising and spending of tax. However, his was a somewhat unique contribution from the Conservative Benches. To listen to the criticisms that have been made of the Budget one would not realise that under this Government, with the stability that they have managed to achieve, we are close to almost any definition of full employment, and that we have the highest levels of employment ever, the highest ever living standards and record numbers of pensioners and children raised out of poverty, partly through the national minimum wage, which both opposition parties opposed, and tax credits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para23"><a name="08031882000107">I am always a bit reluctant to accept homilies from those on the Tory Benches about putting money by for a rainy day. After all, the previous Tory Government took in &#163;70 billion in capital takings from privatisation over 18 years, treating that money as revenue, which would be regarded as dodgy by even the slackest accountants in the private sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para24"><a name="08031882000108">I was struck by some of the earlier references to wealth creation. The definition of &#147;wealth creators&#148; that a lot of people use is a little narrow. A report was published yesterday outlining the cost to business in this country of sickness, which was estimated at about &#163;100 billion a year. The people who reduce that level of sickness contribute hugely to wealth creation. Were those in the national health service not doing their job, a lot of the wealth being created could not be created.</p>

they normally want to reduce regulation, but I believe that we need massive regulatory reform of the banking system, which includes introducing tougher and more effective regulation, both nationally and internationally. The Government are trying to hang on to the stability that has made the improvements over the past decade possible, but that is being severely undermined by the current earthquake in international banking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para27"><a name="08031882000111">It is no good the Tories trying to blame the Government for the current earthquake in international banking. The international banking crisis has been created almost entirely&#151;certainly 99 per cent.&#151;by the people who operate the international banking system. The trouble with the bankers, and their useless auditors and even more useless risk assessors, is that the mess that they have created will affect everybody. In all probability it will affect people&#146;s mortgages, and it may affect their pensions, savings and jobs. I know that Conservative Members smile whenever I attack the banking industry, but I believe that most people in this country are disgusted by what has happened. All the achievements of the stability that the Government seek are at risk because of the banking crisis&#151;a crisis brought on by the practice of the banks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para28"><a name="08031882000112">It was not long ago that bankers had an image of being a rather careful lot of people. They were careful with their own money and with our money&#151;&#147;prudent&#148; or &#147;conservative&#148; were not the words for it. however, that has not been the case in recent times. A substantial number of people now involved in international banking have behaved more like a collection of wide boys, trying to con the others, who were idiots, but they have not been playing with their own money; they have been playing with other people&#146;s money and jobs. Those bankers have not been wealth creators; they have been wealth manipulators. As they were not risking their own money, their main objective was to maximise their bonuses and then leg it as quickly as possible, with little regard for anyone else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80318-0011.htm_para29"><a name="08031882000113">That does not apply to everybody in international banking or everybody in the City. However, virtually all of them have become dedicated followers of fashion. They say, &#147;Well, we&#146;ve heard that A, B and C are on to a good thing, so we can&#146;t possibly not get on to that good thing ourselves.&#148; That is how so much of the British banking system joined the United States in being exposed to the famous sub-prime mortgage market, although the situation is not so bad here. It is usually said that the amount of money made available for mortgages in this country has increased to meet the increased cost of houses. However, I believe that the process has generally been the reverse&#151;that prices have risen to meet the amount of money that the financial system has been willing to lend.</p>

 I certainly think that the regulatory authorities have some responsibility. Above all, however, it has to be the responsibility of the practitioners&#151;or, in this case, what might be described as the malpractitioners. They were seeking to maximise the amount of money that flowed across their desks because they always got a percentage of that money. If the price of a house went up, say, from &#163;100,000 to &#163;150,000, they would get at least a 50 per cent. increase in their rake-off. I believe that we need further constraints and a much more powerful Financial Services Authority in order to constrain such practices. </p>

For example, when people buy a washing machine or deal with a water company, it is a novel experience if their letterbox is not overwhelmed with brochures for insurance for their washing machine or insurance policies against the possibility of leaks developing. It gradually becomes clear to anyone with a grain of sense that these companies make more money out of the insurance than out of the washing machine, and that they make more money by insuring people against a risk that is unlikely to happen than by selling people water. Everything seems to be shifting towards financial services in that way.</p>

Well, all I can say to the Financial Services Authority is, &#147;Why don&#146;t you go and tell that to the bankers who got involved in the sub-prime mortgage scandal?&#148; We have a worldwide system based on people trying to get something for nothing, promoting extravagant borrowing by hedge funds and private equity, and promoting a system of general speculation. </p>

These are the people who appear on television and on the radio and who are lauded on the business pages of newspapers. &#147;Oh, he&#146;s the chap from Merrill Lynch. We&#146;d better listen to him.&#148; Yet Merrill Lynch lost $22 billion on sub-prime mortgages. Or it might be someone from that great Swiss institution UBS, which lost $18.7 billion. I was also struck by the fact that, at least according to the latest list, Bear Stearns has lost $2.6 billion on sub-prime mortgages, yet its rescuer, JPMorgan Chase, has lost $2.9 billion on sub-prime mortgages. So the great heroic firm that bailed out Bear Stearns has actually lost more money than the bank it was bailing out. My submission is that we simply cannot leave these matters to people with such a dreadful record of ruining the economy.</p>

Might not the companies with offices in Barcelona and Madrid as well as in New York and London have spotted the fact that under the Spanish banking system people were not allowed to get involved in sub-prime mortgages, because that was against the law in Spain? Did it not occur to them that there might be some merit in the Spanish law, and that it might offer some protection?

Were there not other factors involved, such as an increase in marital break-ups, people living longer, and rising population numbers?

I am not quite sure what has happened to Prudence. I am very concerned about Prudence, but she seems to have been debauched. She has disappeared and we now hear nothing more about her. She has gone and the new girl on the block is Stability.

An analysis of last Wednesday&#146;s Budget by the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed that spending would have to be slashed by billions if the Chancellor does not want to break his economic rules. The IFS has said that it could mean Ministers having to plan tax increases to avoid cutting back on schools and hospitals if they should perchance win the next general election, which I think is increasingly unlikely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80318-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08031894000008">The IFS added to the gloom around the Budget in pointing out that middle-income households have been hammered by rises in tax for drinkers and family car owners. Robert Chote, director of the IFS, has said that details hidden in the Budget report reveal that the annual growth in spending will be cut to 1.8 per cent. in 2012-13, meaning a reduction in spending by around &#163;8 billion by 2013&#151;which would be equivalent to an income tax rise of 3p in the pound. That will be the result of the very substantial cut of &#163;8 billion in public spending. No wonder that polls since the Budget reveal that fears about rising prices in food, fuel and taxes are people&#146;s biggest worries. Soaring gas and petrol prices, higher council tax and bigger supermarket bills were among the recurring themes of those who commented on <i> The Times </i>online response to the Budget, to which 2,500 people contributed.

Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and reflected in the concerns of many of our constituents; 66 per cent. agreed that the Government spent too much in the good times, so they were raising taxes now; and 74 per cent. agreed that green taxes were just an excuse to raise more money. It has not escaped the attention of most people that the Chancellor is not offsetting the green taxes raised in one place with taxes elsewhere; he is simply taking the green taxes as additional taxation.</p>

Just 21 per cent. of voters say that they would trust the Government more than the Opposition to raise their families&#146; living standards; the Conservatives have a decisive lead on that issue. The overwhelming majority&#151;83 per cent.&#151;believe that the economy will either grow more slowly over the next 12 months or slide into recession. There is no question of people having to talk about this; the fact of the matter is that our constituents are genuinely concerned about what is happening to the UK economy. They find it rather depressing when all that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor can do is simply repeat the mantra of &#147;stability&#148; in the hope that if they say it often enough, it might actually happen.</p>

At 28p in the pound, the UK has one of Europe&#146;s highest rates of corporation tax. This Government&#146;s spending binge has seen the size of the state balloon&#151;from 37 per cent. to 45 per cent. of gross domestic product. Under this Government, the cack-handed expansion of means-testing has seen the savings ratio plummet from 11 to 3 per cent., with consumer debt now a staggering 156 per cent. of household income.</p>

That is why last week&#146;s Budget imposed a net tax rise of &#163;2.5 billion&#151;the precise opposite of what is now needed.</p>

This time last year, when the Prime Minister delivered his final Budget as Chancellor, he said that the Government would borrow &#163;30 billion during 2008-09&#151;the fiscal year about to begin. Yet in his first pre-Budget report, the present Chancellor raised that estimate to &#163;36 billion&#151;an alarming increase. Last Wednesday, the Chancellor jacked that amount up even more, announcing that borrowing in 2008-09 would, in fact, be &#163;43 billion. In other words, in just 12 months, the Government&#146;s borrowing estimate for next year has increased by no less than &#163;13 billion, a jaw-dropping 43 per cent. rise.</p>

During 2010-11, the UK will increase its liabilities by another &#163;32 billion&#151;way higher than the Prime Minister&#146;s &#163;26 billion estimate last year. In sum, our borrowing totals for 2008-09 to 2011-12 have gone up by &#163;20 billion since the Chancellor&#146;s pre-Budget report.

However long and soporifically the Chancellor drones on for, we often discover a lot of the nasties either in press releases issued by the Treasury afterwards or in the small print. This year was no exception. The Chancellor made no mention during the statement of the rise in the earnings ceiling for national insurance by &#163;100 to &#163;770 a week, but it was in the details of the Red Book. Analysts suggest that from 6 April next year, the 11 per cent. band will apply to earnings up to &#163;40,040. Anyone on &#163;41,000 or more will therefore pay about &#163;500 a year more.

Business will not be deceived. The Chancellor is imposing more than &#163;1 billion in new taxes on small firms at just the wrong moment in the economic cycle. He appears oblivious to that. He delayed a further &#163;200 million tax rise on family businesses only because he realised at the last moment that it would not work.

 I do not propose to comment on what was said by the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry), because he repeated large amounts of what we have already read in the newspapers. What I will comment on, before I come to my main point, is the principal line that the Opposition appear to be taking in the debate. It was taken by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan), by the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), the former Chancellor, and by the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee. Their argument was that the Government were at fault because they could have prepared earlier and better for the downturn. My argument is that this is not a normal downturn in a regular business cycle, and it is disingenuous and simpliste to suggest that that is so when the two central factors in the crisis are the United States sub-prime fiasco, for which the United Kingdom Government are not responsible, and&#151;linked to that&#151;the massive shift to securitisation and the opaqueness of trade assets. Because of the complete failure in the role of the credit rating agencies, the toxic effect of that was discovered too late.</p>

merely saying that this massive crisis, this downturn which may turn out to have cataclysmic proportions, is somehow the fault of the UK Government is absurd. That is absolutely not the case. The situation is much more complex and much more unpredictable than that. In a situation of such gravity, it would be better for the House to refer to a real analysis of the facts than to try to gain cheap political capital.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman must not suggest that the Opposition&#146;s critique of the Government&#146;s economic policies is being expressed only in the context of the credit crunch, which, as he said, was not created by this Government. We are running a higher fiscal deficit than all but three developed countries. We have an economy that has grown in an extraordinarily unbalanced way over the past few years, with a housing market that has been spiralling out of control. Does the right hon. Gentleman not believe that, in the absence of the credit crunch, we would still have faced a downturn at some point as those effects inevitably unwound?</p>

 I recognise that there were issues of long-term sustainability, some of which the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. In fact his intervention has helped me, because my main argument will pick up some of what he has said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80318-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08031894000045">There was one rather odd omission from the Budget. It contained next to nothing about dealing with tax avoidance. That is quite surprising given the difficult state of the public finances&#151;to which the hon. Gentleman rightly drew attention&#151;the Chancellor&#146;s obvious need to close the gap, and the current international campaign led by Germany to tackle the scandal head-on, which I consider very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80318-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08031894000046">As we know, the hole in public revenues amounts to some &#163;40 billion. That is a large amount, and it is increasing. The Treasury forecasts that the figure will be &#163;7 billion higher than was suggested in the October pre-Budget report. The Chancellor had every incentive to claw back tax avoided and evaded to help balance the books without raising taxes for the rest of the population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80318-0013.htm_para9"><a name="08031894000047">A recent pamphlet produced by the Trades Union Congress and written by the tax accountancy expert Richard Murphy found that tax avoidance and tax planning&#151;by which I mean fabricating plans artificially in order to pay little or no tax, a device employed by very rich individuals&#151;now account for about &#163;13 billion a year, while the same device employed by companies in rather different ways accounts for a further &#163;12 billion a year. There is obviously plenty of scope for much tougher anti-avoidance measures that would benefit everyone else. If such persons can be made to pay their due and proper taxes, others will need to pay less. Moreover, Inland Revenue statistics show that those who are paid more than &#163;100,000 a year, who constitute less than 1 per cent. of the population, now receive &#163;8 billion in tax reliefs and allowances.</p>

as we have read, believes that it is losing nearly &#163;25 billion a year in tax evasion by rich Germans holding anonymous trusts in Monaco and Andorra, in addition to others who, rather curiously, were outed by a whistleblower as having secreted huge sums of money in another tax haven, namely Liechtenstein. Germany is now demanding cross-national action to force countries with banking secrecy to share information. That is a favourable climate for the UK to participate and take the lead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80318-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08031894000049">Since there is considerable evidence that super-rich British people also use these and other tax havens&#151;notably the Cayman Islands&#151;for the same purpose, a crackdown on those avoiding their tax responsibilities could produce big benefits for the UK Treasury and, my goodness, there has never been a time when the UK Treasury needed big benefits as it does now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80318-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08031894000050">Why was that not done in the Budget? I suspect the reason is the stranglehold exerted by the City on the Government&#151;particularly on the Prime Minister, I have to say&#151;who have been persuaded that the financial enclave of the City of London is central to the economic interests of the UK as a whole. I submit that of course it has an important role, which I would not downplay for a moment, but the idea that it is central to the UK economy is quite another proposition.</p>

The problem is that, by sucking talent and capital from other parts of the economy, the remarkable successes over the past 10 years, which I am the first to praise, have been bought at a very high price&#151;I would say too high a price.</p>

The volatility and excesses of the finance sector are outweighed by the 1 million jobs lost in manufacturing over the past decade, the stagnant industrial output, the &#163;7 billion-a-month trade deficit, and the weakness of manufacturing investment and of the so-called knowledge economy&#151;R and D&#151;which is confined to a very few sectors. Those also have to be taken into account. My point is not that the City of London does not have a key role, but that it cannot be allowed to exploit that role at the expense of reducing the capability of Britain as a sustainable industrial base.</p>

The UK has for example regularly refused to allow the deduction of tax from interest payments within the EU, which would hugely restrict the effectiveness of tax havens because the basic rate of tax&#151;presumably about 20 per cent.&#151;would already have been deducted from the income before it reached the tax haven.

Not only is closer regulation of the financial markets clearly now imperative to prevent future damage to the international economy&#151;the precipitate collapse of Bear Stearns is clearly not the last of it&#151;but the UK in particular can no longer afford either the prohibitive cost of the tax privileges of the City or, just as importantly, the collateral manufacturing damage inflicted on Britain as an industrial nation. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Before the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) gets carried away, let me remind him that Winston Churchill, as Chancellor in 1925, said that he would rather see industry with head held high and finance less proud.

It is surely, by contrast, a responsibility that they make a fair contribution to the overall public gain of which they are a part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="80318-0013.htm_para19"><a name="08031894000057">There are several ways to achieve that. Obviously a key one is to seek to eliminate tax haven abuse. The non-governmental organisation Tax Justice Network calculates that the total assets now held by the wealthiest people in the world in tax havens amounts to a staggering $11.5 trillion, at a potential cost to world Governments in tax forgone of about $255 billion. To put that in context, the money lost to Governments worldwide is more than two and a half times total global aid flows last year.</p>

Instead of just having occasional amnesties, however, all UK dependencies and protectorates&#151;particularly the Cayman Islands&#151;should now be required to use the same standards of disclosure and accountability as the UK itself. The UK standard should also be tightened by requiring all UK-registered companies to report annually on all their overseas subsidiaries, including their revenues and how many people are employed. If we were to introduce that transparency, it would dramatically improve the prospect of fair and balanced tax collection, and I intend to table an amendment to the Finance Bill to that effect&#151;if the Government do not do that first. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Yes, I think that that is unlikely, which is why some of us need to assist and nudge an arm or two.</p>

Abolition might not be the answer, but there should certainly be a considerable reduction in its application. As for so-called capital gains on all assets held for less than a year, they are clearly not capital gains but a form of income, and they should be treated as such and be subject to income tax.

Hundreds&#151;if not thousands, or tens of thousands&#151;of individuals bring their talent and wealth to London and this country not just because it is a great country to live in, but because it is worth their while financially to do so.

 The right hon. Gentleman made three points in what was a rather long intervention, and I shall try to deal with all of them. First, it is impossible for the Treasury or anyone to predict how tax changes&#151;on the non-doms, for example&#151;will affect people&#146;s behaviour. Tax changes very often create unintended consequences, which, had we understood at the time, might have changed our view of the changes. Treasury officials and Ministers tend to take a rosy view of how much revenue tax changes will yield. They rarely underestimate how much extra tax revenue will be gained by a tax increase, but there is a tendency to underestimate by how much tax revenues will rise when we cut taxes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="80318-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08031894000073">That brings me to the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s second point&#151;we will just have to disagree about the Laffer curve. It is an extremely logical and provable relationship that lower tax rates increase economic growth and tax revenues. His final argument about there being a trade-off between a low tax regime that attracts talent from around the world and manufacturing is completely fallacious. The fact that the UK is responsible for 90 per cent. of the currency and bond trading in the European Union although we are outside the euro, and that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has resulted in our attracting much of the equities and derivatives trading to London seems to pass him by. The idea that if we clobbered the City, closed it down as the world&#146;s premier financial centre and drove all that offshore, there would then be an instant revival in traditional manufacturing is fantasy&#151;it bears no relation to the real world in which we live.</p>

 This is an interesting ideological discussion. Does the hon. Gentleman share my dismay that in the whole of his 20-minute speech, the right hon.

 I would like to pick up on a point made about the abolition of the 10 per cent rate. Only last week, my surgery received a visit from a pensioner couple who could not understand how they have been caught by a grievously punishing tax increase. The lady is a non-taxpayer on a modest pension; the gentleman did pay 10 per cent. tax but will now pay 20 per cent. tax, and there is nothing that they can do about it.

We cannot pin that one on the Government. What we can point out, however, is that over the years people have warned about a forthcoming credit crunch.

Budgets have become increasingly unintelligible; they talk about, &#147;Sustainable growth and prosperity&#148; but it is difficult to find a Government table illustrating debt, borrowing and spending, given the chapter heading:</p>
<a name="80318-0014.htm_brev5"><a name="08031894000152"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Fairness and opportunity for all&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80318-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08031894000084">I wish we would get back to more intelligible Budget documentation. Nowhere does the book refer to the end of boom and bust, which is what we were promised. No matter how many times the Prime Minister promised an end to boom and bust when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, any sensible person knew that no Government could promise that. Thus, in the good times one is meant to prepare for the bad times. One thought that that was what the golden rule was all about&#151;it was meant to be about building up the capital in the good times so that we could weather the bad times, but that did not happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80318-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08031894000085">What has happened over the past 10 years is that the Government have substantially increased public expenditure. It has risen from 37 to 42 per cent. of gross domestic product, which is a 40 per cent. real terms increase over seven years and has the effect of overcalculating GDP. A useful table produced by Reform shows that GDP is inflated by about 7 per cent. merely by increasing public expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80318-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08031894000086">As the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) said, nurses and doctors create wealth too. If more money is spent on nurses, doctors and teachers, that contributes to the GDP. Unfortunately, the large increases given to health and education over the years have not produced the commensurate increase in output and productivity&#151;in fact, productivity in the health service has collapsed. That is one of the reasons why some of us prefer the private sector over the public sector when it comes to deciding how to modernise public services. Interestingly, even this Government are importing all kinds<i> &#151;</i><i> [Interruption.]</i> The Chief Secretary is looking suspicious, but she might ask herself why treatment centres are to be run by private companies.

period. Of course, taxation has lagged behind the increase in spending. Taxation has only grown from 35 per cent. to 37.5 per cent. of GDP, which means that we have moved from a fiscal surplus of 1.7 per cent. at the beginning of the period to a fiscal deficit of 2.7 per cent. That is at a time when we should have been paying off our public debt, not increasing it. When we compare those figures to other countries, we see that Australia&#146;s 3.7 per cent. deficit during that growth period is now a surplus of 1.3 per cent. In New Zealand a 0.2 per cent. deficit in 1999 is now a 3.3 per cent. surplus. Whereas other countries have been building up their funds for the inevitable correction in the markets that takes place after any period of sustained economic growth, our Government have been storing up economic problems for the future, so that we are in the worst position to deal with whatever crisis the international markets throw at us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80318-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08031894000090">It is worth pointing out that the increase in taxation and spending, and the lost productivity that tends to happen in the private sector, has led to a consistent overestimate of tax revenues. In each of the last seven years, as the Taxpayers&#146; Alliance demonstrates, tax revenues have come in substantially below forecast and Government spending has overshot. The Government have shown very little discipline with public spending, even overshooting their own forecasts. Substantial increases in spending of 4.3 per cent. per annum on average over 10 years have outstripped economic growth. Consequently, the debt to GDP ratio has risen from 30 per cent. to 37 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80318-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08031894000091">Now we have the credit crunch, which was entirely predictable. The Library has kindly provided me with figures for household debt in relation to GDP for the US and the UK. In the US, where the sub-prime mortgage crisis has occurred and triggered everything else, household debt was 66 per cent. of GDP in 2005 and rose to just under 100 per cent. of GDP in 2006. It has continued to worsen in the last two years so that it is now more than 100 per cent. geared to GDP. We keep hearing how irresponsible the US financial system is, but precisely the same has happened in the UK. It is an extraordinary coincidence, but in 1995 household debt was 66 per cent. of GDP and in 2006 it had gone up to &#163;1.3 trillion, equivalent to 100 per cent. of GDP. It has continued to get worse and the Government have done nothing about it. They are responsible for monetary policy through the Bank of England, and it is no good disclaiming responsibility for it.</p>

There are only three ways to deal with accumulated debt. The Government can inflate their way out of the debt, so that everybody&#146;s debt is devalued by inflation. People can work to pay their debt off, but the markets have decided that there is so much debt out there that defaults are likely. It is not surprising that we now have a crisis in the banking system. Of course, I share the cynicism of some Labour Members about why some of those people in those institutions make those decisions. I should declare an interest in that I used to work in the City in the venture capital markets, but the responsibility of investors is to make good and sound investment decisions and to walk away from the deal when it becomes too expensive.

We heard the word &#147;stability&#148;, but it was an invocation with remarkably little power behind it. Public expenditure will be on a tighter rein in future years, but it will only stabilise at around 42 per cent. of GDP, which displays a continuing upward trend. That is assuming that economic growth and tax revenues match the Government&#146;s anticipated figures, which is unlikely. It also assumes that we meet the tighter spending targets, also unlikely under this Government.</p>

It has been about hoping that something will come up between now and the next election to bail out the Government and prevent them from having to face the consequences of being a tax and spend Government, as all Labour Governments turn out to be. The Government have squandered the economic inheritance that they received from the Conservatives; failed to reform the public services as many sincerely hoped that they would do; and failed the British people.</p>

 Several hon. Members have spoken about the technicalities of the Budget, but I want to talk about the impact it will have on people and how we can address some of the problems facing those who will feel the impact of the decisions that will be made by the House tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="80318-0014.htm_para20"><a name="08031894000096">I welcome some aspects of the Budget. First and foremost, as a former apprentice mechanic, I was pleased to hear that we will continue to support the development of apprenticeships, which should be welcomed by every hon. Member as a way to address the problems of our young people and provide them with better and different types of education. The lowest number of apprenticeships ever was 25,000 in 1992. Many of the industries that many of us had grown up with had been destroyed, and there was no one to provide apprenticeships. Thankfully, that has been turned round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="80318-0014.htm_para21"><a name="08031894000097">We have also done well in supporting 250,000 children who have been taken out of poverty, although there is clearly much more to do. I also want to focus on pensioners. It is noticeable that Age Concern and other groups have welcomed the fact that 600,000 pensioners will no longer pay tax, through the changes made last year, and the increase of the minimum income guarantee to &#163;124. The positive moves on the heating allowance are also welcome, but they would have been a bit more positive if they had been made last year&#151;2006-07&#151;when some of us were arguing for a &#163;100 increase in the heating allowance for people aged over 60. It is a shame that that has not been followed through this year.</p>

low-paid workers raise with me, and we must address it in the coming months and years. The &#163;50 on the heating allowance for those aged between 60 and 64 will be more than eaten up, because they will pay at least &#163;2 a week more in tax, according to letters I have received from the Treasury. They will get &#163;50 in one hand and have &#163;100 taken from the other. That is not the way to make progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80318-0014.htm_para23"><a name="08031894000099">I come back to the issue of the reinstatement of the link between earnings and pensions, which has been discussed before and forms part of the Pensions Bill. We must stop debating whether it will happen, and the time that it will happen should be brought forward, because by 2012 many people will be out of the loop as they will no longer be with us. The other aspect to that is that once the link is restored, it will not be enough to leave it at that, because 15 or 16 per cent. of the average salary in 2012 will be much less in 2020 in cash terms. Although the percentage might be the same, the National Pensioners Convention estimates that in 2012 the link will be worth 15 or 16 per cent. but that the gap will be about &#163;500. Ten years beyond that, if there is not an uprating mechanism, the gap will be nearer to &#163;1,000, and that is not acceptable. I have suggested to the Treasury that when the link is restored we should put in place a commission such as the one that monitors the national minimum wage, which would consider all the factors that impact on pensioners&#146; lives and say that we should uprate pensions above and beyond the current link.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80318-0014.htm_para24"><a name="08031894000100">Another positive move, which has not quite gone far enough, is the good news about smart meters. Smart meters are the way ahead for the energy companies, for the green agenda and to help people in this country save money. Reports out this weekend have estimated that, in the north-east alone, if every household had a smart meter put in it would save people &#163;50 million and reduce carbon emissions by 300,000 tonnes. That could be replicated across the country, but we need some impetus. The small discussion in the Budget, although it is welcome, is not enough. We should have the same mental attitude as we had in the 1960s, when we converted every house with gas from ordinary gas to North sea gas. We did not let anything stand in our way. We should say to the utility companies, &#147;If you want to carry on making money in this country, you must work with the Government and put in smart meters as a matter of urgency.&#148; I suggest that the utility companies would be up for that; we should be up for it, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="80318-0014.htm_para25"><a name="08031894000101">We must also do something about prepayment meters, because people are being robbed by them. I am glad that the Budget has made moves in that direction, but an Energywatch report this year showed that people were being charged up to &#163;300 more for the same amount of electricity as others simply because they cannot afford or have access to direct debits. That is out of order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08031894000103">I have three practical cases that we could pursue to bring back those people who feel that they have been left out. First, I suggest that we consider introducing free school meals for every child in this country. It would at a stroke reduce the stigma for those who have free school meals at the moment. It would obviously increase uptake. It would develop healthy eating habits. It would, I hope, give children a more educated outlook about what food is and the importance of a balanced diet. It might also mean that some children would get at least one good meal a day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08031894000104">I also suggest that we should consider keeping children in schools at lunchtime. It might not be popular with children, but it would certainly be popular with local people because it would reduce antisocial behaviour and litter. It would also give teachers more time to spend with the children and encourage them to develop the children as human beings. There will be a cost, but I believe that the benefits will outweigh the cost. Obviously, some parents would gain financially if they no longer had to pay, but the long-term health benefits and the importance of a healthy diet should outweigh that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08031894000105">The second issue that I ask the Treasury to consider is the fact that for more than 30 years we have been committed to equal pay for men and women, but for more than 30 years we have failed to address the problem properly. Last year, one in five employment tribunals were about equal pay. Unison and GMB between them have 60,000 cases lodged at employment tribunals against the NHS and local authorities. Some negotiations have seen some success, but ultimately the lack of resources from national Government has prevented real movement. Even the most successful cases, which have been negotiated, are being unravelled by no win, no fee lawyers. The Government and employers have a duty to ensure that pay audits are performed and that they deliver equality. Only real Government support can address the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para4"><a name="08031894000106">We have put this off for 30 years. It is 11 years since the single status agreement was agreed in local authorities. It is nearly five years since the agenda for change was agreed in the NHS. If we as a Government do not find the resources to give to public authorities, the probability is that the employment tribunals and the courts will make it their responsibility.

Some 2.5 million people have rejected the privatisation of their homes under various ballots for arm&#146;s length companies, or arm&#146;s length management organisations&#151;you name it. Many more left in-house provision because they were given little, if any, real alternative. In Sunderland, for example, they were told, &#147;Your houses need an investment of &#163;250 million. If you don&#146;t vote for it, you won&#146;t get any investment, but your rents&#146;ll go up &#163;5 a week.&#148; Obviously, people did what they thought they had to do.</p>

people are on local authority waiting lists. It is the biggest issue that I face in my constituency, and we have decent council housing. My surgery, postbag and phone calls every day bring cases of people with housing issues: they cannot get a house, they cannot get the house they want, they want to be out of the one they are in or the one they are in needs upgrading and they are waiting for it to be upgraded. I am not saying that we have not done anything about that&#151;we have. The truth is that if we want to be faithful to the working backbone of this country, we must give local authorities the tools they need to deliver good social housing.</p>

Do we not trust councils? Do we not think that they can deliver? Do we not have faith in them? We should have&#151;they are our people.

We should all have aspirations to make this world a better place for the people we represent, no matter what their background.</p>

We have people who will leave &#163;1 million and more. The issues that working people in my constituency bring to me are those that affect them day in, day out. I spoke yesterday to a gentleman who runs a local pub, and he said, &#147;What on earth are you doing? Are you trying to drive us out of business?&#148; An increase of 4p on a pint of beer might not sound like much, but the smoking ban&#151;whether we like it or not, and I think we made the right decision when we imposed it&#151;has had an impact on pubs. People can go down the street and buy 24 litres of beer for &#163;16. If the guy who runs the pub wanted to sell 24 litres of beer, he would have to charge &#163;100, which would give the Government and the country a lot of VAT that they would not get from the supermarkets, so we lose in every sense of the word.</p>

That will not impact on binge drinking or disorder. People are not going to stop going out and getting smashed just because we have put 4p on a pint of beer, but that increase might close community locals where people are just hanging on by their teeth. Surely that is in nobody&#146;s interest.</p>

We ask fewer staff to do more work for less pay, so it is no wonder that they ask, &#147;Where is our Government going?&#148; It is our responsibility to look after them, because they carry out the work that we decide must be done.

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson), who spoke powerfully and sincerely about the matters that concern people in his constituency. I hope that the Minister was listening. I suspect that politically, there are things that will divide us, but the hon. Gentleman made a very powerful point about aspiration. That is a subject that has not been mentioned much in the debate, although I hope to talk about it in a moment.</p>

While we focused on the contents of the Red Book, the fate of Bear Stearns&#151;Wall street&#146;s fifth largest investment bank&#151;was beginning to unravel. This debate has been going on since last Wednesday, and in that time Bear Stearns has been sold off, for a price that represents just 6 per cent. of what its value was last week. Last week most of us may not have been intimately familiar with Bear Stearns, but its fate has repercussions for us all. Many hon.

private savings and a record balance of payments deficit have left this country exposed, because we rely so much on other people&#146;s money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para18"><a name="08031894000121">However, the debate has made it clear that it is the level of Government borrowing that is exposing us to the worst of the bad economic weather. We have had 15 years of steady global growth. Over that period, any sensible Government&#151;like any sensible business&#151;would have taken the opportunity to build up their position and put something in reserve. Not this Government, though: instead of entering the downturn with a healthy surplus, they have built up a huge deficit. At 3 per cent. of GDP, our budget deficit is worse than that of all our major competitors&#151;unless, of course, the Government now wish to count the Egyptian economy as a major competitor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para19"><a name="08031894000122">What a wasted opportunity it has been! Having inherited a golden legacy, Labour could have&#151;should have&#151;used the past decade to invest for the long term and prepare for the downturn. What have we had instead? The Government have not taken the long, strategic view; rather, we have had a decade of petty tinkering and meddling, of petty targets and stealth taxes. I suppose it was no surprise that last Wednesday, with the global financial markets in turmoil, the Chancellor dithered over whether we should have a ban on plastic carrier bags. That was the extent of the vision in the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para20"><a name="08031894000123">One result of the Government&#146;s obsession with fiscal tinkering is that this country now has the longest and most complex tax code of any major economy. Since 1997 &#147;Tolley&#146;s Tax Guide&#148;&#151;the principal compendium of all our tax regulations&#151;has doubled in size and is now nearly 10,000 pages long. Ministers claim that they want to simplify the tax system, but their policies are achieving the reverse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para21"><a name="08031894000124">The Red Book&#151;I shall carry on calling it that, although my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) was right to say that both its colour and its purpose have changed&#151;contains all the principal measures in the Budget. Two pages are devoted to tax simplification, but they are accompanied by tax law explanatory notes 270 pages long. Indeed, the explanatory notes on all the changes are longer than the entire Red Book itself. By tinkering and meddling with dozens of taxes, rates and thresholds the Chancellor&#151;and inevitably, of course, the Prime Minister before him&#151;has created a hideously complex system that wastes the time and money of every taxpayer and business in the land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para22"><a name="08031894000125">That leads me to the Government&#146;s peculiar approach to so-called tax abuse. I am sorry that the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher) is not in the Chamber at present, as he gave us a fascinating description of how he thinks we should clamp down on anyone who is successful. Hon. Members will know that until 1997 there was tax avoidance and there was tax evasion; one was legal, the other was not. The Prime Minister, when he was Chancellor, rejected that approach. He believed that too many people were abusing the system and not paying what he thought that they should. He therefore devised the new notion of tax abuse, which sits somewhere between evasion and avoidance and, peculiarly, straddles both legal and illegal activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para23"><a name="08031894000126">For example, the IR35 rules were brought in to tackle freelancers who the Prime Minister, when he was Chancellor, thought were abusing the system. We were told that millions of pounds of taxpayers&#146; money would be recovered, but the reality is very different. For example, of the 1,400 cases taken out against freelance members of the Professional Contractors Group&#151;a body that represents just one part of the marketplace&#151;only three have been prosecuted successfully by the taxman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para24"><a name="08031894000127">The same misguided thinking can be seen in the so-called &#147;income shifting&#148; proposals. Over the last few years, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs&#151;sanctioned by Ministers&#151;has spent nearly &#163;500,000 on a single vindictive case against Mr. &amp; Mrs. Jones of the Arctic Corporation, over an alleged liability of only &#163;40,000. There was a good use of public money: spending &#163;500,000 on a case to reclaim a &#163;40,000 alleged irregularity! Ministers lost the case, both on appeal and in the High Court, so what did they do? They decided to change the law, with the result that they now seek to interfere in every family business and to decide the value of what different owners bring to that business.</p>

<p><a name="st_o218"><a name="08031894000128"><a name="80318-0015.htm_spnew1"><a name="08031894000187"><b>Mr. Jeremy Browne:</b>
 Does the hon. Gentleman share my grave concern that if the family business is a farm, it is very difficult to quantify what each member brings to it? There is the farmer, and his wife may help with bread and breakfast, while his son, daughter or son-in-law may help with mending farm machinery or with the harvest at the appropriate time of year. The Government have deferred implementing the proposal for a year, but they have not scrapped it altogether. The problem is that it will be massively intrusive, and will lead to a huge rise in bureaucracy for small businesses. </p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend&#151;I mean with the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne), although he has been present in this debate for so long that he is becoming a friend to those of us on the Conservative Benches. The hon. Gentleman is right: how will the Government implement that proposal, other than by using clipboards and intruding unnecessarily into every family business?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para25"><a name="08031894000130">I welcome the decision by the Chancellor to delay the proposals by a year, but it would be far better if common sense prevailed and they were dropped altogether. The perceived abuse is smaller than Ministers have been told, and as the hon. Member for Taunton suggested, the costs of trying to resolve the problem&#151;economically and, if I may say so to the Chief Secretary, politically&#151;will prove far greater than the benefits the Government seek. Rather than creating a vicious circle by creating new laws and then trying to clamp down on the changes that are made as a result, Ministers should make our tax laws simple, clear and constant. By doing that, they would tackle the root of the problem; they would remove the desire and the opportunity to evade one&#146;s obligations. A simpler and fairer tax system is what the UK needs, and I am pleased to say that that is what my party is proposing.</p>

about the importance of small businesses and highlighted a number of policies that he obviously hopes will begin to restore their confidence in him. Well, if I were him I would not hold my breath.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para27"><a name="08031894000132">After the last year small businesses have lost whatever faith they may have had in the Government. First came the increase in small company corporation tax, then rising business rates, then an extra &#163;10 billion in new regulatory costs and finally the &#163;900 million capital gains tax bombshell. The result of all that is that from April&#151;in just a few weeks&#151;the tax bills of small businesses will rise by &#163;1,000 million per annum, and from April 2009 they will rise by &#163;1,500 million per annum. Given the economic downturn, why increase tax bills for 99 per cent. of businesses? Given that small businesses employ more than 10 million people, why make their finances worse, just when the economy needs all the help it can get?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para28"><a name="08031894000133">As I said, the Budget was accompanied by a White Paper on enterprise. Ministers describe it as a &#147;strategy&#148; but in fact it is the usual new Labour hotch-potch of warm words, photo opportunities and good intentions. To be fair, there are some good points in it&#151;on procurement and invoice finance, for example. I am pleased that the Government finally accept that some small businesses should be exempted from some regulations. For the past seven years, since I have been a Member, Ministers have fought tooth and nail against that principle, but now that they have accepted it we shall see whether they mean what they say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para29"><a name="08031894000134">On female entrepreneurship, we heard from the Secretary of State earlier that it is important to increase the proportion of women who start and run their own firms. I entirely agree. It is a sad truth that British women are only half as likely to run their own firm as their counterparts in America. However, we have heard that language from Ministers before. In the 2005 Budget the Prime Minister, who was then the Chancellor, announced a new women&#146;s enterprise task force. We were told that it would turn things round in three years and make demonstrable progress, yet 11 months after the announcement Ministers had not even appointed a chairwoman to run it. With less than 12 months left to undertake the earlier initiative, we have another announcement and another initiative. The truth is that such Whitehall-led, top-down initiatives rarely work, and those that show promise are never given the long-term commitment needed to make a real difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para30"><a name="08031894000135">In his opening remarks, the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform proudly pointed to the rise in the number of small companies as a sign that our entrepreneurial culture is increasing. However what he did not say is that the increase has been slower than the growth in our population. The start-up rate has actually fallen, from 3.2 per 1,000 people in 1997, to only three per 1,000 last year.  The other critical measure of that activity&#151;total entrepreneurial activity&#151;has also dropped, from 7.7 per cent. in 2001 to 5.8 per cent. in 2006. Despite what the Secretary of State claims&#151;and, I suspect, hopes&#151;the culture of entrepreneurship is reaching a smaller and smaller proportion of the country; it is a culture that is shrinking, not spreading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para31"><a name="08031894000136">Similarly, small firms are growing more slowly. All the leading independent statistics show that the proportion of small firms achieving turnover at the critical figure of &#163;1 million after five years has fallen&#151;from 48 per cent. in 1997 to only 16 per cent. in 2006. In fact, in the UK it now takes an average of 14 years for a company to reach a &#163;5 million turnover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="80318-0015.htm_para32"><a name="08031894000137">Of equal concern is the fact that fewer small businesses employ people than 10 years ago. The most recent statistics show that the figure has fallen to only 28 per cent. of SMEs. In other words, after 10 years of Labour Government, seven in 10 small firms no longer employ people. When Ministers produce whatever their next set of employment regulations may be, they might just want to reflect carefully on why fewer businesses want to employ people.</p>

While DBERR&#151;the Department for business&#151;is publishing its enterprise White Paper, the Treasury is simultaneously raising small firms&#146; bills by &#163;1 billion. The sad conclusion, which I hear all the time from the business community, is that DBERR Ministers&#151;business Ministers&#151;are increasingly irrelevant. Last year, when asked about corporation tax rises, the Secretary of State for business merely referred people to the Treasury. He said that he had nothing to say. When the Chancellor announced the capital gains tax rise he did not even consult the Secretary of State for business. What use is a Secretary of State for business and enterprise who is completely overlooked by the Treasury when business taxes rise?</p>

The reality for the people of Wrexham is that the rate of unemployment has declined since 1997, when, under the Conservative Government, about 2,000 people in my constituency were registered as unemployed. That figure has halved; it is now just over 900.</p>

We should listen less to the doom-mongers on the UK economy and recognise progress when it has been made. I say quite candidly to the Conservatives that it would be extraordinary to listen to their lectures about running the economy. I was born in the same town as my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson), I think, and I experienced what a Conservative Government did to the UK economy between 1979 and 1997. I remember when, in the early 1980s, 3 million people were unemployed. I was seeking work in the north-east at the time, but I went to Germany to work during a summer holiday because there were no jobs available in the north-east. Unemployment was at 3 million not just once but twice under the Conservative Government. Lives were wasted and set aside for 18 years, so I do not listen at all to the arguments put forward by the Conservatives; they can give no lectures whatever about the economy and how to run it.</p>

 Absolutely, and it was a policy of waste. We should remember that during all those years when 3 million people were unemployed, each of those individuals was being paid benefits.

I invite him to see the prosperity, which is built not on public sector investment&#151;although there has been such investment in Wrexham&#151;but on the inward, private-sector investment in north-east Wales that I described. Retail investment is going into the north-east Wales economy from the private sector because it has confidence in the UK economy and the people who are bringing prosperity to the manufacturing industry and the area.</p>

There is not a universal picture. A million manufacturing jobs have been lost; 1,100 across Dundee in the past year. The hon.

 I speak of my constituency, and I realise, of course, that companies close in all constituencies, including mine, because we live in a globalised economy.

At that time, I wrote to the Treasury and to the Department for Work and Pensions. I also tabled a parliamentary question and established that it would cost about &#163;300 million to implement that. I tabled an early-day motion, which I am sure had an inordinate effect.</p>

So concerned has he been to convince us that all is well with his stewardship of the economy and that all is stable in his hands, that he failed to recognise&#151;and barely mentioned in his speech&#151;that the stable door has been blown open by the financial storm coursing around the globe, and is left flapping in the wind.</p>

contributions. We did not cause the crisis; nor are we talking it up. However, we do believe that the Chancellor needs to wake up to the consequences of these unprecedented events, as many commentators warn that he should.</p>

In his speech last week, he talked up the resilience of the UK economy and today Ministers and the few Back Benchers who have turned up to support the Chancellor have been parroting that mantra too. However, what is there to be so resilient about in an economy whose house price inflation is among the highest and most resilient&#151;in that sense&#151;in the world? Our household debt levels are at record highs and our consumer saving ratios are at record lows. The day after the Budget, Roger Bootle, a leading economist, wrote:</p>
<a name="80318-0016.htm_brev1"><a name="08031898000039"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our housing market is one of the most over-valued; our consumer saving ratio has plunged to levels only exceeded by the US; we are heavily exposed to the global economy, which is threatened; we are heavily dependent upon international financial activity, which could be severely hit; and our scope to take expansionary fiscal action is limited by our recently lax fiscal policy. On balance we are relatively badly placed to weather the storm.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="80318-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08031898000024">That says it all&#151;far more than the Chancellor has acknowledged in his assessment of how we are placed to cope with the financial crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80318-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08031898000028">One example of the speed of change is that the central forecast in the Budget is for house price growth of 2.5 per cent. per annum. Figures for last month show that house prices have already declined, after five successive months, to an annual rate of only 1.4 per cent. So, before the year has even begun, we are considering an optimistic annual house price assumption in the Red Book.</p>

It leads to an overwhelming lack of credibility. The Chancellor chose to downgrade his GDP growth range for 2008 to a range of 1.75 to 2.25 per cent., rising back to trend after 2009. However, he did that on the back of consensus economic forecasts, which looked to 1.5 to 1.7 per cent. The bottom of the Chancellor&#146;s range for growth in GDP in the year that is about to start is marginally above the consensus average. Independent commentators, who gave evidence to the Treasury Committee on Monday, raised particular anxieties about that. Bridget Rosewell  <br>

from Volterra Consulting described the Chancellor&#146;s forecast as complacent. She said:</p>
<a name="80318-0016.htm_brev4"><a name="08031898000042"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The particular form of optimism that I find most disturbing was not that overall headline number, where even the bottom end of the range is above the current consensus, which seems odd, but also the discussion about the UK&#146;s resilience to economic shocks and how this is expected to have increased. It was the complacency surrounding that which I found particularly disturbing.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="80318-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08031898000030">What does that forecasting optimism mean for the public finances? The Government, especially the Chancellor&#146;s predecessor, have form on forecasting the public finances. Every year since 2003&#151;seven years in a row&#151;the year in which public finances cross over into Budget surplus has been pushed out. In the 2003 Budget, it was predicted to happen in 2005-06. Only last year, in the 2007 Budget, the date was pushed to 2008-09. The pre-Budget report, which was published only last October, pushed it to 2009-10 and the Red Book now says that it is to be 2010-11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="80318-0016.htm_para20"><a name="08031898000031">The public sector net debt, excluding Northern Rock and the international financial reporting standards&#151;IFRS&#151;changes, to which my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) referred, has increased by &#163;20 billion over the period of the Red Book. What impact does that deterioration in public finances have on the Government&#146;s famed sustainable investment rule? It places it perilously close to a breach. Table C5 on page 184 of the Red Book shows that public sector net debt reaches 39.8 per cent. of GDP. How much headroom does that give us? Headroom of 0.2 per cent. is equivalent to only &#163;2.8 billion. That compares with a &#163;13 billion to &#163;14 billion average forecasting error since 2003. That leaves a high probability of a breach&#151;a 50:50 chance, according to the experts who spoke to us on Monday. Where is the discussion about what happens in those circumstances in the Chancellor&#146;s explanation of the Budget? It appeared nowhere in his speech or in the Red Book. The Chancellor is crossing his fingers that it will not happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="80318-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08031898000032">Of course, the figures completely exclude the impact of Northern Rock, which the Office for National Statistics declared will have to be added to the public debt yet the Chancellor conveniently decides that he can ignore. The ONS calculated the Northern Rock debt at 30 June as adding 6.7 per cent. to the public sector net debt as a proportion of GDP, blowing us way off the sustainable investment rule. Yet that has not been discussed and there has been no explanation of what the Government will do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80318-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08031898000033">The figures also exclude the impact of moving the public accounts on to an IFRS basis. The Government have agreed to that but decided to defer doing it for another year. That is likely to add a further &#163;30 billion of PFI off-balance-sheet debt to the public sector net debt. Again, there was almost no discussion of that in the Chancellor&#146;s presentation.</p>

Much has been made of the fact that it is fiscally neutral and, technically, it is, but only for the year that starts in April.

Budget in 2007 and since, the figure rises by a further &#163;1 billion to &#163;2.8 billion in the third year of the Budget, so we are talking about a tax-raising Budget, not a tax-neutral Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80318-0016.htm_para24"><a name="08031898000035">By and large, the measures in the Budget are puny&#151;that point was well made by the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne). Of the 52 measures set out in table A.1, which shows the fiscal impact of the policy decisions in the Budget, 42 have a fiscal impact in the first year of plus or minus &#163;25 million or less. Indeed, many have either a zero or an insignificant impact. By 2010-11, some 34 of those 52 measures will continue to have a minimal impact. Those measures amount to tinkering at the edges and have little significance on the national accounts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80318-0016.htm_para25"><a name="08031898000036">Overall, the measures are also regressive. Almost everybody earning less than &#163;18,000 will be worse off under the proposals, particularly if they drink, smoke or drive. The more significant measures have been shambolically introduced. Other hon. Members have talked about the capital gains tax changes, which were announced in the pre-Budget report. It was then announced that there would be a rethink, but the rethink was delayed. Finally, the proposals were confirmed a few weeks ahead of the Budget, giving business men very little opportunity to arrange their affairs before the end of the tax year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80318-0016.htm_para26"><a name="08031898000037">The Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform had the gall to argue that the Budget is a Budget for entrepreneurs that, to use the expression that I think he used, abandons short-termism. In fact, the Government&#146;s capital gains tax proposals abandoned the very incentives that encouraged long-term investing. Is it any wonder that the Government&#146;s reputation for economic competence has now been exposed as blowing in the wind?</p>

The UK is now third in the G8 ranking for early stage entrepreneurship, which is very creditable, up from fifth in 2001. That is a considerable improvement. The proportion of the working age population expecting to start a business in the next three years has increased by 70 per cent. Again, that is very creditable and a good story. The proportion of the population who believe that they have the skills to start a business has increased by a quarter, from 40.2 to 49 per cent.</p>

It is a firm with enormous promise named Lifeforce, which has world patents on a process for parking the immune system&#151;that is, extracting the white cells from blood transfusions and placing them in three different locations, to be stored for a lifetime if necessary. They can then be brought out for use if the person&#146;s immune system is under attack or has been damaged by chemotherapy or by a disease such as AIDS. The white cells can then be used to re-infuse the healthy immune system into the body. This is an exciting development.

Its procedure is now a practical proposition that has been approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in this country and by the Food and Drug Administration in America.

It involves the national insurance scheme, which is very unfair at the moment.

However, people in this happy situation have reached a time of life at which we could certainly afford to do so, but those of us in that position pay nil per cent. Most hon. Members pay about 1 per cent., because our earnings are high, but people at the bottom end of the pay scale can pay up to 10 per cent. of their income in national insurance contributions. It is a hugely unfair tax.</p>

Indeed, they are receiving some of the benefits of the national insurance scheme that others might not live long enough to enjoy. That would be a just measure, and it would raise the sum of &#163;2 billion. Those fortunate enough to be in that happy position would find such a tax acceptable.</p>

The actuaries insist that there should a surplus of about &#163;17 billion, to allow for a serious increase in unemployment. However, we have built up a surplus that is way beyond that amount in each year over recent years, and we now have a surplus of about &#163;48 billion. If we were to continue in that way, by 2013 we would have a surplus in the national insurance scheme that could fund a rescue in another Northern Rock crisis, if there was one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para6"><a name="0803194000013">The current situation is unfair because the money is being used as though it were ordinary taxation revenue. It is being used in the same way as other taxes are used, but it has been raised unjustly, because it is a tax that falls more heavily on the poor and the low paid than on those who are very well off. I would like those on my Front Bench to consider my proposal and to change the whole nature of the national insurance scheme so that we no longer build up those surpluses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para7"><a name="0803194000014">A great deal has been made by the Leader of the Opposition of last year&#146;s UNICEF report that was critical of the progress that had been made on tackling child poverty in this country. It is a great shame that the same people who exaggerated the effect of that report did not look at UNICEF&#146;s report from 2004. It came from the same body from the same source&#151;the Innocenti centre in the Piazza della Santissima Annunziata in Florence&#151;and said that of the 25 richest countries in the world, the country that had achieved most in reducing child poverty was Great Britain. That report was totally ignored by the press. I tried to get some attention drawn to it in an early-day motion, because it had had no coverage whatever, as positive news tends to be something that people do not want to hear. We do not see headlines in the papers about that sort of thing, but it gave impressive recognition of all that the Government had done to take children out of poverty. It is, of course, the negative news that gets the attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para8"><a name="0803194000015">The leader of the Conservative party recently wondered how we could allow child poverty to happen and how we could have got ourselves into such a position, but given the extent of child poverty under the 18 years of Tory Government from 1979 to 1997, he should be more careful in his remarks. When the Tories came into office, by the same measure, one in seven children were in poverty; but by the time they left office, it was one in three. That is a terrible record of indifference to the relative poverty of those at the bottom end of the scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para9"><a name="0803194000016">We should also look at certain enterprises that the Government have entered into and we should become more critical of the Chancellor&#146;s involvement in the nuclear industry. An extraordinary answer was given to my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Davies) a fortnight ago. It revealed that an enterprise that had been opposed by hon. Members in speeches and in early-day motions and by environmental groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth nevertheless had the support of every party in the House. The amount of money spent on that flawed proposal, on an evidence-free and unscientific basis, was &#163;473 million.</p>

cause was impossible: it could not work; it was impractical and it had no rational basis. It was intended that the mixed oxide plant at Sellafield would produce 120 tonnes of uranium fuel every year. It has been in full production for five years now, yet it has produced only 5 tonnes&#151;a monumental failure. It is difficult to go back through our industrial history and find an investment that has failed as spectacularly as that, yet we still put this faith in nuclear power&#151;mainly, I think, because most Ministers and others involved in the enterprise feel themselves to be scientifically semi-literate or illiterate and do not question the claims made by the nuclear power lobby. We already know that the bill for clearing up the mess from nuclear power over the long term is something in the order of &#163;73 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para11"><a name="0803194000018">The affair reveals the extraordinary gullibility of the House. This is not ancient history either; it happened over the past eight years. It was in the year 2000 that the great debates about the mixed oxide plant were taking place in this House. Every one of the arguments put forward by the environmentalists and others in the House turned out to be justified, and the arguments supported by those on the Front Benches of all parties turned out to be false.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para12"><a name="0803194000019">The Lib Dem spokesman mentioned the farming industry earlier, and I would like to make another point about it. There is lobbying at the moment about problems in the farming industry, particularly in pig farming. Almost ignored, however, is the enormous amount of money being made by the grain industry, whose profits went up 70 per cent. one year and nearly 50 per cent. the next year. Those are huge sums. When we talk about additional burdens on the farming industry because of the price of grain, why do we leave out the fact that there have been those huge increases in the incomes of grain farmers on account of that? That is not mentioned&#151;we do not get a morning chorus of whingeing on the &#147;Farming Today&#148; programme about the huge windfall profit enjoyed by grain farmers. If sections of the farming industry are doing exceptionally well, there should be a virement to those sections that are under pressure. We should not continue uncritically to support the whole farming industry as we have in the past. The traditional subsidies are no longer supported, particularly given their effect on the developing world countries. Sadly, one man&#146;s subsidy is another man&#146;s poverty in another part of the world.</p>

An official launch will be held by Michael Scholar to celebrate the ONS&#146;s new independence. It was suggested that the Act that introduced that independence was of great importance, which it is, given the cynicism about national statistics. Under that Act, the full independence of the ONS will be guaranteed. The office is located in my constituency, and I remember being approached many years ago by statisticians who felt that their work and their integrity were being undermined by a previous Prime Minister, who was moving the ONS from one Department to another, and who had a vested interest in seeing that the figures might be fiddled in some way.

 I shall not speak for long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para14"><a name="0803194000022">Labour Members have been talking about employment and employment rates. Much to most people&#146;s surprise, I spent six years as a junior Minister ending in 1990, when the employment rate was higher than it is now&#151;that is my guess from the charts in the Red Book. I shall speak mainly, however, about trying to get more consistency into the Red Book.</p>

Obviously, figures on projections for population growth over the next 30 years are rather different from those on the balance of payments over the past 30 years. However, I shall give some illustrative examples, which will not be very exciting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para16"><a name="0803194000024">On page 11, in charts 1.1 and 1.2, on Government expenditure by function and Government receipts, it would be useful to have a run showing percentages, to illuminate how we are letting Government spend money. On page 18, chart 2.1 on inflation performance and expectations from 1990 to 2008 gives an 18-year run of years. Incidentally, in some of the graphs, it would be useful to have a log projection, rather than just a linear one, when the figures have changed significantly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para17"><a name="0803194000025">I will not go through the whole list, although I would if I had more time. The chart on meeting the golden rule has a 14-year run of years, and the chart on protecting investment has a 33-year run of years, I think, unless I have misread my own figures. On page 29, the chart on meeting the sustainable investment rule has a 16-year run of years. So it goes on. I could go through a whole series.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para18"><a name="0803194000026">I suggest that Ministers ask whether those different runs of years were put in because they asked for them, or because the officials suggested them. I suspect that political advisers said before Ministers saw them, &#147;I don&#146;t think the Minister would want people to see that. If you don&#146;t show the Minister, they can deny that they were the ones who made the decision.&#148; I ask for an explanation of the run of years, preferably in advance of the Red Book coming out.</p>

I should like to see an index, and in particular I should like to see the cost of the Red Book reduced from &#163;45 to about &#163;20. We do not need the photographs, although it is nice to see ethnic balance. Of the 10 people pictured, five are not white, five are, and there is one random hand floating around&#151;but we do not need that kind of thing, however balanced it may be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para20"><a name="0803194000028">Perhaps Ministers could ask an archivist to show them a Red Book produced, say, 30 years ago, and ask what the cost would be of printing it in that format. They would find that it would be substantially lower, which would reduce the costs incurred by those who want to see what we are doing.</p>

The consumer prices index is a separate thing: we know perfectly well that it is at 2.5 per cent., although it would have been at 2.2 per cent. if the methodology had been different. The retail prices index is at 4.1 per cent., which matters more to my constituents. The information that the price of strawberries went down in February is not much use to them, nor is information about the drop in the price of hobbies and games. They are interested in the real prices of real things, and the retail prices index matters to them.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley), whose speech was admirably concise. I am grateful to him for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para22"><a name="0803194000031">I want to say something about child poverty, which has featured in speeches by Members on both sides of the House since the beginning of the Budget debate. On Thursday, a source of contention between the two Front Benches was how Government and Opposition could aspire to reach the 2010 as well as the 2020 target. I think it both possible and desirable to eradicate child poverty in a way that fulfils the Government&#146;s commitment. If we define 60 per cent. of median earnings as the poverty threshold, it is entirely possible to raise people from below that level to above it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para23"><a name="0803194000032">There are two ways of doing that. First, there is what I would call the sustainable way. That involves creating circumstances in which people&#146;s earnings carry them from below the threshold to above it. The second way is to regard child poverty as an entirely fiscal phenomenon and to make financial transfers from one group to another, thus topping up poorer people&#146;s incomes and raising them above the threshold. That is not a sustainable method, and I think we should draw a distinction between the two. Our ambition to eradicate child poverty should go hand in hand with enabling people to stand on their own two feet, and to earn enough from the product of their labours to sustain themselves and their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para24"><a name="0803194000033">I find it slightly depressing that in recent weeks the debate about child poverty has concentrated purely on the fiscal transfer, as if that were the only possible way of addressing the problem. If, through a wave of the Chancellor&#146;s magic wand in subsequent Budgets, we were to increase the contribution of state benefits to take everyone who is currently below the 60 per cent. level above it&#151;so that, technically, poverty would have been abolished&#151;would we see an absence of all the social problems that we associate with poverty? Absolutely not. Many of them would continue to exist. The speech made today by the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) made it clear that poverty is as much a symptom of other social problems as it is a self-contained phenomenon to be abolished. We need a more sophisticated understanding of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para25"><a name="0803194000034">No one has captured that point better than my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith). He identified a range of  <br>

contributors to child poverty, from poor housing through poor education and dependence on drugs to family breakdown. Those are the issues that we must tackle if we are to make a sustainable dent in child poverty and, ultimately, eradicate it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para26"><a name="0803194000035">This should not be an issue of contention between both sides. One of the remarkable contributions of the right hon. Member for Darlington today was to suggest that we take a broader view. In that, he is consistent. I was struck by a speech he made recently in which, like today, he quoted Professor Amartya Sen, the Nobel prize-winning economist who has noted that social equality is best tackled if we tackle the root causes not the symptoms. The right hon. Gentleman said that that must mean moving beyond simply correcting low wages and family poverty after the event towards policies that spread opportunity and help people realise their own aspirations for progress. Correcting low wages after the event should not be enough. It might be a temporary palliative, but we should have higher ambitions.</p>

 I am sure that the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) is right to say that we need to go beyond trying to make sure that when people start having children, when their incomes are low and their needs high, money helps, but is not it odd that a Nobel prize winner can be quoted with approval yet when Keith Joseph said roughly the same thing, the whole of the media and the Labour party jumped on him?</p>

 As my hon. Friend points out, times change. I welcome the conversion of the right hon. Member for Darlington to the cause. At the moment, the debate is all about precisely what the right hon. Gentleman suggests we avoid doing: correcting low incomes after the event, rather than tackling the root causes. Last year 2.6 million families received tax credits, excluding the family element of the child tax credit. The number of people receiving this element of tax credit is double what it was in 2001 and treble what it was in 1997. The consequence is that 1 million children are above the poverty line by less than they receive in tax credits. Everyone must be relieved and grateful that they have been put above the poverty line and that their circumstances are improved, but do not let us pretend for one moment that the problem of child poverty has been solved. It has been masked or disguised. Those 1 million children are effectively in poverty and the state is intervening to drag them above the line. That is not a sustainable recipe. They need tax credits to escape poverty, so poverty has not diminished in that sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para27"><a name="0803194000038">The Chancellor has a golden rule and a sustainable investment rule&#151;a golden rule suggesting that we borrow only to invest, backed by a sustainable investment rule that makes sure that borrowing does not reach such a high proportion of national income that it dominates it. In tackling child poverty, we should have a rule that says that we must eradicate child poverty, but that the means of doing so should come from income and the ability of people to earn for themselves. That is the only true sustainable means of tackling child poverty. That makes economic and personal sense for the people concerned. It makes economic  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="80318-0017.htm_para28"><a name="0803194000039">That is the equivalent of the losses of the nationalised industries during the 1970s, when we accepted that companies such as British Steel and British Leyland could not possibly earn enough in their markets to sustain themselves and had to be given a permanent subvention from the Government. It is the equivalent today of the common agricultural policy, where rather than just protecting the incomes of farmers in times of volatility, it is permanently acting as a tax on every taxpayer in the EU and on the consumers of agricultural products.</p>

Our ambition must be to get people back into jobs by equipping them with skills, incentives and motivation so that we regard it as a failure if, having eradicated child poverty in 10 years&#146; time, we have not also made sure that that was down to the sustainable abilities of people to earn their income, rather than transfers from the state.</p>

 This has been an interesting debate, although it has not been particularly well attended by Labour Back Benchers. We started with 11 of them when the Secretary of State stood up, and at the low point of his speech we were down to six. He took what might be regarded as a sensible approach in the circumstances: he adopted the micro-economic approach to analysing the Budget. He focused on the enterprise White Paper, which some in the business community might think of as being akin to fiddling while Rome burns. He spent 20 minutes explaining the details of the well-meaning but rather small-scale proposals in the White Paper, when most of his audience were more concerned about the macro-economic backdrop, which seems to be deteriorating by the hour. Interestingly, he told us that the Government wanted to ensure access to finance for entrepreneurs, but then supported the slapping of an 80 per cent. tax increase on business angels.

He described the Budget as a Budget with a hole, because the most important measures&#151;the income tax changes&#151;were not in it. He pointed to a lack of purpose or any sense of vision in the Budget, and he contrasted it with the Budgets and speeches of the big beasts who have occupied No. 11 in the past, comparing what they did with this Chancellor&#146;s focus on the possibility of introducing a plastic bag tax at some time in the future. He described the Budget as a humiliation for the Chancellor&#151;a series of micro-announcements that he was forced to make to pad out the allotted 50 minutes, with &#163;1 million here and &#163;1 million there. He also gave a highly entertaining, but completely inaccurate, list of supposed Conservative policies, and I am thinking of seeing whether we can book him as an after-dinner cabaret turn for a future Conservative party conference.</p>

He also described the Chancellor&#146;s approach as calm, which is perhaps the friendly-fire version of the description of it as soporific by the hon. Member for Taunton. However, the right hon. Gentleman made a thoughtful speech, in which he focused on the need to support wealth creators&#151;although when he did so, not all Opposition Members were quite sure that he was taking along with him on his journey the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson), who was sitting next to him. The right hon. Member for Darlington also confirmed candidly that the relationship between business and the Government had been sorely tested over the past six months, and he called for a renewed focus on social mobility, which certainly all Conservative Members would agree with. He pleaded with those on his Front Bench to ensure that the Government focus on being an empowering Government, rather than a controlling one.

My right hon. and learned Friend also set out a critique of the complacency in the Chancellor&#146;s analysis of the strengths of the UK economy. He also contrasted the rapid resolution at Bear Stearns over the past 72 hours with the prolonged agony of dithering indecision that we have been forced to ensure as the Chancellor faced the Northern Rock crisis.

He wanted that applied to banks, markets, credit and mortgages. He took us on a trip down memory lane, describing himself as old-fashioned old Labour&#151;and coining an elegant new description of himself as &#147;heritage Labour&#148;. Perhaps he thinks he will be preserved for eternity under that label. All in all, it was a nostalgic performance, reminding not a few of us of his speech in last week&#146;s Northern Rock debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para5"><a name="0803194000048">The right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher) made a wonderfully old Labour speech that made the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras look like a dangerous moderniser. He took us on a tour of Monaco, Liechtenstein and the Canary islands, and he suggested an easy remedy for the Government Front-Bench team. Parroting the TUC line, he told us that the Chancellor could easily collect &#163;40 billion of avoided tax, and lambasted him for not doing so. He helpfully confirmed that, as we have argued, there has never been a time when the Treasury needed big benefits as much as it does now, and he attacked the Chancellor and his predecessor, the Prime Minister, for turning the City into a tax haven, assuring the House that the financial services sector and, as he put it, the so-called knowledge economy, could never replace manufacturing as the mainstay of the British economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para6"><a name="0803194000049">The right hon. Gentleman very effectively headed off what I believe he thought was going to be an intervention by me by citing to aid his case Winston Churchill&#146;s words as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1929. I suspect that some of my hon. Friends heard the unmistakable sound of flapping white coats as we reached the end of the speech&#151;but that is for them to say, not me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para7"><a name="0803194000050">My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) had a high-level economic debate with the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton, after which he spoke about the pernicious effect of the doubling of the 10p rate on some of the poorest pensioners in his constituency. He also pointed out that the Government were repeatedly warned of a coming credit crunch threatening an economy that is increasingly built on debt, both public and private. I apologise if time does not permit me to recall the contributions of all other hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para8"><a name="0803194000051">I welcome the Chancellor to his place. When the present Prime Minister was Chancellor, he was fond of recounting an old Treasury adage that there are only two types of Chancellor&#151;those who fail and those who get out early enough. He has gone, and the jury is out as to whether he got out early enough. So last Wednesday, it was this Chancellor who had to stand up to admit that at the end of a decade and a half of economic growth, his cupboard was bare, and he had no room for fiscal manoeuvre at a time when our competitors are responding to the economic slow-down by reducing taxes and boosting spending in a classic counter-cyclical response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para9"><a name="0803194000052">It was the Prime Minister who was responsible for the mismanagement of the economy that left the Chancellor with that empty cupboard. The Prime Minister was  <br>

responsible for the piling up of public debt through the good years while our neighbours and competitors were fixing the roof while the sun shone, paying down debt and reducing deficits&#151;some of them even set aside something for more difficult times to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para10"><a name="0803194000053">Back in 1995, the Prime Minister wrote:</p>
<a name="80318-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="0803194000671"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Nobody should doubt my iron resolve for stability and fiscal prudence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para11"><a name="0803194000054">Yet it is thanks to his policies that while Ireland and Australia have paid off all their net public debt, and a third of OECD countries are entering the downturn with a fiscal surplus, Britain has the highest fiscal deficit of any country in the world bar Egypt, Pakistan and Hungary, and the highest peacetime non-North sea tax burden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para12"><a name="0803194000055">There is therefore no room for manoeuvre. As a result, when the cost of regulation is rising and the corporation tax rate has gone from being the third most competitive in the EU to the 17th, the Chancellor is imposing an 80 per cent. tax increase on business gains. At a time when his own figures show that business investment is set to fall by two thirds, this Chancellor slaps a tax on it. When families are reeling from the effect of two years of falling real average earnings, rising mortgage costs and soaring prices, they are being hit with a total of &#163;2.8 billion of additional tax burden in this year&#146;s Budget, on top of the impact of the doubling of the 10p rate bequeathed to the Chancellor from the Prime Minister&#146;s last Budget. Taken with all the other income tax changes announced in the Budget, and even after the tax credit changes, that will leave 5.3 million low-income British households worse off and, as the right hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers) pointed out in the debate last week, will also drag another 145,000 people into marginal tax and benefit withdrawal rates in excess of 60 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para13"><a name="0803194000056">Stability, I have to tell the Chancellor, is not only about sound fiscal policy. Stability is also about fostering balanced economic growth. One big problem that we face as we enter this economic slow-down is that our economy is seriously unbalanced, and consequently extremely vulnerable, because of an over-reliance since the beginning of the new century on three key drivers that have delivered between them effectively all of the net economic growth over the past few years. We have had rising public spending financed on the back of mounting fiscal deficits; a soaring housing market that has in turn underpinned a surge in borrowing and fuelled an unsustainable consumer spending boom, on the back of the &#163;1.4 trillion of personal debt that has been piled up; and the dramatic growth of the financial services sector on the back of innovative new financial products.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para14"><a name="0803194000057">The Prime Minister could see&#151;and I suspect has been able to see for some time&#151;that the party would have to come to an end. That is why he was so desperate to move next door at the earliest possible date. He will not have foreseen the scale of the credit crunch, leading to the collapse of mighty financial institutions and bringing the boom in financial services to a shuddering halt. But he will have well understood that the debt-fuelled spending boom of British consumers on the back of spiralling house prices had to come to an end. And he knew, too, that his &#147;blank cheque&#148; approach to public spending could not endure,  <br>

as the current comprehensive spending review demonstrates, with a halving of the growth rate of public sector spending next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para15"><a name="0803194000058">So Britain enters this period of economic slow-down uniquely vulnerable, with all of the principal drivers of economic growth slowing and the public finances in disarray. Last October, the Chancellor revised upwards his projection of how much he would need to borrow in the coming year to &#163;36 billion, and last week he admitted that in the space of just five months, his estimate had risen by another &#163;7 billion. Even that is almost certainly an underestimate. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe reminded us, for seven years the Government have predicted that the public finances would move into surplus two years hence. Every year, that two years is put off by another year, so like the carrot on the stick dangling in front of the donkey, it is always tantalisingly in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para16"><a name="0803194000059">When the Chancellor says that Britain is well prepared for tougher economic conditions ahead because inflation is low, our constituents will wonder what planet he lives on. Does he ever go into a supermarket or fill up a car with petrol? Does someone else write the cheques for his gas and electricity bills? Because in the real world that the rest of us inhabit, inflation is not low and stable; the cost of living is soaring. Bread is up 15 per cent. in a year, eggs 30 per cent., petrol 20 per cent., mortgage interest 12 per cent., butter 36 per cent., and gas and electricity up by double digits in the single month of February&#151;and that is all before the Budget. Of course, the Government are not responsible for the world economic slow-down or the acceleration in global inflation. No one is claiming that they are, although they were quick enough to claim credit when benign world economic conditions delivered steady growth and low inflation powered by the expansion of far-eastern economies over the past decade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para17"><a name="0803194000060">The Chancellor&#146;s predecessor, the Prime Minister, is responsible for the woeful lack of preparedness of the British economy after a decade and a half of economic growth. He inherited a strong economy from my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe, and his stewardship of it coincided with 10 years of sustained low-inflation world growth. Instead of leaving the economy lean and mean, the Prime Minister bequeathed the Chancellor nothing in the cupboard. There is no legacy from the 15 years of economic growth and nothing put by for the rainy day that threatens. The Prime Minister, as Chancellor, did not fix public services, close the skills gap or the productivity gap, or fix the welfare system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para18"><a name="0803194000061">If the backdrop to the Budget looked gloomy last Wednesday, it has darkened significantly over the past 72 hours. There are those outside who thought that the Chancellor&#146;s downgrade of his economic growth forecast looked optimistic last week. Today they will be thinking that it looks like dangerous complacency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para19"><a name="0803194000062">I want to put a specific proposal to the Chief Secretary. In normal times, the Treasury, rightly in our view, sticks to the mantra that it makes forecasts of economic growth and fiscal projections only twice a year, in the pre-Budget report and the Budget. Given the scale and speed of the events that are developing around us, and the size of the change in the  <br>

Chancellor&#146;s estimate of the fiscal problem he faces, which he announced last Wednesday, will the Chief Secretary consult the Chancellor and see whether she can assure the House tonight that if the Treasury&#146;s internal modelling significantly downgrades his estimate of economic growth, or upgrades his expectation of public sector borrowing, between now and the PBR in November, he will make an interim statement to the House so that Parliament is not kept in the dark on those most crucial issues for the best part of nine months?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para20"><a name="0803194000063">Let me turn to the measures in the Budget that the Chancellor delivered. Most have already been well-debated. I detected a familiar pattern. As in previous years, after the Chancellor sat down the facts caught up with the rhetoric and the Budget unravelled. As many of my hon. Friends pointed out, the new tax on gas-guzzling cars, which was painted as an environmental measure, turns out to be a tax increase on seven out of 10 cars on the road&#151;just another burden on hard-pressed families. It is a stealth tax, not a green tax, and there is a bigger percentage increase in the tax on a Nissan Micra than in the tax on a six-litre Hummer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para21"><a name="0803194000064">The pre-Budget spin of a fiscal assault on binge drinking turned out not to be a precision weapon aimed at problem drinking but a carpet-bombing of ordinary moderate drinkers. The tax rises that we heard about, it seems, are permanent, yet the increase in the winter fuel payment is for one year only, echoing the one-year pre-election council tax bonus paid to pensioners in 2005. The education spending announcements came with no new money. The rhetorical commitment to extra money for our fighting troops in Iraq and Afghanistan turned out to be a mere accountant&#146;s note, transferring money that is already spent from the contingency reserve to the defence budget. The rest was a rehash of the Chancellor&#146;s predecessor&#146;s Budget announcement and the flotsam that survived the storm provoked by the PBR with a climbdown on non-dom tax, a U-turn on capital gains tax on business and a merciful postponement of the income shifting proposals. The only things that survived intact were the watered-down Conservative policies on inheritance tax and air passenger duty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para22"><a name="0803194000065">For 10 years, the Prime Minister has traded on a carefully cultivated reputation for having delivered economic stability that was actually the product of a benign world economy. But now that the world economy is slowing and inflationary pressure gathering, his chickens are coming home to roost. The public have spotted his squandering of the legacy that he inherited, and how he has wasted the window of opportunity presented by the decade of Chinese-fuelled, low-inflation world growth. Instead of preparing Britain for the future, as other countries have prepared themselves, instead of turning it into the lean, skilled, competitive and productive economy of his early rhetoric, the Prime Minister blew the lot, and some more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="80318-0018.htm_para23"><a name="0803194000066">Last Wednesday, we witnessed the miserable spectacle of the Prime Minister&#146;s successor as Chancellor being left to pick up the pieces as we enter this economic slow-down less prepared and fit, and more vulnerable, than almost any other country in the developed world. That is Labour&#146;s economic legacy for Britain. We are left steering into stormy economic waters, with a deficit that makes Italy look positively parsimonious and a  <br>

Certainly, it is true that in the early 1980s and the early &#146;90s Britain was first into recession and slow-down and last out, and had a far deeper recession than other countries across the world.</p>

<p><a name="st_o245"><a name="0803197000026"><a name="80318-0019.htm_spnew4"><a name="0803197000663"><b>Mr. Kenneth Clarke:</b>
 The right hon. Lady should follow the Chancellor and refer to the economy that the Government inherited, not the economy of the late &#146;80s and early &#146;90s. We had come out of the recession and were well poised for growth with low inflation when her party took over. I suggest to her that the opportunity should have been taken to put forward some credible, new fiscal rules for the future, to give realistic estimates for future borrowing and, because of the threat of the economy, to decide that this was not the time to raise corporation tax for small businesses. The whole Budget lacks imagination and any strategy at all for facing the present crisis, and makes misleading statements about the past.</p>

<p><a name="st_o246"><a name="0803197000027"><a name="80318-0019.htm_spnew5"><a name="0803197000664"><b>Yvette Cooper:</b>
 I noticed the right hon. and learned Gentleman trying very hard, in a slippery way, to sidestep and disown the events of the early &#146;80s and early &#146;90s, and trying to cling on to the events of the middle &#146;90s, when he stoked up inflationary pressures, when corporation tax was substantially higher than it is today, and when the tax burden on businesses was higher as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="80318-0019.htm_para4"><a name="0803197000028">In the early &#146;80s the world economy slowed, but Britain did not just slow&#151;it shrank. That was the case in the early &#146;90s, too. In the early &#146;80s, inflation hit nearly 22 per cent., unemployment topped 11 per cent., and borrowing hit nearly 5 per cent. In the early &#146;90s, inflation hit nearly 11 per cent., unemployment topped 10 per cent., and borrowing hit nearly 8 per cent. For the 10 years before 1997, we had the lowest gross domestic product per head in the G7. Eleven years on, we have seen continuous growth and the largest growth in income per head of any G7 country. We are no longer bottom of the league; instead, we had the second highest level of national income per head of any major economy last year.</p>

 The Prime Minister&#151;the former Chancellor of the Exchequer&#151;used to boast that he had put an end to boom and bust. Does the right hon. Lady agree that those words are hollow today, or does she actually believe that the Prime Minister put an end to boom and bust? Which is it?</p>

 The fact is that as a result of decisions that we have taken we have had much greater stability over the past decade than we had previously. For example, when the dotcom bubble burst, and after the 9/11 attacks, world stock markets halved, but while the economies in the rest of the G7 shrank, the British economy continued to grow by over 2 per cent. We face serious global challenges and serious pressures in the financial markets. They will inevitably have an impact on the UK, just as they will on countries across the world, but we start off in a stronger condition than many of our European competitors and many countries across the world, in part because of decisions that were made on issues such as Bank of England independence, which the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe always opposed, and on investing in Britain&#146;s future.</p>

 I will make progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="80318-0019.htm_para5"><a name="0803197000033">The Budget sets out clear plans to help pensioners and families with children. Even at a time of global challenges, we are able to help the oldest and the youngest. The Budget raises revenue from alcohol duty; that is what makes it possible to help pensioners with their fuel bills this winter, and to help families with child benefit and the child tax credit the year after that. So this is the right time to use that revenue to help pensioners. The average price of a bottle of wine has fallen from the equivalent of nearly &#163;4.50 in 1997 to nearer &#163;4 today. Even after the duty increase, it will still be significantly cheaper than in 1997. So yes, we are giving pensioners an extra payment of &#163;50 for all pensioners and &#163;100 for the over-80s. In 2009 we will use the money to help child tax credit and those on low and middle incomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="80318-0019.htm_para6"><a name="0803197000034">The question for the Opposition tonight is whether they will back that. Will they back the increase in alcohol duty to fund the payment to pensioners this winter? Will they back the increase in alcohol duty to fund the child benefit increase and the child tax credit the year after? Or will they once again turn their backs on pensioners and on families with children, as they did for so many years when they saw child poverty double and a big increase in the number of pensioners in poverty? Will they once again turn their backs on those who are youngest and those who are oldest across society? It is indicative that the one thing that the Opposition have proposed to cut to fund their plans is Sure Start&#151;one of the programmes that makes the greatest difference to those in greatest need. That is what the Conservatives want to cut.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="80318-0019.htm_para7"><a name="0803197000035">What, then, are the alternatives offered in tonight&#146;s debate? The hon. Member for Taunton set out what he thought was the Conservatives&#146; policy. He said that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) was proposing tax cuts in seven years. He pointed out that we had fought and won a war in less time. The hon. Member for Taunton is doing better than the rest of us if he manages to keep track of the Conservatives&#146; policies. They have said that they think borrowing is too high. They have also called for &#163;10 billion of unfunded tax cuts that would push borrowing even higher.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="80318-0019.htm_para8"><a name="0803197000036">This weekend the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said that the Opposition would not cut taxes for an entire parliamentary term, yet just three days before, on Budget day, they called for massive tax cuts to come in next month. It is still there on the Conservative party&#146;s website. The shadow Chancellor calls on the Chancellor to bring in a massive series of unfunded tax cuts, including inheritance tax for millionaires in this year&#146;s Budget.</p>

 I am glad to have the opportunity of an Adjournment debate, even at this late hour, on a subject of huge concern in my constituency&#151;a matter that has angered the population of Chippenham and the surrounding area more than almost any other issue that I can remember in my 11 years representing them in this place. That culminated in an angry public meeting in Chippenham town hall a week ago on Saturday, attended by 300 people, some of whom were very upset. They were upset about the fact that Chippenham hospital&#151;which serves a town of 40,000 people that is soon to grow to 50,000 people&#151;was to be cut from 43 medical beds to 10 medical beds. That would not resemble a hospital as we normally think of it, and it is questionable whether it would have been sustainable in the long term from an economic or a medical standpoint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o537"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para3"><a name="08031928000043">The anger of the local people is well understood, particularly as the proposal comes after various other cuts in the hospital, including the closure of the overnight minor injuries unit, the withdrawal of day care for geriatrics, and the fact that the hospital stopped using the cardiac machine that cost &#163;23,000, which was recently raised by popular subscription. All that was done over last autumn. The final blow was the proposed reduction in beds from 43 to 10.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o538"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para4"><a name="08031928000044">At oral questions this afternoon, the Minister was able to announce to the House something that has since been confirmed in a press release: the number of beds at Chippenham hospital would be reduced to 20 rather than to 10. Without being immodest, I should like to think that the timing of that decision may not have been uncoincidental with the occurrence of this Adjournment debate and oral questions today, but perhaps it was for other reasons. There has been a change of heart by the primary care trust, which was adamant on the subject at a stormy meeting only two weeks ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o539"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para5"><a name="08031928000045">The chairman and chief executive of the PCT are decent enough people, but were carrying out the will of the Government and were adamant that the hospital would go down to 10 beds. I am glad that in the subsequent two weeks they have seen reason and realised that 10 beds is not sustainable and that 20 is a more reasonable number. A deal has been done with the Royal United hospital in Bath, which will have 10 beds at Chippenham. That is an eminently healthy development. It is still not enough; 20 beds is half the present number, and it is difficult to assess whether that is sustainable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o540"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para6"><a name="08031928000046">The news removes some of the passion from the debate. I welcome it and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say later about that deal. I hope that it may be possible to extend that 10-bed deal to a better arrangement for Chippenham hospital. The development comes about as a result of the &#147;Pathways for Change&#148; consultation. As a result of the proposals in that document, a petition with 25,000 signatures was delivered to Parliament. There were huge public  <br>

meetings and outcry everywhere, but that outcry was nothing by comparison with what has happened to the hospital since.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o541"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para7"><a name="08031928000047">All that comes as a great disappointment, as the Government went out of their way to seek to reassure us about the future of community hospitals. They said in their rather fetchingly entitled consultation paper &#147;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&#148; that</p>
<a name="80318-0027.htm_brev6"><a name="08031928000111"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we are clear that community facilities should not be lost in response to short-term budgetary pressures&#148;,</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o543"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para9"><a name="08031928000049">In a debate on 30 January 2006, the then Secretary of State reassured me that Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire should think again about its strategy to close or cut community hospitals. We took some encouragement from that. We like to take encouragement from what the Government tell us. Imagine our surprise when, despite that, Malmesbury was effectively closed, and Westbury, Trowbridge, Melksham and Devizes hospitals were closed and huge cuts were made elsewhere in hospital provision across the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o544"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para10"><a name="08031928000050">Despite the Government&#146;s assurances on community facilities, why is all this happening? I had a written parliamentary question last week that may help to explain. The Minister admitted last week that one of the worst funded primary care trusts in England is that in Wiltshire. We in Wiltshire get &#163;1,155 per head per annum for health care&#151;compared with &#163;1,182 in neighbouring Hampshire, &#163;1,425 in Northumberland and &#163;1,416 in London. Why should Wiltshire get &#163;300 per head less than Northumberland? What on earth would justify that&#151;other than the fact that Northumberland, of course, is entirely represented by Labour Members of Parliament, while Wiltshire, I am glad to say, is entirely represented by Conservative ones?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o545"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para11"><a name="08031928000051">To put the whole thing into context, I should say that before all this started Wiltshire community hospitals had a total of 173 beds, spread across the hospitals that I mentioned. The &#147;Pathways for Change&#148; document proposed that the number should be cut to 74&#151;24 beds in Marlborough, 20 in Melksham and 30 in Chippenham. However, Melksham closed and Warminster got its 20 beds. Then, with no consultation at all, it was proposed that the number for Chippenham would be cut from 43 down to 10&#151;or now, 20.</p>

<p><a name="st_o262"><a name="08031928000052"><a name="80318-0027.htm_spnew2"><a name="08031928000122"><b>Dr. Andrew Murrison (Westbury) (Con):</b>
 One of the things that my hon. Friend&#146;s constituents and mine are concerned about is maternity services. Has he seen the recent Healthcare Commission report, which commended both Chippenham and Trowbridge maternity units? Does he share my exasperation that the primary care trust that we unfortunately have in Wiltshire seems selective in the evidence that it uses to back up its position? It appears to ignore things such as the Healthcare Commission&#146;s assertion that smaller is better when it comes to maternity services.</p>

<p><a name="st_o263"><a name="08031928000053"><a name="80318-0027.htm_spnew3"><a name="08031928000123"><b>Mr. Gray:</b>
 My hon. Friend is right, and I am grateful to him for staying so late in the evening to support me in this Adjournment debate. The fact is that maternity services, for example, are delivered better in small units  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="18 Mar 2008">

<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>18 Mar 2008 : Column 899</b><br>
than in big ones. Although I welcome the fact that our maternity unit in Chippenham is being maintained, I very much regret that many of the others around Wiltshire have gone, such as the one in Malmesbury, for example&#151;also in my constituency and for which we campaigned hard. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The mere facts that we are keeping our maternity unit in Chippenham, which the Minister will no doubt raise in a moment, and that we have a 20-bed specialist stroke unit in Chippenham, do not excuse the fact that all those other facilities around the county have been abolished.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o546"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para12"><a name="08031928000054">The fact is that we will end up with 30 per cent. of the community beds that we had before all this started, and that seems altogether retrograde. We are a large rural area. There are first-class hospitals in Bath and Swindon, although criticisms can be made of them. However, those hospitals are remote from my and my hon. Friend&#146;s constituents in rural Wiltshire. We need community hospitals, particularly to deal effectively with those needing intermediate and geriatric care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o547"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para13"><a name="08031928000055">In replying, the Minister may well say that I am looking at things in an old-fashioned way and that we do not just need community hospitals because now there are community teams. Of course, we all welcome the notion that if people can be cared for at home, they should be. That is a good thing; no one wants to lock people up in hospitals if that can be avoided. However, if the community teams are to work properly, the hospital beds should be kept open until the teams are working. Incidentally, community teams are not working 24/7, as was promised; there is, as yet, no night-time care in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o548"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para14"><a name="08031928000056">If the Minister came to the House and said, &#147;The Chippenham hospital beds are empty week after week, and we are paying a lot of money to keep them&#148;, we would all say, &#147;Fine&#151;close them down. We have no problem at all, as the community teams are great.&#148; However, the fact is that the community beds are fuller than ever. Currently, they are 96 per cent. occupied over the winter. Most people stay in them for 30 days, and some for 40 days. The Great Western hospital intermediate care unit has closed, which means that the patients have to go to Chippenham instead. Six wards in the Royal United hospital in Bath are currently closed because of the norovirus and there are terrible MRSA problems there too; there are constant red alerts all winter. All the people have to come to Chippenham, especially those requiring geriatric or intermediate care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o549"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para15"><a name="08031928000057">In January, RUH in Bath ended up sending patients to local private hospitals to try to meet the Government&#146;s 18-week target. Last week in Chippenham, local managers inquired as to whether it would be possible to take the Cameron ward in the hospital out of mothballs. It has been mothballed ever since the Government closed it down, but the managers asked whether it could be brought out again because the beds were needed so badly. When they found that they could not do that for economic reasons, they inquired whether the day rooms at the end of the open wards could possibly have beds in them, because they were short of beds. Against that background, they are apparently cutting the number of beds from an inadequate 43 to 20.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o550"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para16"><a name="08031928000058">As yet, the neighbourhood teams are not working. The chief executive of Carers Support North Wiltshire wrote to me this week. She stated:</p>
<a name="80318-0027.htm_brev8"><a name="08031928000113"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The neighbourhood teams are very far from the promised 24/7 service. We have heard of several cases where a patient has been told not to expect a visit for toileting assistance but either &#145;to wear incontinence pads and wait for someone to arrive, or to have a catheter inserted&#146;... As a very experienced nurse, I am becoming appalled and almost ashamed to be part of that profession.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o551"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para17"><a name="08031928000059">What about the dignity of life? We are closing hospital beds in Chippenham, where people can be properly looked after, and sending them home and suggesting that they should either wear incontinence pads or have a catheter inserted until the nurse turns up. That will not do. People demand the proper human care that they have had over the years. The cuts, even to 20 beds in Chippenham hospital, are unrealistic and inhumane. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o552"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para18"><a name="08031928000060">We look to the Minister for three things. First, will he please explain why the people of Wiltshire have &#163;300 less a year spent on them than, for example, the people of Northumberland? The county is among the worst funded in England. What will we do about that? It is a question for the long term and the Minister should answer it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o553"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para19"><a name="08031928000061">Secondly, surely the Minister accepts that there is a place for community hospitals such as Chippenham. Will not he continue the negotiations that the PCT has had with, for example, the RUH in Bath, and maintain the movement that got the number of beds increased from 10 to 20? Let us try to get the figure back to 30 if we can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o554"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para20"><a name="08031928000062">Thirdly, I hope that the Minister can give a hint about the next question, even if he cannot answer it. The PCT applied for some &#163;17 million to redevelop the old hospital, which had been the Victorian workhouse, but the Government did not like some aspects of the application and asked the PCT to renew it. It has now done that. It would therefore be interesting to receive a hint from the Minister about whether that application for &#163;17 million to redevelop the hospital might meet the Government&#146;s approval. That would give new life and hope to the community around Chippenham hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o555"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para21"><a name="08031928000063">The people of Chippenham&#151;and throughout North Wiltshire, because the hospital serves the whole of my constituency, not only the town of Chippenham&#151;deserve a fully functional hospital.

Gentleman will know, Wiltshire county council&#146;s overview and scrutiny committee did not refer the proposals to the Secretary of State, but supported the &#147;Reforming Community Services&#148; programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o559"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para25"><a name="08031928000068">It is not up to me to second-guess what was on the minds of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s colleagues on Wiltshire county council, but I cannot believe that they would have approved the programme if they thought that it would not be for the benefit of their constituents, or would be about cost cutting. The main driver for any local health service reorganisation has to be clinically led, and the central focus must be the best outcome for patients. That is not about saving money, but about investing in services fit for the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o560"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para26"><a name="08031928000069">Let me deal with funding in Wiltshire more generally. Wiltshire PCT&#146;s funding allocation has increased from &#163;341.1 million in 2003-04 to &#163;539.6 million this  year. Next year funding will increase further, to &#163;569.1 million&#151;a 66 per cent. increase since 2003-04. Whereas a few years ago some primary care trusts were a long way from their fair funding target&#151;Wiltshire may have been one of those&#151;no primary care trust in the country, apart from Northamptonshire, is now more than 3.5 per cent. away from its target. Just to correct the hon. Gentleman about Northumberland, it is not represented in the House only by Labour MPs; rather, I understand that there are two Labour MPs, one Conservative MP and one Liberal Democrat MP. Those funding figures mean that funding per head in Wiltshire has increased in just five years from less than &#163;800 to more than &#163;1,200. That is, in any sense of the term, a massive increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o561"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para27"><a name="08031928000070">I do not think that Wiltshire councillors would have approved proposals that they thought would lead to worse clinical outcomes for patients, either. Having looked into health provision in the county and future need, the PCT concluded that there was an oversupply of general medical beds at Chippenham hospital, which currently has 73 beds. Wiltshire PCT was proposing to reduce the number of medical beds to 10,  <br>

as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, but has now reconsidered that. The PCT has been in discussions for some time with the Royal hospital in Bath, apparently about the possibility of devolving some of the acute beds from Bath to Chippenham, and, to allow for the possible relocation of services from the Royal Bath to Chippenham, has adjusted that figure up to 20. There are no plans to reduce the size of the stroke unit at the hospital, and the maternity unit, which has also be referred to, will in fact be expanded. Taken in all, those changes will mean that Chippenham hospital will still have a total of 54 beds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o562"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para28"><a name="08031928000071">According to the PCT, one of the reasons for the reduction in the number of general medical beds is that it has been determined to reduce what is called delayed discharge, where patients are ready to go home, but the support to enable them to do so is not in place. Wiltshire PCT has already cut delayed discharge by half. I hope that we would all congratulate it, and Wiltshire county council, on achieving that. As I am sure the hon. Gentleman would accept, delayed discharge is bad for patients and bad for the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o563"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para29"><a name="08031928000072">The second reason for the reduction in general medical beds is that the PCT has been investing in neighbourhood nursing teams, which have been gradually introduced since November last year. Existing teams provide cover to those in Chippenham, Calne, Corsham and Box, and last month another team was set up covering Malmesbury and the surrounding area. The teams comprise 52 nurses and 22 physiotherapists or occupational therapists in total, and serve a population of 18,000 people aged over 65. In January the teams saw 350 new patients. It is worth noting that fewer than 300 new patients were admitted to the general in-patient beds in Chippenham hospital during the same period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o564"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para30"><a name="08031928000073">On a recent visit to Wiltshire, I had the opportunity to visit the nursing team in Calne, in the constituency of the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram). I accompanied one of district nurses on a visit and saw at first hand how valued the service that the team provides to the local community is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o565"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para31"><a name="08031928000074">As the hon. Member for North Wiltshire acknowledged in his speech, people want to be treated at home where possible, or as close to home as possible. However, the development of community support should not mean that the days of the community hospital are numbered. The general devolving of services&#151;the devolving of services out of acute hospitals, as I hope they will be devolved out of Bath to Chippenham, and out of Chippenham to people&#146;s homes&#151;is the direction of travel that is supported in, I think, all parts of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o566"><a name="80318-0027.htm_para32"><a name="08031928000075">The Government still have a massive commitment to the redevelopment and modernisation of our community hospitals, involving a &#163;750 million programme over this spending review period. Our region in the south-west is already a major beneficiary of the community hospitals programme. It has received &#163;58 million, which is more than a quarter of the total of &#163;190 million allocated so far. That money is supporting major refurbishments in Yate, Minehead, South Bristol, Keynsham Park and Dursley, and at the Moreton and Bourton hospitals in the north Cotswolds.</p>

capital improvements at Chippenham, and there are other funding streams that it can use to bid for funding. For 2008-09, we are changing the way in which capital allocations are made to PCTs. The Department will no longer make formula-based, top-down allocations of capital to fund PCTs&#146; local investment priorities. Instead, PCT capital allocations will be determined by robust and realistic bottom-up expenditure plans submitted by individual PCTs and agreed with their SHAs. That process has already begun, and will be refined over the coming weeks to give maximum flexibility according to local NHS needs over a three-year cycle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o568"><a name="80318-0028.htm_para1"><a name="08031928000077">The fact that Wiltshire PCT is looking at making major capital investments on the Chippenham site should reassure the hon.

It will continue to provide stroke services for Wiltshire and, in future, it will be the main base for community maternity services  <br>

for north and west Wilshire. There will continue to be the minor injury unit, out-patient consultant clinics, assessment clinics, and X-ray and other diagnostic services, in addition to the therapy services and mental health services that are provided at the site. The hospital is the base for many of the community teams working in the area, including the neighbourhood team for Chippenham, health visiting, school nursing and social services. The GP out-of-hours service uses the hospital on weekday evenings and at weekends to provide local access to urgent primary care advice and treatment. I hope that I have been able to go some way towards reassuring the hon. Gentleman that his hospital has a very good future indeed.</p>
