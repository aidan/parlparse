 The iris recognition immigration system&#151;IRIS&#151;provides fast, secure clearance through UK immigration controls for pre-assessed passengers, reducing the possibility of identity fraud. The project will be evaluated once the roll-out of all 10 IRIS barriers is complete in December 2006. The results will be published following the evaluation.

 The answer that the Home Office gave me in September 2005 was that evaluation would be complete in October 2005.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his question. I know of his interest in the matter and he is right: delivery of the project has been subject to some delay, albeit for some very good reasons. The pilot phase was extended after the terrorist attacks on 7 July 2005. Enrolment stations were closed and staff were deployed elsewhere to give the project supplier, Sagem, more time to demonstrate system stability. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the response to his question to the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality, my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty), was that evaluation of the pilot roll-out was scheduled for completion by the end of summer 2006 and key findings would be reported within that time scale. I am pleased to tell him that the pilot roll-out is complete and

 Although there are only a small number of individual support orders to look at in detail, a positive picture is already emerging about how young people&#039;s behaviour is changing, which is why we are keen to see ISOs used more widely as an effective tool in the future.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="60515-01_spnew5"><b> Ann Coffey: </b> 
 As my hon. Friend is aware, most antisocial behaviour orders are applied for and issued on criminal conviction, when often a pattern of criminal behaviour has been established. Does he agree that the earlier agencies intervene the more chance there is of preventing young people from developing criminal behaviour? It is disappointing, therefore, that so few applications have been made for stand-alone civil antisocial behaviour orders with individual support orders attached?

 My hon. Friend has a long and proud record in helping to tackle antisocial behaviour in her constituency, which is, I am sure, why she has so much to say about the matter. As she knows, ISOs allow positive conditions to be attached to ASBOs for up to six months. We are keen to see them expanded, which is why we gave youth offending teams &#163;500,000 to support their take-up, and I am glad to be able to tell my hon.

 A number of my right hon. and hon. Friends have told the House that we are very committed to considering how antisocial behaviour and local injunctions and other measures can be used and streamlined to ensure that they are more effective. They are, of course, part of a package of measures, such as warning letters, acceptable behaviour contracts, parenting contracts, parenting orders, injunctions and fixed penalty notices for disorder. A wide array of instruments are available to local authorities and to the police now, thanks to the antisocial behaviour legislation that the Government have driven through.

Will he apply his mind to ways of ensuring that that money is well spent on those difficult and disruptive families?

<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="60515-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 I am glad to tell my right hon. Friend that the Home Affairs Committee&#039;s report was on my reading list over the weekend, and I greatly enjoyed it. He will know that the reforms that we have proposed for the months to come include reform of youth provision, &#163;52 million for extended parenting support and &#163;28 million for intensive family support projects throughout the country. Yes, we intend to toughen the sanctions for those who commit antisocial behaviour and cause hell for their neighbours and communities, but effective support for those families must be part of the deal.

 (Con): Given the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) about the cost of ASBOs, is the Minister convinced that, in all cases, the police thoroughly follow up ASBOs, because there seems little point in issuing them if they are not properly enforced?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="60515-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right to make that point. It is important that breaches of ASBOs are followed up and that offenders are given a clear message that, where there are breaches, there will be sanctions. Between 2000 and 2003, nearly 800 breaches of ASBOs were reported to us, 437 of which resulted in a custodial sentence being imposed, so it is absolutely right to say that a clear message must be sent when ASBOs are breached.

 Before answering the question, I should like to take the opportunity to offer my own heartfelt condolences to the family of Nisha Patel-Nasri, whose tragic death in the early hours of Friday morning touched us all. The role of the special constable is often a forgotten one, but I believe that I speak for the whole House in thanking that group of public servants, whose endeavours provide a invaluable link between a local community and its police service.
</p>

<a name="60515-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">My first priority is to protect the public by addressing urgently the need to identify, control, consider for deportation and, where appropriate, deport those foreign nationals released from prison where no such process was applied. Additional resources are being allocated to that task. In slightly slower time, I will formulate proposals based on recent experience and my analysis of underlying problems. That process of investigation was started by my predecessor, and as it proceeds it is uncovering systemic problems that need to be addressed, and I will address them.

<a name="stpa_o1">The Home Secretary will be aware of the role played by the probation service in supervising some overseas prisoners already released into the community, but he will be aware that, with things such as custody plus and the new special orders that will come into place, the probation service&#039;s resources are under very great pressure indeed. If it is to be effective, will he, in his new role, review the resources available to that service, to ensure that it can continue to do its very professional job?

<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60515-02_spnew1"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his comments about the hard work being done by the probation service. From his previous experience as a Minister covering probation between 1992 and 1993, I know that he will understand the work that is done and the great challenges that are faced. On his substantial point, there has already been an increase in probation service resources and in personnel&#151;I think from some 14,000 people to 20,000. We have certainly had 5,000 extra since 2001. In addition, we are revising and reforming the probation service under the National Offender Management Service. However, neither of those two things leads me to believe that we have anything like perfection. As I study the urgent requirements&#151;following up in the case of the deportees,

<br>&nbsp;<br>which has engaged the House&#151;I believe that we are uncovering some very serious and systemic underlying problems in the relationship between prisons, probation, deportations and so on. I hope, in the not too distant future, to come to the House not with solutions, but with a statement about what I think the problems are and how I think we should proceed in solving them. Resources may be one of those aspects.

 (Lab): In his second recent statement to the House on overseas prisoner removals, my right hon. Friend&#039;s predecessor referred to prisoners being deported straight from prison. May I remind my right hon. Friend of the fire that was deliberately started at the Yarl&#039;s Wood removal centre in 2002? One of the features of that incident was the presence of prisoners en route to deportation who had been convicted of violent crimes, mixed with ordinary failed asylum seekers and looked after by staff untrained in dealing with formerly violent prisoners. Will he review the current practice and try to ensure that potentially violent prisoners are removed straight from prison and not via the detention estate?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60515-02_spnew3"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I shall look at that, among many other aspects. As I said, I hope to come to the House with a statement in the not too distant future. There are three things that I ought to attend to. The first is the urgent nature of the discovery and consideration for deportation of those 1,023&#151;now accurately defined as 1,019&#151;people who were released without due consideration. The second is continuing the process started by my predecessor of examining the underlying problems&#151;one of which may be what my hon. Friend mentioned. Thirdly, there is setting the shape for the future. In that, I have no doubt personally that it is the feeling of the people of this country&#151;and ought to be the position of the Government&#151;that any foreign nationals who are convicted and serve a significant custodial sentence in this country should face deportation when that is finished.

Has he noted how fitting it is that one of his first tasks as Home Secretary is to deal with the problem of the Afghan highjackers? May I suggest that he would get off to a flying start if he sent them home and brought the British troops back, as I advised him in his previous appointment?

</p>





<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="60515-02_spnew7"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. One of the many problems that we face is that at no stage of the whole process&#151;through investigation, arrest, inquiry, interview, trial, sentencing, consideration, custodial sentence and release&#151;as far as I have been able to determine in the limited time that has been available to me, is there any legal requirement on anyone to be responsible for discovering a nationality, or indeed, on anyone else, to volunteer their nationality. That is a not inconsiderable problem when it comes to dealing with foreign nationals. As my hon. Friend says, this is one of the areas in which identity cards would be a huge boon.

 (Con): Will the Home Secretary accept that one of the underlying problems to which he refers in the context of the probation service&#039;s costs and resources is the cost of being involved in questions of deportation, extradition, control orders and the like, all of which fall within the framework of the Human Rights Act 1998 in one form or another? Will he thus look to reducing that cost by repealing or amending the Act so that we can guarantee that the public&#039;s safety in this country comes before so-called human rights?
</p>

 Just as the hon. Member for Louth and Horncastle (Sir Peter Tapsell) has a route map on which all roads appear to lead to Afghanistan, in the case of the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), all roads appear to lead to Europe. Let me address the question of the Human Rights Act. People in this country want a system of law and order and justice that is intrinsically fair as enshrined in law, and by &quot;fair&quot; I mean getting a balance between the rights of one individual and the rights and safety of millions of other individuals. Secondly, they want the interpretation of the law to be fair and, thirdly, they want the administration of the law to be competent and fair. Those three areas are at the forefront of my mind as I approach my new position, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that I will attempt to achieve those aims. If legislation is needed, we will consider it, but if the matter is merely one of interpretation and competence, we will deal with it in such a way. We will end up with laws that are interpreted and applied in a system that the people of this country believe to be fair to the vast majority of decent, law-abiding citizens, as well as other individuals.

 (Lab): Is any responsibility being taken by the most senior civil servants who were then in the Home Office and the Prison Service for the failure to deport those overseas prisoners who certainly should have been deported? Although the political head obviously takes responsibility, as the Home Secretary&#039;s predecessor did, should not the people to whom I refer recognise their responsibility for the failure that undoubtedly occurred?

As elected politicians, it is in the nature of our position that we are quite rightly often expected to bear the burden of responsibility for our Departments and not to lay the blame on civil servants, and he was careful not to do that. In fairness to some of the leading members of the Department&#151;I include in that group the permanent secretary and several other directors&#151;they have relatively recently arrived in post.

I hope to come, in the not too distant future, to the House with a statement outlining honestly what I see as some of the underlying problems, and thereafter to make proposals on how they may be rectified. I cannot at this stage tell him in what time scale the proposals will be put forward, because I want to ensure that we all, as openly as possible, address underlying problems, which I believe in some cases have been in existence for decades, not just weeks, months or years.

 I thank the Home Secretary for that answer. When I put the question to him, I was careful to use the Prime Minister&#039;s exact words. I note that the Home Secretary did not use the same words, and I understand why&#151;because we have to deal with realities at the Dispatch Box, not overblown rhetoric. In terms of reality, may we have some facts on the 1,023 foreign prisoners released without consideration, who were referred to earlier?

 A national evaluation of police community support officers was published on 26 January this year. The report found that PCSOs have been well received by the public and that they are valued for their visibility and accessibility. They are helping to restore respect in local communities by providing reassurance and tackling antisocial behaviour and low-level crime.

 Thames Valley police estimate that over the next 18 months they will need to recruit between 26 and 32 community support officers in my constituency to provide proper coverage. So far, they have recruited just six. There appear to be two problems: vetting, which seems to be very cumbersome, and funding. The Government fund only 75 per cent. of the posts, so Thames Valley police have to find the 25 per cent. from other Government programmes, which does not seem particularly joined up. Indeed, at the moment, Horton hospital is funding two of the community support officers. I must tell the Minister that between the spin and the reality lies frustration.

<a name="stpa_o4">In Liverpool, 69 community support officers are ably supporting the police and are well deployed and appreciated. However, Liverpool city council also employs 39 street crime wardens and, to the dismay of the chief constable, they wear an almost identical uniform to that of police officers. Will my hon.

<a name="stpa_o5">The matter of uniforms issued to PCSOs is an operational one for chief officers. However, I believe that the common standard uniform set out by the Association of Chief Police Officers distinguishes PCSOs from police officers, while clearly identifying them as members of the police family.

<a name="stpa_o6">The Minister will recall that a major issue of dispute between the Government and the Opposition was giving community support officers the power to detain people for up to 30 minutes, and it was decided to trial it in a few forces. In how many forces do CSOs now have the power of detention, and on how many occasions, as we suspected, was 30 minutes not adequate to enable a real police officer to turn up to turn detention into arrest?

 I say to the hon.

I do not have the figures on the number of areas where the power to detain has been given to PCSOs, but he will no doubt be pleased, as I am, that the Police and Justice Bill, which is before Parliament, contains a measure to standardise the powers for police community support officers across the country, one of which will be the power to detain for 30 minutes.

</p>


<p><a name="st_o44"><a name="60515-03_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality  (Mr. Tony McNulty): </b> 
 We have published our five-year comprehensive strategy for immigration and asylum. The issue of backlogs cannot be viewed in isolation from that overall strategy. We have developed plans to deal with immigration applications including the points-based system and the new asylum model, so that we do not simply get into the position of recreating a problem of backlogs in future. We think that we have got on top of the challenge of intake, and that has given us an opportunity to turn our attention to backlogs, which increasingly will be our focus. That has been possible only because of our redesigning of the managed migration processes and our reducing asylum intake.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o45"><a name="60515-03_spnew8"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 May I congratulate my hon. Friend on retaining his position in the Home Office despite the fact that so much has changed around him? In the 19 years I have been a Member of Parliament, hon. Members on both sides of the House, including me, have criticised the chronic malfunctioning of the immigration and nationality directorate. Indeed, before my right hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke) resigned as Home Secretary, he referred to its systemic failures. Will the Minister confirm that there is no question of any bonuses being paid to IND senior officials until the entire backlog of cases has been cleared, and all outstanding matters have been resolved?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o46"><a name="60515-03_spnew9"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 May I start by thanking my hon. Friend for the welcome which, I think, he extended to me? I thank him, too, for commenting on the recent improvements in performance, but I afraid that it is not for me to discuss in detail at the Dispatch Box human resources, or pay and conditions for any civil servant, for reasons that he will understand. Staying on top of the backlogs at the IND and dealing with them is a matter to which we are devoting serious concentration and effort.

 That is always a consideration that we must bear in mind, not simply in the light of the existing difficulties with foreign national prisoners but as a general point and a matter of law. The hon. Lady makes an entirely fair point.

 (Lab): Is there anything special about the IND, because it seems to lose a large number of files? In approximately one in 20 cases with which I deal, I receive an answer saying that the file has been mislaid or lost. Something has gone wrong, as that increases the backlog and people&#039;s frustration. My constituents may be prepared to wait if they know that their case is being considered, but it is dreadful for their file to be lost or mislaid, so something must be done.
</p>

<p><a name="st_o51"><a name="60515-03_spnew14"><b> Damian Green  (Ashford)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister will be aware that one big reason for those delays and backlogs is the fact that immigration officers are trying to meet Government targets instead of doing their proper job. Last night, &quot;Panorama&quot; revealed that the Prime Minister&#039;s target of removing more failed asylum seekers than there are new applications took precedence over everything. One immigration officer said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_o0">&quot;We&#039;re going to focus purely on failed asylum seekers. Everything else must go out of the window.&quot;</p>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-03_para3">
<a name="stpa_o7">Will the Minister admit that chasing a narrow target means that backlogs build up and dangerous criminals are let out on the streets, and that meeting the Prime Minister&#039;s target has become more important than running an efficient, firm and fair immigration system?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o52"><a name="60515-03_spnew15"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I do not believe that that is the case. I freely accept that there has been a concentration on the tipping point target, not least as a result of pressure from the Opposition, the public and others, but it is absolutely not the case that that is to the exclusion of everything else that IND does. I do not dispute the fact that its work is sensitive, or that it is undertaken by dedicated members of staff. It is not advisable to traduce them, and I caution him against what might be termed fatuous casual empiricism.
</p>

Given that he was born in Dundee, he has lived there since his birth, and both his parents are British citizens, can we not find a better solution? What reassurances can my hon. Friend offer the understandably distressed Sattar family?
</p>

I have not had time, to be honest, to consider these matters in the considerable detail that would be wished in the hon.

 Those figures are extremely encouraging, because they suggest that some of the gross overcrowding of the past has been stabilised and reduced. However, can the Minister tell me whether the work on the expansion of the prison has recommenced after its interruption? When does he expect that work to be completed? That will give the prison an extra 120 spaces, which will help to prevent overcrowding and help it to re-establish itself in future.

 The hon. Gentleman will know that building costs increased above the original estimates and that, as he intimates, the project was temporarily suspended. It was determined to be value for money and is back online. The conversion of the old health care centre into offices is complete, and work on the new house block and visitor centre is well under way. That will provide the 120 extra spaces to which the hon.

 (Con): What steps he is taking to tackle Islamist terrorism; and if he will make a statement. [70216]
</p>


<p><a name="st_o85"><a name="60515-05_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for the Home Department  (John Reid): </b> 
 While effective security measures, intelligence and policing are necessary, ultimately international terrorism will be best countered by democratic values, discussion, persuasion and social solidarity. The key is to engage in genuine and sensitive dialogue with the Muslim communities and not to shy away from difficult issues. That process has already begun. I am aware that the hon. Gentleman has a longstanding interest in the matter, and I would be happy to discuss the issues with him personally should he so wish.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o86"><a name="60515-05_spnew6"><b> Michael Gove: </b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for his robust and balanced response and for his invitation, which I look forward to taking up. Last Thursday, my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace) asked him whether the suicide bomber, Mohammad Siddique Khan, had been under sustained surveillance before 7 July. The Secretary of State replied that at the time, his understanding was that there was not a sustained programme of surveillance. This weekend, <i>The Sunday Times</i> reported that MI5 had extensive transcripts of Mohammad Siddique Khan planning jihadist activities. It appears that the Secretary of State may have been misled by the security services. Can we have a guarantee that, in the absence of a full independent inquiry, every transcript and detail of the surveillance of all the suspects is passed to the Intelligence and Security Committee of this House?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o87"><a name="60515-05_spnew7"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 May I, through the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question, correct some of the misleading statements and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 690</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>misrepresentations in the weekend press? First, when I engaged with the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace) after the discussion in the Chamber, it was reported that I said that the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre was right and that I was wrong. In fact, I said the opposite, and there were at least five witnesses to the conversation. I said that I had been right in the Chamber when I said that there was no sustained surveillance of the two gentlemen in question, Khan and Tanweer, that they had been peripheral to another investigation, that the decision had been made because they were peripheral, and that it would be a wrong judgment to use resources and assets to pursue them rather than the main characters in the main conspiracy that was being pursued. That is the first point, and I stand by that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-05_para1">
<a name="stpa_o13">My second point is that the Security Service gave the Intelligence and Security Committee full co-operation in its investigation of 7 July. Indeed, since the weekend, the Security Service has reviewed the evidence that it gave to the ISC in the light of recent press allegations. It remains confident that nothing that the service knew has been withheld from the Committee. I do not intend to go into specific details, for obvious reasons, but I am glad that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) has given me the opportunity to set the record right and to correct the misleading impressions that formed the basis not only of the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments but of the front page story, which was in several areas very misleading.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o88"><a name="60515-05_spnew8"><b> Mr. Shahid Malik  (Dewsbury)</b> 
 (Lab): I commend the Government on their overall approach to dealing with terrorism. They are taking a twin-pronged approach, and the first prong involves robust anti-terror legislation, of which I have been a strong and vocal supporter. Mohammad Siddique Khan was one of my constituents. The other prong involves dealing with causal factors. Over the weekend, research reports were published by the universities of Oxford, Warwick, Birmingham and Derby showing that there was disproportionate unemployment, underachievement and overcrowding in Muslim communities. Can the Home Secretary reassure me that the Government are not going to take their eye off the second prong of their approach to dealing with terrorism?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o89"><a name="60515-05_spnew9"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 I can absolutely guarantee that to my hon. Friend, and I commend him on the work that he has done in this area. I want to restate the view that I put forward at the beginning of this question, which is one that I have carried over from my other positions in the Government: we will not defeat terrorism by security forces, intelligence services and the armoury of weaponry that comprise the conventional forms of defence alone. They are a necessary but insufficient condition. Unless we address the underlying socio-economic problems, both domestically and internationally, we will not be successful. I therefore commit the Government to continuing in that direction. We have made a good start, but I believe that we have a long, long way to go. I look forward to working with my hon. Friend on this matter.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. One of the two British soldiers killed in a roadside bomb attack near Basra on Saturday was 19-year-old Adam Morris, a private in the 2nd Battalion the Royal Anglian Regiment and a resident of Coalville in North-West Leicestershire. The thoughts of the House and of everyone in the local community will be with his family at this dreadful time. Mr. Speaker, have you had any intimation that the Secretary of State for Defence will make a statement on this matter, either today or tomorrow, to allow us to ask questions about it? The alternative means of obtaining that information&#151;written questions and debates&#151;represent a more protracted and less satisfactory process.

As my hon. Friend the Member for East Renfrewshire made clear at earlier stages, the Government did not approach those issues with a closed mind. We said that we would listen, but we were also anxious to have a better regulation system, which could root out and change unnecessary or outdated burdens on business, the public sector, charities and the voluntary sector.

We are a hard-working, enterprising and creative country. Our openness and flexibility are great strengths. The way forward is not to hide from the changes that are taking place in the world, or to wish them away; it is to ensure that we are best placed to succeed in this world by making certain that Britain remains a great country in which creativity, enterprise and hard work are allowed to flourish and to be rewarded.

As I said earlier, however, we also know that under Governments of both parties regulations have tended to grow.

 If, as I gather, the Minister is moving on from new clause 19, which is the hub of the whole thing, I am very grateful to him for giving way. I have listened to him give way repeatedly. Although the new clause is well-intended, its terms are still amazingly broad. Am I right in believing, looking at subsection (3), that these powers could be used to abolish a tax, to relieve an interest group or trade from a burden of taxation, or to abolish a crime, to make something lawful that was previously unlawful under the criminal law? Those may be very desirable things, but they are subject to more safeguards than consultation and Select Committees.

<p><a name="st_94"><a name="60515-09_spnew16"><b> Mr. McFadden: </b> 
 I was not aware of that, but I will let the statement speak for itself.

<p>
<a name="60515-09_para3">
<a name="stpa_24">I will deal with new clauses 20 and 21 in more detail in due course, but let us explore new clause 19 further, because it provides a power to make provision in an order for the purpose of removing or reducing burdens&#151;direct or indirect&#151;that result from legislation. The definition of &quot;burden&quot; in new clause 19 would allow a Minister, by order, to remove or reduce burdens that take the form of a financial cost; an administrative inconvenience; an obstacle to efficiency, productivity or profitability; or a sanction, including criminal sanctions, for doing something or failing to do something in the course of an activity. That means that a Minister may propose by order to decriminalise offences or reduce or remove sanctions if they are no longer considered appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-09_para4">
<a name="stpa_25">That definition of &quot;burden&quot; is deliberately broader than that in the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. That is because the definition of &quot;burden&quot; in the 2001 Act has proved too narrow in that it allows the removal of only a requirement, condition or restriction. As a result, the concept of &quot;burden&quot; in the 2001 Act is complex and difficult to apply. It puts a heavy and sometimes disproportionate burden of legal analysis on Departments. For instance, the regulatory reform orders under the 2001 Act cannot clarify or simplify legislation unless in so doing a narrowly defined legal burden is removed, reduced, re-enacted or imposed.
</p>





<p><a name="st_95"><a name="60515-09_spnew17"><b> Mark Fisher  (Stoke-on-Trent, Central) (Lab):</b> 
 Does the Minister accept that a burden on one group in society may well be a freedom for another group? I do not understand how the interpretation of subsection (3) 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 702</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of the new clause would relate to, for instance, employment rights. From the point of view of the employer, which may be the state or a private company, employment rights are undoubtedly a burden on efficiency and productivity. According to my reading of the new clause, it would appear that employment rights could be removed by order of a Minister.
</p>





<p><a name="st_96"><a name="60515-09_spnew18"><b> Mr. McFadden: </b> 
 There is, of course, the protection of necessary rights and freedoms, which is set out in the Bill. That would protect against the kind of situation that my hon. Friend outlines. The new definition of &quot;burden&quot; will also allow us to target more effectively the order-making power on removing or reducing the burdens that businesses, charities and voluntary organisations wish to see removed.
</p>





<p><a name="st_97"><a name="60515-09_spnew19"><b> Mr. Garnier: </b> 
 I listened carefully to the answer that the Minister gave to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) on taxation. Clauses 5 and 6 offer us some comfort. However, it is quite clear that, under clause 6, the Minister is not prevented from adding to the criminal statute book offences that attract a penalty of up to two years. There are plenty of offences that the criminal courts deal with now that carry a maximum penalty of up to two years. Is he telling us that the word &quot;burden&quot; does not encompass new criminal offences that a Minister might dream up that do not attract a penalty of more than two years?
</p>





<p><a name="st_98"><a name="60515-09_spnew20"><b> Mr. McFadden: </b>

If the Minister is telling me that I, as a representative of my constituents, will have to rely on some as yet unformed Select Committee to exercise its judgment in a way that would be helpful to me and my constituents, that is extremely worrying. He must surely be able to understand that the making of criminal law should be dealt with here, right the way through every stage.

<br>&nbsp;<br>It will also allow us to reduce administrative burdens, such as by simplifying administrative requirements for business when setting up a business or hiring staff, by ensuring that inspection is risk-based to reduce the burden on those who comply with regulation, thus concentrating inspection on those who do not, by simplifying and making more transparent and less onerous the way in which people and businesses need to apply for consent from public authorities, and by allowing, in certain key instances, the complete exemption of small businesses, charities and others from burdensome regulation to allow them to concentrate their effort where it is most needed.

On financial cost, an order may change legislation if its effect would be to remove or reduce a financial cost on an individual, business, voluntary organisation or charity. A Minister may thus propose an order that reduces or removes any unnecessary costs that result from legislation. That definition includes both direct and indirect costs, so an order may reduce both the costs incurred by a regulated business, charity or voluntary organisation and the costs that they pass on to their customers. For instance, the power could be used to deliver exemptions for small businesses from some disproportionately stringent audit requirements, which could have a marked effect on reducing their costs. It could also be used to deliver a proposal in the Charity Commission&#039;s simplification plan that would exempt small charities from certain audit and registration requirements altogether so that they could focus their resources on providing help to those whom they were set up to support.

 Let me return to my previous point. The hon.

If, for example, a future Government wished to repeal the climate change levy, it seems to me that that could be done by statutory instrument so long as the Government ensured that they had a majority on the relevant Select Committees. I would hope that no Government would want to do that, but we do not want to legislate to enable a Government to do so. It is no good for the Minister to say that such a thing will not happen because that is what his predecessor kept saying.

I am sure that many Conservative Members will take an interest in that.

Repealing those requirements will save businesses hundreds of thousands of pounds and relieve the administrative burden on them. That is a small measure, but it is the kind of thing that could relieve those affected of a substantial burden. As the rules are enshrined in primary legislation, only a Bill could repeal them. The order-making power in new clause 19 will provide a more proportionate measure for repeal.

We believe this answers the fears expressed on those core public service points, although we did not believe that those fears would ever be realised through the operation of the Act.

<a name="stpa_49">The House will be aware that these new clauses and amendments would not have been necessary had the Government been prepared at the outset to listen to the widespread concern about, and criticisms of, their original proposal. I pay tribute to the Select Committees and their Chairmen, which have played an important role in the campaign, but also to those outside Parliament such as the TUC, the Institute of Directors, the press and other media, and various blogsites. This is an important victory for Parliament and parliamentary scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_50">Time and again in recent years, we have had to deal with badly drafted and ill-thought through legislation, or legislation that simply does not have the effect that the Government intend or claim. That was certainly the case with this Bill, which in its original form was dubbed by some of its fiercest critics an attack on parliamentary scrutiny, and even the &quot;abolition of Parliament&quot; Bill. It is good that a major concession has been made at this stage, rather than having to rely on their lordships in the other place to make all the running.

<p>
<a name="60515-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_51">Of course, the Bill should have been about deregulation and reducing the burdens on British business, which have escalated under this Government. Perversely, it has turned out to be almost entirely constitutional in its impact. Deregulation was not mentioned at all, despite the fact that, as I pointed out on Second Reading, the British Chambers of Commerce 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 712</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>estimates that the increase in regulatory burden has cost some &#163;50 billion since 1997, that we are passing 15 regulations a day&#151;50 per cent. up on the figure under the previous Government&#151;and that during the same period, we have fallen from fourth to 13th in the league of the world&#039;s most competitive countries, according to the World Economic Forum. According to the International Institute for Management Development&#039;s &quot;World Competitiveness Yearbook&quot;, we have fallen from ninth to 22nd, but whatever measure one looks at, it is clear that, after nine years of Labour, Britain is less competitive and moving in the wrong direction. The burden of regulation is one of the most consistent complaints that Members in all parts of the House hear when talking to business men and women, whether at national or local level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_52">Like all the business organisations that responded to the Government&#039;s consultation before the Bill was introduced, we were in favour of legislation that would make deregulation easier. I thank the BCC, the CBI, the IOD, the Forum of Private Business and the Federation of Small Businesses for all their help and support. They wanted proper safeguards to be included in the Bill, just like everyone else.

<p>
<a name="60515-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_53">This really was a dreadful Bill, and we said from the outset that a range of changes needed to be made if it was to have any chance of making it on to the statute book. It needed to focus on deregulation, and it needed to have what I described as a veto. Luckily, Ministers are now prepared to consider that, although their proposals are still too restrictive. The Bill also needed to specify what kinds of laws cannot be dealt with using the order-making power. When first introduced, it said that a Minister could change any law in any way for any purpose. That was clearly unacceptable. Ministers are now moving to try to concentrate on deregulation and provide the veto. That is welcome. However, there remain some areas of concern that we will want to debate, not least the Law Commission proposals, where there seems to be very little to constrain what happens, and the veto, which seems to have been very tightly drawn.

Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope). He was very active in Committee and was one of the original members of the deregulation taskforce, so he has strong credentials on deregulation. If he moves that amendment, I am likely to support him. My hon. Friend is seeking to establish that the net effect of an order made under new clause 19 should always be deregulatory.

I look forward to hearing the arguments for those amendments, which I suspect are implied in their wording. I certainly would not rule out supporting that approach. There is always a possibility of judicial review if a Minister acts in a totally unreasonable way, but the amendments could add a lesser sanction to the provisions that would provide a useful way of concentrating minds.

Friends, whose various interventions on the Minister gave the impression that the Government would continue to have the powers that we do not want them to have, even theoretically? May I assume from what the hon. Gentleman is saying that he disagrees with his hon. Friends?
</p>





<p><a name="st_151"><a name="60515-13_spnew3"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 I would go so far as to say that the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Cambridge and my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch would improve the drafting of new clause 19, and I am therefore supportive of their efforts. However, I cannot argue with the fact that new clause 19 represents a major climbdown and a step in the right direction. I personally feel that it has saved parliamentary accountability in an important area. I am still unhappy with certain other areas of the Bill, however. For example, it confers far too wide a power in saying that the Law Commission may make a recommendation on any matter&#151;even a highly controversial and important one&#151;without any guarantee that it will be debated on the Floor of the House. I do not accept that. Similarly, the terms of the veto that have been offered are inadequate. However, new clause 19 is a step in the right direction. I hope that that explains my view to the hon. Gentleman.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_61">I also welcome amendments Nos. 23 and 26, which will tighten the way in which the Law Commission&#039;s recommendations are to be dealt with. I am still not satisfied with the overall arrangements for the Law Commission&#039;s recommendations, but I welcome that tightening. We would certainly be prepared to look at the whole Law Commission issue with the Government. Previously, the House has always dealt with Law Commission recommendations using the Standing Orders of the House. Standing Orders Nos. 58 and 59 apply a fast track to consolidation measures, for example. I am not sure that that is not a better way of tackling Law Commission measures than what is proposed in the Bill. Unless we can find a way of allowing non-controversial Law Commission recommendations to pass, while ensuing that controversial ones are properly debated, I shall be unhappy with new clause 21. That is just a warning, however, because we have not reached that new clause yet.

<a name="60515-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_62">New clause 9 is an important proposal, and I look forward to hearing the Government&#039;s views on it when the Minister winds up the debate. We believe that it is necessary to consider the needs of small businesses separately when measures of deregulation are proposed. There is already a plethora of examples of that happening, including exemptions in different categories involving businesses with fewer than five, 10 or 15 employees, and so on. Some exemptions apply when a business&#039;s rateable value is below a certain point, or when its turnover is lower than a certain amount. There is also a range of regulations providing different kinds of exemptions for small businesses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_63">When considering the regulatory regime for business, there is a strong case for requiring the appropriate Minister to consider whether the proposed regulation 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 715</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>will be appropriate for small businesses. There is wide support for that requirement in the business community, even among large businesses. For example, the Institute of Directors believes that, on balance, there is a case for applying small firm exemptions. In its report on the subject, it said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;The burden of regulations often has a disproportionate impact on SMEs because they lack both the resources and the staff to deal with them . . . Exemptions . . . should be determined on a case by case basis. Small businesses have flourished in the USA partly as a consequence of this approach.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="st_153"><a name="60515-13_spnew5"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 I would be happy to do that. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Better Regulation Commission considered whether providing exemptions created disincentives to growth, but did not find much evidence of that. Its report, &quot;Helping Small Firms Cope with Regulation&quot;, on exemptions and other approaches, made it clear that small firm exemptions were a useful tool to ensure that there was not an over-burdensome regime for those companies. I mentioned the various categories and thresholds that apply, and there are small business exemptions in 50 or 60 areas. At the moment, however, there is not a legal requirement that there comes a time when the small business impact is considered, although the Cabinet Office talks about that. I believe that there would be no harm in a specific provision that deals with small business, and I suggested such a provision in Committee. Interestingly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants has said that it believes that the relative proportion of the burden of regulation on small business is too large, and that it hopes that Ministers will consider such an approach.
</p>





<p><a name="st_154"><a name="60515-13_spnew6"><b> Andrew Miller: </b> 
 I want to clarify this point, as the Regulatory Reform Committee, of which I am Chairman, must look to the future when there might be a less benign Government. Is the hon.

</p>





<p><a name="st_155"><a name="60515-13_spnew7"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 All that I am saying is that, at a time when regulations are being made or removed, the role of the small company needs to be considered. I am going no further than that. As the hon.

We need to establish whether they will be dealt with through the existing Legislative and Regulatory Reform Committee, through a hybrid of some kind, or through a vehicle yet to be devised.

 The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) said that the Bill that left Committee engendered an odd debate. I do not think the debate was remotely odd; it was entirely proper and necessary, because the loose wording that had been adopted drove a coach and horses through our proper parliamentary scrutiny, which is why so many of us were extremely concerned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_74">I again welcome the Minister to his new responsibilities. I am sorry that his first parliamentary outing is on one of the most controversial Bills of the year, although at least he has the advantage of introducing amendments that improve it rather than make it worse. He tried manfully to put as good a gloss on the process as possible, although he was not aided by the Minister for the Cabinet Office who left after 12 minutes, which I found surprising given the context of the Bill&#151;but there we are.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_75">The Minister said that the Government had listened to what had been said by the Committees that have considered the Bill. The Government may have been listening but they certainly did not give the impression that they were prepared to budge an inch in the Standing Committee, where the then Under-Secretary at the Cabinet Office simply replied with assertion after assertion after assertion that it was not his intention, and that if it was not his intention it could not possibly anyone else&#039;s intention, to abuse the terms of the legislation, so it was all right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_76">The only thing that made the Government think again was the message from the Government Chief Whip in another place, who told them that the Bill was as good as dead unless it was substantially amended before it went there. That is why the Government have tabled the amendments that we are discussing today&#151;

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 719</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>rightly so, because the Bill is important. We all wanted to support it and to develop a consensus that enabled us to do so, but we can do that only if the Government remove the wholly unsatisfactory parts of the measure. However, I can tell the Minister that I wholeheartedly agree, without demur, with one of his amendments: No. 10, which leaves out clause 1. That is an extremely good amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-14_para10">
<a name="stpa_77">New clause 19 makes the situation better, but it is by no means the final article. It moves some way towards providing a limiting definition, but that definition is still open to misinterpretation and abuse. The problem with the original scope of the Bill was the huge width of interpretation that it allowed Ministers, and indeed a future House. In Committee, we argued that that could be dealt with in three ways: prescription, proscription or protections. All three are valid and more than one of them will be necessary to achieve a workable Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-14_para11">
<a name="stpa_78">In this case, the Government have adopted prescription. They have set out the matters that are the province of the Bill. They have said, by definition, what the Bill is intended for and thus, by implication, that there are other matters for which it is not intended and that are outside its scope.
</p>

<a name="stpa_79">Some hon. Members would argue strongly&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) may well be one&#151;that it would be better to have a proscriptive list of those statutes or aspects of statute that should fall outside the Bill&#039;s scope. Nevertheless, I welcome new clause 19 as at least a move in the right direction, but as the Minister knows, we and others have tabled amendments to new clause 19, and I ask him, rather than simply rejecting them out of hand, to look carefully at what they would do, because they would not work against the principles that he espouses. Indeed, they would support his view. Amendment (a) would introduce a single but very important word&#151;&quot;reasonably&quot;&#151;into new clause 19. That test of reasonableness would provide an objective, rather than subjective test of whether a Minister was doing what the Minister says would always be a Minister&#039;s intention in those circumstances.

 Is there anything that the Liberal Democrats would like to deregulate under the Bill? I always think of them as being very regulatory and bossy, rather than otherwise.

<p><a name="st_163"><a name="60515-15_spnew1"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I cannot deal with the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s misconceptions about my party, but when he intervened earlier on the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller), I thought that the reply was valuable. The Regulatory Reform Committee ought to have a wider brief than simply responding to what Ministers put to it. The hon. Gentleman suggested an investigatory role, but it could have a collating role. I should like that Committee to perform a genuinely deregulatory function in inviting suggestions for deregulation that ought to be put before the House in the form of an order.
</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Department. I do not excuse them for a moment. They have the responsibility of making decisions in their Departments and, if they do not do that well enough, another Minister should be found. It is helpful to listen to the business world and the outside world generally about what deregulatory measures could properly be introduced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_81">I also think&#151;this is partly an answer to the right hon. Gentleman&#151;that the need for sunset clauses in legislation made by order is a prerequisite for good regulation. We should not have regulations that simply carry on, year after year, long after the original need has been removed but remain on the statute book, applying burdens to people in business that they could well do without. As one of the few Members who has run a small business, I know of what I speak, and I feel that that is a necessary protection for businesses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_82">Amendment (a) would apply the test of reasonableness to the decision that the Minister takes when determining whether he is acting in an appropriately deregulatory way. It is no good for Ministers to say, &quot;We don&#039;t need the term &#039;reasonably&#039;&quot;, because they use it in another part of the Bill&#151;not, of course, applying to Ministers, but to members of the public who may wish to make a complaint about the way that Ministers behave. Let us not argue about whether the word &quot;reasonably&quot; is otiose but simply consider whether it adds to Ministers&#039; responsibilities, and I say that it does. I do not want to make a Minister&#039;s decision justiciable in that sense, because I do not want decisions of parliamentary procedure to become a matter for the courts, but I want Ministers to behave appropriately in making that decision, and the insertion of the word &quot;reasonably&quot; would have that effect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_83">The hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) will speak to his amendment (b), but, as the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) said, it is self-evidently a necessary protection. I hope that the Minister will seriously consider it. He seemed to dismiss it earlier, but if he thinks about it further, he will realise that it is a sensible change that would not reduce the Bill&#039;s effectiveness but simply define it more accurately.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_84">I do not propose to talk about amendments (d) and (e) today, for the simple reason that they also relate to new clause 15, which leads a group of amendments tomorrow, and I can explain the purpose for which they were tabled at that point. We have a slightly confused process. Nor do I need to dwell on amendment No. 4, which relates to the definition of reforming. The reformulation of the Bill means that we will have to return to that in another place. At the time when we tabled the amendment, it was crucial, but it is less crucial in the context of the Minister&#039;s new clauses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_85">Amendment No. 74 also inserts the word &quot;reasonably&quot;, but this time in clause 3, which covers the preconditions that a Minister must apply. Again, I hope that a Minister would behave reasonably. He would be required to do so under administrative law because otherwise he would be subject to judicial review, but I do not want to be in the business of encouraging the judicial review of Ministers&#039; decisions in terms of how they present matters before the House. That is not the right way of doing business. We should make it absolutely clear that we are not talking about an assertion&#151;to use a term that I used earlier&#151;by a Minister or a subjective view. A Minister should have to test objectively whether 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>he is behaving reasonably when applying those preconditions and accepting whether they have been met. That seems sensible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_86">The last amendment that I wish to mention is amendment No. 78, which deals with something that has not been mentioned yet. It is a probing amendment on clause 34, which comes right at the end of the Bill and relates to its extent. When I asked the Minister&#039;s predecessor in Committee, he did not appear to have a clue why the clause was written in the way that it was. I do not want to cast aspersions on the previous Minister, but I can see why he had to be promoted, because he clearly did not understand this aspect of the Bill or many others. I want to know why the Bill asserts extraterritorial jurisdiction for itself. I am struggling to find the areas in which the orders that might be amended, repealed or replaced might apply outside England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Under what circumstances would that apply and under what circumstances would it be appropriate for the House to fast-track an amendment to legislation, which, for one reason or another, applied presumably to a Crown dependency? There are very rare occasions on which we have extraterritorial jurisdiction, for instance in relation to some sexual offences. I simply want the Minister to explain why he thinks that that has to be in the Bill. I did not get an explanation in Committee, so I hope that I will now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_87">I feel strongly about amendment (a), because it is the litmus test of whether Ministers are serious about rewriting the Bill. I hope to have the opportunity to test that in the House, given that the Bill has been completely rewritten. We are virtually back to the Committee stage with this part of the Bill, so I hope that we will have the opportunity to test the will of the House on that. I also hope that, unless the hon. Member for Christchurch gets a satisfactory answer, he will feel able to press amendment (b). If he does, we will support it.

<a name="stpa_88">I know that the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) will wish to speak on new clause 17. It is axiomatic that, if a matter is dealt with through this procedure in order for a deregulatory measure to go forward, it should not be overridden by the European Communities Act 1972 and provision elsewhere. If the principles of subsidiarity are to mean anything, they must mean that. I hope that the Minister will be able to reply that that is already the case, but I fear that he may not. If he does not, and the hon. Gentleman intends to press new clause 17, I will advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to support him.

 The Government have got into a terrible mess with the Bill, so it is good to know that the new Minister in charge of it is doing his best to dig them out of that mess. When the Minister&#039;s predecessor presented the Bill, he did so as if it had a different title and was called simply the &quot;Regulatory Reform Bill&quot;. I do not think that he mentioned the word &quot;legislation&quot; in his Second Reading speech. As hon. Members on both sides of the House have been frustrated by and tangled in the mess of regulation that has accumulated due to legislation over the years, the Bill was waved through on Second Reading&#151;the House did not even divide. The Bill was totally misrepresented and thought of as uncontentious.

 It is not for me to speculate on why and I am not sure that it is interesting now. Hon. Members, and there are plenty on both sides of the Chamber today, have been concerned about how the shift of power in politics has moved from Parliament to the Executive over recent years. Indeed, the former right hon. Member for Bexley and Old Sidcup, in his last speech on the Conservative Benches, said that it had been moving inexorably during the 50 years that he had been a Member of the House. Those of us in the group Parliament First, who are interested in such matters, recognise that the balance of power has shifted enormously. The Bill seemed to be the most dramatic and horrific example of that. Had it gone through 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="stpa_90">New clause 19 is important because it is the one hand against that trend. I congratulate the Minister on introducing it and ensuring that the Bill has some constraint. In the light of the generous number of interventions that he took, I hope that he will go back and think about some of them, and see that there are still weaknesses. I do not feel that he responded fully to the point that the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) made on the climate change levy. He deflected it by saying, &quot;Ah, but legislation is covered by clause 5.&quot; However, it is only covered in one direction&#151;to &quot;impose or increase taxation.&quot; The right hon. and learned Gentleman suggested the possibility that orders could reduce or delete taxation. The Bill, with the current wording, does nothing to stop an order being made. It would have to go to a Select Committee, but a Select Committee of a different House, with a different Chair and a different balance could well wave it through. It could be persuaded that a climate change levy was a thoroughly malign thing. That would not be good for Parliament. It would be extremely bad for the way in which we conduct our business.

Anything more pointless and more to the shame of this House could hardly be imagined. Under this Bill, an order to delete all that legislation&#151;if the order got through a Select Committee&#151;would not need to go before the House; it could be a ministerial order. As a member of the middle way group who voted against the legislation, I would be happy and relaxed about that, but that is not the intention behind the Bill or the way in which we should conduct parliamentary business. I do not see anything in new clause 19(3), which defines the burdens, to prevent such things from happening. I know that the Minister intends that subsection (3) will preclude all those things, but that is not apparent from the wording.

<a name="stpa_93">New clause 19 is indeed extremely welcome. It is the first time that the Government have moved substantially from where they started. The original Bill was drafted in an extraordinary fashion; parliamentary procedure would have been bypassed on every kind of occasion if a Government were minded to do so. New clause 19 has sought to narrow that, but it still has not gone far enough. The Government are still not inclined to restrict their scope sufficiently to reassure me that there is not the danger, perhaps a few years hence, that the provision will be misused and in a way that would further erode the power of this Parliament to check the activities of the Executive.

I tell myself&#151;and I hope that everybody else will in this debate&#151;that one must guard against that before looking at new clause 19 and saying that it is not adequate.

I cited the example of the repeal of the climate change levy, because I thought that the proposal might attract the Minister&#039;s interest. Conservative Members support that repeal&#151;presumably, he is not favour of the measure&#151;and there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Government from introducing it. The Bill could be used to provide an exemption to value added tax on goods or services in response to a well publicised and financed commercial lobby. VAT has become nonsense because so many exemptions have been allowed over the years for political purposes. Plenty of people would argue that their goods or services are so desirable that an exemption is the obvious thing to provide. It would be easier to give way to them, if any Government are so minded, by using the legislation. Airport passenger tax, insurance duty and all kinds of unpopular measures could be repealed under the legislation, subject only to the consultation and the veto of the Select Committee on which the Minister relies as protections.

I do not approve of euthanasia or assisted suicide, but the criminal penalty on that act could be lifted under the Bill, subject only to the safeguards on which the Minister relies. He disappoints me by repeating the arguments deployed by his predecessor in response to such examples. He accepts that the Bill as drafted would allow anyone to repeal such penalties, but he says that the Government do not envisage doing so. He says that it is not realistic to expect anyone to do so in future.

It is a fact that the Government determine the majority of every Select Committee.

 It is a great pity that so far in this debate on this important new clause, we have had from Government Members and the Liberal Democrats not a single example of a deregulatory measure that could be deployed under this power, with the single exception of game licences. Although I am very happy to welcome that one, it is not going to change the world a great deal. One would have expected the Government, when constructing this legislation over many months, to have in mind many examples of how they wished to use this power&#151;to be limited a bit under new clause 19&#151;and why it was reasonable in the light of what they wish to do.

<a name="stpa_108">I want the Government to succeed at deregulation. It is a bit like suggesting that a tiger should become a vegetarian, but one lives in hope that the Government believe that deregulation is necessary and wish to do it. However, it would have been so much easier to have done it in the way that we proposed in a debate before the last election in this very House. We gave the Government 63 items for deregulation, including some very big ones, which were also given in writing to the Minister&#039;s predecessor. The Government said that a parliamentary debate somehow did not count as a way of expressing our views on this matter, so I followed it up with a letter to the Department, thereby enabling officials to see that list of items for themselves. We said that that list should form the content of a deregulation Bill.

<a name="stpa_109">That we are yet again having a longish debate about the constitutional implications of this Bill, just as we had to do on Second Reading and in Committee, shows that it is not a very good way of achieving the desired objective. Given that the leading Opposition party is more in favour of deregulation than are the Government, if they had introduced a proper deregulation Bill full of good ideas, it would probably have gone through much more quickly than the constitutional outrage before us on Second Reading, or the rather more limited constitutional outrage before us today.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) made it very clear that the substantial and wide-ranging powers taken in the first draft of the Bill presented to this House were unacceptable. They allowed Ministers to regulate and legislate without going through the normal parliamentary processes. They enabled a major bypass of constitutional practice by effectively allowing primary legislation to be made by Ministers with very little reference to the House of Commons, in a regulatory, as well as deregulatory, direction.
</p>

<a name="stpa_111">We are now told that new clause 19 will limit these wide-ranging powers to legislating in a deregulatory direction.

<a name="stpa_112">When I advised a former Government with a very large majority and a strong sense of political direction on privatisation, we had a choice. We could have said, &quot;Let&#039;s take one piece of legislation to the House of Commons to give us an overall power to privatise anything we wish&quot;, and then do it by order-making, industry by industry; or we could have done it by primary legislation, industry by industry. I advised&#151;I think that the Cabinet was of the same view anyway&#151;that it should be done industry by industry with separate pieces of legislation in each case. That meant far more effort and difficulty for the Ministers concerned, but it was the right and democratic thing to do. Because those major nationalisations had been put in place by separate pieces of legislation, industry by industry, we thought that they should be undone industry by industry, with much more lengthy and bruising debates in the House of Commons. It is extraordinary that the Government can still think it right, despite the change of heart represented by new clause 19, to propose deregulatory measures that take the form of removing pieces of primary legislation that have been passed by this House without going through the reverse process that would be expected.

<a name="60515-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_113">Why should not we have not only an annual Finance Bill but an annual deregulation Bill? Indeed, the House might discuss and vote on the proposition that there should be a combined finance and deregulation Bill every year. It would be wonderful if the Treasury learned the habit of deregulation and legislated for its tax revenues in a deregulatory way instead of the very regulatory way that it does under this Government year after year, with hundreds of pages of new and complex provisions for old taxes as well as new ones. We could then have deregulatory budgets, Department by Department, so that each year a Department would know that there was a piece of legislation that it could use to fulfil the requirement to cut the amount of regulatory burden that it was imposing.

<a name="60515-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_114">Alternatively, the Government could achieve their deregulatory aims by ensuring that each major departmental piece of legislation that went through had an additional deregulatory section. We hoped that that

<br>&nbsp;<br>was what the Prime Minister had in mind when he told us, in respect of regulations, that it would be a case of one in, one out. We hoped that each piece of regulating legislation would therefore contain a complementary deregulatory section so that we could be assured that the overall burden was not going up. But the Government never do that. They do not take advantage of the many legislative vehicles trundling through this House of Commons year after year, usually covering each of the main Departments in turn, by including them in their deregulatory ambitions. Today, we are again left with a truncated and guillotined debate on big changes in constitutional practice.

Those issues are not dissimilar to the questions that arise in the context of the European Communities Act 1972.

<a name="stpa_127">Since 1972, we have been subjected to a constant stream of legislation that has been brought in by prerogative. Let us take the Maastricht treaty as an example, or the treaties of Nice or Amsterdam. I do not need to weary the House with the vast amount of legislation of that kind that has gone through this House, actively encouraged by my right hon. and learned Friend.

When the hon. Member for Cambridge says that the supposed supremacy of

</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_130">Before I move on to the question whether legislative supremacy is a principle to which we still adhere, I want to deal first with the reasons why, from a practical point of view, I regard it as extremely important that we understand how invasive the burdens have been in relation to the business community, industry, competitiveness and enterprise. Leaving aside the system that I have employed to achieve my results, that is my main point. For example, a short time ago, the British Chambers of Commerce produced figures showing the accumulated cost of burdens that arose in respect of a number of regulations. It did not, however, demonstrate that the top six&#151;the most burdensome and most costly ones&#151;were all of European origin, of which I could give several examples. The total cost, from the moment that the burdens were introduced to the moment that the figures were published, came to &#163;25 billion. The regulations concerned included the working time regulations, the Data Protection Act 1998, the Employment Act 2002 and so on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_131">In addition, Sir David Arculus, the Government-appointed chairman of the Better Regulation Task Force, estimated the cost to business of over-burdensome regulations&#151;I stand to be corrected, as the figure seems extraordinarily high, but it is the one that he gave, as far as I can recollect&#151;as &#163;100 billion. No wonder the Government are looking for a way to deal with the problem. We can break down the European element of that, but we should also consider the percentage of legislation passed through the truncated, unaccountable, unattractive and undemocratic procedures in the House, which impose those expensive regulations on British business. Those regulations are then in concrete, and we can do nothing about them, whatever their merits. Once such regulations have been passed by a qualified majority vote, the legislation is imposed on us, and other member states might have a vested interest in not making changes that may be required.

<a name="stpa_132">I take seriously the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner). However, I do not want or intend to over-egg the pudding on this point. For me, this is essentially a practical question about the burdens on business and deregulation. It is not a foray into the abstractions of sovereignty; it is about the way that the system works. It is a time check on reality. Are we going to allow this legislation to continue to invade our business community? The House 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 738</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>should remember that I have always said that I am in favour of trade and political co-operation, and I voted for the Single European Act, notwithstanding my attempt to preserve the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, for that reason. I wrote an article in <i>The Times</i> for that purpose at the time. I foresaw that we might find ourselves saturated in unnecessary burdens and that we would need to relieve them in the interests of competition. It was therefore essential to have the mechanism to enable us to do that. Unfortunately, under the rules of the supremacy of Community law&#151;the other law, in the parallel universe that exists in legislation&#151;we are not allowed to have that mechanism, under the terms of the case law of the European Union. The hon. Member for Cambridge and I could go through all the case law, and I would agree with him that the position is clear under Community law.

<p>
<a name="60515-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_133">However, all that case law, every one of those burdens and every aspect of that European legislation depend on one thing only&#151;the legislative supremacy of this House in passing the European Communities Act 1972. As a consequence, it is open to our judiciary&#151;as in the different context of the Human Rights Act 1998&#151;to interpret and apply that law. That is solely, exclusively and entirely because of the European Communities Act 1972 passed by this House. If this House decides that it wishes to make changes, by whatever procedure, it is incumbent on the judiciary to give effect to that subsequent inconsistent law, providing that it is express and unambiguous. That case law is laid down unequivocally by Lord Denning in the case of McCarthy&#039;s <i>v.</i> Smith, by Lord Justice Laws in the case of the metric martyrs and by Lord Steyn himself in a lecture in 1996.

 I think my hon. Friend will agree that using the order-making power to amend the European Communities Act 1972 might be a bit strong, even for him. Is not his point that, if a procedure allows us to change the law in this country and if there is a principle of sovereignty, it is open to our Parliament to use that procedure to change laws that affect our European Union treaty obligations? Of course, whether that is a good idea is a different question, and it is possible that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and I would not make the same judgment as my hon.

I do not expect the Government to take it up, but my hon. Friend is right to point out that if we are to be correct and accurate in regard to our constitutional position in UK law, and in the context of the legislative supremacy of Parliament, it is incumbent on us to recognise the issues and to recognise that, through a process of absorption, osmosis and camouflage, they have been overtaken.

<a name="stpa_141">Even the case of Factortame, which dealt with the Merchant Shipping Act 1988, ultimately depended on the passing of the European Communities Act 1972. In the words of Lord Bridge, Parliament&#039;s surrender of sovereignty in the 1972 Act was voluntary. What has been given can be taken away; that is the principle. It does not necessarily follow from my new clause that there would be a political decision and a vote in the House of Commons to do that, although I believe that we have gone far too far in European integration and that we need a substantial and radical retrenchment. Even the judgment of Lord Hope in the recent case of Jackson and others <i>v.</i> Attorney-General ultimately depends on the 1972 Act. Mr. Justice Laws referred to &quot;constitutional statutes&quot;, which were purported to be given an additional status over and above ordinary Acts of Parliament. In the context of the European legislation, they themselves would depend on the fact that Parliament had passed the necessary legislation.

In the democracy in which we live, the United Kingdom Parliament acquires its authority from the voters at general elections, which decide the Government. The hon.

 In one of the more arcane Committee debates, it was discovered that the words &quot;local Act&quot; included Acts of Parliament relating to universities, so as new clause 19 still includes those words I declare my interest as a fellow of a Cambridge college and a university reader.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_145">The hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) is right: in the end, it comes down to a political, diplomatic choice. It is perfectly open to the House to repeal section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 either in whole or in part, and to do whatever it wants with our relationship with Europe. I would not deny any part of his speech when he was making those remarks, but the question is whether those actions would be wise and on that matter he and I might disagree.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_146">I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) that the best amendment in the group is Government amendment No. 10, which removes clause 1&#151;a very good thing to remove. It is an extraordinary provision that allowed the Government to change any primary legislation at will. The theory that the Government appear to be following, and which they appeared to be following last Wednesday night when we were discussing House of Lords reform, is that by their mere existence as the Government they are entitled to whatever legislation they want. But that is not the constitutional theory on which this country is based. Parliament legislates, not the Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_147">Another point that we tried to make in Committee, and a mistake into which the Minister appeared to be slipping today, is that it is not the motives of Ministers, or those of the Government that matter, but what the Bill actually says. In that regard, new clause 19 is still defective in two ways. The first is that there is still no control over the subject matter to which the Bill applies. As the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher) said, under subsection (6) the provision applies, in principle, to all legislation. In principle, the abolition of jury trial, for example, can be achieved under the Bill by statutory instrument. If new clause 26, which prevents the use of the Bill for amendments to the measure itself and to the Human Rights Act 1998, were passed, even that would not protect jury trial because the Human Rights Act does not in terms, or by implication, protect jury trial. That aspect of our legal tradition is not protected by the European convention on human rights or by our incorporation of it into our law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_148">The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) said that outlandish possibilities were being discussed, but the erosion of the right to trial by 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 744</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>jury by the Labour Government is far from an outlandish possibility. Indeed, every time the Prime Minister talks about changing the balance in the criminal justice system he means measures of that sort.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_149">A second reason why control over subject matter is important is that it would still be possible under new clause 19 to institute major constitutional change by statutory instrument as long as a Minister considered that it would relieve or reduce burdens. That might include abrogation of section 2 of the European Communities Act and would certainly include matters such as the radical reform of local government, which should, in my view, be achieved only by primary legislation. Although the new clause is welcome, it needs to go much further in a number of ways. In a later group, we shall discuss new clause 16, which deals directly with subject matter, but there are other problems with the measure.
<a name="time_15">
<a name="60515-22_time0"><h5>6.45 pm</h5>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_150">The second major problem is the subjective test. The new clause, like the original provision, leaves the decision about whether use of the Bill is appropriate in the hands of the Minister&#151;if the Minister considers that the conditions for its use are fulfilled. The Minister might consider that jury trial&#151;to take that example again&#151;constitutes an administrative or financial burden. It is right that the new clause excludes from the scope of the Bill burdens on Ministers and Departments, but a Minister could easily consider that jury trial imposed burdens on employers, by removing employees from their workplace for the duration of a trial.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_151">It is important to recognise the weakness of the subjective test under the new clause. Our amendment (a) would strengthen that test by inserting the word &quot;reasonably&quot;, the effect of which would be to heighten the bar over which the Minister must leap to entitle him to use the Bill. In the longer term, the provision would give the courts clearer guidance when considering new orders under judicial review.
</p>





<p><a name="st_245"><a name="60515-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the provision would add an element of objectivity to the test? It would be necessary for a Minister, if pressed, or in judicial review proceedings, to show that there were reasonable grounds on which the reasonableness could be based. There would need to be substantial evidence to support it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_246"><a name="60515-22_spnew2"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 That is an important point. If there were a challenge to ministerial action, it is possible that there would be an attempt at judicial review but what would be the test applied by the court? Without the word &quot;reasonably&quot;, the only test that the court could apply would simply be whether it was true that the Minister indeed considered that the measure was lifting a burden. It would be difficult for a court to get behind a ministerial statement to that effect unless there was clear evidence that what the Minister was saying was not true, or was unbelievable. It is all too believable that a Minister might believe that trial by jury imposed an administrative or financial burden and should be abolished.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_152">The same point applies to the insertion of the word &quot;reasonably&quot; in clause 3. Throughout the debates on the Bill, Ministers have pointed to the protections in clause 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 745</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>3 as a way of deflecting criticism about the removal of necessary rights and freedoms. There has been a debate, or perhaps a lack of understanding, between opposite sides of the House about what those rights are and which of them are necessary. Labour Members were concerned lest Ministers remove rights such as those relating to the minimum wage under the Bill, but Ministers have told them that under clause 3 those rights are &quot;necessary protection&quot;. The problem with that is: who says that they are necessary protection? The answer: the Minister&#151;subjectively. Were the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) the Minister, he might have a different view and consider the matter differently from the present Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_153">Conservative Members were keen to emphasise that a different sort of right was necessary and the Minister tried to reassure them in the opposite direction. The Minister&#039;s defence of the Bill has run the risk of contradiction on a number of occasions.
</p>





<p><a name="st_247"><a name="60515-22_spnew3"><b> Mr. Greg Knight: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is on to a very good point. Could not a Government of one complexion use clause 3, for example, to remove administrative burdens and financial penalties from company directors, whereas a Government of a different persuasion could use the same provision to remove administrative burdens and financial penalties from trade unions? He is therefore absolutely right to say that there is not adequate protection in clause 3.
</p>





<p><a name="st_248"><a name="60515-22_spnew4"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 Yes, I believe that to be the case. In fact, Ministers from different parties could make opposite decisions on the same matter but still be within the terms of the Bill, because all that it requires is that Ministers consider that certain things are the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_154">The Minister has followed his predecessor in asserting that none of this matters because tomorrow we will pass the Committee veto and that all our concerns should fall in at that point. All I say in response is that the Committee veto is not a veto, because the Government retain the right to overturn it in the House as a whole. If it were a Committee veto and there were no appeal against what the Committee decided, the situation might be more interesting, but even then there is the problem to which a number of hon. Members have referred that the Government&#039;s in-built majority on all Committees&#151;indeed, their ability to change the membership of Committees in advance, as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster no doubt knows from her previous job&#151;is enough at least to throw into doubt whether that aspect of the so-called Committee veto is an adequate protection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_155">I find another aspect of new clause 19 particularly disturbing, but I will not refer to it at great length tonight because the best time for that discussion will be tomorrow in a debate on a new clause. However, two amendments in this group deal with the point, and I should explain to the House what they are about. New clause 19, like the old clause 2, contains a provision that allows, by order, legislative power to be transferred to any person. It strikes me as an extraordinary power to grant the Government, and the extent to which the person to whom that power is transferred will be subject to the restrictions in the Bill is not clear. It is that matter to which we will return tomorrow, but it is a major weakness of the Bill that the purpose for which that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>provision was proposed&#151;it has been proposed again tonight&#151;has never been made properly clear. New clause 19 is an advance on the old clause 1, but it is still deeply defective in many ways. Unless further amendments and further concessions are made, I fear that the Bill is still unacceptable.

<p><a name="st_249"><a name="60515-23_spnew0"><b> Mr. Heathcoat-Amory: </b> 
 I rise in support of new clause 17, and I wish to speak to it quite briefly, but by way of preface, I should say that I have an interest to declare in that I have a number of business interests that might conceivably might be beneficiaries of the Bill if it passes into law. From that perspective, I can confirm to the House that over-regulation is the modern scourge. As a population, we are dividing into those who do things and those who stop people doing things. That is having very severe consequences for business activity and, indeed, international competitiveness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_156">My other credential for speaking in the debate is that I am a member of the European Scrutiny Committee and therefore am able to see that the regulatory itch has not abated in the European Union. Every now and then, the European Commission declares war on over-regulation&#151;it did so again last year&#151;but, again, I can report from my perspective on that Committee that, so far, over-regulation is winning that war. It has shifted into new policies, but the overall volume of legislation has not decreased. That is where new clause 17 becomes relevant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_157">I wish to remind the House of an example of over-regulation that could become the subject of the Bill. There have been many calls in the debate for hon. Members to give specific examples of regulatory overreach that could engage the House&#039;s attention if the Bill is passed. I wish to remind the House that, earlier this year, we passed regulations implementing the artist&#039;s resale right, or to give it its French title, the droite de suite regulations, which give living artists, and will eventually give to dead artists as well, a right to a percentage of revenue when their works are resold. The British Government opposed that EU directive, but it was imposed on this country and the House by majority voting. The implementing regulations were debated earlier this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_158">Unfortunately, those regulations got into the hands of the Department of Trade and Industry and, specifically, a weak Minister in another place who spectacularly over-regulated. Instead of implementing that directive to the letter and sticking to what was strictly required by the artist&#039;s resale right directive, he ensured that the threshold was not &#8364;3,000, but &#8364;1,000 for a work of art, thus drawing into the net huge numbers of extra businesses and items and completely contradicting the Prime Minister&#039;s and the Government&#039;s earlier campaign in Brussels to try to get the directive rejected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_159">The Government understood that the directive would be intensely bureaucratic. Very small sums would be collected and possibly redistributed to artists if they could be found. If a work of art was valuable, it would simply not be sold in London; the business would go to New York. That was demonstrated beyond doubt. All those arguments were forgotten by the DTI. I hope that those regulations will be reconsidered in the course of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 747</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>experience, because they will undoubtedly damage London&#039;s position as a leading art market, as well as not in any real way enriching poorer artists.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_160">In a year or two, the Government might wish to amend those regulations, and I hope that they will do so. Given that they are both EU regulations and domestically gold-plated, new clause 17 will be relevant. The House may decide simply to take the regulations back to what is strictly required by the directive; or the House may wish to go further and trespass on the terms of the directive in recognition of the campaign fought, as I have explained, right across the party divide against the directive in the first place. Therefore, it is important that Parliament is aware that those regulations could be amended even though certain requirements are entrenched in a directive. The political judgment at the time might well argue against that, and we might decide not to contradict any provision in the artist&#039;s resale right directive, but we do not know. That is a judgment, and it is important that Parliament understands and has it written into the Bill that it has powers to legislate notwithstanding the provisions of the European Communities Act 1972.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_161">New clause 17 is entirely unexceptional; it would not direct the House in any way to touch the 1972 Act. Indeed, it does not mention the 1972 Act as an Act of Parliament; it simply makes it clear that, in future, Parliament could legislate notwithstanding the provisions of that Act. We are not repealing the 1972 Act; we are simply reminding the House and putting into primary legislation the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty under which we all operate and have done ever since parliamentary powers were first discussed.
<a name="time_16">
<a name="60515-23_time0"><h5>7 pm</h5>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_162">It is sometimes argued that the 1972 Act is entrenched in some way. Other countries in Europe and around the world have written constitutions that make it impossible for Parliament to legislate in conflict with an entrenched constitution. We do not have that doctrine in this country and if any hon. Member believes that we do, they need to say so now, because otherwise we are proceeding on a false assumption. As long as that doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty endures, I do not find it objectionable to amend the Bill to make it clear that if Parliament explicitly and expressly legislates accordingly, it could override directives that are in pursuance of the 1972 Act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_163">That is not a constitutional revolution&#151;rather the opposite. The measure is very modest. I hope that the Government&#151;the Minister has given some fairly unconvincing answers to interventions so far&#151;will address the issue of parliamentary powers. We are not saying that a future House will wish to contradict treaty      provisions, although the Government are contemplating doing so at the moment. The Human Rights Act 1998 is now under question. Following a suggestion from the leader of my party, the Government are apparently looking seriously at repealing, amending or replacing certain international provisions of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

 My hon. Friend knows his constitutional law. It is established beyond doubt in all parts of the House that the Dicey doctrine, as I have heard it expressed, endures and that no Parliament can bind a successor. Although the Parliament at the time passed the 1972 Act, that is not entrenched and cannot bind a future Parliament. Also, treaty law is not ipso facto binding in domestic law. Some countries, such as France, have a unitary system. When they sign international treaties, by that act, the treaties are binding in French law. We do not have that system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_164">In conclusion, new clause 17 is unexceptional. It clarifies the legal powers of the House and makes explicit the possibility of overriding international treaties and EU provisions. I therefore urge the House to accept it and I hope that we divide on the issue.

Let us consider simple measures, such as building regulations. Some 20 years ago, a builder did some work on my house. I thought that it was not right, so I called in the building inspector and the builder had to do the work again. There was a burden on that builder, but it meant that my house was safe to live in after the work had been done, so it was absolutely right.

 The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher) laid bare his soul by suggesting that he had been defective in not appreciating the burden of what the Bill was about. I join him in that state of sin inasmuch as the titles of Bills often deceive us as to their purpose or intent. For example, who could possibly have objected to the Civil Contingencies Bill? It was an important measure. Yet part 2 contained the right of Ministers, down to Whips, by statutory instrument or Order in Council, to change or suspend all the laws of this land with the exception, and only under pressure, of the European convention on human rights and therefore the Human Rights Act 1998. The title of a Bill does not necessarily indicate what it is about. We owe a debt of thanks to the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth), as we do to the Select Committee Chairman, the hon.

I wholly disagree with our membership of the European Community; do not doubt that. I did not stand by and vote for the Single European Act, unlike my more craven hon.

<a name="stpa_189">On the disapplication of the European Communities Act 1972, new clause 17 addresses the elephant in our house. The Modernisation Committee went to Finland about two years ago. The Finnish committee that judges and scrutinises European legislation accepted that 80 per cent. of its legislation came from Europe. In the case of the German Bundestag&#151;Mrs. Merkel made reference to it&#151;70 per cent. of its legislation comes from the European Community. Last week&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Stone was in attendance&#151;Vaclav Klaus gave a lecture in London to American business men, saying that 75 to 80 per cent. of the legislation of the Czech Republic emanates from Europe.

<a name="60515-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_190">Our Cabinet Office two years ago suggested that, more modestly in Britain, only 40 per cent. of our legislation emanates from the European Community. How can we have a deregulation Bill without acknowledging that the greater part of our legislation, including the statutory instruments that follow it and the regulation that is attendant on it, now emanates from the European Community? In some instances, it has direct application in our law without even troubling the House. We have a process, through statutory instruments, by which those laws are nodded through.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_191">What is the purpose of the new clause? First, can we ignore the fact that that quantum of legislation is not regarded for the purposes of the Bill? The new clause says no. My second concern, which is more important, relates to the constitutional affirmation accepted by, I think, the hon. Member for Cambridge and articulated by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe. I am a more simple Member of the House. The long march to our democracy is summed up by Churchill&#039;s exclamation as to who is sovereign: the people are sovereign. The new clause is an expression of that sovereignty. The bypassing of that sovereignty by other means is not appropriate.

The House, having regard to its own dignity, should not just say that because the previous draft of the Bill was so dreadful and has, properly and rightly, been improved to some extent&#151;I give credit to the Government for that&#151;it does not seek the things that qualify the powers of a Minister. That is the heart of the matter, and why the argument is about ourselves and the sovereignty of this place, which my hon. Friend is trying to promote. This issue is incredibly important for the House, because it is about ourselves, our country and our authority&#151;the authority that this Bill and a raft of other legislation confers, each reducing the power of the House for the benefit of the Executive.

 My right hon. Friend is right. Previous deregulation Bills were subject to pre-legislative scrutiny. The Bill goes much further and wider, but it was not subject to such scrutiny. We can only assume that the Government&#039;s motive was to present us with a fait accompli. They tried to seduce us into accepting the provision on the ground that it was not as unreasonable as the original proposal. I very much agree with my hon.

As a result of our efforts in Committee, the Government have begun to see sense, but they still have a long way to go. I look forward to the Minister accepting amendments (a) and (b). As for amendment (c), which proposes that the new clause apply only to public general Acts, it is regrettable that he still insists that it should apply much more widely to local acts, Orders in Council, orders, rules, regulations and so on, as set out in subsection (6). The Bill would be better if the provision were confined to public general Acts. The only local Act that the Government have been able to cite is the Covent Garden Market Act 1961. If they used a truncated provision to change the legislation governing the Covent Garden Market Authority, it could have a severe impact on people who use the authority, businesses that rely on it, landowners and so on. Why should such local legislation not be subject to the full rigour of scrutiny and debate? People may believe that local Acts are less significant, but they are often supremely significant to people who live in the locality that is affected. Under procedures in this Parliament, they may not receive notice of proposed changes until it is too late and the measure has been considered by the Regulatory Reform Committee. The Bill should extend only to public general Acts, not to local Acts.

Since the Bill&#039;s publication in January, we have consistently expressed grave concerns that the powers granted to the Government were too widely drawn and would result in a severe weakening of parliamentary power, the sidelining of legislative scrutiny and the possibility of a move towards ministerial authoritarian rule.

The example has been used of perhaps increasing the burden on a million but reducing the burden on one. That is not likely. However we could increase the burden on one and reduce the burden on a million. That is what we mean by saying that the overall effect should be downward. It is the same as the 2001 legislation that would allow the introduction of more targeted or more proportionate burdens in the context of an overall downward trend. New clause 19 also permits the removal or reduction of overall burdens. It could permit the introduction of new burdens if it is done in the context of reducing the burdens overall.

</p>





<p><a name="st_312"><a name="60515-29_spnew1"><b> Mr. McFadden: </b> 
 The Bill provides that under part 2 the purpose is to remove or reduce any burden&#151;including the overall burdens&#151;that result either directly or indirectly for any person under the legislation.
</p>





<p><a name="st_313"><a name="60515-29_spnew2"><b> Sir Robert Smith: </b> 
 The clause includes the word &quot;or&quot;. The amendment seeks to replace that with &quot;and&quot;. With the &quot;or&quot; still in place we can remove any burden but we do not have to remove overall burdens. The overall

<br>&nbsp;<br>burden can increase. As I have said, there is an &quot;or&quot;. The Minister can say that he is removing a burden even though there is an increase in overall burdens. There is still compliance as things stand.
</p>





<p><a name="st_314"><a name="60515-29_spnew3"><b> Mr. McFadden: </b> 
 No, the overall burden would be reduced. We cannot accept amendment (b) because if we did, in the context of reducing the overall burden, a burden could be increased on one person.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_228">I anticipate that there will be future examples where legislation covering an entire area could be rationalised to benefit those regulated. However, amendment (b) would narrow the order-making power so much that many of the reforms that were possible under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 would no longer be possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_229">I turn to the reasonableness test in amendment (a). The Minister is already under a public duty to reach a reasonable view. We discussed who could object to a reasonableness test, and although the views expressed are on one level true, the amendment would add nothing to the duty that the Minister is already under to act reasonably. Case law has established that if a Minister&#039;s decision is not reasonable, it can be struck down by the courts, so the existing subjective test is a real one.
</p>





<p><a name="st_315"><a name="60515-29_spnew4"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 The Minister seems to be confused. The point is that under the subjective test in the Bill as it stands, all that the judicial review will study is whether the Minister considered a particular thing to be the case. If the word &quot;reasonably&quot; is included, deciding whether the Minister acted reasonably in that context becomes a more objective test. The Minister has a dilemma: either the word &quot;reasonably&quot; makes no difference, in which case, he should accept it; or it makes a very big difference and on a ground that he does not want to accept, in which case, he should resist it on that ground.
</p>





<p><a name="st_316"><a name="60515-29_spnew5"><b> Mr. McFadden: </b> 
 We are of the view that the amendment would not make a difference. We will reflect on it, but we cannot accept it tonight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_230">A number of safeguards will ensure that orders that are beyond the scope of the Bill will not be delivered. Before an order is laid, the Minister will be required to consult widely with the relevant stakeholders. In addition, the Government have undertaken not to use the order-making powers in the Bill to create highly controversial measures, or to force through orders in opposition to the Committees. We will of course hear more about that issue tomorrow.
</p>





<p><a name="st_317"><a name="60515-29_spnew6"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 The Minister said that he would reflect on amendment (a), and I find it difficult to understand what he will be reflecting on. But&#151;this is the big &quot;but&quot;&#151;this is the only opportunity that this House has to express an opinion on it. He can reflect as long as he likes, but this House will not have the opportunity to express its opinion unless it does so tonight. So can he reflect a little more quickly, and perhaps accept it?

<p><a name="st_318"><a name="60515-29_spnew7"><b> Mr. McFadden: </b>

<a name="stpa_231">My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) said that the inertia in the process since 2001 was not necessarily the fault of the Select Committees or of the degree of parliamentary scrutiny. He has a strong point; we have to look at the system in the round. There is an argument that Departments will be more reluctant to come forward with regulatory reform orders if they think that the process is so cumbersome that it will be difficult to use. So there is an argument about incentives and how the process works as a whole. But the Chairman of the Procedure Committee, who has been a voice of common sense throughout this process, and who has come up with positive and constructive proposals, made a strong point about there being not just a duty on this House to agree the proper scrutiny procedure, but a duty on Departments to pursue this agenda with vigour and enthusiasm.

 Does the Minister therefore accept, on his own interpretation of new clause 19, that it may well result in this procedure being used in circumstances where overall burdens will be increased, rather than decreased?
</p>





<p><a name="st_322"><a name="60515-29_spnew11"><b> Mr. McFadden: </b> 
 No, I do not accept that, but it is possible for the burden on some to go up as a new deregulatory process comes into being.

<p>
<a name="60515-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_232">We had a lengthy debate on new clause 17, mostly between Opposition Members. I tried to follow it, and I hope that I have understood the intention of the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) accurately. If I am right, the purpose of his new clause is that orders made under this procedure would not be binding on our Community obligations. He said, I think, to my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband) that if his new clause were accepted, infraction procedures would occur and various consequences would follow.
</p>





<p><a name="st_323"><a name="60515-29_spnew12"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 I did not predicate my argument on the basis that there would be infraction proceedings; rather, I said that they could be a consequence. The stability and growth pact is an example of the rule of law in Europe being destroyed by the attitudes of individual member states. What I am saying is that, where there is an Act of Parliament that is express and unambiguous, even if it is inconsistent with the European Communities Act 1972, and where the words &quot;notwithstanding the 1972 Act&quot; are included in such legislation, the legislative supremacy of this House requires the judiciary to give effect to that legislation. That is the simple point that I am making, and it is unchallengeable.
</p>





<p><a name="st_324"><a name="60515-29_spnew13"><b> Mr. McFadden: </b> 
 It is unchallengeable in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s subjective judgment. The interesting point about new clause 17 is that it is supported by his Front-Bench colleagues, with all the inferences that will be drawn from that. The Conservative party has been re-packaged in recent months, but the point, which might 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 768</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>be noticed beyond this debate, is that they are backing this new clause in the knowledge of what the consequences might be.
</p>





<p><a name="st_325"><a name="60515-29_spnew14"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 I made it clear that I should be very interested to hear the Minister&#039;s views on the new clause. Is he saying that it would change the law, or that it would simply clarify existing law? Is it not just a statement of existing law?
</p>





<p><a name="st_326"><a name="60515-29_spnew15"><b> Mr. McFadden: </b> 
 It seeks to go further than our proposals on the European aspects of the Bill, which deal with gold-plating rather than trying to challenge our obligations as members of the European Union, which are a matter of fact.
</p>





<p><a name="st_327"><a name="60515-29_spnew16"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 As with the arguments&#151;on which at last the Prime Minister has given way&#151;on the Human Rights Act 1998 in the context of the sovereignty of Parliament and the role of the judiciary, so, in different circumstances but on the same principle, the legislative supremacy of Parliament applies in the context of the European Community. Does the Minister agree with that or not?

 The hon. Gentleman proves my point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_233">I should like to turn to some of the other comments made towards the end of our debate. The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) mentioned the Scotland Act 1998. The Bill would have the same relationship to that Act as to the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, in the sense that consequential provisions could be made, as set out in clause 8.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_234">The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) asked about tax. The answer is that orders could be used to reduce tax if that met the purpose of removing burdens and other provisions in the Bill. In reality, however, there is a Budget and a Finance Bill every year, and that is how we deal with tax measures in this House. I hope that that makes the matter clear.
</p>





<p><a name="st_329"><a name="60515-29_spnew18"><b> Kelvin Hopkins: </b> 
 As I said, all taxation issues can be dealt with in the Finance Bill every year, and there is no real necessity to include them in this Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="st_330"><a name="60515-29_spnew19"><b> Mr. McFadden: </b> 
 Here we come to the question of what regulatory reform orders are likely to be used for. My hon. Friend is right&#151;there is a Budget and a Finance Bill every year precisely for the purposes of making changes to taxation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_235">Several hon. Members asked for examples of what the Bill will allow us to do. One example is that of the Charity Commission deregulation, which was undertaken to review the financial thresholds at which certain registration requirements are asked for. Others may include simplifying some transactions with Government, consolidating areas of overlapping legislation, Hampton mergers of regulatory bodies, and streamlining overlapping consent regimes. For instance, the Department of Health wishes to remove a consent regime introduced in the Health Act 1999 because it has proved ineffective, and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister undertook to consider proposals for reviewing, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 769</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>repealing and modifying numerous consent regimes with a view to removing burdens on the NHS, local authorities and others.

<p><a name="st_331"><a name="60515-30_spnew0"><b> Mr. Heathcoat-Amory: </b> 
 Since this regulatory reform Bill has itself undergone considerable regulatory reform so far, will it, if it becomes an Act, be a candidate for regulatory reform under its own provisions, so that it is another example of a future Act that needs to be reformed?
</p>





<p><a name="st_332"><a name="60515-30_spnew1"><b> Mr. McFadden: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman anticipates amendments that we will reach later in the debate. I shall resist outlining those provisions now, as we have that joy to come.

<p>
<a name="60515-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_236">In the end, we have to make a judgment as to whether we want a deregulatory system that can do the job. New clause 19, with its associated amendments, was our response to fears that the Government were introducing too wide a power. Equally, there is a warning on the other side of the debate. If we legislate on the basis of every scenario in our wildest imaginings about what this legislation may be used for, we will end up with a repeat of the process that we have had twice before, which has achieved a consensus in Parliament but not the purpose that we wished.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_237">I shall end by reflecting on what my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, the Chairman of the Regulatory Reform Committee said. It has been suggested in the debate that the Bill is about relieving the burdens on Ministers. That is not the intention of the legislation. Those who feel the burdens are the people and bodies outside the House, including charities, businesses, and voluntary and public sector organisations. They have to deal with the regulation and legislation that we introduce. It is they who feel the effects, and it is to them that we have a duty to regulate in such a way that the power can be used effectively.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. During the debate, several hon.

<p><a name="st_350"><a name="60515-32_spnew2"><b> Mr. McFadden: </b> 
 Having sat through what we have sat through this afternoon, I quite appreciate what the hon. Gentleman is saying.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_242">Making regulatory functions more consistent with those principles is in line with the recommendations in Philip Hampton&#039;s 2005 report that regulators should conduct their business in ways that are risk-based. The Hampton report proposed that the principle of risk assessment should be entrenched in regulators so that the burden of enforcement falls on the highest risk businesses and least on those with the best record of compliance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_243">Although the Hampton report found that there is much good practice in UK regulation, the proposed order-making power in new clause 20 could be used to effect real further improvement. For example, the report found that fewer than half of the regulators in the Hampton review used risk assessment to reduce enforcement activity on high performing businesses. By being able to make provision modifying the way in which regulatory functions are exercised, the Government could begin to propose improvements that would ensure that more inspection is proportionate to risk and consistent. That would have a real effect on those regulated, because the burden of inspection would be reduced on the vast majority of the regulated and would be focused on the cases in which there was a real problem. New clause 20 would allow a Minister by order to modify the way in which a regulatory function is exercised, to secure that regulatory functions are carried out in accordance with the five principles.
</p>





<p><a name="st_351"><a name="60515-32_spnew3"><b> Rob Marris: </b> 
 Would new clause 20 enable a Minister of the Crown, with the safeguards that we hope will be in the Bill, to get rid of some of the many quangos?
</p>





<p><a name="st_352"><a name="60515-32_spnew4"><b> Mr. McFadden: </b> 
 Certainly the merger of regulators is an element of the Bill and is possible under the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_244">One example may be that a regulator could have regard to the views of a body that represented consumers in that area&#151;such as the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council&#151;so that the regulator&#039;s activities are carried out in a way that is more accountable to consumers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_245">New clause 20 would also allow a Minister by order to amend the constitution of a body exercising regulatory functions under an enactment if doing so would make it more transparent and accountable. An example could be amending the statute governing a regulator to provide that it has a board structure, with perhaps a proportion of the board being comprised of non-executive directors, to improve accountability and transparency. It would also be possible by order to transfer the regulatory functions of one regulator to another. That power could be used where two regulators exercise oversight of related areas. For instance, where two regulators are operating in closely related areas, to make their work more transparent to the regulated and more proportionate to risk, it may be appropriate to transfer the functions of two regulators to a single regulator.
</p>





<p><a name="st_353"><a name="60515-32_spnew5"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 Will the Minister explain to me, because I am not absolutely clear about this point, how new clause 20 relates to clause 23, which excludes some regulators 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 778</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>from provisions? I mention that only because he mentioned gas and electricity consumer groups and, of course, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority is one of those specifically excluded from the principles underlying the Bill.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_246">New clause 20 would also permit the creation of a new body to carry out the functions of existing regulators if the Minister considered that that would be for the purpose of securing that regulatory functions were exercised so as to comply with the five principles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_247">Finally, if as a consequence of the creation of a new body or the transferral of a function, another regulatory body becomes obsolete, it may be necessary to abolish it. That, too, would be possible under the order-making power of new clause 20, if the Minister considers that it will ensure that regulatory functions are exercised so as to comply with the five principles of good regulation. It is important that I make it clear at this point that, under new clause 20, an order may propose changes to a body carrying out regulatory functions only if those functions continue to be exercised. Any modification by order of the functions themselves would have to be dealt with under new clause 19, or by way of primary legislation. I assure hon. Members that it is not in any way our intention to erode the independence from Government of those regulators set up by statute. Our aim with this new clause is to have an order-making power that can be used to ensure that all regulators conduct their business in a way that is consistent with the five better regulation principles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_248">An order made under new clause 20 will of course be subject to the same checks and balances as any other. Such an order must meet the preconditions in clause 3, and a Minister must consult widely on any proposed order.

The Government have also given an undertaking that they will not do anything highly controversial using an order and that an order will not be forced through despite opposition from the relevant parliamentary Committees. As we will discuss tomorrow, the Government have placed on a statutory footing a veto for relevant Committees of either House. That will provide further assurance for those concerned that an order will proceed only if the informed view of the House and another place is satisfied that its outcome is desirable.

<a name="60515-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_250">Let me turn to the question asked by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath). Clause 23 excludes certain economic regulators from being specified by order for the purposes of clauses 20 and 21, which relate to the principles and the code. Those regulators are not excluded from new clause 20. I hope that that clarifies the situation, and I ask hon. Members to accept the new clause.

<p><a name="st_355"><a name="60515-33_spnew0"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 We welcome new clause 20, which, as the Minister said, is designed to promote the regulatory principles that derive from the Hampton review and the five principles of better regulation. There is clearly a role 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 779</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>for merging regulators, and there is a proposal to merge 35 national regulators into seven. However, if changes to the role of a major regulator might impact on the public or have a great effect on business, it should be possible for full parliamentary scrutiny to take place. When the former Minister addressed that matter in Committee, I understood that he gave an assurance that that would happen. However, subject to that point, we welcome the new clause as a step in the right direction.
</p>





<p><a name="st_356"><a name="60515-33_spnew1"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 I hope that I can also be relatively brief because I support new clause 20. I had intended to be even briefer, but after hearing the Minister&#039;s reply to my intervention, I am struggling to reconcile what the new clause says with the provisions of clauses 20 and 21. The Minister must correct me if I have misunderstood him, but he told us that although clause 23 excludes certain regulators from the provisions of clauses 20 and 21, those regulators are not excluded from the provisions of new clause 20.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_251">We said in Committee that it was an anomaly that the specified regulators were excluded from clause 20, which says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44">&quot;Any person exercising a regulatory function to which this section applies must have regard to the principles in subsection (2) in the exercise of the function . . . Those principles are that . . . (a) regulatory activities should be carried in a way which is transparent, accountable, proportionate and consistent; . . . (b) regulatory activities should be targeted only at cases in which action is needed.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_252">Sharp-witted Members will have realised that those words also appear in new clause 20. That measure will require a Minister to secure that regulatory functions are exercised by bodies in such as way as to comply with those precise principles, although certain regulators are excluded from those requirements as the Bill presently stands. There is thus a group of regulators that apparently does not need to comply with those principles by virtue of clause 23, but is required to do so by virtue of new clause 20, which the Minister will be able to use to ensure that regulatory functions are exercised in such a way that they comply with those principles. That seems to be an anomaly, albeit not an unwelcome one because at least the principles are there somewhere. Nevertheless, the anomaly might need to be sorted out at a later stage.

<a name="stpa_253">As we said in Committee, that would exclude the Financial Services Authority to some extent and other financial regulators if confidentiality is important. However, it may still apply to them subject to that modification. I wonder whether that is what the Minister is saying.

<p><a name="st_358"><a name="60515-33_spnew3"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman rightly draws attention to subsection (3), but it only complicates matters further. We are not clear, because of the way in which procedure works, where the new clause will sit in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us because it is a basic question. I am assuming that it 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 780</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>forms part of part 1, but it may be part of part 2. I think the Minister nods to say that it would be in part 1, in which case we have one provision in part 1 and something that could be construed as a different provision in part 2.

<p><a name="st_382"><a name="60515-34_spnew0"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 New clause 21 provides a power to implement by order recommendations of any of the UK Law Commissions, with or without changes. It makes the same provision for delivering Law Commission recommendations as set out in provisions contained in clauses 1 and 2, as amended in Committee. The preconditions in clause 3 and the restrictions in the following clauses continue to apply, as does the undertaking given in Committee by my hon. Friend the   Member for East Renfrewshire (Mr. Murphy), now the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform, that the power will not be used for highly controversial measures. The new clause is necessary because of the changes made to clauses 1 and 2.
</p>





<p><a name="st_383"><a name="60515-34_spnew1"><b> Mr. Greg Knight </b> 
: The Minister says that the new clause is necessary because of changes to the Bill, but why is it necessary at all in the light of Standing Order No. 59, which makes special provision for an accelerated procedure to take place in the House for Law Commission Bills?
</p>





<p><a name="st_384"><a name="60515-34_spnew2"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his comments. As Chair of the Procedure Committee, I know that he has taken a detailed look at the Bill. I am interested in his remarks and would be prepared to reflect on them. However, it is not always appropriate to do everything by Standing Order. It is better to put some things in a Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_259">It has sometimes taken too long for Governments to implement some of the proposals recommended by the Law Commission. Indeed, its report last year was fairly typical. It revealed that there were 16 accepted but 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 782</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>unimplemented reports, with an average waiting time of more than seven years from publication to enactment. Clearly, that is not satisfactory.
</p>





<p><a name="st_385"><a name="60515-34_spnew3"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 Why does the hon. Lady feel that there is this long delay in implementation of Law Commission reports? Is it a lack of Bills from the Home Office or the Department for Constitutional Affairs, or is there some other reason?
</p>





<p><a name="st_386"><a name="60515-34_spnew4"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 I am amazed that the hon. Gentleman was able to say that with a straight face. As he knows very well, parliamentary time for Bills from a variety of Departments is likely to be precious and it is difficult for space to be made for them. That is one reason why it is important that the Bill allows for the opportunity for Law Commission recommendations to be brought before Parliament in a speedier fashion. That is the very purpose of new clause 21. After all, Law Commissions are by their nature generally apolitical, so it is not that easy to win parliamentary time. That is one reason why proposals might otherwise not be enacted for very many years. That is not good, because people and businesses are not able to benefit from the considered proposals that the Law Commissions have made. For those reasons, I recommend the new clause to the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_260">If I may, I shall refer to the amendments to the new clause and explain to the House why I must ask it to resist them. The problem with amendment (a), which is intended to restrict the scope of the order-making power to implement Law Commission recommendations by ensuring that Ministers cannot change those recommendations in any way if they wish to use the order-making power, is that it is too restrictive. It would not allow any changes to the recommendations. The words &quot;with or without changes&quot; introduce a degree of flexibility into new clause 21. The new clause would therefore avoid the loss of good measures by reason of quibbling arguments that a change is beyond a particular technical parameter, while still preserving the overall rule that the order in question must implement a Law Commission recommendation and not something different from that.

</p>





<p><a name="st_388"><a name="60515-34_spnew6"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 Subsection (5) does indeed go a long way to achieving what we want to achieve, but it is important that we include in the Bill the fact that amendments to Law Commission recommendations may need to be made. The most obvious example of when that might be necessary, which my hon. Friend the Member for East Renfrewshire gave in Committee, is following a time lapse such as that we have discussed, during which other things may have taken place that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 783</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>mean that a recommendation no longer fits the purpose for which it was intended. In that case, changes would have to be made. Amendment (a) would stifle that use.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_262">My hon. Friend also said in Committee that the words &quot;with or without changes&quot; are not intended to allow Ministers to make proposals that would turn recommendations into something completely different. If proposals are so far removed from the recommendations that they would not, in fact, implement them, under new clause 21 the proposal should not be proceeded with. I would imagine that the Scrutiny Committee would be quick to ensure that that were brought to the House&#039;s attention under the new veto provisions to be introduced in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_263">The 2001 Act included numerous technical restrictions that created arbitrary limits on what could be delivered by order. The order-making powers created by the Bill should be flexible enough to achieve the effective delivery of beneficial Law Commission recommendations, which are an important part of the better regulation agenda. The correct approach is not to rule out changes but to allow proposals to be considered by the Committees. If they do not agree that the      proposals implement Law Commission recommendations or satisfy the pre-conditions in clause 3 that provide important protection for people&#039;s rights, they can veto the order. We may, for example, need a power to make changes before the Law Commission recommendations become legislation. There may be scope for drafting or structural changes if the Government decide to adopt only some of the proposals in a Bill drafted by the commission. It is often necessary to make amendments to reflect changes in the law after a Committee reports. It may be desirable, too, to make material changes to the detail after further consideration or a suggestion from a scrutiny Committee. In response to the question from the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke), subsection (5) would not cover all those possibilities. In summary, amendment (a) is unduly restrictive, as it would introduce sterile and time wasting arguments about form and language. We want a procedure that delivers better regulation, not one that absorbs resources in arid legal arguments over technicalities. I therefore cannot support amendment (a), so I hope that the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) will withdraw it.

 With reference to Scotland, the Minister may be aware that the Law Society of Scotland has pointed out that there is an implied assumption in new clause 21 that all Law Commission and Scottish Law Commission reports and recommendations are non-controversial and may be enacted using the procedure under the Bill.

 The hon. Gentleman is right. Many of the issues that the Law Commission deals with are controversial.

To reassure the Law Society of Scotland, I point out that where issues are controversial, as has been said in earlier debates today and as was said in Committee by my hon.

We would need to define family law and the other topics that have been mentioned.

<a name="stpa_292">Some Governments are very hard to please. They tell us exactly what they want, we table an amendment to that effect, and then they want something completely different. There are other reasons for which they want to be able to change recommendations, and it is those other reasons that give us cause for alarm in this instance. If the intention is to implement some recommendations and not others, that may completely change the complexion of what the Law Commission proposes. Is the Minister proposing to cherry-pick certain proposals? Are proposals going to be tweaked to make 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>them more acceptable to Ministers or, indeed, Select Committees? I have worries about that as well. The issue should be put before the House so that everyone has a choice to take part in the discussion, not just a select few.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-36_para14">
<a name="stpa_293">If the Bill is to contain the mechanism described by the Minister for the fast-tracking of Law Commission proposals&#151;there are new caveats that I welcome, given their applicability to later amendments&#151;it must also incorporate amendment (b), which limits the ability to change the recommendations in a way that the Minister specifically identified in Committee as a necessary prerequisite for effective working of the legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-36_para15">
<a name="stpa_294">If the Chairman of the Procedure Committee, the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight), presses his amendment, we will support him. I merely ask him to reflect on whether our amendment would not only do the same as his, but allow a small concession to Ministers in the context of what they sought in Committee. In the light of that, he may prefer to support our amendment. In any event, the House should divide on one of the amendments. I must add that if the Procedure Committee, a Select Committee of the House, is to be ignored by Ministers, it sets a poor precedent for the working of the Bill.

<p><a name="st_414"><a name="60515-37_spnew0"><b> Mr. Knight: </b> 
 This is not a party-political issue. It is really a matter of judgment. I have reached the conclusion that new clause 21 is not the answer, and I hope that the Minister will reflect on what has been said this evening and will withdraw it. If she is not prepared to do so, the new clause will be rendered less offensive if the House accepts amendment (a), which incidentally has cross-party support. I hope, Mr. Speaker, that you will allow a Division on the amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-37_para0">
<a name="stpa_295">As has been said, new clause 21 seeks to facilitate the implementation of Law Commission recommendations by using a fast-track procedure under the Bill &quot;with or without changes&quot;. The Minister objects to the removal of those four words. According to the Minister for the Cabinet Office, the right hon. Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong), if time had elapsed and some of the measures had been implemented because they were deemed urgent, without the words &quot;with or without changes&quot; Ministers would not be able to implement the balance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_296">I do not buy that argument, for reasons identified by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) and the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth). Subsection (5) of the new clause states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50">&quot;An order under this section may contain such consequential, supplementary, incidental or transitional provision (including provision made by amending or repealing any enactment or other provision)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_297">I think that the power is there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_298">One of the duties of the Law Commission&#151;some would argue that it is one of its main tasks&#151;is to codify and bring together legislation on the same subject. Why would we want to split one of its proposals between different pieces of legislation? My reading of subsection (5) is that Ministers could implement proposals that were necessary and repeal any law changes made in the interim, and codify it all under the order-making power. That seems to me to be the right way to proceed.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 793</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_299">As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) said, it is incorrect to assume that a Law Commission recommendation will be uncontroversial. When my Committee took evidence, the Minister&#039;s predecessor, the hon. Member for East Renfrewshire (Mr. Murphy), insisted on using the term &quot;highly controversial&quot; to describe measures to which the provision would not apply. Not just controversial, but highly controversial was the description given in each case. If the Minister is saying that she has reflected on that and is willing to lower the threshold, I would be reassured.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_300">I see no need for the provision to be in the Bill. We have two Standing Orders that could relate to the type of legislation that we have been discussing. Standing Order No. 58, which deals with consolidation measures, states that Second Readings and Third Readings of such measures will be taken forthwith; it therefore provides a much accelerated procedure. Standing Order No. 59, which the Conservatives introduced, with consent, when we were in government, specifically refers to Law Commission Bills and states that they should be referred to a Second Reading Committee. We made those changes with consent&#151;that was how we did business then when we amended Standing Orders, and I regret that that is not what happens now. That Standing Order, which was introduced in 1995, has, I believe&#151;I stand to be corrected by the Minister&#151;not been used by the Government since 1999. One has to ask them why. Why have they not at least tried to use that provision to put Law Commission proposals on to the statute book?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_301">I am not saying that those two Standing Orders are perfect, but I noted what I regard as a point of good will made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire. He said that he was prepared to engage in constructive dialogue with the Minister, perhaps on ways of changing the Standing Orders to deal with such matters. The Modernisation Committee is already examining our processes, and I know that the Procedure Committee would be prepared to consider that very point. I hope that the Minister will reflect on that with a view to not going down the proposed route and to ensuring that the House always has the opportunity, through primary legislation, to consider Law Commission proposals, albeit by an accelerated procedure.
</p>





<p><a name="st_415"><a name="60515-37_spnew1"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 I, too, welcome the comments made by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald). I am always happy to enter into dialogue with him, and happy to restate that if it helps this evening&#039;s debate. However, that does not mean that I have any intention of withdrawing new clause 21. There are times when the accelerated procedures that the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) has clearly outlined are not appropriate for substantive changes to the law, as opposed to consolidating Bills. I ask him to reflect on that point.
</p>





<p><a name="st_416"><a name="60515-37_spnew2"><b> Mr. Knight: </b> 
 I am disappointed to hear that. In the light of what the hon. Lady has just said, I shall be one of those seeking to divide the House on the new clause.
</p>





<p><a name="st_417"><a name="60515-37_spnew3"><b> David Howarth: </b> 
 In view of the time I shall be brief and add only one point. The importance of the debate is that the Law Commission route is the only one under the Bill 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 794</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>whereby Ministers can change the common law, otherwise their powers are restricted to changing statutes. The common law basis of our constitution is well-known; the rules of natural justice, for example, exist only in common law, not in statute.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_302">The Government have a history of changing Law Commission recommendations. On bad character evidence, for example, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 did exactly the opposite of what the Law Commission recommended, so these are serious matters. If the Government cannot bring their desires within either subsection (5) of the new clause or the second part of amendment (b), to take advantage of the power to make changes consequent on the delay in implementing the recommendations, the only proper route is not to make use of the fast-track procedure but to go back to the Law Commission and try to persuade it to take the matter forward.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I wonder whether you could help us. The last group of amendments for consideration today, which we did not have an opportunity to debate at all, included some very important amendments on the constitutional arrangements, particularly the application to the Scotland Act 1998 and the way in which the Bill interacts with Scottish affairs in the Scottish Parliament. Is there any opportunity to discuss those matters tomorrow, given that we have a further day on Report and that under today&#039;s timetable we have had no debate whatever of those subjects?

<p><a name="st_438"><a name="60515-39_spnew3"><b> Mr. Andrew Lansley  (South Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful for the opportunity to raise an issue of particular concern to my constituent&#151;I shall shortly explain his circumstances&#151;that extends to a much wider constituency of opinion. Many people both inside and outside the House think that the time to take action to try to remedy some of the difficulties in the case is overdue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para1">
<a name="stpa_310">I am grateful to the Minister for Local Government for agreeing to replying to our debate on the model code of conduct for councillors. I accept that it would be inappropriate for him to refer to the specific case of Councillor Alex Riley, but I am grateful that he will deal with the wider issues. It might be helpful if I describe the circumstances of Councillor Riley&#039;s case. For some time, he has chaired the parish council in the village of Longstanton, which is several miles north-west of Cambridge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para2">
<a name="stpa_311">As a result of the last regional structure plan and the subsequent county structure plan, a large new town is to be built to the north of Longstanton and Oakington comprising 8,000 to 10,000 homes&#151;subsequently, the local development framework settled on 8,000 homes. That large development is very close to Longstanton, and it will envelop parts of the village. It extends to the north, west and east of the village, and in the original plans, it was no more than the distance of a football field from some points of the village.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para3">
<a name="stpa_312">As chairman of the parish council, Alex Riley was closely and actively involved in the debate about the structure plans. When it became clear that active planning on the local development framework would begin, he decided to stand for election to represent Longstanton on those issues. In June 2004, he was elected with 70 per cent. of the vote in Longstanton as an independent councillor&#151;the House will observe that this is not a party political matter. From June 2004, he sought to represent the village&#039;s views on a range of issues in the local development framework before an outline planning application was made. However, the ethical standards officer alleged that 15 breaches of the code of conduct took place in the space of just five months. I accept that the Minister will not want to comment, but the hearing of that case took place today. It concluded that Councillor Riley was responsible for breaches of the code of conduct but a penalty was not imposed, apart from the fact that he was instructed to receive training in the code. That is ironic, given that he has become insufferably familiar with it to the point of contempt. None the less, in my view&#151;I do not propose to speak for anyone else&#151;those were technical breaches of the code. That is one of the main reasons why no penalty has been applied.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para4">
<a name="stpa_313">The issue is the extent to which councillors legitimately sent to their council chamber by constituents are able to represent those constituents. The Local Government Act 2000 set out an ethical framework for councillors, including in section 30 a model code of conduct, which South Cambridgeshire district council adopted in 2002. The code identifies two 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 804</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>interests&#151;first, personal interests, which can be defined as anything that might be held to affect a councillor&#039;s well-being or financial position, or that of their relatives or friends, to a greater extent than it would affect the local population generally. Secondly, there are prejudicial interests&#151;interests that are so significant that a member of the public with knowledge of the relevant facts would reasonably regard those interests as likely to prejudice the councillor&#039;s judgment of the public interest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para5">
<a name="stpa_314">Those definitions are not at issue. Individually, Councillor Riley and all the other residents of Longstanton have personal and, in almost all cases, a prejudicial interest in relation to these matters. Planning decisions must, of course, be made in the public interest, but local residents have a legitimate expectation that that public interest includes and fully takes account of their views as the people most affected by a planning decision. We must ensure that that interest is properly and accurately reflected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para6">
<a name="stpa_315">There is confusion in South Cambridge district council about how the code of conduct should be applied. Without going into detail, it was clear in 2004 that Councillor Riley received conflicting advice about what his personal and prejudicial interests should mean in relation to his participation in the council&#039;s discussions. In October 2005 South Cambridgeshire district council took counsel&#039;s opinion. That was necessitated by the fact that the council was coming on to examine the local development framework and an outline planning application from Gallagher, which is the promoter of the large scheme. The Minister need not declare an interest, but English Partnerships, which is part of the Department, owns much of the land on which the town is to be built.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para7">
<a name="stpa_316">Counsel&#039;s opinion pointed out how the district council should, in accordance with the current law, deal with the councillor. First, a councillor with a prejudicial interest would be required to withdraw whenever a meeting was held. A meeting, for these purposes, included any meeting of the authority&#151;not just meetings that formed part of any decision-making process, but informal meetings, briefing meetings or any meeting whatsoever. Secondly, the further requirement that under the code councillors should not seek improperly to influence a matter should be interpreted to include lobbying or making any written representations to members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para8">
<a name="stpa_317">The code allows dispensations, but counsel&#039;s advice to the district council was clear. The standards committee of the council could not use those dispensations to avoid adherence to the code. Counsel instanced some of the very limited circumstances to which dispensations might be applied.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para9">
<a name="stpa_318">When counsel was advising the planning authority about what Councillor Riley could do, he came up with three options. The first was that Councillor Riley should no longer be regarded as the route through which representations could be made by villagers, so representations could be made direct to the planning director. The second was that villagers should use another councillor who had no disqualifying interest. The third option was that Councillor Riley should resign. He would then be able to make representations as chairman of the parish council or as a private citizen.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 805</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para10">
<a name="stpa_319">It is curious that the use of another councillor has been the route through which the district council has proceeded. The necessity for Councillor Riley not to apply improper influence has even extended to the point where he is not allowed to discuss matters in his village with the councillor who has been nominated to be the route through which such representations are to be made. Another councillor on the parish council has been so nominated and the deadening hand of the code seems almost to be extending to the point where Councillor Riley cannot even talk to Councillor Grace, who subsequently talks to Councillor Kindersley, who is the councillor through whom their representations might come. Such is the effect of the model code in the way in which it has been interpreted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para11">
<a name="stpa_320">You will not be surprised, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that I have raised the issue with the Standards Board for England. It responded helpfully in November by saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55">&quot;The Board shares your view that the current rules can be over-restrictive . . . and may exclude members from discussing certain matters which their community would expect them to be addressing or even, in certain cases, where they have been elected to represent specific views. Given the changing role of most councillors, the code needs to be seen to be supporting such local advocacy and the democratic right of a community to be represented when key matters which affect that community are under discussion.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para12">
<a name="stpa_321">David Prince, the chief executive, went on to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56">&quot;The Board has also further recommended that the Government should also give local authorities broader powers to grant exemptions to members with prejudicial interests who nevertheless are speaking on behalf of their constituents.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para13">
<a name="stpa_322">The board went on to make recommendations to Ministers that flowed from exactly the same points that were made in their letter to me. The Committee on Standards in Public Life separately has made its own recommendations to Government, and I shall quote one of them. It said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57">      &quot;In planning decisions the ability of elected members to represent constituents&#039; interests where they have personal and prejudicial interests has been unnecessarily diminished. This should be changed to give any elected member the right to speak (but not vote) for their constituents at a planning committee meeting or any other quasi-regulatory meeting.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para14">
<a name="stpa_323">In that sense, we are clear about the direction in which both the board and the committee see we need to go.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para15">
<a name="stpa_324">I wrote, of course, to the Minister. He responded helpfully in January to me, making it clear that the Standards Boards had made these recommendations that he was minded to accept. I suppose that I could have rested on that and not exposed the issue to further gaze in the House, but I wanted to use this opportunity to say that I think that the current situation is untenable. In the case of South Cambridgeshire district council, there has been the benefit of counsel&#039;s opinion. It is not an arbitrary opinion. We have arrived at the point where, not seeking improper influence, where Councillor Riley can barely speak to any of his fellow councillors without it being thought to be an improper influence. He cannot even go to informal meetings, briefing meetings or information meetings in the same way as members of the public attend to ascertain what is happening. He cannot ask questions and he cannot make representations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para16">
<a name="stpa_325">Across the country, I have no doubt that this is not the only example. The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) raised an instance not dissimilar to it on 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 806</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>8 November last year. Throughout the country either councillors are unknowingly breaching the code, as Councillor Riley did in 2004, by speaking on matters where they have an interest, even if they know that they do not have to vote. In many cases they have not concept of the extent to which the moral code of conduct can be interpreted as constraining them. Alternatively, we have councillors throughout the country who are being excluded from discussion of the very issues that they know best and about which they have been elected to represent their constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para17">
<a name="stpa_326">Councillor Riley and I do not expect that he should be able to vote on issues where he has a personal or prejudicial interest. He does expect to make a full declaration of interests. He expects also that his representations should be made only openly and transparently. He does not expect to undertake private lobbying or to participate in discussions after he has made his representations. He does however expect to have access to briefings, and to be able to ask questions and make representations in cases where his council colleagues will be making decisions. He said to me plainly that if he cannot persuade them of the merits of the argument, he will understand and accept that he has failed in his task. It is his responsibility to make the arguments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-39_para18">
<a name="stpa_327">The issue is not settled; Ministers need to make progress. The outline application for the Northstowe development, which encompasses Longstanton, has yet to be considered and determined. Circumstances such as Councillor Riley&#039;s will arise elsewhere in the country. It is important that changes to the code be made as a matter of urgency. If the code is not changed under the secondary legislation that local government legislation permits, this negation of democracy will carry on and, far from inspiring confidence in local government, the code of conduct&#039;s application will bring local government into disrepute.

<p><a name="st_439"><a name="60515-40_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Local Government  (Mr. Phil Woolas): </b> 
 Congratulations are due to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) on bringing to the House&#039;s attention the case of his constituent, whose views have been represented. This case also raises wider issues of relevance to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s other constituents. I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for explaining my responsibilities in this regard; it is always helpful when that happens. I am conscious that whenever we debate parish matters, newspaper headlines reporting our deliberations do not scream off the presses. However, there are some 80,000 parish councils in the country, and in my experience it is wise to take these debates very seriously, because many councils rightly take a close interest in these proceedings. The issues that the hon. Gentleman has raised concerning the code of conduct apply not just to parish councillors, but to councillors across the board.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para0">
<a name="stpa_328">I am also grateful for the opportunity to discuss the rules of conduct for councillors in the context of the planning regime. These rules are set out in model codes of conduct for local authority members&#151;including, of course, members of parish councils&#151;with the aim of maintaining the highest standards of the public conduct of local authority members. We consider it important to promote such standards for parish councils, as for other tiers of local government.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 807</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para1">
<a name="stpa_329">As has been said, it is difficult for me to comment on individual circumstances, but where allegations impinge on an individual planning application, that application could be referred to the Secretary of State or to one of her inspectors on appeal. In those circumstances, I would not wish to say anything that might subsequently prejudice the quasi-judicial appeal process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para2">
<a name="stpa_330">Actively promoting high standards of behaviour among local authority members is of course an important objective for any Government. Many men and women devote their time and energy to the service of their communities, and the overwhelming majority of people elected to serve as local authority members already observe the highest standards of conduct. But it is also important to get the balance right&#151;an issue that I will discuss in a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para3">
<a name="stpa_331">We cannot disguise&#151;nobody wishes to&#151;the fact that failings occur from time to time, and given that tens of thousands of people are involved, that is going to be so. However, it is worth noting that instances of elected members falling short of the conduct expected of them are very rare indeed. Such misconduct not only harms the community that members are elected to serve; it can damage the wider reputation of local government and undermine the public&#039;s trust in, and confidence in, the system as a whole. I noted carefully the hon. Gentleman&#039;s reference to the pendulum perhaps swinging too far, as some might see it, and to that itself bringing the regime into disrepute. The need to maintain public trust is just as true for parish councils as it is for other tiers of government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para4">
<a name="stpa_332">The planning system involves a considerable amount of discretion, and councillors on a planning committee may arrive at a decision based on a variety of considerations. However, the law defines that decision-making duty. Failure to act within the confines of these provisions may render the council open to legal challenge by means of judicial review. The role of an elected member on a local authority planning committee involves balancing the need to represent the interests of individual constituents and the community with the need to maintain an ethic of impartial decision making on what can be, and often are, highly controversial proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para5">
<a name="stpa_333">In 1997, the Government committed themselves to reinvigorating local democracy, focusing on enabling councils to provide the local leadership that their communities need and to deliver the services they want. In order to tackle the need for a higher degree of public trust, we introduced a new framework under the Local Government Act 2000 to promote standards of ethical behaviour. We felt that the new framework must help to dispel public criticism about those in public life by demonstrating clearly that unethical behaviour is just as unacceptable to those who have been elected as it is to the communities that they represent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para6">
<a name="stpa_334">The framework indicates the high standards that are expected and requires an explicit commitment to them. Let me remind the House that the most significant provisions of the ethical regime were: the introduction of new statutory codes of conduct; the establishment in each authority of a standards committee to provide support and guidance to members on the requirements of their local code; and the creation of what was then a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 May 2006 : Column 808</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>new body, the Standards Board for England, to promote high standards nationally and to investigate alleged breaches of the code in an independent and consistent manner.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para7">
<a name="stpa_335">The codes of conduct set out the conduct that is expected of members and provide a sensible framework for handling personal interests which should ensure that, providing that they have no prejudicial interests, councillors can take part in discussions and decisions and so represent their electors to the best of their ability. From May 2002, the provisions of the codes have applied to all councillors, and any allegations that the code has been breached can be reported to the Standards Board, which can then decide whether to investigate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para8">
<a name="stpa_336">The model codes provide that members have a prejudicial interest in a matter if, as the hon. Gentleman said, the interest is one that a member of the public would reasonably regard as so significant as to be likely to prejudice the member&#039;s judgment of the public interest. A member with a prejudicial interest is required to withdraw from the meeting at which the matter is discussed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para9">
<a name="stpa_337">The codes also provide that members should not use their position to confer an advantage for themselves or any other person. Various further guidance documents have been issued to assist members in carrying out their roles in respect of the planning regime and the need to have regard to their own personal and prejudicial interests. Chapter 8 of the document, &quot;Probity in Planning&quot;, which is issued by the Local Government Association, makes it clear that councillors who have openly declared a view on an application should not use their position to lobby other councillors or organise a caucus to support their position. Elsewhere in chapter 8, it is made clear that other political meetings should not be used to reach a decision in advance of the committee which will make the decision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para10">
<a name="stpa_338">A document prepared by the LGA, &quot;Member engagement in planning matters&quot;, gives similar advice. The purpose of that document is to explain to members how they can become more engaged in discussions without fettering their discretion. However, if they do, the guidance is clear. It states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58">&quot;Members who do take an active stand in support or assistance to an application should withdraw from the planning committee deliberations. Responding to lobbying is fully legitimate where a councillor openly admits an interest in the outcome of deliberations and withdraws from the discussions on which they have a particularly strong view and stands down for the period while the item is under discussion.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para11">
<a name="stpa_339">We wish to make the planning system fairer and more transparent. Accordingly, my Department continues to work with its partner bodies, such as the Local Government Association, to produce advice and guidance for elected members on propriety issues in planning. Indeed, the Planning Advisory Service, which is an arm of the Improvement and Development Agency, is financed by the Government. Its creation was one of the benefits of the &#163;600 million in planning delivery grant allocation made available to improve the system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para12">
<a name="stpa_340">When they were initially issued in 2002, the model codes were generally welcomed. There were certainly some complaints from the smaller parish and town councils, particularly about the requirements to register

<br>&nbsp;<br>interests. It was feared that a sledgehammer was being used to crack a nut. However, many of the concerns have been eased as councillors have grown familiar with the conduct regime, and it now has broad support. This has been assisted by the Standards Board&#039;s own provision of support, guidance and training to parishes on the operation of the system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para13">
<a name="stpa_341">It is sometimes suggested that the introduction of the code of conduct for parishes has caused parish councillors to resign. I took those fears very seriously, because it is obviously important to get the balance right. However, I am pleased to be able to tell the House that there is little or no evidence to suggest that significant numbers of councillors have resigned as a result of the code.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para14">
<a name="stpa_342">That brings me to the subject of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s debate. The recent reports of the Graham Committee and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Select Committee&#151;which was so ably chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Chris Mole)&#151; considered the future of the local government ethical regime. They supported the continuing inclusion of parish councillors within that regime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para15">
<a name="stpa_343">The conduct regime has now been in operation for four years. We have recently reviewed it, and our proposals for change were set out in our discussion paper of 15 December 2005. They included proposals to make decision making under the regime more locally based, to make the Standards Board a more strategic regulatory body, and to make the code of conduct simpler, clearer and more proportionate. We are hoping to make changes to ensure that the framework meets the objectives that it was created to achieve, and that the lessons deriving from practical experience in operating the rules are learned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60515-40_para16">
<a name="stpa_344">As part of our follow-up to the discussion paper, our review of the code of conduct will take into account the recommendations on changes to the code made by the Standards Board. These include proposals for a reduction in the number of interests that members need to declare, and for a relaxation of the rules relating to prejudicial interests to support the advocacy role played
