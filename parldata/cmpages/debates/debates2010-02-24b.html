 Good morning, Mr. Speaker. Youth unemployment in Scotland has increased in recent months, but since 1997 the number of 18 to 24-year-olds in Scotland claiming unemployment benefit is down by 40 per cent. That issue was discussed at the recent jobs summit in Easterhouse.</p>

 The figures in Scotland have gone down 40 per cent. In Scotland the number of 18 to 24-year-olds claiming unemployment benefit for six months or more was 8,800 in January 2010, so hopefully that answers the hon. Gentleman's question. I would have thought that it would be a matter of consensus across all the political parties that we have to do more together to challenge youth unemployment, because it dampens expectations among the most idealistic and energetic generation, and has the potential to ruin young lives. However, based on the hon. Gentleman's question, it is clear that he does not understand very much about unemployment among young people in Scotland.</p>

 It is very important that we take a team Ayrshire approach to trying to overcome youth unemployment, and not just youth unemployment. We are keen to ensure that those over 50, who have perhaps not experienced unemployment or been in a job centre for a considerable period-or perhaps never in their lives-do not become used to unemployment and do not spend that period in advance of their retirement settling for a life on unemployment benefits. It is therefore essential that we do more together across all the generations, in Ayrshire and across Scotland.</p>

 It is a fact-I thought that the hon.

However, because of the actions of this Labour Government, 50,000 jobs have been saved in Scotland. It is clear that the hon. Gentleman does not care about that, because he is so fixated on trying to get only one job, and that is my job, at the next election. The people of Scotland know that.

to reflect on the fact that during the 1980s Tory recession, it took 19 years for the jobs situation to return to pre-recession levels. Nineteen years-nearly two decades-is how long it took Scotland to recover from that recession. The fact is that the Conservative party has not learned the lessons of the 1980s, because it remains committed to cutting tax credits from many families throughout Scotland. It is no wonder that Scotland sees the Tories as a real danger to its well-being.</p>

That is the Labour Government subsidising the opportunity for young people and others to have the chance of a job during this recession.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for providing me with a little advance notice of his supplementary question.

He crushed the peasants' revolt, built up a group of unpopular favourites, arrested, imprisoned and executed the people he worked with, or banished them and confiscated their estates. It sounds a little like a Conservative party selection meeting. More seriously, I am sure that we are all very interested in the results of the archaeological investigation, and that the Scottish Government and the local authority will be more than pleased to promote any find that might be discovered.</p>

The Chancellor may well have been distracted by fighting back the forces of hell, while the Secretary of State may have been distracted by appealing to the forces of heaven.

 My hon. Friend's question must be a very popular one, Mr. Speaker! Amidst all the hullabaloo and excitement on the Opposition Benches, he asked about the important issue of supporting young people in Scotland through the recession. It is very important that politicians in Scotland do not take their eye off the ball in terms of the recession, but that has sometimes happened in the Scottish Parliament. Some people seem fixated with the constitution, at the expense of dealing with the recession. When we talk about over 230,000 more people being in work in Scotland, that is not just a large figure, but it tells of an enormous number of families whose lives have been transformed. It is the equivalent of the entire population of the city of Aberdeen being in work today who were out of work during the previous Government's time.</p>

went into that hospital-some with relatively straightforward ailments-and ended up dying because of the way they were mistreated. Talking to the relatives, as many of us in this House have done, is absolutely heartbreaking. Does the Prime Minister understand that these victims will never be content with an inquiry that was conducted in private, behind closed doors and without any public hearings? Does he understand their clamour for a public inquiry?</p>

 Let me say, first of all, that we understand both the sadness and the sorrow of all the relatives who lost their loved ones in the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. We know that every single one of those cases where relatives have doubts or questions are now being investigated individually. I understand that more than 300 cases are being investigated and every one of the families deserves to have the answers that are necessary. That is the first form of inquiry that is being done.</p>

What happened in this hospital was completely unacceptable. What happened was a management failure in the hospital. When it comes to accident and emergency, I am shocked not only to read the stories but to find that where there should have been four consultants, there was only one, and that where there should have been 55 nurses, there were only 37. This is a failure in management that has to be dealt with. I am grateful to the Secretary of State for Health for bringing forward a series of recommendations including a recommendation that where management fails, just as with doctors, we should be able to strike off from a list those managers who are not acceptable to health authorities.</p>

 I am grateful for that answer, but is not one of the tragedies of Stafford the fact that people were dying because of bad practice-not just bad management, but bad clinical practice and an over-adherence to processes-year after year. Death rates at the hospital were far too high and were out of line from 2005, yet the Healthcare Commission started investigating only in 2008.

Currently, 94.1 per cent. of patients see a cancer specialist within two weeks.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has taken a very keen interest in how we can make progress against cancer in our country. The truth is that if people get early screening and diagnosis, there is a 90 per cent.-plus chance of survival from breast cancer and other forms of cancer such as bowel cancer. That is why we are so keen that everybody who is worried can see a specialist and get a diagnosis as quickly as possible. That is what will save lives.</p>

Does the Prime Minister agree that nearly everyone in this country supports our troops, but that a sizeable proportion of the population are at least sceptical of our role in Afghanistan?

 I share the sympathies that the hon. Gentleman expresses to the family of his constituent who tragically lost his life. I share also with the hon.

I repeat that the majority of the serious terrorist plots that have been discovered in Britain and would threaten the lives of people in Britain come from the Afghanistan-Pakistan area. In other words, they do not come from plots within Britain or Europe. They are organised from the Afghanistan-Pakistan area, and that is why we are in Afghanistan-to prevent al-Qaeda running Afghanistan through a Government who would be run by the Taliban themselves.</p>

As he knows, large numbers of previously terrorist organisations have decommissioned their weapons and announced that they are ceasing violence. Two organisations have not done that, and pressure must be brought to bear upon them. The way we show terrorist organisations that we will have no truck with their violence is by building up the strength of the political and democratic process in Northern Ireland. That is why I urge all parties-parties in this House and in the Northern Ireland Assembly-to support the agreement that will mean the devolution of policing and justice and the end to a process of constitutional conflict over many years in Northern Ireland.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="100224-0004.htm_para1"><a name="10022460000176">Until the late 1960s, successive UK Governments had over a long period of time supported child migration schemes. They involved children as young as three being transported from Britain to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and Zimbabwe. The hope was that those children, who were aged between three and 14, would have the chance to forge a better life overseas, but the schemes proved to be misguided. In too many cases, vulnerable children suffered unrelenting hardship and their families left behind were devastated. They were sent mostly without the consent of their mother or father. They were cruelly lied to and told that they were orphans and that their parents were dead, when in fact they were still alive. Some were separated from their brothers and sisters, never to see one another again. Names and birthdays were deliberately changed so that it would be impossible for families to reunite. Many parents did not know that their children had been sent out of this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="100224-0004.htm_para2"><a name="10022460000177">The former child migrants say they feel that this practice was less transportation and more deportation-a deportation of innocent young lives. When they arrived overseas, all alone in the world, many of our most vulnerable children endured the harshest of conditions, neglect and abuse in the often cold and brutal institutions that received them. Those children were robbed of their childhood, the most precious years of their life. As people know, the pain of a lost childhood can last a lifetime. Some still bear the marks of abuse; all still live with the consequences of rejection. Their wounds will never fully heal, and for too long the survivors have been all but ignored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="100224-0004.htm_para3"><a name="10022460000178">When I was first made aware of this wholly unacceptable practice, I wrote to the Prime Minister of Australia to urge that together, we do more to acknowledge the experiences of former child migrants and see what we could achieve. It is right that today we recognise the human cost associated with this shameful episode of history and this failure in the first duty of a nation, which is to protect its children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="100224-0004.htm_para4"><a name="10022460000179">Shortly, I shall be meeting a number of former child migrants here in the Palace of Westminster to listen first-hand to their experiences, and as Prime Minister, I will be apologising on behalf of our nation. To all those former child migrants and their families, to those here with us today and those across the world-to each and every one-I say today that we are truly sorry. They were let down. We are sorry that they were allowed to be sent away at the time they were most vulnerable. We are sorry that instead of caring for them, this country turned its back, and we are sorry that the voices of these children were not always heard and their cries for help not always heeded. We are sorry that it has taken so long for this important day to come, and for the full and unconditional apology that is justly deserved to be given.</p>

I am sure that other members of the Health Committee will join me in paying particular tribute to David Hinchliffe, the former Member for Wakefield and former Chair of the Committee. He became almost obsessed by the grotesque injustice of these events and, at one point, persuaded me as Health Secretary to sign over some money to help to fund the Child Migrants Trust so that it was better able to go about its task.

 I was one of the members of the Health Committee who visited Australia and New Zealand. I have been a GP for many years and I think that I have heard most stories, but never have I heard such harrowing tales of distress and loss as I heard from those brave migrants. I wish to place on record my tribute to those very, very brave people who were able to open their hearts to the Committee. We heard tales that I hope never to have to listen to again of abuse perpetrated by organisations whose job it was to protect children, but clearly failed to do so. I also wish to place on record my thanks to my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson). He was the first Secretary of State to take this situation seriously and, as he has already modestly said, to find money to allow some of these migrants to meet their families and pick up some of the threads that they had so cruelly taken away from them.</p>

Thankfully, we saw that off. At one stage, I had to tell officials that I would resign rather than allow that to happen, so I welcome the extra funding pledged by the Prime Minister.

that, when people say, "It's better for the child", it is quite difficult to question the injustice. Sadly, many things similar to the child migrant programme, albeit on a smaller scale, continue today, and families are emigrating from this country to escape the family courts.

 My constituent, Pat Hewkin, who sadly died last year, lost her younger brother when she was six when child migrants were sent to Australia. I was honoured to be there when her brother came over for the first time and they were reconciled. I saw the joy, the sadness and the horror of their having to tell their stories, but it was absolutely wonderful to see how they were reconciled and able to meet each other-thanks to the work of the Child Migrants Trust and Margaret Humphreys. Pat was also able to go over and visit him in Australia.

Recently, many of them have come forward and had difficulty being received and believed.

<p><a name="st_o140"><a name="10022460000229"><a name="100224-0005.htm_spmin9"><a name="10022460000735"><b>The Secretary of State for Health (Andy Burnham):</b>
 With permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a statement on the report of the independent inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, which I am publishing today. Copies have been placed in the Vote Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para0"><a name="10022460000230">In July last year, I commissioned Robert Francis QC to conduct this inquiry. I asked him to establish what went wrong at Stafford hospital and why; what lessons can be learned; and what further action is needed to ensure the trust is delivering a sustainably good service to its local population. In particular, I asked his inquiry to focus on listening to patients and their families. I said at the time that the full impact of what happened at Stafford hospital would be understood-particularly in the NHS at local and national level-only when we heard clearly the voices and experiences of those most affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para1"><a name="10022460000231">The Francis report fulfils all those aims. I wish to thank Robert Francis for his thorough report, and the painstaking way in which he has conducted this investigation. Over 900 pages and two volumes, his report lays bare a dysfunctional organisation at every level and appalling failures of basic care over the period between 2005 and March 2009. The report confirms the severity of the then Healthcare Commission's assessment of the trust in March 2009. In his covering letter to me with the report, Robert Francis says:</p>
<a name="100224-0005.htm_brev0"><a name="10022460000531"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The overwhelming number of accounts given by those affected should surely put to rest the views, still harboured by some, that the Healthcare Commission's report painted an unfair picture of how the Trust was performing. There can no longer be any excuse for denying the enormity of what has occurred."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para2"><a name="10022460000232">Let me be clear: the care provided was totally unacceptable and a fundamental breach of the values of the NHS. Since March last year the Government's first priority has been to help the trust to take immediate steps to improve patient safety, care standards and public confidence. Last July a new chair and chief executive were appointed and, with a new board and senior team, they are making progress, as confirmed by the Care Quality Commission's three and six-month reviews. However, as their local hospital hits the news again today, I appreciate that doubts about safety will be in the minds of people in Stafford. In advance of this statement, I therefore asked the Care Quality Commission for its latest assessment of both the Mid Staffs trust and the wider NHS. I will place a copy of its letter in the Library. The Care Quality Commission confirms that the trust is safe to provide services, although further improvements are still needed, and says that it does not believe that there is any other hospital in England with problems on the scale or of the magnitude seen at Mid Staffs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para3"><a name="10022460000233">There have been many calls for a full public inquiry into events at the trust and the wider regulatory system. When I came into this job I gave those calls very careful consideration. In particular, I spoke to the four Members whose constituencies are served by the trust. It was clear to me that a further process of inquiry was needed to establish the full picture and to help the healing process. However, I had to balance that with not distracting the trust from the overriding need to make immediate  <br>

improvements in patient care. It was that consideration which led me to establish the inquiry in the form that it has taken, rather than as a full public inquiry. I did not believe that a lengthy, adversarial inquiry would be in the best interests of health care in Staffordshire. The chairman was able to ask me for further powers if he felt they were needed, but he did not do so, and I believe that his report supports the approach that we have taken. He concludes:</p>
<a name="100224-0005.htm_brev1"><a name="10022460000532"><ul><p class="tabletext">"I am confident that many of the witnesses who have assisted the Inquiry by written or oral evidence would not have done so had the Inquiry been conducted in public."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para4"><a name="10022460000234">More than 900 members of the public and 82 current and former members of staff contacted the inquiry directly or indirectly, and 113 witnesses gave oral evidence. That evidence revealed an organisation with a culture</p>
<a name="100224-0005.htm_brev2"><a name="10022460000533"><ul><p class="tabletext">"not conducive to providing good care for patients or a supportive working environment for staff".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para5"><a name="10022460000235">The board did not consider patient complaints, clinical governance or quality at its meetings. Meetings were held in private, and Robert Francis describes the organisation as working in isolation from the wider NHS community and as having a closed culture. As he has said today, the board</p>
<a name="100224-0005.htm_brev3"><a name="10022460000534"><ul><p class="tabletext">"lost sight of its fundamental responsibility to provide safe care."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para6"><a name="10022460000236">That dysfunctionality extended to the way targets were managed in the trust and the failure to put in place adequate staffing levels to provide safe patient care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para7"><a name="10022460000237">The management of the trust cut staffing to dangerously low levels, at one point leaving A and E with a third fewer nurses than were needed to provide safe care. A work force review in March 2008 disclosed that the trust needed to increase its nursing establishment by 120 whole-time equivalents. There was an intimidating and bullying management style. Among staff there were failures of professional standards and clinical leadership. Some staff were praised, but the report finds a "lack of compassion" and an "uncaring attitude" among others. Time and again throughout the report, there are unacceptable examples of poor care, neglect and disregard for patients' dignity. At times, as Robert Francis says, that could be described as rudeness, hostility or even abuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para8"><a name="10022460000238">The trust has already taken disciplinary action to hold individuals to account. The trust and the professional regulatory bodies, the General Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Council, are investigating a number of clinical staff potentially implicated by those events. Today I have written to the chairs of both bodies to ask them to consider the report in detail and work with the trust to determine whether further action is needed against any individuals. I have asked for their response by 12 March.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para9"><a name="10022460000239">In total, Robert Francis makes 18 recommendations. Together with the new board of the trust, the Government accept all the recommendations in full. I will take the four recommendations that apply to my Department in turn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para10"><a name="10022460000240">First, Robert Francis recommends that I consider steps to improve accountability among executive and non-executive directors of trusts. The board that presided over the failings at Mid Staffs has been replaced, and other managerial staff have been suspended. However, it is a long-standing anomaly in the NHS that the robust professional regulatory system for clinicians is  <br>

<notus-date day="24" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>24 Feb 2010 : Column 311</b><br>
not matched by a similar scheme for managers and non-executive directors. We must end the situation where a senior NHS manager who has failed in one job can simply move to another elsewhere. That is not acceptable to the public and not conducive to promoting accountability and high professional standards, so today I am announcing that I will consult on a new system of professional accreditation for senior NHS managers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para11"><a name="10022460000241">Secondly, Robert Francis asks me to consider asking Monitor to de-authorise Mid Staffs as a foundation trust. The report makes it clear that Mid Staffordshire has not been deserving of the foundation trust status that it has held for the past two years. At the same time as setting up the inquiry, I proposed to create a new power for Monitor to de-authorise foundation trusts, to make it clear that this status has to be continually earned and is not a one-way ticket. That provision was subsequently endorsed by this House. I can tell the House today that I accept Robert Francis's recommendation to consider asking Monitor to de-authorise Mid Staffs. My strong view, in the light of the report and the support that the trust is likely to need in the medium and long term, is that I will ask Monitor to consider de-authorising when the powers come into effect in the coming months. I will therefore ask the CQC, Monitor and others to give me their views of the trust's long-term clinical and financial prospects, and I will consider initiating the process in the light of their responses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para12"><a name="10022460000242">Thirdly, Robert Francis asks me to review how comparative mortality statistics are compiled, as well as the methodologies that underpin them, to improve public confidence in and understanding of them. One of the principal reasons why the Healthcare Commission launched its review in 2008 was that it was not satisfied with the trust's explanation of its high hospital standardised mortality ratio. The inquiry has consulted a range of experts on the issue, and Robert Francis concludes:</p>
<a name="100224-0005.htm_brev4"><a name="10022460000535"><ul><p class="tabletext">"it is in my view misleading and a potential misuse of the figures to extrapolate from them a conclusion that any particular number or range of numbers of deaths were caused or contributed to by inadequate care".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para13"><a name="10022460000243">However, as he points out, there is no shared methodology for HSMRs, nor any clear account of how they should be used and interpreted. The result is confusion for patients and the public. I therefore welcome and accept the recommendation to establish an independent working group to examine and report on the methodologies in use. The NHS medical director, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, has already established that group, which includes the key parties involved in developing and using HSMRs, as well as leading academics and others. The group has committed to developing a single HSMR for the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para14"><a name="10022460000244">Fourthly, the report calls for a further independent examination of all the commissioning, supervisory and regulatory bodies, in relation to their monitoring role at Stafford, with the objective of learning lessons about how failing hospitals are identified. I accept that recommendation, and can tell the House that Robert Francis has agreed to chair the further inquiry. We are publishing draft terms of reference today, and we welcome views on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para15"><a name="10022460000245">In addition to accepting all the report's recommendations, there are further steps that I will now take to learn the lessons of this and prevent a repeat. First, let me make  <br>

<notus-date day="24" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>24 Feb 2010 : Column 312</b><br>
clear today to all foundation trust boards my strong presumption that their meetings should be held in public and that governors should have access to all papers in the trust. The decision of the board at Mid Staffs to hold more meetings in private on achieving FT status is a direct contradiction of what this House intended when it passed the original foundation trust legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para16"><a name="10022460000246">Secondly, I am today accepting the National Quality Board's recommendations to improve early warning systems in the NHS, and I am publishing its report today. Thirdly, a group has been established to advise me on updating whistleblowing guidance. Statutory protection for whistleblowers is enshrined in the NHS constitution, but events at Stafford hospital reveal the need to ensure that staff feel able to exercise that right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para17"><a name="10022460000247">Fourthly, I want to see a much greater focus in the NHS on measuring patient satisfaction and staff satisfaction-key indicators of good quality care. In December, I announced that a growing proportion of a hospital's income will be linked to patient satisfaction, rising to 10 per cent. of its payments over time. Fifthly, I brought forward the new system of provider registration in the NHS to ensure essential levels of safety and quality. The CQC has already announced today its intention to register Mid Staffs, although it will place conditions where further improvement is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="100224-0005.htm_para18"><a name="10022460000248">In conclusion, the Francis report delivers a damning verdict on a dysfunctional organisation. It was principally a local failure, but I accept that there are national lessons to be learned-and they will be. Last year, the Prime Minister apologised to the people of Staffordshire. On behalf of the Government and the NHS, I repeat that apology again today. They were badly let down. I pay tribute to the people who had the courage to come forward and tell their stories and to expose the failures of the past, in order that they could protect others in the future. Robert Francis said that many of the patients who gave evidence to the inquiry</p>

They do so because they want it to be better. I want their voices to be heard loudly and clearly in this trust, and across the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para1"><a name="10022460000250">Today, Sir David Nicholson has written to every NHS chief executive and chair, urging them to read this report and to review their standards, governance and performance in the light of it. When the NHS fails-as it did the people of Staffordshire-it is right to confront it with its failings. At times, there is a tendency in the NHS to push complaints away. I believe very strongly that it is only by facing up to failure-and by holding a mirror up to the NHS-that we can ensure that it is a learning organisation and prevent any repeat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para2"><a name="10022460000251">Since events at Stafford, Lord Darzi's next stage review has established a major drive to build an NHS that places a relentless focus on quality. For the vast majority of patients, the NHS provides a good standard of care. The CQC's latest patient survey showed that 93 per cent. of patients rated their overall care as good or excellent. When things go wrong, however, we must face up to them and do everything in our power to ensure that such events can never happen again. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for making an oral statement today, and for giving me advance sight of it. I want, once again, to express our deepest sympathies to the patients who suffered and to the relatives who saw them suffer. My right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) and I have had occasion to talk to those relatives in Stafford, and the stories of their experiences were harrowing. Today's report, the second volume in particular, sets out the most compelling-indeed, horrific-character of many of the sufferings of the patients and their relatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para3"><a name="10022460000253">I pay tribute to the work of Julie Bailey and Cure the NHS, and to their determination and persistence in holding the hospital trust and the Government to account for their failures in relation to this hospital, and in securing this further investigation. The Secretary of State will recall that, when the Healthcare Commission published its first report, his predecessor instituted an internal Department of Health inquiry under Dr. Colin-Thomé and another under Professor Sir George Alberti. We told the Government then that that would not meet the need of the people of Stafford for a clear investigation in public into what had happened. When the Secretary of State announced this inquiry by Robert Francis, we told him again that it would not achieve that aim. This is the fourth report, and none of them has diminished the need for a public inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005, in which evidence can be taken in public and under oath. We can combat a culture of secrecy and bullying only by ensuring the fullest openness and transparency in any investigation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para4"><a name="10022460000254">The whole House will, none the less, be grateful to Robert Francis for fulfilling his brief in a thorough and objective manner. We find no fault with his work, but we do object to Ministers setting up report after report with constrained terms of reference that are designed more to focus on local management than to get to the full truth and the full context of the tragedy at Stafford hospital by analysing in addition the failure of national and regional scrutiny and of NHS performance management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para5"><a name="10022460000255">In my evidence to Robert Francis, I urged him to recommend a further investigation into the role of the external monitoring and performance management agencies, and I am glad that he has taken this advice and made that recommendation today. Such a further investigation is essential, because many of the serious questions that we and the relatives of those who died have been asking the Government for the past year remain unanswered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para6"><a name="10022460000256">Why did the primary care trust fail to ensure that standards were up to scratch when it commissioned services from the hospital? Why did the strategic health authority, which was charged with performance management of the hospital when it was an NHS trust, fail so abjectly in that task? Why did the Department of Health simply wave through the foundation trust application at the very time that clinical standards were so poor? Why did it take so long for the scrutiny by the inspectorate to establish that the high mortality rates were occurring, and to undertake an investigation into them? What are the problems with national policy and decision making on patient and public involvement that resulted in people failing to listen to patients raising their concerns in Stafford? And what are the problems with the  <br>

whistleblowing procedures and practices in the national health service that prevented or inhibited front-line staff from speaking out about poor standards of care?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para7"><a name="10022460000257">The Francis report provides a powerful analysis of the impact of the Government's top-down targets on patient care at Stafford hospital. When the scandal was laid bare by the Healthcare Commission last March, the then Minister of State, the right hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw), said that</p>
<a name="100224-0006.htm_brev1"><a name="10022460000537"><ul><p class="tabletext">"this was not a problem about targets".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para8"><a name="10022460000258">However, the Francis report-on page 165-states:</p>
<a name="100224-0006.htm_brev2"><a name="10022460000538"><ul><p class="tabletext">"This evidence satisfies me that there was an atmosphere in which front-line staff and managers were led to believe that if the targets were not met they would be in danger of losing their jobs. There was an atmosphere which led to decisions being made under pressure about patients, decisions that had nothing to do with patient welfare. As will be seen, the pressure to meet the waiting target was sometimes detrimental to good care in A&amp;E."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para9"><a name="10022460000259">Will the Secretary of State now acknowledge that Ministers were wrong to deny that targets were part of the problem at Stafford, and that they are wrong now to maintain that they are not the issue? Will he therefore move to abolish top-down political targets, so that the NHS can focus on patient safety and quality of care as an absolute priority?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para10"><a name="10022460000260">In this Parliament alone, I have had to stand at this Dispatch Box on four occasions to respond to issues of failing hospitals: Stoke Mandeville in 2006; Maidstone in 2007; Mid Staffordshire last March, and again today; and Basildon and Thurrock in December. Each time, Ministers have insisted that these are isolated cases and blamed local management principally, but the themes have become too frequent and too familiar for this simply to be a coincidence: waiting time targets prioritised over patient care; clinical priorities distorted by Government targets; a focus on financial issues at the expense of patient care; senior management at board and strategic health authority level putting targets and policy processes ahead of a focus on quality care for patients; primary care trusts focused on cost and volume, and not on quality; and front-line staff finding their attempts to voice concerns going unheard or, even worse, suppressed. That is not good enough. We cannot go on like this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para11"><a name="10022460000261">We must be committed to establishing a full public inquiry into the tragedy at Mid Staffs. It must be an inquiry with a remit broad enough to ensure that no stone remains unturned and no lesson is overlooked. That would restore confidence among the public in and around Stafford. We will learn the lessons across the NHS, and we must do so up to and including the Department of Health. Action must be taken on the results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para12"><a name="10022460000262">For our part, we would abolish top-down political targets and the pointless bureaucracy that surrounds them. Instead, we would focus relentlessly on the results for patients. We will make patient experience and outcomes central to accountability. We will ensure that the quality imperative drives NHS services so that when complaints are made, the inspectorate receives, understands and acts on them. We will make quality and safety the central drivers of NHS performance and we will see through the changes in leadership, strategy and reform in the NHS that will give the public the confidence that when they go to hospital, they are there to be cared for and to be treated-and never to be harmed.</p>

 Order. This is an extremely important and sensitive matter. Nevertheless, both the Secretary of State's statement and the initial response from the shadow Secretary of State have exceeded the time allowed for such exchanges, so I would ask the Secretary of State to provide economical replies and for others to take note in order that we can all make some progress.</p>

<p><a name="st_o144"><a name="10022460000265"><a name="100224-0006.htm_spnew3"><a name="10022460000739"><b>Andy Burnham:</b>
 Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The shadow Health Secretary began by extending his deepest sympathies to the patients and families affected, and I am sure that that will be echoed across the whole House and across the country. Today is another difficult day for those people, but we hope that this report will allow their voices to be heard at least more clearly than they have been hitherto.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para13"><a name="10022460000266">The hon. Gentleman paid tribute to the work of Cure the NHS, which campaigned to have the events at Stafford hospital thoroughly investigated, and I believe that the report published today meets that requirement for a thorough investigation into those events. He asked whether the initial inquiries were internal to the Department of Health and he called for an independent inquiry, but that is the inquiry that I commissioned. As I said in my statement, when I came to this Department, I believed that a further process of independent inquiry was necessary. I commissioned it; I set it up; and I will deal with what it tells me today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para14"><a name="10022460000267">I do not think it is possible to read the Francis report and conclude that it does not tell the full truth or reveal the whole picture of what happened at the hospital. We now move forward from the inquiry to consider the actions of the regulatory and supervisory bodies. I have made it clear to Robert Francis that, should he need further powers to conduct that part of his work, he can come back to me and I will consider the request.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para15"><a name="10022460000268">I draw the shadow Health Secretary's attention to the draft terms of reference issued today, which state:</p>
<a name="100224-0006.htm_brev3"><a name="10022460000539"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The Government's presumption is that the inquiry will be held in public, but this decision is a matter for the Chair."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para16"><a name="10022460000269">I would welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments on those draft terms of reference, but I believe that they meet the tests that he put before us a few moments ago. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para17"><a name="10022460000270">The hon. Gentleman also asked about the PCT, the SHA and the Department of Health. He is quite right to do so: he is quite right to ask questions about those bodies, their role in what happened and why things were not spotted sooner. That is precisely why we are setting up the second stage of the inquiry-so that those searching questions can be asked of those organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para18"><a name="10022460000271">The hon. Gentleman asked me about targets, suggesting that they were the problem. Let me quote the Francis report:</p>
<a name="100224-0006.htm_brev4"><a name="10022460000540"><ul><p class="tabletext">"As will be seen, the pressure to meet the waiting target was sometimes detrimental to good care in the organisation. This is inconsistent with the guidance about targets published by the Department of Health. It is vital that this target must not in any way jeopardise the quality of care offered to patients."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para19"><a name="10022460000272">If the hon. Gentleman reads the Francis report in full, as I am sure he will, he will see that the failure of the trust was the implementation of targets within it, and, indeed, the failure to provide adequate staffing levels on the wards to ensure that care could be delivered safely and meet the standards that other trusts around the country are able to meet. That is the conclusion I draw from the inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para20"><a name="10022460000273">The hon. Gentleman asked what steps we can take to ensure that this does not happen elsewhere in the NHS. With an organisation on the scale of the NHS, I am sure that he and I would accept that things will go wrong and problems will occur. The right thing to do is to face up to them and take action to prevent them happening again. In this particular case, I believe that we have faced up to the enormity of what happened at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. It has been laid bare today in a very detailed report of more than 900 pages. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I take my responsibility to act on the report's findings with great seriousness. That is precisely what I will do.</p>

<p><a name="st_o145"><a name="10022460000274"><a name="100224-0006.htm_spnew4"><a name="10022460000740"><b>Norman Lamb (North Norfolk) (LD):</b>
 I thank the Secretary of State for early sight of his statement. This is an utterly shocking scandal, which is a stain on the good name of the NHS. It demonstrates again horrifying evidence of patient neglect, which should never feature in the national health service. I welcome the recognition in the statement that there are national lessons to be learned, but the focus of the inquiry was none the less on this particular trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para21"><a name="10022460000275">It seems to me that the inquiry was not designed to ensure that the full wider lessons could be learned. It was not designed to hold anyone to account, which it specifically says, as the terms of reference did not permit investigation into the role of any of the external agencies. It was also held in private. The inquiry was not able to consider the reports of any of the individual cases through a separate process because they were not ready in time. The report itself confirms that disappointing numbers of staff came forward to give evidence. That is not good enough. It is not the fault of the inquiry, but the fault of the process created by the Government. The bottom line is that the report will not satisfy the families of those who lost their lives and it will not bring an end to demands for a full public inquiry. I also pay tribute to the work of Julie Bailey and the organisation Cure the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para22"><a name="10022460000276">Do not the findings reinforce the need to learn wider lessons about the causes of the failures that took place in the hospital: the focus on process at the expense of outcomes; the failure to listen to those who receive care; staff disengaged from the process of management; insufficient attention to the maintenance of professional standards; a weak professional voice in management decisions; abuse of vulnerable elderly people; and a lack of transparency? The key point is that none of those findings can be said to be unique to this particular trust. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) highlighted other failing hospitals that the House has debated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para23"><a name="10022460000277">There is surely a need for a full public inquiry, and it should surely first consider the pay-off to the chief executive and the fact that people are too often rewarded for failure. This chief executive received £400,000. I have a copy of the private investigation into his actions. Surely it should be published in full-it is heavily redacted, which amounts to a cover-up of the full findings of the investigation. It points to a case for disciplinary action, yet there was a very substantial pay-off to this chief executive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para24"><a name="10022460000278">A public inquiry should also look at the role of targets. The statement rightly said that blaming targets in their entirety would let management off the hook,  <br>

but not looking at targets lets the Government off the hook, given that targets played a part in the failures of this hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para25"><a name="10022460000279">It is also essential to look fully at the role of regulation. I am pleased that there will be a further inquiry into that, but it should surely be held in public and should look at the complex web of regulation that we have created. The fact that we have five different national organisations with some responsibility for patient safety has resulted in no one taking proper responsibility for it. In Basildon, for example, there were 21 visits by seven different organisations in the year before the final report emerged. We need to look at the devastating report into the role and failure of regulation that was commissioned by the NHS Confederation last summer. It showed that we have ended up with paper safety rather than real patient safety and a tick-box culture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para26"><a name="10022460000280">A public inquiry should also look at the process for securing foundation trust status, which provided a false reassurance to people that the hospital was performing to a high standard. Finally, do we not owe it to the families of those who have lost their lives to have a full examination in public of the wider lessons that need to be learned from this scandal?</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman that this is a shocking report that damages the name of the national health service. He asked why the report did not allow consideration of wider national issues, but he will have seen that the report does comment on national lessons to be learned. There were four recommendations in the report, which I spelled out in my statement when I responded to those points. I did agree with the chairman that he could comment on what he wanted to comment on. However, we wanted the inquiry to focus primarily on the trust and the voices of the patients affected by the terrible events in the trust, so that we could get to the bottom of the failings and allow the trust to move on-which is, I believe, what we must do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para27"><a name="10022460000283">I wanted to get to the bottom of events as quickly as I practically could. I was also anxious that the trust should not be debilitated by a protracted inquiry that would divert it from its main job. I believe that we have got to the bottom of what happened locally; I now want the trust to move forward, and I believe that it is moving forward under the leadership of the new chair and chief executive. However, I accept Robert Francis's recommendation that we look more closely at the bodies that have a supervisory, regulatory and commissioning role in relation to Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. As the hon. Gentleman will know, we have already embarked on that task. David Colin-Thomé has done some work in examining the role of the primary care trust, but we must now put that work on a proper footing-knowing what we know from the first inquiry-so that we can learn the lessons at a national level, and I can assure the hon. Gentleman today that that is what we will do.</p>

Gentleman said that the failings were not unique to this particular trust, and rightly observed that what went wrong in this instance was caused by a focus on process rather than on people. The words "focus on process" were used by Robert Francis, and they are at the heart of what went wrong. There was a failure to understand and respond to the public about what matters,   <br>

and to see each patient as an individual deserving of the very highest standard of care-the care that we would all want our own families to receive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para29"><a name="10022460000285">The hon. Gentleman was right to say that the failings described in the report are not unique to the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, but it must also be said that the scale on which they occurred make the events in that trust unique. I sought an assurance from the Care Quality Commission that no other NHS trust exhibits problems on the scale of those found at Mid Staffordshire, and it gave me that assurance today, but let me also assure the hon. Gentleman that we remain constantly vigilant, and will ensure that every possible action is taken to deal with poor performance and poor quality in the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para30"><a name="10022460000286">The hon. Gentleman asked about the Garland report on the former chief executive of the trust. I understand that he did not receive £400,000, but received his notice period and no more than his contractual entitlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para31"><a name="10022460000287">The hon. Gentleman also asked about targets. The suggestion is that targets are there to distract people in the NHS from patient care, but they are essentially about the basic minimum that every person who arrives at the door of the NHS should be able to expect. They are fundamentally about people and the quality of care that should be given to every single person, regardless of their background or what they bring to the door of the NHS. In this case, the trust grotesquely failed to manage the pressure involved in delivering that basic standard of care to every person who arrives at the door of the NHS, which is what so many other trusts throughout the country manage to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para32"><a name="10022460000288">Let me remind the hon. Gentleman what happened before there were targets for accident and emergency departments. The previous Government, in fact, suggested a four-hour target because there was chaos in A and E departments in the early and mid-1990s, and the present Government retained that target because basic minimum standards must be available to every patient who arrives at the door of an accident and emergency department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="100224-0006.htm_para33"><a name="10022460000289">The hon. Gentleman asked for a proper safety structure rather than "paper safety". I can tell him that I take my responsibilities in respect of the new registration process extremely seriously. He will know that I have expedited the introduction of that system, which I believe directly responds to the concern that he has expressed.</p>

May I ask him to look again at the recommendations in the Health Committee's report on patient safety? We suggested that there should be a system of whistleblowing like the one in New Zealand, which seems to be far more efficient and provide people with far more access. As my right hon. Friend pointed out in his statement, people in the NHS do not feel that they are able to blow whistles in an appropriate manner, even when there are horror stories such as those about what was happening to patients in Stafford hospital.</p>

As the Prime Minister said earlier, individuals can make their complaints directly through a process of investigation. As for the fundamental question of whether it was right to hold a private inquiry, I have two points to make. I have to balance the need to ensure that the hon. Gentleman's local trust takes immediate steps to improve the quality of care that it provides for his constituents. I see that as my fundamental duty: above all else, I must help people today in the quality of care they receive. I accept that others may not agree, but it was my judgment that an inquiry of this nature was more likely to get to the bottom of the issues more quickly, so that the trust could focus on the job of improving patient care. I also refer the hon. Gentleman to Robert Francis's comment that he believed he received more from the public and staff because of the nature of this inquiry. The same level of privacy is clearly not justified in a national inquiry, however, which is why I say in the terms of reference that the presumption is that it should be conducted in public.</p>

 First, may I congratulate Cure the NHS on its work? I am delighted that the Secretary of State is determined to learn the lessons from Stafford so that the whole NHS can benefit. It is absolutely right that hospital trust boards must always meet in public. It is also right that the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust should be de-authorised, but will the Secretary of State ensure that hospital managers do not profit from their failures and that other hospitals looking to apply for trust status, such as the University hospital of North Staffordshire, do not make the same mistakes as Stafford by putting financial issues and staffing levels before patient safety?</p>

 May I echo my hon. Friend's comments about Cure the NHS? Although this process is, of course, very difficult for all those affected at the local level, I can say without fear of contradiction today that the actions that it has taken are now leading to changes in the national health service that will prevent a repeat situation from arising either locally or elsewhere. A number of changes that will benefit patients everywhere have already been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="100224-0007.htm_para6"><a name="10022460000307">I had to reread the passage in the report that stated that on receiving foundation trust status, the trust began holding more meetings in private, because that beggars belief. As anybody who debated the FT legislation knows, that fundamentally contradicts the vision for foundation trust status. I repeat to all foundation trusts today that we expect meetings to be held in public wherever possible. I also very much hear what my hon. Friend says about the importance of not jeopardising the quality of patient care. Patient safety is the paramount and overriding priority of every NHS hospital, and of every NHS organisation. Everything else comes second to that.</p>

 In thanking the Secretary of State and the Minister of State, the right hon. and learned Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien), for their unfailing courtesy in keeping Staffordshire Members informed, may I ask the Secretary of State to insist that the inquiry he has announced today be held in public, and to reflect upon the words of a widow who came to see me after having lost her husband, probably unnecessarily: what is crucial is that confidence and trust in the trust must be restored now, so that the area and the people the trust serves can look upon it with confidence and trust?</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman again for the manner in which he has helped us address these issues; his courtesy is always appreciated. I entirely agree that confidence is the key issue. This is another difficult day for the hospital, but I believe that from today the trust can begin to move forward, because we have now inquired fully and in depth at the local level. I believe the trust is making progress under Antony Sumara and Sir Stephen Moss; that is reflected in the report and in the reports that I hear locally from Stafford, and we need to do everything we possibly can to support them. There are 140 extra staff at the trust, and it has received about £4.5 million from the West Midlands strategic health authority. Support is going into the trust, therefore. We are considering whether we should initiate a process of de-authorisation, but we would only do so because we may be able to get more support more quickly to the trust, in order to build the confidence that the hon. Gentleman rightly calls for.</p>

 Even after four inquiries, it is still impossible not to be shocked by the record of failure of care in this case. We now know, beyond peradventure, what happened, and I think we know why it happened. What we do not yet know enough about is how it could have been allowed to happen. That is why there is a valid case for a fifth inquiry, into the regulatory structure, and I am glad the Secretary of State has announced that today. May I make one further point? There is one group of people who bear no responsibility for what happened: the patients. If we have one overriding obligation now, it is to make sure both that that hospital, which has failed them, pays for the errors of the past by being supported by the national health service, and that patient care in that hospital is as safe and effective as possible.</p>

 As a member of the medical profession, I was staggered and saddened by the low profile and lack of effectiveness of staff whistleblowers in Stafford. I therefore welcome the Secretary of State's promise to update whistleblowers guidance. The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 and the work of Public Concern at Work need far more publicity. Does the Secretary of State agree that we still need to consider extra measures to support whistleblowers, who are still terrified of going through the normal channels? That is the whole point of my private Member's Bill.</p>

I cannot say today that that culture exists in all parts of the NHS, but I can say unequivocally that that is the culture I want to see in every corner of our national health service.

 May I put a very simple point to my right hon. Friend? What clearly stands out from all this wealth of erudite and important words that we have heard in this House and everywhere else is that the hospital was terribly understaffed. If a company or any other organisation were so seriously understaffed, it would never get anywhere. I therefore have a suggestion. It involves one piece of paper, and I ask him not to resist it on that ground. In fact, such a piece of paper might already exist but have insufficient prominence. If we had one piece of paper on which hospitals had to list current staffing levels against the agreed requirement in the critical matter of doctors and nurses, we would all know whether or not there were sufficient staff to do the job. If such a piece of paper had been available, we could have avoided this whole situation.</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend that that is, in many ways, the main message that comes out of the report. I was shocked to read that the work force review of March 2008 found a shortage of 120 whole-time equivalents, as well as one consultant in A and E when there should have been four, and 37 nurses when there should have been 55. Herein lie many of the problems the trust faced. It simply had an inadequate work force to deal with what needed to be done on a daily basis. That led to intolerable pressure on the wards, which in turn led to unacceptable treatment of patients. It is absolutely clear to me that this is unacceptable. That is one of the main messages that comes out of the report-and indeed, Robert Francis describes the trust as chronically understaffed.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will know that action has been taken in respect of Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. He may not be aware that further steps are being taken against Tameside hospital NHS foundation trust in Greater Manchester. Where action needs to be taken in order to intervene, we are taking that action. I should repeat to him the view of the Care Quality Commission, which is that there is no evidence to suggest that problems of this magnitude are replicated elsewhere in the NHS. I also say to him that I am not complacent on these issues: how could one ever be? Since what happened in Bristol, we can say with some confidence that we have, with the support of those on the Opposition Benches, begun a process whereby we are shining a spotlight on data in the NHS that in times past simply were not available. A wealth of data are now available to inform the public about standards at any particular trust. Many of the data are available on the NHS Choices website, but they can be improved so as to build a better understanding and appreciation of the picture at any trust. The hospital standardised mortality ratio-the HSMR-is not, in and of itself, a verdict on a trust; it is a trigger in respect of whether further action is required. As we have said today, we need further understanding of that target and an improvement of its methodology so that it is clearly understood across the NHS.</p>

That was a lamentable performance by Monitor, which was supposed to look into all aspects of the situation and then make a recommendation to the Secretary of State.

 I do care about patient safety, and I say again that it is the overriding concern for every NHS organisation in the country, including NHS London. However, I would ask the hon. Lady to open her mind to the possibility that at times changes to hospital services are necessary to enhance standards of patient safety. The National Audit Office recently pushed Ministers on the reform of major trauma services, which implies a reconfiguration of hospital services. The lesson in the Mid Staffs case is that the trust was acting in isolation without sufficiently well developed clinical networks in its surrounding community. I say to the hon. Lady that sometimes patient safety may be enhanced, rather than diminished, by the reorganisation of services.</p>

 That is a very important piece of work, which is why I said in my statement that Professor Sir Bruce Keogh is already making progress on it. However, it is very important for the voices of the royal colleges, other professional bodies, and organisations across the health care world to be listened to in that work. When it is produced it will succeed only if it has support from, and is owned by, all those bodies.

The HSMRs are not, of themselves, evidence of failure-but they can provide a trigger for inquiry into whether standards are sufficiently high at any one hospital. I encourage him to continue to ask questions and to work with his local trust to ensure that standards are sufficiently robust at his local trust; that is exactly what I do with my local hospital.

 I beg to move,</p>
<a name="100224-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="10022460000541"><ul><p class="tabletext">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require public bodies to purchase only those seafood species and stocks that are demonstrably sustainable; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="100224-0008.htm_para1"><a name="10022460000332">I am delighted to introduce this Bill. Even as I speak, promising changes are afoot. A written answer to me that was published yesterday clearly put on the record the departmental fish procurement percentages, and I was pleased to see that the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs had-this is according to what I have read-refused to sign off the EU protocol on tuna because it was not sustainable enough. So, this Bill is appropriate at this time, if not prescient. I thank, in particular, Alex Jackson of Sustain for allowing me to introduce it, and all those Members-some 50 or more-who signed early-day motion 226 to draw attention to this important issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="100224-0008.htm_para2"><a name="10022460000333">No one can be in any doubt that the way in which we catch and consume fish on a global scale is of great importance given that it is devastating the biodiversity of our oceans and endangering some of our best loved fish species. Stopping the destruction will require action to change both how we catch fish and how we consume it. The Bill focuses on the crucial consumption side of that solution and outlines how Government, as a huge consumer of fish in the public sector, can lead by example in the purchase of sustainable seafood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="100224-0008.htm_para3"><a name="10022460000334">What is the problem? It is important to understand that fish stocks need careful management and that fisheries that are over-exploited can collapse suddenly, causing irreversible damage. Probably the most famous example of such a collapse occurred off the east coast of Newfoundland in 1992 when cod stocks vanished, the local industry evaporated and 40,000 people lost their jobs. To this day, the cod have not returned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="100224-0008.htm_para4"><a name="10022460000335">Data from the United Nations fisheries and aquaculture department paint a very bleak picture of the state of our oceans. On a global scale, it estimates that</p>
<a name="100224-0008.htm_brev1"><a name="10022460000542"><ul><p class="tabletext">"80 per cent. of the world fish stocks for which assessment information is available are reported as fully exploited or overexploited and, thus, requiring effective and precautionary management."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="100224-0008.htm_para5"><a name="10022460000336">In British waters, we face an urgent problem. In the north-east Atlantic, the majority of commercial stocks are fully exploited, over-exploited or depleted, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's fisheries and aquaculture department's report of 2005. British salmon stocks are considered to be fully or over-exploited and North sea plaice, cod and sole are considered to be outside safe biological limits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="100224-0008.htm_para6"><a name="10022460000337">The experts also tell us that the threat posed by climate change will only serve to exacerbate those problems. In 2005, the intergovernmental panel on climate change predicted that climate change will have a significant impact on the future abundance and distribution of fish stocks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="100224-0008.htm_para7"><a name="10022460000338">What will the Public Bodies (Procurement of Seafood) Bill do? It will help support the sustainability of global fish stocks and species by making it a legal requirement that public bodies in the UK can only buy fish that is  <br>

proven to be sustainable. It would do that by prohibiting the purchase in the public sector of fish from the Marine Conservation Society's "Fish to Avoid" list, which includes all fish in danger of over-exploitation. It would also require that all wild-caught fish purchased by the public sector should come from stocks that meet the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation's code of conduct for responsible fisheries, which includes fish that meets the need for Marine Stewardship Council sustainability certification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="100224-0008.htm_para8"><a name="10022460000339">The Bill would aim to achieve three important things. First, it would ensure that the Government spend public money on fish in a responsible way that acts to solve environmental problems rather than causing them. Each individual British taxpayer spends approximately £70 a year on public sector food. They need to know that their money is being spent by Government to support the marine ecosystem and protect the sustainability of popular fish species rather than putting them at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="100224-0008.htm_para9"><a name="10022460000340">Secondly, the public sector should lead by example in the food we buy and serve to educate through best practice. It is especially important that public bodies lead by example in the purchase of fish, because the issues surrounding the sustainability of seafood are complex and not generally well known by the public. The Bill would guarantee that the public sector generates greater awareness of the issue and would also demonstrate to those who eat and prepare public sector food what sustainable fish is and how it can be purchased. That is particularly important when we consider that the public sector serves more than 1 billion meals a year to consumers including nursery and school children, hospital patients, elderly people in care homes and members of the armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="100224-0008.htm_para10"><a name="10022460000341">Thirdly, the sheer purchasing power of Government has the capacity to drive the market for sustainable seafood, catalysing advances in the seafood industry. So, what about the public sector? The public sector is a big consumer of fish, but it is not an ethical consumer of fish. Sustain, the alliance for food and farming, estimates that each year the Government spend more  <br>

than £40 million a year on seafood in the public sector. At present, public sector organisations are not required to meet any legal standard for the fish that they buy. There is Government guidance, but no rules. In fact, the Government do not even require the public sector to meet the rules they introduced under the fish labelling regulations, through which retailers must clearly label the origin and species, including the method of production, for all fish and fillets sold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="100224-0008.htm_para11"><a name="10022460000342">As a result, the public sector buys fish species that include some of the most vulnerable stocks in the world. The Ministry of Justice, for example, spends £1.25 million a year on fish and more than one 10th of that total is spent on haddock, without any regard to its sustainability. That is a huge cause for concern because, according to the Marine Conservation Society, some stocks of haddock are "unsustainable, overfished and vulnerable".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="100224-0008.htm_para12"><a name="10022460000343">The picture is not any better in hospitals, where tiger prawns, dogfish and swordfish-species which are often produced particularly unsustainably-are available to purchase from the big catering companies. Research compiled by Sustain showed that of 341 fish, seafood or fish-based sandwich filling products provided by the biggest supplier of food to the NHS, which trades using an NHS logo, only one is listed in its catalogue as certified by the Marine Stewardship Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="100224-0008.htm_para13"><a name="10022460000344">There can be little doubt that the future of popular global fish species lies precariously in the balance. The Bill provides a clear legal framework that would ensure that the millions of pounds of public money spent on seafood each and every year is invested in a way that would transform the long-term sustainability of seafood species throughout the world.</p>

The decarbonisation of the electricity sector is central to achieving our statutory goal of reducing carbon emissions by 80 per cent. by 2050. The low carbon transition plan, which was published last July, set out our plans for getting about 40 per cent. of our electricity supplies from low carbon sources by 2020.

Coal-fired power stations generate about 30 per cent. of UK electricity and about 40 per cent. of global electricity. Tackling emissions from coal-fired power stations must therefore be a priority if we are to avert dangerous climate change while enabling countries to maintain energy security.</p>

 I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman understands that we have an energy mix and a privatised energy market. It will be up to the companies to decide what investment they make. What we endeavour to do in the Bill is make it possible and profitable for companies to invest in new coal. We believe that if it were not for the provisions of the Bill, we would not get the new coal-fired stations that we will need, because we will lose a third of existing coal-fired capacity by 2015.</p>

Ensuring that our policies deliver the carbon reductions that we need within the time frame that we need them is of critical importance if we are serious about tackling climate change. New clause 8 provides the means for Parliament to hold the Government to account for progress on these matters. It requires the Government to lay before Parliament, every three years, a report on progress towards the decarbonisation of the electricity sector including the decarbonisation of coal-fired power stations. The report will also include an assessment of the status of CCS technologies and progress towards demonstration at a commercial scale, and whether coal-fired power stations that have been consented to from 2020 can be expected to be fully CCS from the start.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that question. I know that he, too, takes a great interest in these matters. We certainly did consider having a shorter reporting period, but because there is quite a long way to go to make CCS operational at a commercial scale, the three-year period seems appropriate to us. That will mean that we will report in 2012 at the latest-just a couple of years from now-and in 2015 and 2018, coinciding with the review period. We think that that is appropriate, but of course hon.

 Unfortunately, I do not have to hand the document to which the hon. Gentleman is referring. Although my understanding is that the facility concerned is not a coal plant that generates electricity, which is what this Bill deals with, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that the Norwegians have done groundbreaking work on the storage of CO2. That is very valuable, and is part of the knowledge that we have today. The results achieved in Norway enable us to say with confidence that we know that the storage end of the chain seems to be practicable. However, we are talking about an operation involving generation, transport and storage, and no system covering those three components on a large scale exists in the world today.</p>

 It would help me in the debate to understand better whether the Government are concerned about the timing of an EPS or about whether it is right in principle to introduce it. I agree with my hon. Friend's argument about the nature of development. Putting the standard before the development is like putting the cart before the horse. Our railways would not have developed if the standards were in place before the railways were built. Is it a question of timing? In principle, I support an EPS to stop any backsliding at a future date. That is the danger.

 I could not have put it better myself, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because the question is essentially one of timing: introducing an EPS today would be premature and undermine investment; and, as we progress with CCS we will be able to judge whether we require an EPS or, possibly, another mechanism. The Independent Committee on Climate Change has said that there could be as many as four ways of making further progress on decarbonisation, of which EPS is one. My hon. Friend may be right and EPS may become the favoured means if we have to deploy other means than CCS, but at this stage it would be premature to decide that an EPS was the right instrument, because several could be used and EPS is just one of them.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Given the extent to which the developing economies and the great emerging economies, such as China and India, will continue to use coal, CCS is absolutely vital to tackling climate change, as I said at the beginning of my speech. If we are able to develop the technology speedily in this country, there will be real export potential. Co-operation is already under way between the UK and China and the EU and China. The EU will also fund some CCS projects, of which we hope at least one will be in the UK, and they will be combining all the information. CCS is very much a global project, but at the same time, from the point of view of British industry, if we get ahead we will be in a very good position to help other countries and benefit financially.</p>

However, if we look at the time scale, we know that the nuclear fleet, if it goes ahead, will begin to come into play only by the end of this decade; that carbon capture with coal can be commercial, again, only by the end of this decade; and that the scale of the Government's targets and objectives on renewables pushes their introduction out towards 2020. Therefore, there is a significant need for new gas generation in the system. The reality, though, is that as a result of the delays in starting to build those plants, our energy security has been put at severe risk, which has resulted in a scramble to try to put in place the required new-generation capacity.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend the shadow Minister, who has, not surprisingly, made a much more convincing case than the Minister, and has taken seriously security of supply. Given that subsidies will be an issue in this new technology, and that penalty payments for excess carbon are also an issue, the Government must set targets for the amount of carbon in order to justify the subsidy or the penalty payments, so why are they denying it?</p>

 Everything that I have said today about the rolling review and the reporting clause in new clause 8 is predicated on the fact that we believe that CCS will succeed. The companies think that CCS will succeed. There is therefore no reason for them to suspect that we are going to introduce an EPS, because if we succeed, there is no rationale for doing so. It is but a backstop in the event that CCS does not succeed.</p>

 A company that is allocating hundreds of millions or billions of pounds to new projects must look at the long-term environment in which it is investing. What we are seeking to do, in conjunction with many of the Minister's hon. Friends, is to provide that clarity in the shortest possible time scale. This is about securing investment rather than driving it away. Business is not overwhelmingly concerned about the principle of the EPS but about the level of it-that will determine whether investment is or is not made.</p>

 As far as I recall, the hon.

That does not spread uncertainty, as I am sure that he would agree, because he supported it. Does he not accept that this is a similar mechanism, which, by the way, he should address in terms of what happens with marginal coal plants as the process continues over the years? Does he consider that this system, in sustaining marginal coal plant in the system through the years, may be a better system than the indeterminate approach that he suggests in his proposal?</p>

 I have great respect for the hon. Gentleman, but there is a fundamental difference here. We are talking about policies that will help to drive investment decisions, which need to be made in a relatively short period.

 The hon. Gentleman assumes that a change in Government policy would mean the introduction of an EPS or similar mechanism, but there is another danger. The only coal plants likely to be built in the next few years are those that will be subject to the levy and will effectively be subsidised. We may get to a point in 2020 at which the plants have been built but CCS is not working or is not economic, and there is then a real danger of a change in policy, with the Government saying, "We will not go ahead with this, because we have invested so much money in these plants." We could therefore end up with higher emissions in the long run unless there is an EPS from the beginning that would force down the emissions or mean that the plant would not proceed.</p>

 One concern is that the Bill states that the levy may in due course be used for retrofitting. It does not state that there is an automatic right for it to be so used. Although the Minister has said today that it could be, there is no legal basis for her words in this House being used in a court in years to come. It is the words printed in the Bill that will be used. Accordingly, an element of doubt will remain. People will say, "Yes, I may get the levy for the first 300 MW, but what about for the next 900 or 1,200 MW, or however much more there will be?" Companies will say that that is not guaranteed, so we need to consider what the likely framework is and how we can give them the assurance that they need.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman's remarks about giving the market a clear signal would carry some weight if such a signal were contained within the new clause that he and my hon.

 The hon. Gentleman is right, but we were determined not to put that figure in the Bill, because that would be counter-productive in the long term. No decision on new coal will be taken in this country in the next six months, and no new investment decisions are likely in that time. Under new clause 15, within those six months industry would know the recommended figure and whether it would be enforced within the following six months.

If the EPS is not in place, it will find innovative ways of addressing the matter. If the hon.

The Government need to give long-term clarity to investors in coal with carbon capture, just as they have done for investors in nuclear and renewables. The latter already have such clarity in the shape of the policy framework and the funding regimes, which ought to be applied to coal with carbon capture.

 It is worth registering that there is an overwhelming consensus in the House that we need to take effective action in response to the threat of climate change. The statistics issued by the Department for Energy and Climate Change are very interesting in that they emphasise the importance of the energy and electricity supply in that context. The figures from 1990 to 2008 are striking because they show that energy supply and transport account for well over half of total emissions, and that emissions from energy supply are more than 50 per cent. more than for transport. The Government are right to believe that energy supply is at the centre of where we need to take action to tackle climate change. The nub of the argument is whether there should be an emissions standard or standards in relation to our power stations. There is a strong case for having more than one emissions standard, and I am of that view, and a case for more effective regulation of our power stations in future.</p>

It is implicit that such technology may not be successfully demonstrated and that any emissions reductions may not be cost-effective. Of course we can have CCS in some form or other, but the question is whether we can develop it effectively to reduce emissions sufficiently significantly-by more than 50 per cent., as my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen) indicated-and whether that will be cost-effective. We should not lose sight of the fact that that is where we are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="100224-0011.htm_para13"><a name="10022460000492">There is a consensus in the House that we should go down the road of providing financial support for CCS. That is fine, and it is important that we acknowledge that Government new clause 8 is constructive because it provides for a report. However, it is essentially retrospective, in the sense that we will always be looking back and seeing what happened, which is very different in principle from setting out standards that will apply in future. Of course, there could be different standards for new coal, old coal, gas and, indeed, in theory, for every single power station. The problem is sufficiently important that we must drive down emissions for new power stations and old.</p>

wish to speak. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for drawing my attention to the fact that the proposal for an actual emissions standard that must be met is a Liberal new clause. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) for his tremendous commitment to taking action on climate change and for the amount of work he has put into the matter in recent years. He may disagree, but new clause 6 is far better than new clause 15. New clause 6 is similar to the measure he proposed in Committee. New clause 15 refers only to new power stations. I am not suggesting that we ignore them, but that measure envisages a hugely different degree of intervention and regulation.</p>

Friend's proposal in Committee and to new clause 6 because they emphasise the plural. In theory, we could have one EPS for every station in the country, and every station would have to be below it. My view is that it would be more practical to have different emissions standards for different classes of power station. That is another reason why I find new clause 6 more attractive than new clause 15, but it would nevertheless be an advance if it were possible to win support for the latter.</p>

The companies that will provide the framework for research and development are large, transnational companies. However, we must try to ensure that we get value for money. It would not be unreasonable for the heads of some of those large companies to say, "Look, we want as much money as we can get with no strings attached," given that they are in business and that they want to get on with research, investment and, of course, making a private profit.</p>

 That is an interesting point, but I will not respond directly to the right hon. Gentleman because I do not have time.

 Is my right hon. Friend confident that within a year we can correctly define the emissions to a target standard?

 I join the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) in giving credit to the Secretary of State and the departmental team for the progress they are making in, for example, tackling climate change and addressing issues such as carbon capture and storage. It is worth casting our minds back to the days before the appointment of the current Secretary of State to a time when we had no Committee on Climate Change, no Climate Change Bill and no feed-in tariffs. We did not even have the expectations that we now have for CCS by the 2020s, and there was limited competition to incentivise it. We should recognise the progress that is being made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="100224-0011.htm_para19"><a name="10022460000507">However, this debate takes place in inauspicious times. According to an opinion poll this morning, there is growing scepticism about the reality of climate change and the anthropogenic causes of it. There is growing scepticism in the media, in newspapers such as the<i>  Daily Express</i>, and among those on the Conservative Benches. Indeed, I see that the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) and the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) are breathing down the neck of the hon. Member for Wealden. That kind of scepticism is on the rise, but it is important that we reiterate that the overwhelming scientific consensus is still that climate change is certainly happening and it is overwhelmingly likely that it has man-made causes.</p>

 How serious do the Liberal Democrats think the possible shortage after 2016 will be, given the number of power stations being retired and the absence of new ones? What would he do about that?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman makes an important point. That is an issue that might in the end lead to derogations from European directives to keep aged power stations online or to allow more importation of gas, which would not be a satisfactory outcome. We certainly need action now, not only to promote CCS but to promote greater seriousness about renewables. For example, we need a stronger feed-in tariff for renewable energy and many other such actions to address the issue that he is talking about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="100224-0012.htm_para3"><a name="10022460000515">The Committee on Climate Change also said in its report that the current market arrangements-in other words, those prevailing under the European trading scheme at the moment-are insufficient and leading to a perception of risk in investment in low-carbon generation. It states:</p>

That does not mean that we should wait until 2018, 2019 or 2020 to do something about an emissions standard or a limit on generation. We have to give signals that we intend to take such action right now-as early as possible. In fact, the Committee is even more specific about that later in its report, when it says:</p>

They know about business and investment, if nothing else-[Hon. Members: "Oh!"] I withdraw that uncharitable remark. We need those early signals now in order to create the investment framework.

 There is one flaw in the argument about the signals for investment that an EPS can provide. If we are worried that too strict an EPS will disincentivise investment, surely to incentivise investment, it would have to be a very lax EPS, which will get us nowhere.</p>

 I hate to say it, but I think that the hon. Gentleman is misunderstanding how a market works. Constraints can drive investment in different directions. That is the whole basis of the idea behind a carbon price and an ETS. A counter example is what happened in Norway, which, not having our opportunity to be part of an ETS and to have an EPS, introduced a different incentive-a carbon tax. The result was not to stop investment in those technologies, but actually to drive investment, and it has put Statoil-the Norwegian energy company-at the absolute forefront of those technologies worldwide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="100224-0012.htm_para12"><a name="10022478000015">I would like to mention a fantastic institution situated close to my constituency. The International Energy Agency greenhouse gas research and development programme, based at Stoke Orchard near Cheltenham, has credited that carbon tax and those price signals with driving investment by private industry, including Statoil and others, in these technologies, and with putting Statoil and others at the forefront of that technology.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that investment decisions are not just about whether we build new things, but about whether we keep existing things open? Does he also accept that after 2015-16, about 10 coal-fired power plants will continue to operate on the basis of fitting scrubbers to their chimneys under the large plant directive? We ought to ask whether those plants should continue to exist abated in the 2020s. Does he consider that they are necessary to balance the system, or does he think that they should close immediately after 2015-16? Furthermore, does he believe that a three-year review, at the time when those decisions to close or open are being made, might be the best method of ensuring that those plants know that they are going towards carbon sequestration and that they can stay open for a time as marginal suppliers in order to balance out the system and keep that new investment coming in?</p>

 I might have lost track of some of the questions in that intervention, but broadly speaking I think that the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right-he is expert on these issues. Retrofitting and the attitude to the maintenance of existing plant are obviously critical, and the signals sent by proposals for an EPS would be important in achieving that. The flaw in the Government's position, and in the Minister's constant use of words such as "aim" and "expectation", is that they do not give that concrete signal. They give the encouragement to investors that they might be able to exploit the loophole, whereas the Committee on Climate Change has made very clear its expectation, and has advised the Government, that unabated coal power should form almost no part of our energy generation after the 2020s, regardless of whether CCS is economic or not.</p>

 Except that we have a range of options based on emissions performance standards that absolutely would give greater certainty.

The calculation is led by the science, yet it is an acceptance that we are perhaps having to moderate our ambitions a little, but-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Sorry, it was the Environmental Audit Committee, of which the hon. Gentleman is a fellow member, that advocated an emissions performance standard of around 90 per cent. We are going below that, which is the very least that the science demands-and indeed, the level would be increased in time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="100224-0012.htm_para15"><a name="10022478000030">Rather less robust is new clause 6, tabled by the hon. Member for Nottingham, South, which we on the Liberal Democrat Benches are perfectly happy to support. Equally, it would mandate an emissions performance standard, but rather less specifically. Then we have the most flexible proposal, or the weakest, depending on one's point of view: new clause 15, which has the virtue of being supported by those on the Conservative Front Bench. Compromising on comprise, we are equally happy to support that, too, if it is the best that we can get today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="100224-0012.htm_para16"><a name="10022478000031">There is clearly some opposition to an emissions performance standard. E.ON has provided us with a helpful brief, which says:</p>
<a name="100224-0012.htm_brev10"><a name="10022478000230"><ul><p class="tabletext">"from our perspective as an investor in new generating capacity...an EPS creates new risks which will substantially increase the discount rates we apply to new investments, and ultimately determine whether we proceed with an investment or not."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="100224-0012.htm_para17"><a name="10022478000032">That is quite a mild rebuttal. It does not say that it will not proceed; that would be foolish, of course, as its investors would query whether it was sensible. E.ON also says in its brief that it recognises that an emissions performance standard can have a useful role in defining what individual new fossil plants will have to achieve in terms of CO2 abatement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="100224-0012.htm_para18"><a name="10022478000033">I have already cited Statoil in Norway, which has invested in the Sleipner project, as well as in the Algerian project at In Salah, and in Snøhvit. That has all been driven by the market intervention of the Norwegian carbon tax. Other economic incentives have driven investment in other parts of the world, including the potential for enhanced oil recovery in some places. That is clearly not happening in this country, however.</p>

This kind of uncertainty creates other risks, and I want to ask her another specific question. How secure is the funding even for the competition project? Let us imagine for a moment that the Labour Government are re-elected and enjoy another Parliament in power. In those circumstances, how secure would the investment in this project be, if the Treasury were to say, "Actually, the rest of the world is so far ahead of us now that it isn't worth our while spending this money in the UK.

 The truth is that I said repeatedly in my earlier remarks that the reporting regime would begin with a report no later than in 2012, then again in 2015 and once again in 2018. If the hon. Gentleman read the clause, he would see that that if a conclusion were reached-based on all the considerations that he wants to be taken into account at each stage and on advice from bodies such as the Climate Change Committee-that we were not making sufficient progress, so CCS would not provide the answer to our decarbonisation goals, it would of course be possible to consider an emissions performance standard at any point. I stress again that the Climate Change Committee has itself said that the EPS is but one of four measures that it believes might appropriately be taken if CCS were not successful.

 I have to say that that is one of the vaguest and most non-committal statements that we could expect to be made. Let me quote once again one of my favourite sources, the International Energy Agency greenhouse gas programme. Its report on worldwide investment supports the view already expressed that the rest of the planet is getting on with this. It says:</p>
<a name="100224-0013.htm_brev1"><a name="10022478000234"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Considerable work on CCS is being conducted throughout the world and these efforts are growing rapidly. Many scientists, engineers and geologists are now devoting their efforts to all aspects of CCS."</p>

The Australian government has established its low-emissions coal initiative with funding of AU$500 million and has announced an international carbon capture institute funded at AU$100 million. Together, these and other countries are funding a diverse array of projects on every aspect of CCS and this funding is expected to grow."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="100224-0013.htm_para3"><a name="10022478000046">The Minister asked about capture as well as storage projects. The three fully operational large-scale projects that I mentioned have storage-they include capture, of course, because carbon cannot be stored without having been captured-but while it is true that they do not capture from coal-fired generating power stations, they include capture from mixtures of gases from industrial processes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="100224-0013.htm_para4"><a name="10022478000047">The IEA report includes a list of dozens of projects worldwide-dozens of storage projects, but also dozens of capture projects. The truth is that more progress is being made in Norway, the United States, China, Brazil, Canada, Australia and Algeria on projects that include not only capture and storage, but transportation as well. Long pipelines are already in place and there is huge investment. The reason for it is obvious-that the prize of developing successful commercial-scale carbon capture and storage for coal-fired power stations will be fantastic. It presents a wonderful opportunity and for whichever countries or companies crack it, unbelievable numbers of jobs and revenue will follow from the successful exploitation of these technologies. While we hesitate, the reality is, sadly, that we may have missed the boat, so we will end up buying in this technology from China or the United States, which will cost the UK economy even more, because we will be expensively retrofitting something that we have not developed ourselves.</p>

We have been here before on renewable energy: despite this country's massive resources, we have ended up being overtaken by many other countries.

 The hon. Gentleman knows that my argument is that those same amending provisions totally undermine the investment programme that we have set out. I remind him that no other country in the world has a statutory funding mechanism, as is proposed in the Bill. He mentions various projects, but I do not believe that a single one of them includes capture, transportation and storage all within the same project on the scale that we envisage-capturing from coal-fired generation. He will not find a single example that combines all those elements, or a single example of a statutory funding package. He quotes the billions of investment, so I remind him that we are looking here at a potential of £9.5 billion being raised through the levy mechanism.

 When we are discussing an investment designed to achieve a certain goal, it is easy enough to say that it is impossible to produce any examples of anyone anywhere in the world who has achieved that goal. The truth is, however, that there are dozens of capture projects-some relating to coal, some to gas, and some to other industrial processes-dozens of storage projects, and hundreds of miles of pipeline. All the individual technologies are being developed. Of course it is true that we have not yet achieved the goal for which everyone is aiming-that is rather self-evident-but every other Government in the world have provided much more encouragement, which is why those projects are all up and running.</p>

It was addressed by the head of Deutsche Bank's global climate change research unit, who said that if we put together transparency, certainty and longevity, we provide what investors are looking for. He went on to say that investors in renewable energy ought to be differentiated from energy companies. And it is worth noting that many energy companies have said, "We don't like transparency. We like to do deals behind closed doors. That is how we can get the greatest arm-lock to lever resources out of Governments, taxpayers or customers."</p>

For everyone else, however, from citizens to Government to investors, it is a no-brainer that that is a good idea. That is why we should address this issue within a framework that requires the Government of the day to come back within a 12-month period with a scheme that sets out the details of where we go from wherever we are, so that this would not be the end of the game.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="100224-0013.htm_para14"><a name="10022478000068">The people from Deutsche Bank said to us this morning, "Look at the object lessons to be learned from Germany, where the introduction of feed-in tariffs has been followed by a series of reviews. That has happened because the regulatory framework drove the agenda for change." It drove the investments and innovation processes, and that is why they were able to go through a series of review processes that pushed way ahead of where the initial framework had envisaged that they could get to when they started out.</p>

 Absolutely, and we could broaden that point. The same sort of debate took place in California when the state wanted to introduce tighter controls on emissions from vehicles. At the time, the motor industry said, "This will kill the industry. There will be no new investment," but California had the courage to say, "Get lost.

All those things were built in to try to incorporate a recognition of concerns that were raised by Ministers and by the industry in response to the initial consultation.</p>

 I, too, am greatly enjoying my hon. Friend's presentation. If it is his intention that new clause 15 replace new clause 8-I presume that it would do were it to be passed by this House-an emissions performance standard would apply only to "new electricity generation plant." That is what new clause 15 states, but that provision was not in his original proposal. Does he, thus, accept that existing generation plants would be unabated and move into the 2020s with no emissions performance standard applying to them whatever?</p>

It made the point that when energy companies talk about new investment they will invariably come to the banks to raise the finance and it is the banks that are saying that they want TLC-transparency, longevity and certainty. That is the framework that they see as helpful in setting an emissions performance standard.</p>

Probably the best example from our shores that I can cite is the decision made by the company formed by BP and Rio Tinto-this relates to the projects of their hydrogen energy company. The original proposal was to build a power station in Peterhead, Scotland, but that was withdrawn and the decision was taken to build the power station in California, where a requirement for an emissions performance standard is already in place. The company was saying to us that if the combination of finance and regulation is put in place, that delivers the certainty that allows investors to invest. It seems nonsensical to claim that to have standards would deter investment rather than the contrary, which is that it would give the certainty to investment that investors are looking for.</p>

 Is there not another issue? The Minister has said that the difference for investment in this country is that £9.5 billion will be available through the levy that is not available elsewhere.

 That is exactly the point. As the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) said earlier, if the Government are making a commitment on such a scale-£9.5 billion-worth of investment support-why are we not placing performance conditions on the sector? It seems to me that if we take one step back and address the performance of the sector to date, what we have is another example of chronic market failure and a sector that is being driven by short-term calculations. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said on "Channel 4 News" just a week or so ago, the profit margins that are now being enjoyed by the energy sector are at-I think that these were his words-"pretty much record levels."</p>

The Government should be willing to place conditions on how we support industry rather than throwing money out of the window in the hope that those companies that have held the country in this arm-lock will behave differently from how they have behaved in the past. Many in the sector are already arguing that to set conditions would be a technology driver and would force the pace of innovation and change. We should not be afraid to address that.</p>

To say that somehow standards of performance run counter to that process, rather than reinforcing the urgency of the upward trend, is to miss the point completely and surrenders to the notion that we are held hostage to an ever increasing set of demands for public or customer finance to try to make something work when it might well not. This is an extra safety net rather than an obstacle on the road to progress.</p>

 I am delighted that we agree on something. Will my hon. Friend concede that we are not clear not only about the technology and about whether it can work-the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) did not give us an example of a coal project that was working anywhere in the world-but, more importantly, about the economics of carbon capture and storage? Until we can develop and refine that, it is premature to introduce emissions performance standards. We need the learning from CCS before we introduce an EPS.</p>

 That is quite wrong. We have to say that if someone is going to build a new coal-fired power station they should, in any case, expect to set an emissions performance standard for that station. What is done in CCS should be an enhancement of that. We cannot say that we should build anything that does not have an emissions performance attached to it now. That seems crazy. How can we set ourselves national targets if we begin from a presumption that we are not going to measure anything? That is why we should have the courage to set for ourselves an emissions performance standard.</p>

An American Electric Power company CCS retrofit project in West Virginia has so far been able to capture carbon at a rate of 1 per cent., but it hopes to raise that level to 7 per cent. That is a salutary measure of both the starting point and the extent of the road ahead of us. Having said that, I return to the point that this gamble is unavoidable: we have to take it, but we should not do so without setting safety net standards in relation to power stations having CCS.</p>

 Absolutely.

This is a time to be brave and interventionist. My biggest disappointment in this regard is about the argument that is used against us-that we should leave everything to the emissions trading scheme.

I fear that the system will turn into a carbon casino which will end up benefiting no one except those who speculate on carbon price changes.

We have heard examples of where standards exist, but they are applied to existing technologies that we well understand and whose development we can predict. I am not sure that we know how CCS will develop and if, indeed, it will be successful. Indeed, I regret that the Minister was not able to define CCS, and I hope that we establish a definition, because without one we cannot establish a standard. Should CCS be defined as more than 50 per cent. carbon capture, more than 75 per cent. or 90 per cent? The Environmental Audit Committee said that 90 per cent. was the right level, and I agree.</p>

Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) has. It is a coal-fired power station that produces millions of tonnes of emissions a year-not comparable to Drax, but pretty big-and its little pilot project captures 36,000 tonnes a year. That is state-of-the-art technology, so there is a big gap and a long way to go, and the issue is not just about the technology, but about the legality. Where do we put the stuff? It is okay to say that we can put it in the North sea, which has a huge capacity, but is it necessarily correct to do so? What are the legalities of storing something in these reservoirs for centuries? Who is responsible for them over time? Is that going to be included in, or excluded from, the standard?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises an important issue.

 In that case, what has been amiss? Why does every country not have this standard right now, fully implemented, with 100 per cent. or 90 per cent. capture? The hon.

 This has been a fascinating debate about whether we should have performance standards, and there is much at stake for this country and for my children and grandchildren. It is a pity that we have not spent more time talking about that, because in many respects their future well-being depends on the matter. We ought to put it into perspective a bit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="100224-0015.htm_para2"><a name="10022478000130">I have been working for a clean coal sector within our energy provision for quite a long time, and I have been disappointed by the progress in the House since I have been here. I must say, however, that the pace of progress has increased remarkably since the current Secretary of State has been in his position, and I am delighted that that is the case. I was disappointed that the CCS competition was not worked out in quite the efficient way I had hoped. To be fair, the Minister of State has admitted that, which I welcome. I also welcome the fact that the next three of the promised four projects in Britain's CCS programme will be undertaken under different criteria. There is an important learning curve, and we have grabbed it and taken it on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="100224-0015.htm_para3"><a name="10022478000131">I shall briefly mention the technology involved. There are already more than 70 projects in existence throughout the world, and carbon storage has been well handled by BP in the middle of the Algerian desert for 13 years. Anyone who goes down to Sunbury to look at its centre where CCS is controlled and researched will be amazed by the progress that has been made, how much monitoring is undertaken and how safe the process is. I am worried for my grandchildren, not about leaks of carbon dioxide but that the power stations will cease to produce the energy that we need in this country. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) said that too, although we come to different conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="100224-0015.htm_para4"><a name="10022478000132">New clause 8 is particularly important. I am disappointed that the Minister decided to go for a three-year reporting term. I would prefer an annual report, not least because energy provision will be the most crucial and worrying area of activity, and one of the most doubtful, for our well-being and that of our children and grandchildren. The development of CCS in the next 10 years will be absolutely vital for the well-being of this country, which is why I would have hoped that we could return to it every year. There are many questions that we need to keep track of and find answers to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="100224-0015.htm_para5"><a name="10022478000133">The pace has picked up enormously, and in my view it will continue to do so. We will be hanging on the back of global development in CCS in the next 10 years, and we need to be as well informed as we possibly can be. That is why I urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to rethink the timing of reporting. I believe that we need an annual report.</p>

station, transporting it to the aquifer and shoving it down the aquifer. It also requires getting the coal in the first place, so we need to keep track of many issues with regard to CCS on a commercial scale. I ask the Minister whether a number of them will be included in what I hope will be the annual report to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="100224-0015.htm_para8"><a name="10022478000136">Of course we will need to talk about sites following the decision on the three projects that we hope to make progress on-a decision that we hope the Minister will make by the end of this year. As an aside, I was delighted to learn that she expects to make a decision quickly on the competition for the initial experiment and the first station. I hope that happens within weeks rather than months and I look forward to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="100224-0015.htm_para9"><a name="10022478000137">Will the report include the concept of clusters, which is vital to this country and its people, who will want to know where the jobs and the power stations will be, and how we are going to plan such things in the years to come? There is also the issue of a pipeline network. The size of the pipeline is crucial. If we have a relatively small pipeline and a cluster thereafter, we might be unable to progress with further stations because the pipeline cannot take the carbon. That would clearly be crazy, so we need to think about the size of the pipeline and how the pipeline network will service the transportation of the carbon that we extract from the coal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="100224-0015.htm_para10"><a name="10022478000138">We need a real understanding of how we are going to shove the carbon down into the aquifers. There is no doubt that we are immensely well blessed with aquifers in the North sea, because we can not only create a global trade in storage, which will enhance Britain's income, but enhance the production of oil and gas. It is estimated that if we do that properly, we can get an extra 15 per cent. more oil out of the North sea, which is a prize worth grabbing when we are being told from certain quarters that our production will peak by 2015. We need to understand aquifers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="100224-0015.htm_para11"><a name="10022478000139">Longannet is talking with Shell about stuffing the carbon down into the aquifers, but we need more information, and to track the situation. In Sunbury, BP has worked on tracking the carbon using satellites, which is a most remarkable technology. Technology to work out the dispersal of the CO2 underground in the aquifer, which is important, is also in place. We are behind not on technology but on putting the stuff together on a commercial scale of, say, 800 MW. That is what we are testing for-the technology is already there. Will the report also be about aquifers and the potential for Britain to sell aquifer space to other producers of CO2? That business is growing quickly and dramatically throughout the world.</p>

 I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. The Minister was right to say that the Bill tries to put three technologies together, which has not been done elsewhere, which we accept. However, in reality, the end bit-storage in aquifers in the North sea and elsewhere-is not in the gift of the Government but of oil and gas companies, which still own them. Does he share my concern that many aquifers will disappear quickly, because they will collapse, and that unless the Government, through the reporting mechanism, which is important, state how we are going to maintain them in the short term as well as the long term, we will lose an opportunity to be world leaders in storage as well as outcome?</p>

Much of our coalfield closed down because the foreign owners of our power stations could buy coal from Australia, Poland or Indonesia more cheaply than they could get it out of the mines in Nottinghamshire.

The issue for miners in Nottinghamshire, UK Coal and the Government is how we get there. After much discussion, the consensus is that very quickly we have to get a demonstration plant up and running in Nottinghamshire or Yorkshire where that coal can go to.

It ranges from that which is commercial now-for instance, where there is advanced oil recovery, where storage is right next to the plant and on particular types of recovery-right through to that which is quite expensive, very distant from the aquifer and so on.

Coal and gas are important to our current energy supply and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future, so CCS is vital.

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="100224-0016.htm_para0"><a name="10022478000164">That is a point of view, but as was pointed out earlier, there is one thing being done in this country that is not done elsewhere, and the Minister said it herself. No other country has a statutory funding mechanism. She has talked about £9.5 billion from the levy for four demonstration plants. That is a considerable amount of the investment that will be needed for those four plants, but the money will not come out of thin air; rather, it is money from the levy on the energy companies, the cost of which will be met by the consumer at the end of the day. We are therefore talking about giving £9.5 billion of consumers' money to the energy companies to demonstrate CCS, and possibly also for retrofitting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="100224-0016.htm_para1"><a name="10022478000165">Earlier the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) mentioned the increasing scepticism about climate change shown in polls of late. However, another type of scepticism is increasing, and that is scepticism among energy consumers, who are being asked to bear more and more costs, for environmental issues, helping with the grid and so on. As we are in a period when wages are not rising and are not likely to rise for the foreseeable future, yet energy bills continue to rise, and more and more is being put on those bills, there is a squeeze on the energy consumers who pay them. If we are going to take consumers with us down this route, we have to convince them that we are getting value for money for the huge amounts that we are putting into CCS and other things. One way to do that is by putting the EPS in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="100224-0016.htm_para2"><a name="10022478000166">I understand the point that the hon. Member for Sherwood made about timing, and he is right. A year is a short time when we are talking about CCS, which we have talked about for many years but have never really got off the ground, for various reasons that I could go into at length, but will not. We have to show the consumer that we are putting real pressure on the companies to perform, to ensure that the money is well invested, that we will have a CCS system that works and reduces carbon emissions, that the cost is worth while for reducing the long-term emissions into the atmosphere and for helping to meet our challenging targets for carbon emissions reduction.</p>

No one in their right mind will operate a coal plant without the levy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="100224-0016.htm_para4"><a name="10022478000168">To digress slightly, we talked about gas earlier, and I made the point in Committee about the terms of the national planning statement in England, which I think will prevent new gas plant from being developed. We took that up with the Minister, Lord Hunt, when he appeared before the Committee, and he promised to look into the matter again. This needs to be sorted out, because it could stand in the way of the development of gas plant.</p>

clause 8. I do not doubt the Minister's sincerity on the new clause. I do not doubt that the Government intend its effect to be that, in reviewing the measure in future, we will consider an EPS if we are not making fast enough moves towards decarbonisation. To me, however, that is not what the new clause actually says.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="100224-0016.htm_para6"><a name="10022478000170">The new clause says that we will look at</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="100224-0016.htm_para9"><a name="10022478000173">We should bear in mind the fact that by that time the energy companies will have invested money in the plant, and the Government will have invested £9.5 billion-perhaps a lot more. If, disastrously, carbon capture and storage is not working economically, there will be massive pressure on the Government of the day. Let us remember that 2020 is two Parliaments away, and with the best will in the world, whatever happens later this year, the Minister is unlikely still to be in her post-no offence meant to her, of course. In those circumstances, there will be massive pressure on the Government of the day to allow the plants to continue to operate without CCS because of the money that has been put in, and because of the effect on the energy system if they were taken out of commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="100224-0016.htm_para10"><a name="10022478000174">For all those reasons, it seems perfectly sensible-indeed, absolutely essential-that we make it clear to the energy companies from the outset that there must be an emissions standard and that they must meet it. We are putting this money in to help us to achieve our carbon reduction targets, and if we do not do that, there is real dangers ahead. I also suggest that we would have grave difficulty in convincing the energy consumers-who, ultimately, are paying for all this-that that is the right thing to do. I will support the emissions target tonight, and I hope that the measure goes through. I foresee great difficulty if it does not.</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friends the Members for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) and for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen) that this debate might, unfortunately, be characterised as a debate between vertebrates and invertebrates. I believe, however, that it is about whether a very good existing policy on carbon capture and storage should be strengthened, or whether, in seeking to strengthen it, we could end up with no carbon capture and storage, and no coal plants, at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="100224-0016.htm_para11"><a name="10022478000176">The debate is also about where we want to get to in terms of using low-carbon coal, if we decide we are going to use further coal power for energy production. It is also about whether we have new coal plants-if we do not have any, we will certainly not have any carbon capture technology, because the one follows from the other. As I said in an earlier intervention, the debate is about whether we take seriously what we are going to do about existing coal plants for our future energy  <br>

In a recent report, it said explicitly that</p>
<a name="100224-0016.htm_brev2"><a name="10022478000242"><ul><p class="tabletext">"there is no role for unabated coal-fired generation beyond the 2020s on the way to an 80 per cent. emissions reduction in 2050".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="100224-0016.htm_para13"><a name="10022478000178">That is a very clear statement, which is, in fact, rather more radical than an emissions performance standard, in saying that by the 2020s investors in coal-either in existing power stations or new ones-will not be able to use those stations for energy generation unless it is abated. Full stop. That seems to me to provide complete certainty about the future basis for investment. This is essentially the position we are now in, as we look at carbon capture and storage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="100224-0016.htm_para14"><a name="10022478000179">The question then arises: if we adopt one or more of these amending provisions, where do we stand in terms of the aim? If new clause 15 were adopted, the No. 1 point is that no new coal-fired stations might be developed in the first place-for reasons connected with the economics of developing the power stations and the imposition and overlay of an EPS on an existing series of projects for new coal-fired projects. As new clause 15 specifically points out, the suggested EPSs should apply only to new coal-fired plant. We could thus end up with the worst of all worlds-with no new coal-fired power stations and with no emissions standards for existing coal-fired power stations. That would indeed be a magnificently perverse outcome for those who claim that they are fighting on behalf of the vertebrates against the invertebrates.</p>

 I believe that my hon. Friend conceded that point in response to my earlier intervention. That seems to me to be a possible problem with new clause 15.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right that that might be a problem with new clause 15. However, he should bear in mind what successive Ministers have repeatedly said-that there is nothing to stop the Government from introducing an EPS on their own account now. The new clause could cover the aspects that are omitted in relation to existing plans, but the real question is whether there is the political will for an EPS. It actually comes down to something as fundamental as that.</p>

 I take my hon. Friend's point, but we are debating real amendments before us, which would have a real effect, so if we go into the Lobbies to vote on those provisions, the outcome will be that one amending provision or another will be passed. New clause 15 clearly states that an EPS of any description-it is not quantified-will apply only to new power plant.</p>

Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood)-a man who lives and dies by markets-because he appeared to confuse markets with marketplaces. In energy, we do indeed have a very constrained market, but we also have a marketplace for balancing our energy supply between what is demanded, which is variable,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Feb 2010">

<notus-date day="24" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>24 Feb 2010 : Column 378</b><br>
and what is supplied, which is also variable. Not only do we have a variable supply, but we have the introduction of a variable-in a different sense-renewable supply against a baseline supply which is not variable, but which may come within the marketplace on a variable basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="100224-0016.htm_para16"><a name="10022478000185">All those elements must be balanced against each other if we are-as the right hon. Gentleman said-to keep the lights on. If we wish to keep the lights on, as well as moving to a low-carbon economy and retaining an element of coal, we must take careful account of how the existing coal-fired power stations-not necessarily the most economic-remain in the marketplace in terms of the balancing mechanism that I assume will continue be used to ensure that our energy supply demand matches our energy supply over a period of years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="100224-0016.htm_para17"><a name="10022478000186">If we are to do that, it is imperative that the existing coal-fired power stations are clear about two facts. They must be clear about the fact that they will not receive rebates after the 2020s, and they must be clear about the fact that a number of them will stay on line after 2015-16. We should consider what will happen if, as a result of anything that we do today, a commercial decision is made that causes those 10 stations to close, given that they will not be receiving receive rebates for very long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="100224-0016.htm_para18"><a name="10022478000187">The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) mentioned flue desulphurisation. The decision in that instance was made not on the basis of whether it was suitable for those stations, but on the basis of the economics. A number of coal-fired stations were closed under the large plant directive because it would not have been economic to fit desulphurisation equipment. The 10 stations that will continue to operate do have that technology, and can operate for a while: indeed, Drax can operate for a number of years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="100224-0016.htm_para19"><a name="10022478000188">The question that we must ask ourselves is: do we wish those power stations to disappear from the marketplace in the not too distant future? If so, we shall be faced with the additional prospect of either the market or the Government building new power stations and mothballing them in order to keep the marketplace working in terms of energy supplies. That is a second possible perverse outcome of what we think we are trying to achieve today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="100224-0016.htm_para20"><a name="10022478000189">I believe that new clause 8 represents a considerable improvement on what we were offered in Committee. It sets out what we should seek in terms of progress; it sets out our aims; it sets out how we can get there; it sets out what we do if we are beginning to fail to get there; and it sets out the ultimate outcome. That seems to me to ensure that the outcomes that we want will be achieved and the risk of perverse outcomes minimised. I therefore cannot support new clause 15, and I urge the House to support new clause 8.</p>

 It is impossible for us to conduct this debate without understanding the background: what is actually going on in the world of energy supply.

He also mentioned an overall rise in prices since 1998, climate change and the legislative programme from Europe, the closure of coal plants-which has been dictated by that programme-and the risk posed by gas imports. That risk has been clear for at least five years, given, for instance, the closure of pipelines from Ukraine. A huge element has been the length and depth of the financial crisis. It is clear that Ofgem, along with many other people in the country, could not have been expected to forecast that or work its way around it.</p>

In particular, we face the huge issue of security of supply, while seeking massive investment from the markets. Ofgem predicts that we will need to raise £200 billion by 2020. That is a huge sum of money, and Ofgem put it into context today when it said that £100 billion was invested in the water industry over 20 years, and we now need £200 billion over 10 years-twice as much over half the length of time, when we have had serious economic problems. We are certainly in straitened times.</p>

companies have not invested in skills because of the overriding objective of keeping prices down and giving shareholder dividends.

Let me repeat something that I have said more than once before in this House, especially as the Minister with responsibility for coal is present. There is a moral point to be made about the fact that we import coal. We are importing coal from China, where 6,000 miners a year are dying. Tonight in China, 20 men will not go home because of a lack of safety standards. In Ukraine, for every 1 million tonnes of coal that is got out of the ground, seven people die. That is the reality of getting cheap imported coal. If we are happy with that, we are not the people we should be in this country.</p>

From all the debates we have had over the past 25 years about the privatisation of public services, I have understood that the whole idea is to transfer the risk: if we transfer the services out of the public sector, we also transfer out the risk. The truth, however, is that whenever the risk returns, these investors are suddenly standing with their hands out, and with their hands in our pockets, demanding that our customers and electorates pay for their shortfalls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="100224-0016.htm_para31"><a name="10022478000201">The European energy system works in a different way from ours. In the rest of the European Union, countries base their energy debates and demands first of all on social obligations. We base ours on price-led mechanisms, so it is no wonder that when times are tough gas goes into Europe and out of Britain. Twenty years have passed since we were told to "Tell Sid." Well, the chickens are coming home to roost, because companies here need to find £200 billion and we are on the back foot. The companies will be coming to the Government-regardless of which party is in charge-and saying, "We need you to help us. We need you to help us at a time when money is more expensive than it has probably been for a long time." We are paying the price for being in an ideologically driven situation, and it is the very same ideology that got us into this mess in the first place.</p>

As has been acknowledged by Members on both sides of the House, there is no doubt that a significant sea change has taken place in the past two years, particularly with the creation of the new Department and the new drive to try to put the British coal industry, in particular, and the British energy system back where they should be. Nobody wanted to talk about energy during the first three years that I was in this House. It took the huge petrol price increases of two years ago to frighten people; the reality was that we were being held to ransom by the oil companies and we needed to start doing things. If that has been a push in the right direction, thank God it has.</p>

 Will the Minister confirm that she was saying just a little while ago that the Government themselves would look at an EPS if that was necessary in a few years' time?

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="100224-0017.htm_para7"><a name="10022478000213">The hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) said that there was a need for clear signals to be given. I do not believe that there could be a clearer signal than the framework that we offer in this Bill, the levy that it contains and the certainty that companies can have that they can invest at a time when they are being asked to do so in technology that in its complete form-from capture to transportation to storage-has not yet been proven. He cited a range of projects that appear in an IEA report. I have to tell him that I have now had the opportunity to check all those projects and I have found that some of them are not operational, some will not necessarily be taken forward and none is on a commercial scale. I hope that he will therefore understand that what is proposed by our framework is necessary, because those projects are not on a commercial scale, and the support that we rightly offer through this Bill is what industry needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="100224-0017.htm_para8"><a name="10022478000214">The hon. Gentleman asked about EU law and suggested that there was an amendment to a directive that could be a threat to any future EPS. We have been in discussions on the matter and we remain convinced that the proposed amendment does not threaten any attempt by a sovereign state to introduce an EPS at any stage in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="100224-0017.htm_para9"><a name="10022478000215">I am glad to see my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) in his place. I think that he compared me to a worm today, which I am very surprised at-he compared me to an invertebrate, and the best known invertebrate is a worm. He spoke at some length about how he thinks that an EPS can incentivise, and made comparisons with the German feed-in tariffs and catalytic converters in cars. My hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen) intervened and made the following point, but it needs to be emphasised. There is a fundamental difference between creating incentives to bring on and to produce more use of existing technologies, and creating the incentives required to enable people to take on a huge risk where the technology is not yet entirely proven. We reject absolutely the comparisons made by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South, which do not support a case for imposing an EPS such as that which he suggests at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="100224-0017.htm_para10"><a name="10022478000216">When EU law sets standards, it does so on the basis of the best available technology-that means not just the technology that is available for lab-scale prototypes but that which is economically and technically feasible. That is the judgment that we must make when we are considering the investment programme that we propose and how an EPS would undermine it.</p>

Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Dr. Strang), why the Government would throw such enormous sums of money at the private sector without setting any conditions. First, let me remind the House that conditions already exist in our climate change levy and the EU emissions trading scheme. We are already in a carbon-constrained economy where all fossil fuels are subject to some constraint, and that is recognised and codified in the carbon budgets that we have set through to 2022. They, of course, are statutory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="100224-0017.htm_para12"><a name="10022478000218">Obviously, conditions will be set on the projects through the incentive.

that is to be stored. There will need to be monitoring of the CCS projects, as well as the collection, collation and reporting of information to an agreed standard. The information will then have to be shared. We will have to ensure that the CCS projects fully meet any relevant safety and other standards. So, there will be standards. In addition, the payment made to companies will not just be given to companies willy-nilly. It will be awarded to companies based on the amount of CO2 that is saved.</p>

Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), whom I see nodding-perhaps he is glad to have had that information-he asked for more information. He asked about the overall investment and I repeat what I said earlier: the estimated cost of the investment is £9.5 billion. He spoke well and in a way with which we would all agree about energy security. It is fundamental to what we are doing and the Bill is intended to assist with energy security. He said that the Government need to be clear about the missing bits, and we think that we have done that by saying that we need new nuclear projects, by making massive renewables incentives available to industry and by saying categorically and specifically in the Bill that we need four new coal-fired power stations, which we will enable to come on stream by making the CCS levy available. He can find further details about finance in the annexe to the low carbon transition plan, but that will be revised soon so he is welcome to write to me if he wants further detail, which I may or may not be able to give him. Where I am able to, I will do so.</p>

He was at the meeting of the all-party group on coalfield communities that I addressed yesterday. It is important that people across the House have a commitment to coal and to the future in the way that he expressed. I cannot give him the satisfaction of agreeing to move from a three-year reporting period to a one-year reporting period, but I will say that, as he well knows, it is up to all Members of the House at Question Time, in Opposition day debates and on other occasions to obtain more frequent responses from Ministers if that seems appropriate. He asked specifically about the nature of reports. I can give him the assurance that all matters such as clusters, the concept of pipeline networks and storage capacity-indeed, all the potential uses that he could think of-can be covered by reports, and we anticipate that they will be.</p>

He has interpreted that to mean that we will revise matters in 2020. On the contrary, we have three-year stages, so there will always be the potential to revise policy as we go along. The difference between our position and that of putting an EPS in place very quickly is that we will have knowledge of how CCS is going and will therefore be able to make better judgments not only about whether an EPS might be  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para0"><a name="10022484000030">The current rules require suppliers to provide customers with written notice of a price increase within 65 working days of the change taking effect. That means that some customers may not be told that their gas or electricity price has been increased until almost three months after the change has taken place. Although consumers have a 20-day period following the notification within which they can switch supplies to avoid the price increase, it is simply unacceptable to have such a delay between a tariff change and notification. Best practice must surely be to notify before a price increase, so that customers can consider whether they want to switch to another supplier or budget for the higher costs before they come into effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para1"><a name="10022484000031">After a substantive debate on this issue in Committee, I wrote to Ofgem to highlight the strength of feeling of hon. Members, and to ask it to address the matter urgently. As the regulator, Ofgem is best placed to take steps to do that by changing licence conditions. It has responded to my letter, and announced that it will consult on the issue before Easter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para2"><a name="10022484000032">Given normal time scales, I expect that Ofgem will take action by the end of the summer. My firm expectation is that it will address the issue effectively but, if it encounters difficulties, it is important that the Government are able to step in and remedy the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para3"><a name="10022484000033">I am sorry to say that new clause 2, as drafted, would not work in practice. There needs to be a mechanism through which the Government can impose such a requirement on energy companies, as well as suitable enforcement measures to ensure compliance. That mechanism is the licence condition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para4"><a name="10022484000034">Government new clause 9 enables the Secretary of State to modify licence conditions in electricity and gas supply licences and to set the notice period within which energy suppliers must notify consumers of tariff changes. As is standard practice, it sets out that any modifications should be subject to consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para5"><a name="10022484000035">Government new clause 11 makes those modifications subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Therefore, a resolution of either House of Parliament would prevent the Secretary of State from making the modifications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para6"><a name="10022484000036">Government new clause 9 includes a sunset clause. The Secretary of State will not be able to exercise his power after a period of three years from the provisions coming into force. That is because the situation requires urgent resolution. Taking these powers should give a clear signal to industry that the Government expect the issue to be resolved swiftly and are ready to take direct action if needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para7"><a name="10022484000037">The introduction of new Clause 9 leads to a restructuring of the Bill, as many provisions relating to licence modifications are common to more than one part. Amendments 15 to 18, 20 to 26 and 29 to 35 are technical: they restructure the Bill to take account of the consolidation of licence modification provisions set out in new clauses 11 and 12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para9"><a name="10022484000039">Government new schedule 1 contains all the consequential amendments made necessary by the change, and collects together the existing consequential amendments required by the other clauses in this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para10"><a name="10022484000040">The remaining Government amendments in this group are amendments 27 and 28. These correct a technical and unintentional anomaly-which was the fault of the Government-in clause 23. They ensure that, in relation to appeals under the market power licence condition powers, the Competition Appeal Tribunal can change both the amount of the penalty and the day by which it, or part of it, is required to be paid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para11"><a name="10022484000041">Amendment 2 aims to reduce any adverse impacts on security of supply and investment which may result from the market power licence condition introduced in clause 18 by making it an explicit requirement that before exercising the new powers, the Secretary of State should have considered these issues and be of the view that action would not affect them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para12"><a name="10022484000042">Security of supply and the need for increased investment in electricity transmission are, of course, matters of prime importance. The market power licence condition has been purposefully structured to limit the market uncertainty which may have a negative impact on investment. Our intention is that it will apply only where there are transmission constraints in existence. It is narrow and proportionate to the specific problem identified by Ofgem and contains a tailored appeals process as an added support for companies. There will also be a full consultation process on the licence conditions and Ofgem's accompanying guidance document to ensure that we avoid any unintended consequences and subsequent adverse impact on security of supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para13"><a name="10022484000043">Finally, the inclusion of a sunset clause that limits the operational life of the licence condition to five or seven years gives the industry the certainty that this is a targeted measure. After that period of time, we anticipate that there should be sufficient investment in the transmission network to remove the constraint scenarios that give rise to market power exploitation, and that the licence condition will therefore no longer be necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para14"><a name="10022484000044">The amendment is unnecessary, although I understand and have sympathy with the reasons for tabling it. The narrow and targeted nature of the market power licence condition, together with its curtailed lifespan, will limit any investment uncertainty. In addition, the amendments to the duties of Ofgem and the Secretary of State introduced by clauses 16 and 17 will ensure that security of supply issues are considered when developing the licence condition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para15"><a name="10022484000045">On new clauses 18 and 21, energy companies currently have the right to block licence modifications proposed by Ofgem if more than 20 per cent. of licence holders or companies with 20 per cent. of the market share object to the proposed change. We recognise that there are concerns that the 20 per cent. threshold is too low and could make it too easy for major energy suppliers to block or dilute change intended to benefit consumers. For example, in many cases it would require a combination of only two of the major electricity companies to reach the required blocking threshold and thus veto change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para16"><a name="10022484000047">The 50 per cent. threshold proposed by the Lib Dems would make it more difficult for companies to veto Ofgem's changes to licence conditions, arguably enhancing Ofgem's ability to make timely changes for the benefit of consumers. There are, however, a number of risks associated with increasing the threshold, in particular the risk of inducing market uncertainty, which could impact adversely on much needed investment in the energy market and thus on security of supply. Given that changes to licence conditions can have potentially significant implications for a company's operations, it is appropriate that it should have an effective means of challenging these decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para17"><a name="10022484000048">The new clauses also address the mechanics of the blocking threshold. The issue was raised with my officials recently by Consumer Focus. Currently, the percentage of licence holders required to meet the blocking threshold is calculated by either market share or the number of licensees. But with some large companies holding multiple licences, the balance of power can be distorted, with those larger companies finding it easier to block modifications as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para18"><a name="10022484000049">The new clauses would change the rules so that there is one vote per group of affiliates, rather than one vote per licence holder, meaning that companies with multiple licences get only one vote instead of several, thereby levelling the playing field. It is not clear how much of an impact this change would have on larger companies, which will still find it easier to meet the market share blocking threshold. I accept that these issues merit attention and they are under active discussion in the Department. This is, however, a complex issue, and a quick legislative fix without a full understanding of the impacts is not necessarily the best way forward.</p>

 I have listened very carefully to the Minister, and, having some experience of listening to civil servants, I think that, on the proposal before us, she has had a rather big dose of, "Better not, Minister." Bluntly, it is not good enough to say, "We all understand how difficult this is and we all have to put it off until we get it right." The truth of the matter is that most of us would like to see the proposal introduced now, and, unless the Minister can explain that she really will take some measure to do what I think is absolutely essential, we will have to take the view that her response is yet another obfuscation by a Government who have not stood up to those companies as they should have.</p>

A belated conversion is better than no conversion, and I am always willing to receive a better drafted amendment, but I just make it clear that we are doing something that we should never have had to do by legislation, because the situation should never have arisen. For the first time, we are ensuring that the big six energy companies tell people in advance of changes to their prices. Today, they can still tell people 65 working days after they have changed their prices, and that is just nonsense.

for his support. At the moment, if a company has a 20 per cent. share of the market, it can block any proposals by the regulator for changing the licence conditions. Yes, there is an appeal mechanism, which can be taken up to the Competition Commission, but the regulator has shown itself to be very reluctant to go down that route. We are seeking to ensure that one of the big six companies cannot alone prevent changes in the rules that would be against their interests. It is entirely wrong, and unacceptable, that in terms of prices and the way that the energy companies give people information about what they are doing, one company can hold consumers to ransom in this way. Our proposals are thoroughly supported by Consumer Focus, the consumers' representative group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para26"><a name="10022484000060">Our second proposal would prevent energy companies from being able to collect a set of licences and thereby accumulate a similar power, under the radar, in a way that works against the fulfilment of consumers' wishes, as reflected by Ofgem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para27"><a name="10022484000061">The third proposal is probably the most timely and would affect people most at the moment. Colleagues will probably be aware that on Monday, Ofgem, like a sleeping giant waking up to its obligations, produced a report on the prices that the gas and electricity companies have had to pay and the prices that they were charging their consumers. In summary, as was reported yesterday in many newspaper headlines and national news bulletins, energy suppliers are making more than £100 out of every customer by refusing to cut bills during the record freeze. We have had record cold weather, with people probably having had to use their energy supplies more than in any recent winter in living memory, and yet during that period the energy companies have had a larger share of profits than ever before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para28"><a name="10022484000062">The figures for the big six companies-British Gas, Scottish Power, EDF Energy, npower, Scottish and Southern Energy and E.ON-show that in the last quarter, net profit margins per average dual fuel customer widened from £75 last November to £105 at the start of this month. That is the highest average margin enjoyed by the industry since 2004. In the next few days, we are expecting some of the big companies to report their profits, with possible increases in profits up as much as 50 per cent. and potential profits of up to £550 million. When bills such as the one that I have here drop through people's letterboxes telling them that prices are going up or staying the same, it is not an unreasonable proposition that the customer should know what profits are being made out of them by the big six energy companies. I am sad that the Minister resisted what seems to be an absolutely essential prerequisite for customer choice.</p>

Prices have gone up for consumers, many of whom have low household incomes. People have been paying over the odds and the energy companies have been making massive profits. We have to change the balance of power, and all these new clauses are about doing that. The Government have conceded on one of them and we are grateful. However, that is just  <br>

 As the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) said, it is sad that we will not have more chance to debate these issues today. We have quite rightly had a substantial debate on carbon capture and storage and emissions performance standards, and it shows the folly and shortcomings of the timetabling of debates that we cannot have more time to discuss such important energy issues at a time when they are so relevant to people in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para30"><a name="10022484000065">I welcome the Government's tidying-up amendments. They are not likely to win any plain English awards, as they are rather obscure, but we understand that they are important to make the Bill more substantive and put things in order. We also welcome very much the Government's response on the 65-day notification period. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on how he has pushed the matter forward. A 65-day period is simply too long and was unacceptable, and it is quite right that Ministers should now take a power to address the problem and require a reduction in the notification period if Ofgem does not act as we would all expect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para31"><a name="10022484000066">I understand that the Minister's hope and preference is that tariffs should be announced in advance, so that there is no retrospection at all, or at worst within 10 days. That would return us to the situation that appertained before the Government changed the notification period to 65 days. We welcome that and hope that it can happen. We also welcome the sunset clause, which is appropriate in these circumstances. We need to act quickly, and that provision will put pressure on the Government and the regulator to do so in an appropriate way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="100224-0018.htm_para32"><a name="10022484000067">There are other issues that we wished to address, such as concerns about profitability. We recognise that there is a case for openness and information for consumers, but one has to question why it should be uniquely on energy bills. When we buy a car or a holiday we do not need to know the company's profits, and with so many tariffs in existence it is hard to relate the profits of an energy company to the particular tariff that a customer is on and the contribution that they are making to those profits. Those matters need to be explored further with the Government, and we hope to have the chance to do so in due course.</p>

The current structure gives some of the less attractive elements of the media the ability to present the whole system in a way that is damaging to those of us who are fighting for a low-carbon, and finally non-carbon, economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="100224-0020.htm_para39"><a name="100224101000436">The work that has been done has helped to strengthen the Bill in a number of respects. It has helped in relation to the scope of the CCS incentive, the reporting of progress towards decarbonising our electricity supply, and consumer protection. The relatively speedy passage of the Bill has been due partly to the able work done in Committee, and partly because it was designed as a short Bill that could make swift progress before a general election. Our task now is to send the Bill to the other place so that it can make further progress.</p>

 Obviously it is important for the Bill to be passed in the House of Commons, but does the Secretary of State accept that practical issues remain with which it cannot deal? I am thinking, for example, of the transport of equipment relating to wind turbines in my constituency, which is a very vexing issue. May I report to the Secretary of State after my ministerial meeting about it? It might be useful for him to understand, in the context of the United Kingdom as a whole, practical issues that concern local communities.</p>

 I admire the hon. Gentleman's characteristic ingenuity in inserting a question about the transport of wind turbines into a Third Reading debate. I look forward to hearing from him-even if it is too late for the purposes of the Bill-about what more can be done about that important issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="100224-0020.htm_para40"><a name="100224101000441">The Bill contains a number of important provisions. The most important involves carbon capture and storage, and the levy to fund it. It should be emphasised that, by common consent, we now have the most environmentally ambitious coal conditions in the world, and I hope that we are nearing a growing consensus on conditions for new coal-fired power stations. It is important to send the message about investment in those stations.</p>

<notus-date day="24" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>24 Feb 2010 : Column 407</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para0"><a name="100224101000442">Our framework is important not just because of the objective that carbon capture and storage should be ready for commercial deployment in 2020, but because of the demand. As my hon. Friend the Minister pointed out, no other country has produced the formulation that a substantial proportion of any new coal-fired power station must involve carbon capture and storage. We will not allow building of unabated coal-fired stations. I thank all Members, and indeed members of the wider community who take an interest in these important matters, for their campaigns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para1"><a name="100224101000443">The Bill represents a milestone in that regard, and it also represents a milestone because of the consumer levy. It will add 2 to 3 per cent. to bills in 2020-we should be up front about that-but it is the right thing to do if we are make the environmental progress needed in the power sector, and also to guarantee our energy security. We know that in today's world, the best form of energy security is low-carbon energy security, and we know that carbon capture and storage represents the only way we can achieve that in relation to coal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para2"><a name="100224101000444">The first and most important part of the Bill from Labour's point of view relates to the CCS incentive. However, we are aware that the low-carbon transition involves costs, and it is important for us to take all the action we can to protect consumers from those costs. There have been significant advances recently, such as those for people on prepayment meters; a number of Members have raised that matter in the House. A year ago, people on prepayment meters paid £41 more for their energy than standard credit customers; today that differential has, effectively, been eliminated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para3"><a name="100224101000445">There is much more to do, however, so the Bill makes a series of changes in a number of areas, including reform of the regulator's powers, sending a message to the regulator about the role of competition, but also including proactive work by the regulator. There is also the market power licence condition, to try to ensure greater fairness for consumers. Another of the changes-that to do with the information that must be given to customers-was debated on Report. That, too, has been a campaigning issue for Members. It is right that proper information should be provided to consumers. As has been said, either that will be done by Ofgem or it will have to be done by Government. We are sending out a clear message. This suite of new powers is very important. It significantly strengthens the ability of the regulator to ensure that the costs of energy are fair to all consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para4"><a name="100224101000446">Another aspect of the Bill that should be highlighted is the action on fuel poverty. A lot has been done on that, but at a time of higher energy prices, there are much greater upward pressures in respect of fuel poverty. We have taken action on incomes, prices and energy efficiency, but again, there is more to do. I should mention one important change. We have turned a voluntary commitment by the energy companies-negotiated by my predecessor in this policy area-to provide help for vulnerable consumers, into a compulsory or mandatory commitment. I suspect this power to provide a mandatory commitment to ensure fairness for the most vulnerable consumers will become more important as the years go by. We have set out a trajectory for the amount of money that will be spent under this power: in 2013-14 the total will be £300 million.</p>

It constitutes a redistribution to the poorest consumers, and it sits alongside other measures that we take to protect vulnerable consumers, such as the winter fuel payment. It is an important recognition that, at a time when the transition to low carbon imposes costs on consumers, we must do all we can to protect the vulnerable. It is a very important change, which will stand the test of time, and I hope it will be welcomed by all Members. There have also been amendments to the Bill clarifying that mandatory price support could provide help other than direct financial benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para6"><a name="100224101000448">It is a short Bill, but it puts in place important measures in respect of the transition to low carbon. The CCS levy delivers an unprecedented amount of investment, not just in Britain but around the world, into CCS, which is a crucial technology for the future. The strengthening of the powers of the regulator is essential moving forward, as we face upward pressures on prices. There is also specific support for the most vulnerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para7"><a name="100224101000449">I have no doubt that in the remainder of the debate Members will say that lots of other measures should have been included in the Bill. That is, at least, what the Opposition said on Second Reading, but we can never tell whether there will be consistency. What is clear, however, is that this Bill takes important steps forward. The task now is to send the Bill to the other place and to get the legislation on to the statute book, because the task is urgent and we all must ensure that we make speedy progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para8"><a name="100224101000450">I hope all Members will support the Bill. I think it makes important progress. We always welcome consensus on these issues, and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

 I would love to say what I think should be in this Bill, but I think that you would prevent me from doing so, Madam Deputy Speaker, so I shall have to contain myself. We can at least agree, in the spirit of consensus, that the great advantage of a Bill that does not contain much is that it provides little with which to disagree-and that is the position this evening. As the Secretary of State says, on energy-related issues more than most there is an imperative for the Government and the Opposition parties to maximise the scope for long-term agreement.</p>

Our most recent discussions have shown that the argument was won by my Conservative colleagues, and by the hon. Members for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) and for Angus (Mr. Weir), even if the majority that the Government enjoy allowed them to push their proposal through. I hope that Ministers will reflect on that expression, which clearly portrayed the feeling of the House in that very good debate.</p>

in his work on the Public Bill Committee. I pay tribute to all members of the Committee, in particular my hon. Friends the Members for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley), for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) and for St. Albans (Anne Main), who took the often technical subject matter to heart and gave their all.</p>

Friend the Member for Wealden for many Parliaments to come, but I am conscious also of the contribution made to the passage of this Bill by Members of the House who are stepping down at the forthcoming general election. The issues at stake in this Bill are of long-term importance and I wish to pay tribute to those retiring Members who served with distinction during the passage of the Bill. When future generations look back on this era and ask what our generation did about the energy and climate change crises of the 21st century, they will judge the record not only of Governments but of Parliaments. The judgment of history on us all will be the kinder for the contribution made by outstanding parliamentarians such as my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) and my hon. Friend the Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para12"><a name="100224101000455">I also recognise the consistent dedication of Members from all parties, in particular the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson), whose contribution today showed that he is the most vertebrate-I use his description-of Members of this House, the hon. Member for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen), who is also stepping down and who has made a contribution to these debates, and the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping), who is also retiring as Chair of a Select Committee. Their presence will be much missed in the House, but I trust that they will continue to enrich public life in other ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para13"><a name="100224101000456">With their work in mind, I wish that this Bill presented a more substantial legacy, but it is not entirely without substance. As the Secretary of State says, it provides a long-overdue framework for the demonstration of carbon capture and storage. Although we have lost ground to other countries, it is not too late for Britain to establish a leading position in this emerging global industry. If the Bill is passed, a Conservative Government would certainly not hesitate to use its provisions wherever that would be of help to the UK CCS industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para14"><a name="100224101000457">The second main area of provision in the Bill concerns the role of Ofgem. Any clarification in that regard is welcome, because as things stand it is not clear who is responsible for what in UK energy policy. In particular, we have seen Ofgem take an increasingly high-profile role in shaping policy at the strategic level, especially through the Project Discovery exercise. It is, of course, better to have some part of the machinery of government taking a comprehensive view of our future energy needs than to have no part doing so, but that part ought to be in the Department, in support of Ministers who are democratically accountable to Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para15"><a name="100224101000458">The third and final leg of the Bill deals with the introduction of schemes for the reduction of fuel poverty, including mandatory social price support. It is ironic that we should be legislating on this matter in the year that fuel poverty was due to be eliminated, according to some of the Government's targets: well, there we are. Some useful powers are included in this leg. The measures in the Bill to protect the most vulnerable customers are welcome as a last line of defence, but they do not  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para16"><a name="100224101000459">In our view, energy policy should have four main objectives: security, sustainability, economy and opportunity. Achieving all four will require an approach to policy that is both timely and comprehensive. The Bill is not timely but overdue, and it is not comprehensive but partial-yet every journey begins with a single step. This Bill takes more than a single step in the right direction. That is why, as it proceeds to another place, it does so with our support.</p>

 May I join the Secretary of State and his Conservative opposite number in paying tribute to all those who have carried out this bit of work with mutual respect and courtesy in a businesslike way? Everyone who has participated has done so in that spirit. I thank the Ministers who led the Bill through Committee for their engagement with the issues. They did not always deliver what we wanted, but they were willing to answer questions. On one subject, they did not even deliver the document we wanted-the Government's policy on how all homes might be warm homes-although at least they promised that it was somewhere and would be seen one day. We will still be waiting.</p>

He is not with us at this second, but throughout his career he has been unqualifiedly unrelenting in arguing methodically and effectively on these issues. We will miss him hugely in these debates. I am sad that he has decided to step down. I also pay special tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), who served with me in Committee, as well as to my hon.

It is better that we go down the road of trying to have carbon capture and storage to deal with our coal industry in the future, although it is to be regretted that we missed by just nine votes taking the opportunity to add emissions performance standards. I hope that the House of Lords gets the Bill soon enough to be able to remedy that. In the House of Lords, of course, the Government do not have a majority.</p>

measures to try to reduce what is colloquially called fuel poverty. It is sad that in this country so many people still pay more than 10p in the pound or £10 in £100-the definition of fuel poverty-for their fuel bills. It is sad that the target for the most vulnerable has not been met, that the number in that level of financial difficulty has gone up, and that the targets set for 2015 will not be met. I hope that the Bill will have reminded everybody to increase their efforts to deal with that problem and I regret that we were unable to win the argument to obtain a commitment to a policy that would make every home in this country a warm home over 10 years from the end of the current schemes in 2012. My colleagues and I will continue to argue for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para21"><a name="100224101000465">The greatest regret-although the Opposition parties' one success occurred in the same area-is that we did not manage to beef up the powers and effectiveness of the regulator. We achieved one success, in that the Minister of State was kind enough to recognise our request in Committee to require the energy companies to change the rules about pricing so that they must tell consumers in advance of any changes. The Government accepted that request and today we have amended the Bill to put that mechanism in it. That is welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para22"><a name="100224101000466">It is frustrating that other things that we think would have helped hugely to even out the balance between consumer and energy company-allowing easy comparison between tariffs, limiting the number of tariffs, stopping the veto power of the energy companies and showing, to expose the issue, how much profit the energy companies make from the individual consumer-have not been adopted. We will return to those issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para23"><a name="100224101000467">The Bill was published on 19 November. It has taken three months to get it through the House even though there was willingness on both sides to make progress. It had its Second Reading on 7 December and left Committee on 21 January-more than a month ago. I sincerely hope that the Government will not be as dilatory in taking the Bill to the Lords and giving them the opportunity to improve it. We all understand the pressures of the last Session of a Parliament, but if the Government are serious about energy policy as a priority, we expect that to be reflected in the House of Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para24"><a name="100224101000468">Let me end on this point. Two of the three great future challenges for our country are climate security and energy security. The third is economic security-by definition, they come together. Unless we remain absolutely clear, as Front Benchers have, that the threat to the planet from climate change caused by human activities is so serious that we need always to take precautionary action, a much more serious position will face the next Parliament, the next Government-whoever they are-and the Governments after them. Front Benchers have a duty to stand together on this issue, and our friends on the Conservative Benches must be tough with their colleagues who do not appear to understand the urgency of these matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para25"><a name="100224101000469">The Government, to their credit, understand the urgency. They came to the issue late, but they now understand where we need to go.

 I have listened to the hon.

However, I shall not elaborate on that as there is no need to do so now.</p>

I believe profoundly in British coal, which should be part of our energy security and part of our foreign policy, and I applaud those who are in favour of it, including those in Government circles. If we can develop proper carbon capture methods and get things right, we will be able to supplement the energy security that we really need. Those of us who are rather more sceptical, to say the least, about climate change as a whole will none the less acknowledge certain changes. It has been pretty cold recently, as I am sure people will acknowledge. There are important issues in the mix; carbon capture is definitely a plus, and wind farms are definitely a minus.</p>

I applaud the fact that they are pushing ahead with this agenda in this country, and I know from my personal involvement that they are also actively arguing the case in other countries, in particular the US. The UK is showing a crucial bit of evangelical zeal in persuading others that we need to embrace this technology as part of the mix.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="100224-0021.htm_para30"><a name="100224101000476">My final point has been touched on by others. This Bill is part of getting the whole mix right, especially in the encouragement that it gives to all forms of renewable forms of energy, but there are still inconsistencies in the Government's approach. I was a strong supporter of feed-in tariffs: I believe that it was right to introduce them and I am pleased that the Government finally adopted them, but I want to say a word on behalf of one small group of people engaged in renewable energy generation in my constituency. They use micro hydro to generate electricity and power. They often bring historic buildings back into use, but they are faced with a feed-in tariff system that involves a microgeneration certificate scheme that is wholly impractical and which in fact acts as a deterrent. Only this week, I had a message from one of them to say that they get 12p per kWh at the moment but that, as a result of the feed-in tariff, they will get only 9p.</p>

 I must admit that I find myself in a slightly strange position, in that the concerns that led me to seek this debate have actually been resolved. The case of the Beam Park West prison site demonstrates that sometimes in Parliament, one can be overtaken by fast-moving events.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="100224-0022.htm_para10"><a name="100224101000847">I shall explain. I requested this Adjournment debate on 9 February and it was granted on 11 February. The idea was to present a reasoned, constructive contribution to the ongoing debate regarding the proposed Beam Park West prison, which was planned to be located in Dagenham, in my constituency. I also wanted, again in a rational way, to articulate some of the many concerns that had been raised with me locally and give a voice to local residents in a process that, like the siting of any proposed prison, has been difficult. I anticipated that the debate would give me a chance to lay out the responses that we had received to our local consultations on the plans, not least because the local authority consultation finished earlier this week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="100224-0022.htm_para11"><a name="100224101000848">However, on 12 February, the Ministry of Justice announced that it would not proceed with the proposed prison development, which accounts for the strange position that I find myself in this evening. I readily concede that the decision was not singularly driven by the agreement of the parliamentary authorities to this somewhat small, insignificant debate in the parliamentary calendar. However, as a politician I am quite prepared to take credit-even I realise that it is an unlikely turn of events, though. I doubt that my being awarded the debate was a determining factor in the process of public policy making in the MOJ.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="100224-0022.htm_para12"><a name="100224101000849">Joking aside, the announcement on the 12th of this month somewhat alters the nature of my contribution. Instead, I now wish to take this opportunity to place on record, on behalf of many thousands of my constituents, my deep appreciation of and thanks to Ministers and officials for their open dialogue with us regarding the proposed project, over an arc of 10 months. I also wish to put on record my gratitude to local people for their thoughtful and constructive contributions throughout the discussion, despite blatant and cynical electioneering by another political party-not necessarily the Opposition. Finally, I shall raise a number of points on the process and the future of the Beam Park West site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="100224-0022.htm_para13"><a name="100224101000850">It would be useful at the beginning briefly to review the cycle of events regarding the proposed prison development. On 27 April 2009, the Ministry of Justice announced Beam Park West as the designated site for a 1,500-inmate, category B prison, the rationale being the projected prison expansion to 96,000 inmates by 2014 and the need for extra capacity. The Government announced the need for five new prisons, or 7,500 places, alongside the closure of 5,000 inefficient places. On Monday this week, the Justice Secretary returned to that subject when discussing prisoner early release schemes. The current prison population stands at some 83,800, which is up from 60,300 in 1997. We now have well over 86,000 places in terms of operational capacity. He reiterated this week that the plans for 2014 are on track given the capacity building programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para0"><a name="100224101000851">Following the April announcement, we raised a series of technical issues regarding the proposed development, including the required transport infrastructure, not least because of earlier community fears that the new Mayor of London was not necessarily in favour of the extension of the docklands light railway to Dagenham and beyond. We were also concerned about the costings of the project; the implications of the time line of the development for the local community; the planning process, not least because of the existence of an urban development corporation in east London; and the land remediation and decontamination that would be required because the development would have been on the old Ford car plant site. Moreover, we raised questions on the consultation process that was envisaged and many other issues, including how to get local people genuinely involved and to feel that they had a stake in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para1"><a name="100224101000852">I met the appropriate officials on a number of times, as well as the Secretary of State, the Minister and her predecessor. To his great credit, the Secretary of State visited the site in October 2009. He canvassed opinion and discussed the concerns of the local people by literally going door to door in the community opposite the proposed prison site. That was a most impressive and honest contribution to the debate, and it was very much appreciated in the locality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para2"><a name="100224101000853">At the same time, technical analysis of the site revealed the scale of possible flooding and the decontamination required. Dealing with those problems would have added to the cost of what was already a £1.2 billion project, excluding VAT and the cost of purchasing the site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para3"><a name="100224101000854">That led to the 12 February announcement, but a couple of earlier developments are worth noting. There was an earlier plan for an 800-inmate prison on the Beam Reach 5 site, which literally lies a few hundred yards from the site we are discussing tonight but which is in the neighbouring London borough of Havering. Following the publication in December 2002 of Lord Carter of Coles's report, "Securing the future: Proposals for the efficient and sustainable use of custody in England and Wales", a list of potential sites for 2,500-place Titan prisons was drawn up. It was subsequently revealed under a freedom of information request that that list included no fewer than 12 sites, but not the Beam Park West site. That was acknowledged in a written parliamentary answer on 1 June.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para4"><a name="100224101000855">The Beam Park West site was identified during an exercise to identify potential sites for a prison in London-a search that was undertaken jointly with the London Development Agency. Of interest here is the revelation in a written answer on 3 June that that joint search followed a meeting between MOJ officials and the Mayor of London in mid-2008. The suggestion that has been made to me is that the Beam Park West site was preferred by the Mayor of London to the earlier site, which was confusingly known as Beam Reach 5 because it was situated in the London borough of Barking and Dagenham rather than in Havering. I do not know whether that is true, not least because the Mayor did not respond to me regarding that and a number of other issues related to the proposed prison. However, it is curious that the Beam Park West site was identified even though it was not on the earlier extensive site list, and following a meeting with the new Mayor, who had in turn been heavily lobbied by the neighbouring borough prior to becoming Mayor. I simply suggest that the  <br>

move was the result of a nudge across a borough border following a discussion with the new Mayor. That should not be the source of any local celebrations. Interestingly, the new location was much closer to many of the Havering residents in South Hornchurch and Elm Park than the earlier identified site location. Indeed, the proposed second prison would have been much bigger-not an insignificant factor for local residents. I raise this point not least because a letter to the Mayor containing a series of questions about his involvement in this process remains unanswered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para5"><a name="100224101000856">Given the announcement of the Beam Park West site on 29 April, the task at hand was to create opportunities to contribute and measure the community responses regarding the proposed new site-not in a melodramatic way, shouting and screaming, but to seek a thorough understanding of local feelings about the proposition. To that end, we decided to survey some 32,000 households in the local community, covering some 65,000 individual residents. The Barking and Dagenham council also decided to consult formally the residents in the two specific wards located next to the proposed site, Village ward and River ward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para6"><a name="100224101000857">The responses to the consultation were overwhelming. We received more than 17,000 responses to our surveys of local opinion. More than 90 per cent. of the responses were against the proposed development, mostly on the grounds of its residential setting, but also because the local council had earmarked the site for major sports facilities for local people. A Facebook group registering concerns regarding the proposed development managed to secure well over 14,100 participants. With the aid of an online survey, as well as petitions and responses to other leaflets, we offered various opportunities for local contributions to be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para7"><a name="100224101000858">Moreover, more than 1,000 responses were made to the council survey in the two wards surveyed. In the latter survey, 8 per cent. of those responding backed plans for the use of the site for the proposed prison development. Some 76 per cent. of the Dagenham residents surveyed signalled support for the council's plans to use the site for housing, small industrial units and community facilities. The council are now seeking a meeting with the Mayor of London and senior executives of the London Development Agency to fast forward the regeneration of this site to benefit the local community.</p>

 I very much welcome this decision. As the hon. Gentleman has said, the Beam Park West site lies on the border between our constituencies. He has rightly pointed out the opposition to the original plans for Beam Park West in his constituency. I presume that he is also aware of the opposition in places such as the Mardyke estate in South Hornchurch, which is also very proximate. Does he share my view that this decision puts the issue to rest and will hopefully allow the regeneration of this part of the Thames Gateway along the A1306, which is in need of investment, jobs and skills?</p>

 I agree, and while I have some concerns about the Mayor's position, I do not seek to make any party political points across the Chamber tonight. The hon.

some hope in terms of regeneration that can change the nature of the community more positively than people feared-as they made clear in various surveys of the proposals for the prison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para8"><a name="100224101000861">I have several conclusions from our experience since April last year. First-and this is not said often enough in this place-I wish to put on record my appreciation for the work of the Department, the Secretary of State, the Minister of State and their respective officials. At every turn, questions have been answered, views have been respected, meetings have been organised and contributions welcomed in the broader discussion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para9"><a name="100224101000862">I think that I can tentatively suggest that, in April, the process did not begin that well. The decision to build the prison on the site was announced at very short notice. Notwithstanding that, however, at every stage, the Department has respected the concerns of local people and listened courteously. That needs to be said. It was very much to the credit of the Secretary of State that he came down and walked the site, and most importantly listened to the concerns of local people. I would like to say thank you, on behalf of local people, for how the process has been handled, notwithstanding the slightly bumpy start. That is a great credit to the Department and the Government themselves. Early difficulties have been more than compensated for by the subsequent desire of the Department to involve and listen to local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para10"><a name="100224101000863">Briefly, I would like to put on the record my appreciation of the approach adopted by the London borough of Barking and Dagenham. At every turn, it has sought to listen to local concerns and to articulate them to the Government in an informed and measured way. It refused to assume that the decision was a given, and sought to raise technical issues regarding, for example, planning, flooding, proximity to residents and how it related to future housing and infrastructural developments in south Dagenham and across the Thames Gateway, as the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para11"><a name="100224101000864">The announcement of the site location, on 27 April, occurred on the day that a new council leader was appointed in the borough of Barking and Dagenham. Liam Smith, the council leader, was actually the councillor in the River ward in Dagenham, and became the leader a few hours after the announcement-actually without any knowledge of the decision in his own ward. It was a major test for the new leader, and I suggest that he has done a great job in providing a balanced, measured response and articulating the concerns of his ward residents and the wider community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para12"><a name="100224101000865">The calm reporting of the local papers-the <i> Barking and Dagenham Post, </i>the <i> Barking and Dagenham Recorder </i>and the <i> East London Advertiser-</i>also deserve to be acknowledged, as we reach the end of this process. Again, I want to record my thanks to them throughout these difficult months. Most importantly, however, I would like to thank all the local people who made a contribution to this debate. Thousands and thousands of local people have taken the trouble to contribute, to email, to respond to surveys, to phone and to sign petitions. The tenor of the contributions throughout has been mature and thoughtful. It is a credit to the people of Barking and Dagenham and the southern part of Havering that they have made their contributions in such a constructive form. These contributions have been a credit to the community, and I salute the people for the way they have come together to form a voice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para13"><a name="100224101000866">Finally, however, I would like to register a note of concern that is very much alive in the community. On 10 June, the London Assembly called on the Mayor to oppose the plans for the prison. This was proposed unanimously. Yet we heard nothing from the Mayor. Indeed, I find it curious that the Secretary of State was prepared to meet local residents and discuss the issues and that the Major never entered into such discussions in my constituency. Moreover, following the Mayor's announcement we have heard nothing from him apart from grumbling about prison capacity-in effect, opposing the 12 February announcement. Indeed, the Mayor was in the borough last week and said nothing on the prison decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para14"><a name="100224101000867">The Beam Park West site is London Development Agency land controlled by the Mayor. We know that he met with Ministry of Justice officials prior to this site being designated and that other parties saw the relocation of the prison to the Beam Park West location as a local victory. Many people locally can only conclude that the Mayor actually wants to locate the prison on this site in Barking and Dagenham. Indeed, the shadow Justice Secretary said this week, in the Chamber, that the decision</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para15"><a name="100224101000868">The implication of that viewpoint, alongside the muteness of the Mayor since 12 February, is that this prison plan could be dusted down and re-presented depending on the election results in a few weeks' time. That is a real concern locally, and the next stage of our campaign is to develop alternative uses for the land for the benefit of the local community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para16"><a name="100224101000869">Overall, I do not want that last point to detract from the real appreciation in the community for the recent Government decision. I personally respect the way the Department has handled this issue. Most importantly, I want to pay credit to my constituents for how they have engaged with this issue, the outcome of which is a tribute to local democracy and, more generally, public policy making in this country. Thank you very much.</p>

 I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas), who spoke in a typically modest way about his own contribution to this story. It can be characterised as a success on his part in representing the views of his constituents well. He set out the extent to which he consulted them, and the extent to which they responded to that consultation.

professionalism. I therefore add my thanks to those that my hon. Friend has put on the record for the professional job that my officials do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para18"><a name="100224101000872">It is certainly correct to say that Adjournment debates rarely, if ever, lead to enormous shifts in policy, and it must be said that my hon. Friend's suspicion that this debate might not lead to the change in policy is probably correct. However, it is certainly the case that an Adjournment debate can be the final straw in getting points across-in this case that has happened as part of a campaign during which he has sought to represent the views of his constituents-and getting them across in such a way that the Department can hear them, as he has acknowledged has happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para19"><a name="100224101000873">On 27 April 2009 my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor announced plans to build five 1,500-place prisons, as part of a programme to increase prison capacity to 96,000 places by 2014. Those prisons will be safe, secure and effective places-the prison that we were considering at Beam Park West would have been category B-that can help prisoners to deal with their offending and develop the work, education and life skills, which they may have been missing, that they need to turn their lives around. My right hon. Friend also announced that our Department was working to secure sites for the first two of those prisons-one at Runwell, in the borough of Chelmsford in Essex, and one at Beam Park West, in the London borough of Barking and Dagenham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o513"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para20"><a name="100224101000874">Those sites were chosen not out of convenience, or in an attempt to cause trouble for the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) or my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham. We try to build prisons so that prisoners can serve their sentences closer to their home areas. There is no doubt that there is a dearth of prison places in and around London, so we need sites in the area-suitable sites, of course-on which to build more places and ensure that offenders from in or around London have a chance to serve their sentence in a prison closer to home. We know that ensuring that capacity increases the chances that those serving sentences of imprisonment will be more able and more likely to reintegrate successfully into society, put their offending behind, and learn to live law-abiding and useful lives when they come out. That is why we are searching in and around London for sites for prisons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o514"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para21"><a name="100224101000875">However, as the announcement of 12 February 2010 has shown, there is nothing to say that we have fixed views about the particular sites that we investigate. It is perfectly normal for us to investigate a site, declare an intention to build on it and then find that it is not suitable for various reasons, or that other issues have led us to re-evaluate our initial interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o515"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para22"><a name="100224101000876">The Beam Park West site was originally identified following a site search exercise in the London area, which initially found it to be an appropriate location for the development of one of our 1,500-place prisons. We subsequently undertook some due diligence work on the site, including environmental investigation work. That work demonstrated that the flood risk on the site was higher than had previously been thought, and indicated that the required mitigation was likely to be more extensive and costly than was originally envisaged. That also presented a planning risk for the site, along with other factors, such as the allocation of the site for housing in the emerging local development plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o516"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para23"><a name="100224101000877">We have also listened to the views expressed by local residents since our interest in the site was announced, although we were yet to conduct a full public consultation into the proposals. I might add that it is a bit difficult to see how we could have conducted a more comprehensive consultation on the proposals than my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham instigated himself. We should thank him for his efforts in that regard, because he has enabled us fully to understand the local concerns without having to conduct our own consultations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o517"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para24"><a name="100224101000878">In the light of all these considerations, the decision was taken not to proceed with the site at Beam Park West. In October last year we announced that we would begin a new site search exercise for further sites in the priority areas of London, north Wales, the north-west and west Yorkshire, with the purpose of identifying sites on which to build new prisons closer to the homes of the offenders we expect to serve their sentences in them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o518"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para25"><a name="100224101000879">As I said, there is a significant shortfall of prison places in London, and it therefore remains very much a priority area for new prison places. There are currently around 11,400 more prisoners from London than places available in the capital, and the most recent population projections show that the numbers of prisoners from London could increase further by mid-2015. In the light of that, we are still looking for good suitable sites in and around London. Locating new prisons in the greatest areas of need will allow us to keep prisoners closer to their home areas. This will help to ensure that important family ties and other links with local communities can be maintained, which will assist with prisoner rehabilitation.</p>

I want to make it clear to all hon. Members that we are committed to being as open and transparent as possible about these sites. I hope it will be possible for any other hon.  <br>

Member, at the relevant time, if they have reason to discuss these matters with us when we identify further sites, to report the same experience as my hon. Friend has conveyed to the House today, of our openness and transparency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o520"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para27"><a name="100224101000881">Once a site has been identified, consultation with local MPs, local authorities and residents will be undertaken in order to achieve the most open and transparent process possible. I know that an announcement that we are seeking to build a prison in a particular place is not always popular, although it can be more popular in some places than in others. There is variation in the response that we receive. Once consultation has been concluded, and all the views have been taken into account and the due diligence has been done, if development is considered to be appropriate, we will seek to acquire that site with an appropriate planning consent, and to build the prison. The Government remain committed to providing more prison places to ensure that the most dangerous, serious and persistent offenders are locked up, and we are still on track to provide 96,000 places by 2014.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o521"><a name="100224-0023.htm_para28"><a name="100224101000882">I am happy to be able to respond to my hon. Friend's debate this evening by saying that in my experience as Minister for prisons, rarely has a campaign been so effective and totally successful in what appears to me to have been quite a short time-although it must have appeared to him to be an age. I shall finish by congratulating him on that effort, and by saying that his input has been valuable in conveying to us the views of his constituents and the local stakeholders in the area. We thank him for that, and we will continue to be open and transparent about our intentions in respect of particular sites, which we are still seeking.</p>
