Is she also aware that the latest figures show that patrol officers are so burdened by form filling and paperwork that they are forced to spend exactly the same amount of time on paperwork in an office as they do out on patrol?

 Will my right hon.

There is a disparity of provision among railway lines and stations. Sometimes, the Home Office forces cover railway stations but the British Transport police do not. There is not a comprehensive, coherent approach to the issue. I urge her to look at it again and probe, and not to be fobbed off by chief constables. The provision is inadequate and patchy.</p>

 No, I do not. As I emphasised to the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton), the figures have identified a reduction in the time being spent on paperwork. There is investment in new technology&#151;for example, the &#163;50 million that is being turned into 10,000 mobile data devices to enable police officers to stay out on the streets instead of having to return to the police station. The additional number of police officers, supported by police community support officers and other staff, means that we have a more visible, more reassuring police force than we have had before and that police officers are able to spend their time doing the things that make a difference to the public. I commend them for their efforts in doing that.</p>

 We are in relatively early days in terms of spending the &#163;50 million and translating it into the 10,000 hand-held devices. When I speak to police officers who are using the devices, they say that they are helping them to get information more quickly about people whom they are stopping. Information can be entered there and then, which means that they do not have to return to the station. That means that there is more efficiency in catching and tracking people whom the police might be stopping in the streets and gives more time for them to be visibly out on patrol. That is why the devices are being welcomed. This is investment that the Government have been willing to put into ensuring that our police services have all the tools that they need to protect the public.</p>

 Will my hon.

The problem with the DNA database is that thousands of completely innocent people are on it, including 100,000 under-18s, yet thousands more who have committed serious crimes are not on it. Will she commit the Government to doing much better to ensure that the DNA of those most likely to commit crimes is captured?

 I cannot quite believe the torrent of misinformation from the hon. Gentleman. Let us be clear: more than 87 per cent. of under-18s who had their DNA taken were charged, convicted, cautioned or given a final warning, and only 12.8 per cent. were not. That reflects the reality with regard to under-18s. Other countries are looking closely at Britain&#146;s protocols and processes.

It was, of course, after the handover of Hong Kong in 1997 that Gurkhas could anticipate a period of service in the UK; before 1997, that was extremely unlikely, so the difference in approach remains important. We are using 1997 as a dividing line, but we are taking a more nuanced approach, involving consideration of individual circumstances&#151;including ties to the UK, but also the contribution to this country&#151;in respect of Gurkhas who retired from the armed forces before the handover of Hong Kong.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to point to the British crime survey figures, which show a reduction in violent crime of more than a third. Notwithstanding that fact, what we are doing in respect of violent crime in London and elsewhere is to ensure that we have a tough enforcement approach in which we support the police and that we have prevention and diversion schemes alongside it. We know that if we are going to solve this problem, it is not just a matter of increasing the sentences available to the authorities and tough enforcement of the law, but of working with communities.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that point. I remember the petition that he presented, and he is quite right to highlight the tougher sentences made available to the courts. The maximum sentence available for possession has increased from two to four years and changes in the presumption to prosecute have been made, as it has been extended to 16 and 17-year-olds. It is quite right to say that tough enforcement of the law is one part of the solution to the problem of knife and other violent crimes, as people have to be made to realise that there will be consequences to their actions.</p>

 The Government recently published their youth alcohol action plan, which sets out a new tiered approach to tackle young people consuming alcohol in public places. All tiers will closely involve parents to prevent an escalation of problems. However, when young people are creating serious problems for their communities, we will also address the behaviour of parents through parenting contracts and parenting orders.</p>

 I hope that the Minister will pay particular attention to the recommendation of the Bassetlaw young people&#146;s alcohol panel, which was presented to the Home Secretary last week. Does he agree that it is vital to take account of the views of young people themselves about how problems such as alcohol and, indeed, knife crime can be solved?</p>

 I know that, along with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, my hon. Friend has met young people to present his findings. I also had the privilege of meeting young people in his constituency a few months ago to discuss the issues with them. He is right to stress the importance of involving young people in the search for solutions to alcohol-linked and other crimes. The Government are already considering some of the points that they have made, and intend to deal with others. For instance, we strongly support the idea of making parents take more responsibility for their children when they act in antisocial and, indeed, criminal ways. We will take account of the reports from my hon. Friend and the young people in his constituency in determining our policy.</p>

 My constituency is experiencing significant problems involving young people drinking alcohol in public places, often hidden in drinks such as orange juice. They obtain their alcohol from small shops and off-licences. Will the Home Secretary consider much tougher penalties for those who dispense alcohol to young people, and bear in mind the fact that the &#147;pile it high, sell it cheap&#148; method of selling alcohol, rather than the existence of licensed premises, is the root of the problem?</p>

 The hon. Lady has made an important point. As she will know, we have conducted a number of under-age sales campaigns involving action against retailers. She will have noted that over the years the proportion of small retailers who fail the test has fallen from about 50 to 15 per cent. However, we are aware that we need to take further action against retailers, and I want all local authorities to use the powers that are available to them.</p>

I do not anticipate restrictions in the student route being so draconian that overseas students cease to be a source of labour for the agricultural industry or others, but perhaps we should schedule that meeting on the back of that statement of intent, when it is published.</p>

That is why I announced the establishment of a new national knife crime programme to focus action in eight police force areas. The work, being led by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alf Hitchcock, will include stepping up targeted stop-and-search operations, a tough approach to reviewing the licences of bars and clubs where there is violence, working with accident and emergency departments to improve information sharing, and providing knife referral schemes for young people convicted of knife-carrying so that they understand the full consequences of their actions.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and she and her constituents can be further reassured by the fact that violence against the person recorded in the Bridgend crime and disorder reduction partnership area fell by 12 per cent. over the last year. It is because we need to focus on those areas where knife crime is a particular issue that I have asked DAC Hitchcock to focus the knife crime programme in those police force areas where we need to make the most difference and where knife crime is, understandably a concern for people both locally and nationally.</p>

 The impact of knife crime has been felt all across the country, including in my borough of Bexley where, tragically, there have been three murders involving knives during the course of this year. Is the Secretary of State aware that my constituents feel that her comments at the weekend show that she is rather out of touch with what the public want? What they really want is to have the police on the beat, and for them to be more freed from paperwork and restrictions so that they can spend more time catching the perpetrators of knife crime.</p>

 And that is precisely what the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents are getting with neighbourhood policing teams in every area, the Flanagan review recommendations that this Government are putting into operation, and more mobile data machines so that the police can stay out on the beat. However, I believe that they also want the investment that this Government have put into providing the knife arches and search wands and other tools for the police to use to collect knives and catch those carrying them. They also want the investment we have put into sending a very strong message to young people that carrying a knife does not make them safer, but makes them more likely to have that knife used against them or use it against somebody else, with all the tragic consequences that brings. There is not one simple answer to this, which is why we have a wide-ranging strategy to tackle knife crime including, as the hon. Gentleman rightly says, ensuring that there are police officers and police community support officers visible on our streets, and I hope he will support the development of neighbourhood policing.</p>

 No, it is not. May I welcome the hon. and learned Gentleman to his role? I hope that he remains in that role, even when others return to this House. What I made clear over the weekend is that I believe, as I said in my first answer to topical questions, it is important that we develop knife referral schemes that will enable young people caught in possession of knives to face up to the consequences of their actions. Such schemes should include their attendance at weapons awareness workshops, where graphic and detailed information on what happens when someone is stabbed and what the wider consequences are for them and their families, as well as for the victim, the victim&#146;s family and the community, are brought home to them. Such schemes could include visits to hospitals, or doctors visiting them so that they can talk to health care professionals, hear about the graphic impact of knife wounds and better understand what happens when somebody is stabbed. We are not&#151;I have never said that we are&#151;proposing to bring young people into wards to see patients.</p>

I get the impression that, in fact, she has slipped away from her previous statement on Saturday that in order to make people realise there is nothing glamorous about carrying a knife, knife offenders would be taken into accident and emergency departments in hospitals. I think that she has now abandoned that, but I would be grateful if she would give confirmation. Moreover, if, as I believe, she has abandoned it, what sort of impression will that send out to the public? It will give the impression that the Government are constructing policy in three days and abandoning it in three hours, and that this is gimmickry.</p>

Of course, I never said&#151;nor would this be sensible&#151;that young people would be trailed through accident and emergency wards while people are being treated.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on House of Lords Reform. I am also today publishing a White Paper on the subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="80714-0003.htm_para1"><a name="0807141000153">In my statement to the House on 19 July last year, I said that I would continue to lead cross-party talks on reform of the Lords. Those talks have included Front-Bench representatives of the main parties from both Houses, as well as representatives of the Cross-Bench peers and the bishops. The talks have made good progress and I am most grateful to all those who have served on the group. I pay tribute to them for their constructive contributions and readiness to consider alternative proposals. Our discussions have been much informed by the work of others, including the Public Administration Committee, informal cross-party groups, the Cunningham report and above all the report of the royal commission under the chairmanship of the noble Lord Wakeham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="80714-0003.htm_para2"><a name="0807141000154">The basis for our talks was the outcome of the votes in the House of Commons in March 2007. The House voted then for a wholly elected second Chamber, and for a mainly elected second Chamber and rejected all other alternatives by a large margin. Their lordships took a different view and voted for a fully appointed second Chamber and rejected all other alternatives by a large margin. However, as I said in my statement on 19 July last year, reflecting the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on 3 July last, work taking forward House of Lords reform had to be based on the will of the House of Commons, which is the primary Chamber in our legislature. The proposals we make today are consistent with the 2005 manifesto commitments of the three main political parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="80714-0003.htm_para3"><a name="0807141000155">The White Paper sets out how a wholly or mainly elected second Chamber might be created within a bicameral legislature in which the House of Commons retains primacy. The White Paper reflects the considerable consensus reached in the cross-party talks. Inevitably, we did not reach agreement on all issues. In some instances, those taking part have asked that the White Paper record their difference of view, which of course it does.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="80714-0003.htm_para4"><a name="0807141000156">As I indicated to the House in my statement on 19 July last, our intention is that the product of the cross-party talks would be the basis of a</p>

It was a key recommendation of Lord Wakeham&#146;s royal commission, and one that has since enjoyed strong consensus within the cross-party group, that Members should serve a single, non-renewable term of three electoral cycles&#151;that is, of between 12 and 15 years. The proposal reflects the  <br>

proposals in the February 2007 White Paper. Under this system, elections would be held at the same time as those for Members of this House, so as to minimise disruption to the business of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="80714-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0807141000159">The current House of Lords has more than 700 members. The Government intend that the reformed second Chamber should be significantly smaller, not more than between 400 and 450 members, maybe fewer, and that costs should be similar or reduced. We envisage all members of a reformed second Chamber making a full contribution to its work and we would welcome views on its size. Single, non-renewable terms would help to provide a membership for the second Chamber that continued to be distinct from that of this House and could hence bring an added dimension to the work of Parliament. It is proposed that this be reinforced by the use of large constituencies for elections to the second Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80714-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0807141000160">I referred earlier to the primacy of this House. Analysis of other countries&#146; arrangements, including that set out in chapter 5 of last year&#146;s White Paper, and consideration of our own history shows that primacy does not depend on the fact that this House is elected while the Lords is not, rather that primacy is rooted in the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 and the conventions that govern relations between the two Houses. However, with the introduction of elected Members in the second Chamber, we have to ensure that the mandate of this House, and of the Government it sustains, continues to hold sway. The membership of a reformed second Chamber should be such that it could not challenge that mandate. That is why we saw considerable merit in staggered elections, with a third of Members returned at each election. In that way, the electoral basis of the reformed second Chamber could never, as a whole, be more recent than that of this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80714-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0807141000161">The cross-party group considered at some length possible voting systems. The White Paper presents detailed modelling on the possible&#151;I underline possible&#151;effects of each of four electoral systems for elections to a second Chamber. The systems are first past the post, the alternative vote, the single transferable vote and open or semi-open list systems. The Government would welcome views on the choice of system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80714-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0807141000162">The group considered the powers of a reformed second Chamber. We took the view that it would be wrong to presuppose conflict between this House and the other reformed House. The working relationship between the two Houses currently functions well, and we could see no reason why it should not continue to do so. Creative tension between the Houses can lead to better government, not to an undermining of the primacy of this House. If conflict arose in the future, it would, as now, be for both Houses to devise a way through that conflict. In advance of that, we identified no persuasive case for reducing the powers of a wholly or mainly elected second Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80714-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0807141000163">Given the Commons votes last March, the White Paper does not take a view between the options, which were voted on in favour, of either a 100 per cent. or an 80 per cent. elected second Chamber, but the White Paper includes detail on a possible 20 per cent. appointed element, should the latter option be chosen. There would then be a statutory appointments commission and published criteria for appointments. Any appointed members would serve for three electoral cycles in the same way as elected Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80714-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0807141000164">If the second Chamber became fully elected, there could be no seats appointed or reserved, including for Church of England bishops. But in recognition of the wide and important role played by the Lords Spiritual in the life of the nation and the special constitutional position of the Church, we propose that their representation should continue in a mainly elected House. In that instance, their numbers would not contribute to the 20 per cent. appointed element.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80714-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0807141000165">The White Paper includes proposals on eligibility and on disqualification. Because of the long non-renewable terms for which they would serve, we were attracted to the system discussed in the White Paper of recall ballots for elected members of the second Chamber, with analogous arrangements for any appointed members, but those would apply only after the first of the three parliamentary terms that members would serve. Again, the Government would welcome views on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80714-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0807141000166">We also propose that members of a reformed second Chamber should receive salaries, with the Senior Salaries Review Body asked to advise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80714-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0807141000167">The transition to a reformed second Chamber raises a number of important issues, not least about the future arrangements for existing Members of the Lords. It is those Members who, collectively, enable the Chamber effectively to fulfil its key roles of scrutinising legislation, conducting investigations and holding the Government to account. The Government and, I know, the whole House greatly value the work of the Lords and the contributions of individual Members to it. However, it was made clear in 1999 that the rights of hereditary peers to sit and vote would be removed, as part of the next phase of Lords reform. The Government therefore propose that, following legislation and during the transition to a reformed second Chamber, there should be no further by-elections to fill vacancies for hereditary peers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80714-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0807141000168">The February 2007 White Paper included a proposal from me that a reformed House should be 50 per cent. elected and 50 per cent. appointed. One of the many merits that I saw in that proposal was that it would have enabled existing life peers to remain for life if they had wished to do so. But that 50:50 proposal was comprehensively rejected by both Houses. The votes in this House for a wholly or 80 per cent. elected House mean that the context for the transition to a reformed second Chamber has changed. There may not be an appointed element in a reformed second Chamber. If there is, it may comprise 90 or many fewer Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80714-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0807141000169">A discussion is therefore now required to determine how far the rights of life peers to sit and vote during any transition to a reformed second Chamber should continue. The White Paper sets out three options for managing this transition: first, for all existing life peers to leave in tranches, allied to the three electoral cycles; secondly, for all to leave on the third cycle; and thirdly, to remain as now for life. Again, the Government would welcome views on those options.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80714-0004.htm_para12"><a name="0807141000170">The cross-party group faithfully and assiduously followed the mandate set for it by the Commons in March 2007. We are now keen for there to be a wide-ranging and thorough debate on our proposals. But I hope that all members of the cross-party group share my view that to have got this far on such an important but highly complex issue is a considerable achievement. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><br>

I think so, and I am very grateful for the approbation of the House in that respect. As I said in my statement on 19 July, our intention now is to continue to develop the consensus around a comprehensive package for reform of the House of Lords.</p>

As the Justice Secretary said, it is a Government document. Many of the proposals reflect areas of consensus in the cross-party talks, but there are areas of disagreement. Will he accept that the question of the electoral system for any reformed second Chamber is far from settled? We believe that that system should mirror that for this House: a first-past-the-post system based on recognisable constituencies of our historic cities and counties. We would strongly resist any move to introduce an electoral system based on proportional representation. Would not simultaneous elections to both Houses involving two different electoral systems be a recipe for confusion?</p>

The United States Senate has only 100 members for a population of 300 million people, albeit in a federal system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80714-0004.htm_para18"><a name="0807141000179">The issue of transition could be highly contentious. The White Paper suggests that life peers could remain members of a reformed second Chamber even after transition was complete. How could reform possibly be considered complete while life peers remained in a second Chamber, perhaps for decades? The White Paper also suggests that the remaining hereditary peers would go at the completion of transition. Does not the Justice Secretary accept that given that the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine, gave an undertaking that the elected hereditary peers would remain until stage 2 of reform had taken place, it would be invidious and inequitable to remove those remaining hereditary peers sitting in the other place as long as the 400 life peers created under Labour continued to sit? While the largest number of Members of this House voted last year for a 100 per cent. elected second Chamber&#151;I was one of them&#151;is it not the case, in view of the contrary position taken by the Lords themselves, that retaining an appointed minority would provide the best hope of consensus?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80714-0004.htm_para19"><a name="0807141000180">We welcome the special place that the Government intend to reserve for the Church of England bishops in a mainly elected, reformed second Chamber. However, does the Justice Secretary agree that retired justices of the supreme court, who would not be appointed to the second Chamber automatically, would make every bit as valuable a contribution to its work as the Lords Spiritual?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80714-0004.htm_para20"><a name="0807141000181">Reform should not be supported unless it strengthens the authority of the second Chamber in holding Governments to account. However, a reformed second Chamber should not seek to compete with this House, which must continue to have primacy. Is it not the case that both Houses of Parliament need strengthening to hold the Executive to account? Does the Justice Secretary agree that the next reform of the Lords should be a democratic one and that we should be wary of any proposals that might cement the current arrangements, especially by allowing an entire second Chamber to be appointed by an unelected quango?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="80714-0004.htm_para21"><a name="0807141000182">The White Paper represents the next step after last year&#146;s votes in the House for a mainly or wholly elected second Chamber, but is it not clear that the change envisaged is a radical one? It is not so much the reform of the House of Lords as the creation of a new second Chamber. Reform of the Lords has been proposed and attempted for the past 100 years. Will the Secretary of State for Justice indicate when he thinks the proposals will be translated into a Bill? It is right that Members in this House should reflect on and debate the issues carefully. We Opposition Members will continue to seek consensus on a way forward.</p>

election manifesto: it is to make sure that all our MPs vote at the earliest opportunity in the next Parliament for just this sort of reform package. However, if people are to be elected to the second Chamber&#151;it will be called &#147;the Senate&#148;, I think&#151;in thirds, for one term only, there is no justified argument that those elected with a party affiliation should not proportionately reflect the public&#146;s votes for the parties at the election.

The only logical position is that all the hereditary peers should go at the beginning of the democratic process and that the life peers should go, at the latest, at the end of the three elections, probably by thirds over the period. In the White Paper, the Government express the preference that we have discussed: that the elections for the second Chamber should take place on the same day as the general election. However, does the Secretary of State agree that there is a strong case for our needing a fixed-term Parliament for the House of Commons and for there to be, at half-time intervals, elections for the second Chamber as well as for the devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and for any future devolved Administration in England?</p>

If we are seeking a Chamber that is complementary, we must have a system of election that does not get in the way of Members of this House. That is a serious anxiety. We therefore propose single terms, although these Members would not be as responsible to their electorates as is any Member of this House. At the same time, it is important, in our view, that there should be recall mechanisms of some kind to ensure, for example, that as well as attendance requirements, the natural check on Members&#146; assiduity and behaviour, which takes place very quickly at each subsequent election, would not arise under this system.</p>

It is unusual for the second Chamber of such a large and important country as the United Kingdom to be wholly appointed. Over the years, we have tried to increase the legitimacy of the other place, but it is still appointed.

 I congratulate the Justice Secretary on the progress that he has made in bringing forward proposals that give effect to the views that the House expressed. I would urge him strongly to commit to as open an electoral system as possible, so that through electoral reform it might be possible to involve in our revising Chamber representatives who stand on platforms other than those of our existing political parties. Having a more open system is absolutely appropriate for a revising Chamber whose job is not to sustain a manifesto or sustain the Government, but to scrutinise the work of that Government and revise legislation.</p>

 I very much welcome the statement and the White Paper.

It would be most unfortunate, and certainly not the wish of this House, to substitute one form of patronage with an even less transparent one.

On top of that, we still have convicted criminals in the second Chamber and it is still predominantly representative of London and the south-east.

My question, however, is this: if we go ahead and change the electoral system for the House of Lords, it would effectively mean that there would be five separate types of elections in the different parts of the United Kingdom.

While the current statutory dispute resolution system is based on well-founded principles, the review highlighted several drawbacks in the way the system is operating, such as the inflexibility and high administrative burden of the mandatory procedures affecting both employers and employees, and that the road to the tribunal is fixed too early, resulting in a significant proportion of cases reaching a tribunal hearing which could have been resolved beforehand between the parties. Access to tribunals is an important part of the dispute resolution system and an important recourse for employees who may be facing mistreatment at work, but it is also the case that if disputes can be resolved more informally or earlier, perhaps through conciliation, that is the benefit of all concerned.</p>

 The draft code does not seem to make clear the final date by which people must return their consultation replies. Is the Minister able to help by telling us what that date is? A date has been given in respect of the guidance&#151;the end of this month&#151;but it would be useful to know what the position is on the draft code.</p>

Clause 3 gives tribunals the discretion to adjust awards upwards or downwards by a maximum of 25 per cent. where they find that parties have unreasonably failed to comply with the code. The provision is designed to encourage compliance, but I emphasise that it is a discretionary power for employment judges to apply in the circumstances of the case, without the rigidity of the previous automatic link to the statutory procedures. The Gibbons review concluded that better advice and guidance and greater availability of conciliation as early as possible in a dispute could enable there to be more resolutions without recourse to the tribunal.</p>

 One such example might be where an employee had been found to have a case, but they had not complied with the code. Although they still had a case, the tribunal might judge that the award to them should be lowered by up to 25 per cent.</p>

That is important, because we are not only repealing the statutory procedures in place; we are providing additional funding for the conciliation that we think can help to resolve more disputes earlier. ACAS has a good reputation among both employers and employees, and expanding its work in this way should give more support to the earlier resolution of disputes. Before I move on from discussing the Gibbons review, I am happy to inform the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) that the closing date for the code consultation is 24 July.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="80714-0007.htm_para3"><a name="0807141000290">The Bill also contains two legislative changes intended to maximise the effectiveness of ACAS conciliation.

request of the parties, into a power. That will enable ACAS to prioritise its case load effectively within its statutory powers. Clause 6 removes the time restrictions on ACAS&#146;s duty to offer conciliation to parties already involved in employment tribunal claims, thus ensuring that ACAS conciliation is open to parties right up until the tribunal hears the case. One of the effects of the current system has been that people&#146;s minds are often not concentrated fully until the tribunal hearing is almost upon them, and that provision will enable ACAS to continue to offer its services right up until that moment.</p>

Clause 7 simplifies the process for claimants who have suffered direct financial losses arising out of the employer&#146;s non-payment of money due&#151;such losses could arise as a result of bank charges for unauthorised overdrafts. In those circumstances, the tribunal would be able to make an additional award against the employer to provide compensation for such losses, rather than leaving the claimant to bring a separate action in the small claims court.</p>

Most businesses want to obey the law and treat their staff fairly but there are those who are willing to break the law by denying their staff the minimum wage. That impacts on those workers who are underpaid, but also enables those dishonest employers who flout the law to undercut the vast majority of law-abiding businesses that comply. That is not only unfair, but uncompetitive, and through the measures in this Bill we are determined to take tougher action against it.</p>

 In the Minister&#146;s experience, which sectors of our economy are most prone to breaking the law relating to the payment of the minimum wage?</p>

 It is the traditionally lowest paid sectors. For example, this year we have targeted minimum wage enforcement on the hospitality industry, which has a record of low pay. Most employers in that industry are happy to abide by the law, but we have seen some cases of underpayment. We consulted last year on proposals for a new penalty for underpayment of the minimum wage and a fairer way of calculating arrears. Our conclusion was that the enforcement regime should be strengthened in several respects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="80714-0007.htm_para10"><a name="0807141000301">Clause 8 amends the method of calculating arrears owed to those who have been underpaid. They are currently paid at the rate in force at the time when the underpayment took place, which means that when arrears are paid to cover underpayments that took place over several years, the worker loses out from the upratings that have taken place in the meantime. The Bill will change that so that all arrears owed are paid at the current rate, helping to compensate for the potential loss of purchasing power since the offence originally took place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80714-0007.htm_para11"><a name="0807141000302">Clause 9 introduces an enhanced penalty regime, reflecting the serious view taken by the Government of employers who still do not comply with the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. Under the new regime, employers will be liable to a penalty if it is found that they have been making underpayments. The penalty will be based on the employer&#146;s level of non-compliance&#151;that is, the total amount of underpayment&#151;subject to a minimum penalty of &#163;100 and a maximum of &#163;5,000. We want to encourage quick repayment, so the penalty will be reduced by one half if the employer repays all arrears to workers within 14 days.</p>

I think the whole House will agree that we should be grateful for their dedication to making a positive difference to the lives of so many young people. Any confusion that may arise about eligibility for the minimum wage could seriously damage the ability of the cadet forces to continue to provide their services. For that reason, clause 13 amends the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 to make it clear that cadet force adult volunteers do not qualify for the minimum wage. I stress the fact that the provision does not change the current situation, but puts it beyond doubt in law. It will enable cadet force adult volunteers to operate exactly as they do currently and it will not affect any entitlement to the minimum wage that they may have outside cadet force activity.</p>

However, voluntary workers clearly necessarily incur expenses to perform their duties, such as those involving child care, travel or the cost of specialist clothing or equipment. We recognise that voluntary workers should not be financially burdened as a result of their activities. Clause 14 will therefore enable voluntary organisations to reimburse such expenses where they are legitimate. That will enable voluntary workers to continue to make their highly valuable contributions to society, while ensuring that they are not out of pocket in doing so.</p>

 The ECHR discussed such rights in the ruling. Of course, there are rights to expression and freedoms of association, and the ruling touches on both. During the Bill&#146;s progress through the other place, there was much discussion of that issue, and the Government decided to amend clause 18 to add additional safeguards on the use of such powers. The version in the Bill also takes into account the views of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and others who felt that that the clause did not provide sufficient safeguards against possible abuse. They argued in favour of greater protection for individuals. The clause, although amended, still provides for compatibility with the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.

 For the past decade, businesses of all sizes have had to cope with the steady drip, drip of employment legislation. Since 1997, the Government have introduced some  18 Acts and more than 280 statutory instruments dealing directly with employment, which have often left employers bemused, baffled and bewildered by the negative implications for UK employment. Last autumn, pre-credit crunch, a survey by the Federation of Small Businesses found that nearly 80 per cent. of small business owners handled paperwork themselves, and that a third of those businesses claimed that they would not be hiring new staff because of bureaucratic complexities. It is by that and other means that the Labour Government are continually damaging the flexibility of the UK&#146;s labour market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="80714-0008.htm_para5"><a name="08071416000002">Only a few weeks ago, a further deal was done between Labour and the trade unions to tamper with the laws on agency workers, which could be very damaging for already overburdened businesses. The Government made that massive and costly concession to their Back Benchers. They have fought in Brussels against the European agency workers directive for the past five years, but the sad reality is that they could no longer handle the pressure back at home. It is a testament to the Prime Minister&#146;s weakness that Britain&#146;s economic interests are being weighed up as less significant than his political survival.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="80714-0008.htm_para6"><a name="08071416000003">I am glad that the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform finally seems to recognise that the Government have gone too far. He recently admitted&#151;of course, this was after the Government had passed 298 employment laws&#151;that there was a</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80714-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08071416000004">That is certainly something to support, but judging by the latest trade union wish list that has been floating around the media in advance of the Labour party&#146;s Warwick discussions, he will have a big fight on his hands. As we enter this period of economic instability, it is critical that the Secretary of State ensures that flexibility remains a cornerstone of our labour market so that if unemployment begins to rise businesses have the proper flexibility to organise their work forces and can weather the storm. It is with that in mind that I shall examine the provisions of this latest Employment Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="80714-0008.htm_para8"><a name="08071416000005">First, however, may I say that while the Bill&#146;s passage through the Lords lasted for months, we were given only a few days&#146; notice of the debate, which was not ideal and not conducive to allowing Members to participate? Additionally, the Secretary of State has pulled out of leading on a Bill that he wishes to push through at such short notice, and we believe that that deserves some explanation from a Minister, perhaps during the wind-ups.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for his important contribution. The issue goes even further.

administrative burden for both employers and employees; that they resulted in the need to use formal mechanisms such as the laying down of red tape, although previously disputes could be informally resolved; and that they were over-complex and the penalties for failing to observe them resulted in employers and employees seeking external legal advice earlier than in the past. That last consequence is of particular interest as the Government claim in their explanatory notes to the new Employment Bill that it was unforeseen. We beg to differ.</p>

The Minister&#146;s response was that the procedures were designed to be simple and easy to understand and that uncertainty should not arise. At least now, by proposing to repeal said statutory procedures, the Government are admitting that that over-simplistic assessment was utterly wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="80714-0008.htm_para21"><a name="08071416000026">The problem is that this is yet another occasion on which Labour has got it wrong. Last week&#146;s Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Bill, which the Minister and I recently debated, was its third attempt at reform, and this is its second attempt on dispute resolution procedures. What the Secretary of State said about less employment legislation is the opposite of the case&#151;not only are we seeing more and more employment legislation, but a good part of it is an attempt to patch up previous, failed labour laws.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="80714-0008.htm_para22"><a name="08071416000027">We support the existence of a national minimum wage and the continual monitoring of the legislative provisions dealing with it.

They claim that they expect the new penalty measures under clause 11 to increase the deterrent effect on businesses that do not currently pay the national minimum wage. The Minister has said that some 1,600 employers were found to be non-compliant, but last year only very few cases of underpayment were deemed bad enough to lead to the issue of one of the Government&#146;s penalty notices. Other cases led to the employer paying arrears, but in no way being punished for the illegal underpayment. The Government have also said that only 5 to 10 per cent. of cases will result in the imposition of a penalty under the new legislation; it is therefore unclear to us how the new penalty, applied to only a small fraction of cases, will act as more of a  <br>

deterrent than the currently rarely applied penalty notice. The Minister shook his head at my figure of 5 to 10 per cent., and I would be grateful if he put me right on that. While the proposal to allow enforcement officers to be able to withdraw and replace notices of underpayment is beneficial as errors may be corrected, the potential disadvantage, as with the current penalty notice regime, is that there are no real incentives for officers to get the notice right first time. Officers may issue an incorrect notice, put the employer to the trouble and expense of appealing it, and simply start again when they recognise their error. As with so many of the Government&#146;s attempts to make things better, there is potential for red tape and bureaucracy to mar the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="80714-0008.htm_para24"><a name="08071416000029">We strongly oppose the suggestion made in the other place on 13 March that the national minimum wage be extended to foreigners working on British ships and foreigners working on any ship at any time when it is within British territorial waters. Broadly speaking, we are concerned that those changes could be made prematurely, and we shall look to the Minister to address those concerns. I note that he did not comment on the report by the TUC&#146;s commission on vulnerable employment. Perhaps he could comment on the Government&#146;s findings on that report in relation to the proposals in the Bill. I urge that any changes that are made be implemented with maximum publicity. All employers must be given the opportunity to assess their companies and to correct any failings in payment of the national minimum wage before the new penalties are imposed. Have the Government yet given any indication of the expected costs of the new powers in enforcing the minimum penalty? If not, it is difficult to assess whether the proposals are the best way forward in protecting low-paid, vulnerable workers.</p>

I therefore turn to clause 18, which, as he said, represents a response to the judgment made on 27 February last year by the European Court of Human Rights in the case of ASLEF <i> v.</i> the UK. The clause enables trade unions to prohibit or expel from their organisation an individual who belongs, or has belonged to, a particular political party. It amends the relevant sections of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. To our mind, the clause represents yet another rewrite of inadequate provisions that the Government introduced just four years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para0"><a name="08071416000033">The Employment Relations Act 2004 introduced measures to allow trade unions to expel members with extreme political views. The then Minister with responsibility for employment relations, the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe), hailed the new provisions as striking the right balance between workers, trade unions and employers. He argued that they would provide &#147;protections for workers&#148; and said that he believed that successful workplaces are founded on partnerships between employers, workers and their representatives. That is all well and good&#151;how different, though, from the position of the Government today. The current Minister seems to have no qualms about throwing the interests of the aforementioned workers and employers out with the bath water in order to allow the trade unions to sit at the top table and call the shots. These, of course, are the same trade unions that now provide more than 90 per cent. of the Labour party&#146;s donations, as opposed to the 55 per cent. they provided when the earlier provisions were on the table. I agree that it is appropriate to respond to the ASLEF decision, but we have concerns about clause 18.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08071416000034">We are pleased that the Government have accepted the much-debated amendment to clause 18, first proposed by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, and introduced by the Liberal Democrat Lord Lester of Herne Hill in the other place on 13 March. The decision to expel a trade union member will be unlawful if</p>
<a name="80714-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="08071416000167"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the decision to exclude or expel was taken otherwise than in accordance with the union&#146;s rules&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08071416000035">or established procedures, or if the exclusion or expulsion would prejudice the individual&#146;s livelihood or conditions of employment. That is a fair starting point for dealing with the sometimes conflicting rights of trade unions and their own members. It should ensure that a heavy-handed union boss cannot usurp the internal rules to which members sign up. It prevents trade unions from throwing out members purely on the basis that the opinions of the member differ from the union&#146;s own ideals. It should also prevent unions from exerting power beyond their remit, thereby protecting the employment status of union members expelled under the clause. However, in order to protect union members from over-bearing union officials who may wish to impose their will unfairly, it would be preferable for stronger boundaries to be drawn around the clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08071416000036">Clause 18 is silent on determining the organisations that are classified as political parties. That could allow trade unions to flex their muscles and evict individuals who are members of organisations with which the union clashes. Is it truly the intention of the ASLEF decision that membership of politically active organisations such as Greenpeace or Amnesty International should be grounds for eviction from a trade union? I do not think that that is intended. More thought needs to be put into the drafting of clause 18 if we are to prevent unions from imposing their political biases on their members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08071416000037">I also find the application of the clause to former membership of a political party somewhat worrying. Why should a 40-year-old employee, for instance, face the possibility of being evicted from a trade union on the basis that he was a member of a certain political party for a short time when he was a student? That aspect of the clause represents a one-size-fits-all approach typical of much of the union legislation of the old days, and maintains a definite air of retrospective punishment.  <br>

Lord Bach argued that tighter wording in clause 18 was not necessary, as disgruntled expelled trade union members can make a complaint to the certification officer. I met the certification officer recently to discuss his role and the powers that he has been given, and on the basis of what he reported in that meeting I do not think that the Government&#146;s argument holds much sway. By his own admission, the certification officer has very weak powers of inspection, and is not able to issue penalties to unions. That regulator is a relic of the trade union settlement of the 1940s and 1950s, rather than an effective, modern-day regulator, and it requires reform. The situation shows how little the Government think about the protection of individual trade union members as opposed to the unions themselves.</p>

All in the House today would agree that many, if not most, of the BNP&#146;s policies are abhorrent, but it is still classified as a political party, membership of which is not, per se, illegal. Should not eviction from a trade union still essentially be for reasons of improper conduct, rather than based on a blanket, one-size-fits-all attitude towards membership of a particular political party? On the final day of Grand Committee in the other place, Baroness Perry of Southwark said that the Minister remained open-minded on clause 18, and Lord Bach said that the Government remain open to others&#146; views on the clause. I hope that that is truly the case, and that the Government take full account of the arguments made today.</p>

Ministers try to give the impression that they know where their party is heading, while in reality their union-led Back Benchers are not only calling the shots but regularly rebelling when they do not get what they want. At a time when British business is entering difficult waters, the last thing it needs is a Government who say one thing and then cannot deliver.</p>

My Bill resulted from our experience in my constituency with Gate Gourmet. A large number of my constituents, largely Asian women, who were working for Gate Gourmet, a company that received contracts outsourced from British Airways, went to work one morning and were herded into a shed. A manager then came forward and sacked them by megaphone for refusing to sign up to new terms of work that would undermine their conditions, cut their pay and even threaten their pension status.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para8"><a name="08071416000042">At that time, we were looking for new legislation that would provide protection to those workers. However, some hon. Members will also recall that other members  <br>

of the Transport and General Workers Union at the airport spontaneously came out on strike in solidarity. The airport is like a mining village. People work in different sections of the airport and for different companies. Many worked for companies to which contracts had been outsourced by British Airways and had worked with each other in the past. Indeed, many were members of the same family working in different areas, so there was a natural feeling of spontaneous support for the workers, largely women, who had been sacked so brutally by Gate Gourmet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para9"><a name="08071416000043">The workers therefore came out on strike. As a result, the TGWU was threatened with tens of millions of pounds&#151;the figure quoted was about &#163;42 million&#151;in fines by the aviation industry, which threatened to break the union. Eventually, the workers had to go back to work. Although the union did its best, some individuals suffered severe detriment, in both wages and conditions. Indeed, some of them are still not even back at work, despite all the union&#146;s hard work and best endeavours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para10"><a name="08071416000044">It was in that climate that I expected the Employment Bill to reflect the concerns of trade union members, as well as members of the community throughout, and to reflect the Trade Union Rights and Freedoms Bill, which we sought to promote last year, because such incidents continue. Only last week we had a debate with the Minister present&#151;I am grateful for his help in the discussions that we are having&#151;because the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union had come forward about the Lyndale group. For three years, Lyndale had been planning to restructure, but without consultation with the trade unions. Lyndale went into administration, but within hours established itself as a new company trading in exactly the same way, laid off 700 workers, avoided its responsibilities for redundancy payments and, again, frogmarched some workers off its site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para11"><a name="08071416000045">That is no way in which to treat workers in this day and age. The reason companies can treat workers so is that we have fewer trade union rights now than we had in 1906, after the Taff Vale judgment. We still do not have the right to strike embedded in law and we no longer have the right to solidarity action. As a result, the reality of work for many people is that they are exploited and feel unprotected, so I was hoping for a more ambitious Bill than this one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para12"><a name="08071416000046">I would like to set out those areas in which some of us will seek to amend the Bill in Committee and on Report to improve the situation, so that people can be represented properly by their trade unions, and so that industrial harmony can break out. Respect for trade union rights has been fundamental for co-operation between workers and employers for two centuries now, and has produced an industrial climate that has been beneficial to both sides of the industry, as well as to the community overall. I would like to go through those elements of the Bill that I would like to be amended and which I hope will form the agenda for later debate. Other Members on our Benches have issues that they would like to raise for amendment, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para13"><a name="08071416000047">The first issue that I want to discuss is industrial action. There is currently no right to strike in law in this country, although we have the right to be protected for a limited period from employers&#146; attempts to threaten actions on breach of contract. In their most recent  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="14 July 2008">

<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>14 July 2008 : Column 56</b><br>
legislation on the issue, the Government improved the situation by extending the period of protection from eight to 12 weeks, but the right to strike is still not embedded in law, as it is across Europe. Furthermore, no protection is provided after 12 weeks, and I would like the Bill to be amended so that employees are given protection for an indefinite period when they go on strike. They should also have the right to take action if an employer takes action against them, unless the employer can prove that the detriment to, or the sacking of, a member of staff is not related to the industrial action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para14"><a name="08071416000048">Even though people are protected for 12 weeks and action can be taken if they are sacked or suffer detriment, the Bill also fails to amend current law under which there is no effective way for them to ensure that they are reinstated. Their trade union may introduce a reinstatement order on their behalf following action by their employer, but such orders are made in only 0.2 per cent. of the cases that are brought, and few are implemented. I would therefore like the Bill to be amended to make effective the protection that people have when they take industrial action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08071416000049">The Bill also relates to agencies. We successfully introduced legislation to prevent agencies from being used to bring in workers to break strikes, but a loophole continues to exist, and agencies are still used to bring in strike-breaking workers. Indeed, in the Gate Gourmet case, the employer prepared well in advance by recruiting agency workers. I would like us to use a provision from the Trade Union Rights and Freedoms Bill to amend this Bill by placing a duty on the employer to inform the agency when a dispute takes place. At the moment, agencies often argue that they are unaware of such disputes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para16"><a name="08071416000050">Unfortunately, the Bill also fails to consider ballot arrangements. The balloting process that trade unions currently have to undertake is complex and in many ways invites litigation and injunctions from employers. The Government need to examine a simplified notice system, which would benefit all sides. The employer should be given notice of future industrial action, but the amount of information required should be significantly reduced. For example, we have seen a number of disputes in which injunctions have been taken out against individual trade unions for not giving full information regarding the number, names and addresses of employees or the places where they work. Such requirements no longer reflect the modern workplace, where employees are moved from time to time, making it difficult to keep track of them, particularly when there is an element of outsourcing and contracts have been delegated to individual companies. I would like the Government to reconsider the issue, because it is in everyone&#146;s interests that we introduce a simplified procedure for giving notice to the employer, which requires less information about the number of employees who will participate in the dispute. In that way, we would overcome the unnecessary difficulties and, often, conflicts that embitter disputes as a result of the notice requirements in existing legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para17"><a name="08071416000051">We recently had an extensive debate in Westminster Hall on the minimum wage at which the Financial Secretary to the Treasury was present. We hoped that the Bill would address a range of the issues that were raised, and although I welcome the fact that it addresses some of them, there are many outstanding ones. I still have a number of concerns&#151;other hon. Members  <br>

mentioned them during that Westminster Hall debate&#151;including the Government&#146;s failure to reconsider the youth rate of the minimum wage. It is perplexing for many of us that the youth rate discriminates against younger workers. There are currently three national minimum wage rates based on age; workers between the ages of 16 and 17 receive &#163;3.40 an hour, workers between the ages of 18 and 21 get &#163;4.60 and workers aged over 22 get &#163;5.52 an hour. What that means for the 16 to 17-year-olds is an annual wage of &#163;6,630; and for the 18 to 21-year-olds, it is &#163;8,970. I believe that those are poverty wages, and I find it almost impossible to understand how anyone, particularly an 18 to 20-year-old, could survive on a wage of &#163;8,970 a year. Even for the over-22s, the annual minimum wage is only &#163;10,764. These are poverty pay rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para20"><a name="08071416000054">The hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) referred to seafarers&#151;again, in the recent Westminster Hall debate, we also asked that the Bill consider their position. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran will also dwell on that subject. Speaking as someone who has steered debates on seafarers through the House for the past five years or longer, I have to say that I am extremely disappointed that the Bill does not even look at the current problem. I have discussed the issue with the Clerks, however, and found out that it will be in order to amend the Bill to deal with the matter later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para21"><a name="08071416000055">Some Members will know the background to that debate because they have participated in it with me over the years. For a number of years, the Race Relations Act 1976 exempted shipping, so shipowners were able to discriminate in the payment of their workers on the basis of race. The European Union asked the Government to look again at the matter and there was a long campaign, organised by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, in response to which the Government committed themselves to review the issue of discrimination on racial grounds, which meant that two seafarers doing exactly the same job on a British flagship were being paid differential rates based on their race. Most of us found that morally abhorrent, as it was dramatically perpetuating the exploitation of workers on low rates of pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para22"><a name="08071416000056">We campaigned and the Government responded, telling us that they would reform the law, but the reform that they introduced was unacceptable&#151;the Government amended the legislation so that it could no longer discriminate on grounds of race, but discrimination on grounds of nationality continued. Most of us find that distinction almost impossible to fathom. We thought we had gained at least one concession when a former Minister gave a commitment to the Regulatory Reform Committee that all workers on UK flagships and ships working in British waters would be paid the minimum  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="14 July 2008">

wage. I felt that that was a breakthrough, a concession and a victory that had resulted from our long-standing campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para23"><a name="08071416000057">What we did not know then was that British waters would be defined not as territorial waters, as is generally accepted, but as Britain&#146;s internal waters. As a result, large numbers of workers&#151;even on ferries, which we would usually consider to be within British waters&#151;are not being paid the minimum wage, as employers continue to discriminate on the basis of nationality. I hope that in later stages of our consideration, we will be able to amend the Bill in order to secure fairness and equity for all workers, who should get the rate for the job, based on the nature of the job itself, not on their country of origin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para24"><a name="08071416000058">In his introduction, the Minister spoke about the enforcement of the minimum wage. Many of us welcomed the statements made some time ago by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, now the Prime Minister, about the allocation of additional funding of &#163;3 million for the purpose of enforcement, but as we said in the Westminster Hall debate, it does not look as though much of that money has actually filtered through to the appointment of staff. I would welcome the Minister&#146;s pledge to reconsider that matter and the powers given to individual officers working for the enforcement team.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para25"><a name="08071416000059">Third-party actions also warrant further examination. At present, enforcement takes place when individuals demonstrate that they are being paid less than the minimum wage. In some circumstances that requires an act of courage, especially when exploitative employers seek to intimidate their work forces. Perhaps the Minister will consider tabling an amendment allowing third-party actions. That would enable trade unions and other organisations to represent individuals or groups of workers and bring cases relating to failure to pay the minimum wage, so that the system would no longer need to rely on individuals who can so easily be victimised and intimidated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para26"><a name="08071416000060">The Minister mentioned voluntary workers and cadet force adult volunteers, but I believe that the Bill may allow us to look beyond those groups. We have received representations from the National Union of Journalists and the Performers Alliance, which includes Equity, the Musicians&#146; Union and the Writers&#146; Guild of Great Britain. According to the NUJ, many people, mostly in newspapers but across the media, are required to work voluntarily not just for a few hours a week or a few weeks but, in some cases, for between six and 12 months in order to get on to the ladder even to be considered for a permanent position. As a result, they fall outside any legislation that would protect them from exploitation and ensure that they were paid the minimum wage at some stage in their careers. I hope that the Minister will examine the issue of volunteers in those sectors and propose amendments, because we may not have another opportunity to tackle it for some time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para27"><a name="08071416000061">The Performers Alliance unions also raised the issue of agency fees and their effect on the minimum wage. We know that the Government have helped greatly through their moves to protect workers from an agency which, at one point, was charging high fees and deducting them from wages, with the result that many workers&#146; pay fell below the level of the minimum wage. However, there is still a loophole. Some agents have reconstructed themselves as publishers, so that workers can be charged a publication fee simply to be listed in a directory. They  <br>

are being exploited by having to pay a fee upfront, which is deducted from their pay so that, again, it falls below the minimum wage. Perhaps that too could be amended in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para28"><a name="08071416000062">The hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker), who is no longer present, mentioned tips. We have been promised movement on that for a long time. A private Member&#146;s Bill was drafted in the hope that the Government could incorporate its provisions in future legislation. I think the time has come to give full protection to workers who depend on gratuities, so that those amounts are not deducted from their minimum wage. At present there are a number of ways in which employers can avoid the current legislation, with the result that workers do not receive the full reward for their good service. That too was raised in the Adjournment debate a few weeks ago, and again we hope that the Minister will be able to incorporate provisions from the private Member&#146;s Bill in this legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="80714-0009.htm_para29"><a name="08071416000063">I hope that another issue raised by Members will be incorporated. The Bill provides powers of enforcement in regard to non-payment of the minimum wage, but we believe that the provision for the exchange of information between agencies should include the opportunity to deal with non-payment of holiday money, and with other payments not made by employers. The Bill should contain a right of protection, so that those officers who deal with the enforcement of the minimum wage can also deal with the non-payment of holiday pay and other payments that employees should have received but the employer has avoided paying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para0"><a name="08071416000064">I also hope the Minister will consider the representations we have received from a number of unions&#151;I am thinking in particular of the civil service union, the Public and Commercial Services Union&#151;on workplace environmental representatives. We were hoping that the role that such representatives play in their companies and their work sectors would be recognised in this Bill. Environmental representatives are like health and safety representatives in that they want to participate in the development of the policy of their company&#151;or agency, or Government Department&#151;with regard to improving the environmental standards of their workplace. At present, they undertake that role while some employers&#151;including Government Departments&#151;recognise them and some do not. They play a vital role in identifying areas where the environmental standards and performance of their employers can be improved, but they gain no statutory recognition and as a result no facilities in assisting them other than those that have been acquired voluntarily by representations to their employers. I would like the Government to look at the formal recognition of workplace environmental representatives, particularly on the day when we have received an Environmental Audit Committee report on the lack of progress, to put it diplomatically, especially of Government Departments in achieving the Government&#146;s own environmental targets. Finally, let me turn to the part of the Bill that deals with the ASLEF judgment. A range of problems have been identified in the concessions the Government have so far made in the other place. I believe they will impede the implementation of the spirit of the Government proposals, particularly with regard to the detail of what is required of a union in identifying what political party  <br>

the member they are dealing with belongs to and how that can change over time. Other fairly onerous requirements will undermine the implementation of the European Court of Justice&#146;s decision on the matter. We will look at amendments as this Bill proceeds through Committee and on Report, but I think there is agreement in every part of the House that it is most important that we ensure that trade unions have the freedom not to have to accept as members those who hold offensive views and act offensively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08071416000065">That leads me on to another issue to do with our public services, which I think may be addressed in this part of the proposed legislation. We already have rules and regulations that prevent British National party members from serving in the police and prison services, but we do not have those rules for BNP members who work in other sections and Government Departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, where they are meant to be serving a multicultural community. I would like the Government to look at from what other areas of service beyond the police and the Prison Service we should bar the employment of BNP members or bar their continued membership of the BNP, because I believe that holding those views and being a member of that party infects their role in serving a multicultural community. We should do everything we can and employ the full legislative force to prevent BNP members from operating in those sectors and thereby undermining the ethos of fair and equal service to the public.</p>

Until we can secure that right once again, people will continue to be exploited; there will be bad employers who seek to undermine their wages and conditions, and the balance between employer and employee will still be out of kilter. I urge the Government to look again at this Bill to see whether we can include once again in British law this protection and the basic human right to withdraw one&#146;s labour.</p>

some previous legislation that was highly burdensome and bureaucratic for business. We shall be supporting the Bill&#146;s Second Reading, but there are a number of issues on which we would like significant progress to be made in Committee. Some areas will need careful scrutiny, but our principal areas of concern about the Bill are to do with sins of omission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para5"><a name="08071416000070">Let me begin by acknowledging the changes that we support. The Gibbons review of the Employment Act 2002 and its 2004 consequential regulations clearly stated that the aims of that legislation had simply not been achieved. The original purpose of the legislation&#151;to encourage conciliation as an alternative to a tribunal&#151;had not been successful. As the Government&#146;s response to the Gibbons review says, the procedures imposed a high administrative burden, and far from encouraging amicable settlements appeared to have encouraged involvement of lawyers at an early stage. However, that failure masks a more important negative philosophical shift.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para6"><a name="08071416000071">The 2002 Act divided opinion between those who believe that procedure matters in and of itself because it validates an individual&#146;s worth, and those who believe that procedure is merely a means to an end. A liberal would say that procedure matters, because treating people fairly matters in and of itself independent of whether the outcome would have been the same. It is very much to be commended that the Government have reviewed the 2002 legislation and are now repealing it, even if their change of mind has been brought about only by unintended side effects rather than a true conversion of principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para7"><a name="08071416000072">I welcome the reversion to the Polkey principle, which recognised that fairness does matter&#151;dismissal under such principles may be found to be unfair on procedural grounds. However, the principle also recognises the merits or otherwise of the case, and allows a tribunal to reduce the compensatory part of the award in proportion to the likelihood that dismissal would have gone ahead anyway if correct procedure had been followed. The acceptance by the CBI and others of a reversion to Polkey principles has, however, been dependent on a promise of simplification of the ACAS code of practice. Employers want a code of practice that they can actually follow. The new draft code, which was published during the consideration of the Bill in the other place, will need to be carefully scrutinised in Committee to ensure that it is a genuine simplification and that it is clear. I suspect that a considerable proportion of our time in Committee will be spent in examining that draft code.</p>

While recognising that the abolition of closed shops should give unions greater freedom to decide their own membership, we nevertheless thought that the original wording in the Bill was drawn far too broadly. The new definition adopted in the other place meets many of our original concerns. However, we will also want to re-examine that and explore it further in Committee. The hon.

and the possibility of trying serious cases in the Crown court is also welcome, as it increases the fine possible in serious cases. I, like the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), am disappointed that the Government have not taken the opportunity of this legislation to end the national minimum wage&#146;s discrimination against young people through the lower rate. People under the age of 21 do not get a discount in shops for being young, and it is hard to justify why young people should be paid less for doing the same job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08071416000075">I am also disappointed that the Government have not used this legislation to deal with the issue of people using tips as an excuse for not paying the national minimum wage. As a consumer, I want to know that any tips I pay are extra money that will go to people who are probably working extremely long hours for the minimum wage. The Minister reassured us that the Government are examining the issue, but I hope that they will do so in time to table amendments in Committee. The Government have the whole summer in which to consider the matter, because according to the programme motion the Committee will not sit until October. I hope that they will work with people in all parties who clearly feel strongly about the issue to introduce a practical means of solving that problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para11"><a name="08071416000076">The new formulae for calculating the arrears of employers who fail to meet minimum wage legislation are a welcome step forward. Using the current rather than historical rate of the minimum wage is not only a fairer way of calculating arrears for employees, but gives employers an incentive to settle arrears today rather than to delay until next year. I heard what the Minister said in reply to my intervention about interest rates and tax, but I hope that we may still explore the matter in more detail in Committee to see whether there is a means of getting round the problem. It is unfair that employers are able to have an interest-free loan at the expense of an employee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08071416000077">New formulae are all well and good, but the chance of a business being inspected for a breach of national minimum wage legislation remains extremely low. Moreover, even if an employer is inspected and found to be in breach of the law, the chance of their being prosecuted is almost non-existent. Just three of a total of 14,500 or 15,000 cases of arrears have ever been prosecuted&#151;the Minister gave the exact figure in his speech. Why is that figure so low? I would like to think that an amicable result was found in all cases, but that seems highly unlikely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08071416000078">The problem of a failure to pay the minimum wage appears to be increasing. The Minister mentioned that the average arrears for each individual is now more than &#163;200, which compares with the previous financial year&#146;s considerably lower figure of &#163;130. Enforcement is vital not only for individuals who are inadequately rewarded for their work but, as the Minister mentioned, for employers.</p>

who flout minimum wage legislation often deny other statutory rights, such as the right to paid holiday, statutory sick pay and paid maternity leave&#151;the citizens advice bureaux have found evidence of that in the cases that they have dealt with. Concern about those rights, particularly for temporary and agency workers, lead to pressure on the Government, particularly from some Labour Back Benchers, to equalise rights with those of permanent employees. The trade unions, the Government and the CBI appear to have found a compromise on this matter, and we await legislation in this area in the next parliamentary Session so that we can scrutinise just how the Government intend to deal with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08071416000081">I remain concerned that merely creating new rights will not necessarily yield an improvement for workers unless there is a practical way of enforcing them. I recognise that the Bill strengthens powers to inspect employment agencies, but, in practice, most vulnerable workers who wish to take action against exploitation must battle through the tribunal system, which, for many of them, is not a practical solution in enforcing statutory rights. The system is lengthy, stressful and legalistic, and even when it finds in favour of the employee it may fail to yield a payment to the individual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para15"><a name="08071416000082">There is an obvious need for an agency that is able to work across fields to tackle issues of non-compliance in a proactive way. The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington touched on the issue of information that is permitted to be exchanged in the Bill and whether there is a more proactive means of tackling non-compliance. A number of suggestions have been made, including a broad-based fair employment commission, extending the work already done on the national minimum wage. I wonder whether the Minister&#146;s winding-up speech will inform the House as to whether the Government are actively considering that possibility&#151;I know that they have considered it in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para16"><a name="08071416000083">The problem that many workers have with the employment tribunal system is that even if they manage to navigate it and get a ruling in their favour, which is no mean feat, many employers just fail to pay up. Citizens Advice, which works with employees exploited by rogue employers, estimates that it sees about 1,000 cases of unpaid employment awards every year. I have seen such cases in my constituency, and they are incredibly stressful for the individuals concerned. Citizens Advice estimates that across the country the level of non-payment of tribunal awards may actually be as high as one in 10 of the 13,000 monetary awards made by tribunals each year. The only route for claimants in that situation is to take action through the civil courts, but, yet again, that process is complex, time-consuming and often prohibitively expensive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08071416000084">For some rogue employers, the knowledge that the enforcement route is so difficult makes non-compliance a gamble worth taking, allowing them to flout the system with near impunity. The cost of the non-payment of awards to individuals is considerable. Citizens Advice estimates that of the 1,000 cases it dealt with in the past financial year, the total value of unpaid awards was in the region of &#163;4.5 million&#151;the sums involved for the individuals concerned are thus considerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para18"><a name="08071416000085">In recognition of that problem, the Government made some changes to the system in the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. Principally, the Act made the registration of non-payment of an award at county court automatic and free, and it also allowed enforcement action to be taken without registration. Those provisions will come into force in April 2009, when this Bill is also due to come into force. Although those changes were welcome, it is not the process of registration of non-payment at the county court that is so difficult for claimants; the problem is the process that follows, which is prohibitively expensive and complex.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08071416000086">That brings me to my gravest concern about the omissions in the Bill. How clear people&#146;s statutory rights are and how efficient the tribunal system is are of no matter if, when the tribunal rules in favour of the claimant, they are simply unable to go the next leg of the journey to wrench the money that they are owed from their employer.

The issue is really about using the state to take the risk that at the moment is borne by individuals. At the moment, individuals have to pay to go through the county court process. They will get the money back, if they win, but I want the Government to consider whether the state could take on the risk for very low-paid individuals. The state would get the money back, but the burden of risk would be shifted from the individual to the state. NACAB has suggested using High Court enforcement officers.</p>

 I first wish to make a general point that is relatively important in the context of clause 4. When I first started appearing before industrial tribunals in 1976 I did so for free, as a trainee lawyer with the Free Representation Unit. In those days, tribunals were very informal, the rules of procedure were limited and the chairman would often be able to decide what sort of evidence he wanted to hear and how. The person representing the employee was often a trade union representative or someone free&#151;like me&#151;and the employer would simply send along the personnel director. In that atmosphere, the people there&#151;including the members of the tribunal&#151;understood the workplace and the industrial scene. The three who made up the panel&#151;the employer&#146;s representative, the employee&#146;s representative and the lawyer who acted as chairman&#151;were an integral part of that atmosphere, which was that of an industrial jury that decided industrial concerns on behalf of people who all understood the workplace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para23"><a name="08071416000093">The atmosphere has changed a lot over the years and industrial tribunals&#151;now employment tribunals&#151;have become much more formal places with more legalism. It was inevitable that that would happen. That area of law was very exciting in the 1970s, because it was constantly changing as new Governments came and went. The <i> Industrial Relations Law Reports</i> came out every week, so more law was reported in that area than in almost any other. Gradually, the effect of all the new cases and the need for precision ensured the change to a more legalistic environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para24"><a name="08071416000094">However, the tripartite decision making has remained throughout, with an employer&#146;s representative, an employee&#146;s representative and a chairman. That is very important for cases that address issues such as the terms and conditions of employment or questions of unfair dismissal. Once the employer has shown the reason for dismissal, it is up to the industrial jury to decide whether the decision to dismiss was reasonable. The issue of reasonableness in that forum is well decided by a tribunal made up of representatives who understand the workplace. Anything that erodes that approach would be a bad thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para25"><a name="08071416000095">So when clause 4 of the Bill talks of fast-track decision making without a hearing, alarm bells begin to ring. Will that mean that the chairman decides cases on his own? Last year, we had a consultation document, &#147;Transforming tribunals&#148;, from the Ministry of Justice, and chapter 9 included suggestions that employment tribunals had scope for more decision making by chairmen alone, as it would not always be necessary to involve the lay members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80714-0010.htm_para26"><a name="08071416000096">The issue was taken up in the other place by Lord Wedderburn who pressed the Minister on it. I wish to do the same and press the Minister to confirm that the Government have no intention of cutting back on tripartite decision making by the tribunal on important issues such as reasonableness of dismissal and terms and conditions of employment. The lay members add something to the decision making on those issues and I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me on that point.</p>

In the early days of the industrial tribunal, it had a much more limited jurisdiction with far fewer cases. Even in 1998, there were only about 29,000 cases a year. By 2000, that had grown to 130,000 cases a year, and something needed to be done to encourage employers and employees to try to solve their problems without necessarily ending up at an employment tribunal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="80714-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08071416000098">One of the great motors for an increase in the number of cases was the Polkey <i> v</i>. A. E. Dayton Services Ltd decision in 1987, because it said that if there was any significant procedural irregularity in the way in which a case was dealt with by the employer, there was an entitlement to a finding of unfair dismissal. If it was only a technical matter, however, the tribunal could decide that, despite the procedural irregularity and the consequent unfair dismissal, the compensation could be set at nothing or very low.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="80714-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08071416000099">The decision meant that cases that would previously have been rejected on their merits were pursued on procedural grounds. The Conservative Government looked at the issue in the mid-1990s and published a Green Paper in 1994 that considered the options for dealing with disputes. It had two main suggestions. First, it suggested that ACAS should have a conciliation scheme and a system of voluntary referrals to arbitration. Secondly, if employees had not followed the internal grievance procedure, or employers had not followed their internal procedures, they should not have the right to go to a tribunal. In other words, it was vital to both employees&#146; and employers&#146; defences to have pursued internal remedies first.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80714-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08071416000100">In response it was argued that that approach would cause complexity and delay in many cases. After much thought, the then Minister, Ian Lang, decided not to require the internal procedures to be completed. When the Labour Government came in, they looked at the consultation document and the responses and made the same decision. I cannot remember who the Minister was, but in 1997 the incoming Government decided against that change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="80714-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08071416000101">It was therefore a surprise&#151;not to mention a mistake&#151;when the Government, in introducing the 2002 Act, decided to go ahead and insist that internal procedures should be completed to provide grounds for a claim or a defence to a claim. Many warned at the time that that would lead to complexity and delay. Instead of all the evidence being heard in one go by a tribunal, a two-part procedure was necessary. The first part of the process was deciding whether a case was procedurally acceptable because the internal procedures had been completed by the employer or employee. Then another hearing was needed to decide whether the dismissal was unfair or not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="80714-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08071416000102">The effect of that was predictable, and so it came to pass. From quite early on&#151;within a year of the change&#146;s implementation&#151;organisations such as the CBI and some unions were saying that it was a good idea in policy terms, but that the way in which it had been implemented was heavy handed, bureaucratic, prescriptive, over-regulatory and did not work. The number of cases that were delayed went up and became a big problem.</p>

As far as the other side of the coin is concerned, though, the idea of having conciliation and some ability to talk and to try to reach a decision on the claim between employer and employee before the matter gets out of the workplace is a good idea.</p>

Is it that it should just be a matter for ACAS and that the &#163;37 million will do it, or are the Government saying that they would be prepared to have independent mediators and others involved to try to tackle some of the cases at an earlier stage?</p>

One of the first steps that the initial 29 Labour MPs took was to drive through a private Member&#146;s Bill to overturn the House of Lords decision on Taff Vale.

If we look at history and at the situation now, we see that one of the most effective ways of fighting a cause in the workplace is to join a trade union. We know that trade union members earn significantly more than non-trade union members. They have better pay, better pensions and better health and safety in the workplace.</p>

One reason for that is that we have to recognise the huge imbalance of power in society. In particular, we must recognise the huge imbalance of power in the workplace between the employer and employee. I welcome the work that has led more than 100 MPs to sign early-day motion 1604, which calls for the Bill to be amended to include aspects of the Trade Union Rights and Freedoms Bill.

The clause is in the Bill because of active attempts by fascists in Britain to infiltrate trade unions, when, of course, fascist ideology runs counter to the beliefs of trade unions. If we consider the activities of fascists who have gained power throughout the world, we see that trade unionists are one of the first groups that they target, victimise, exploit, jail and kill. Trade unions are saying that they do not feel that it is reasonable that they should be forced to take people who are members of fascist parties into their membership, because they know that the only reason those organisations target them is to undermine their core values and beliefs.</p>

Britain has the most restrictive labour laws in Europe, which means that we have the most rules that govern how trade unions behave. The Conservatives, who were in power for 18 years, introduced most the legislation that led to the regulation of trade unions. It is interesting to hear Conservative Members talk about burdens on business, because they put excessive burdens on trade unions.

 I agree. My central point is that trade unions should be able to regulate their own rule books. Members should be allowed democratically to decide the rules under which they operate. I welcome the Bill&#146;s provisions, but I ask the Government to look again at the issues I have raised and consider simplifying the operation of trade unions.</p>

I suspect they will be the basis of amendments to the measure. The first relates to exemptions for young workers, which have already been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington. The Government have asked the Low Pay Commission to look into the issue again, but we need to say strongly in this place that we view an annual wage of &#163;6,630 for a 37 and a half hour week as a poverty pay rate. We want a rate for the job.</p>

The Minister for Energy will be aware that the current legal position is that foreign national seafarers are entitled to the national minimum wage on UK registered ships when they are in port or in internal waters. The result is that foreign workers on British ferries are being paid wages equivalent to &#163;1, &#163;1.50 and &#163;2 an hour. Examples have been provided to the Government on a number of occasions. All workers on a UK registered vessel in UK internal waters&#151;for example, a Caledonian MacBrayne ship sailing to the Western Isles&#151;would be entitled to the minimum wage, but that would not be the case if  they were on a non-UK registered vessel making the same trip.</p>

 I have every sympathy with my hon. Friend&#146;s proposition, but it is incredibly difficult to legislate for such things. For example, a similar situation might involve a trucking company based in Poland, but owned by a UK company, which could be sending HGVs to the UK driven by Polish nationals resident in Poland who were earning less than the UK minimum wage.

 I do not accept what my hon. Friend says. Such situations are clearly difficult to regulate, but the role of Government is to grapple with them and come up with solutions.

 The hon. Lady will know from the constituency that she represents that the UK used to have one of the largest merchant fleets in the world.

 The hon. Gentleman will be aware that that is why the tonnage tax was introduced. I am sure that the Minister will comment on the fact that British shipping has been a great success story for the Government. Such issues are often raised as red herrings, and that is why I focused on the examples that I used in raising the issue with the Government. I have specifically focused on ferries, because those that run between Scotland and some of the islands are good examples. If a ferry leaves Ardrossan and goes to Arran, all the workers will be covered by the national minimum wage, but if that ferry leaves Ardrossan and goes to Belfast, they will not be covered. We should address that anomaly, and I hope that the Government will look again at that issue. They are holding detailed discussions with the trade unions that represent some of the work force in those sectors, and I hope that the Government propose a practical solution during the consideration of the Bill.</p>

To me and many other trade unionists, that seems completely unacceptable and certainly against the moral spirit of the legislation on the national minimum wage, if not against the letter of the law.

 Yes, indeed. My hon. Friend highlights yet another loophole, and I do not believe that that was the intention of those who campaigned so hard for national minimum wage legislation over so many generations. Of course, hospitality industry staff are some of the most exploited and least organised, because traditionally trade unions have not been powerful in the sector. We should look again at that issue, because it highlights the need for one of the British trade union movement&#146;s other calls in asking the Government to consider class actions in relation not just to equal pay cases, which we will discuss in the equality Bill, but to employment matters such as the national minimum wage. The reality is that the most vulnerable workers in our society find it very difficult to stand up for themselves, and they fear victimisation. There is therefore a strong case for looking at how organisations such as trade unions can take collective class actions when the law is breached. My hon. Friend gives a good example in relation to those who work in the hospitality industry.</p>

 Indeed. People have become increasingly aware of the fact that, unless they leave cash, the money might not get to the right person. However, most of us would presume that any tip we leave would automatically go to the person whom we intended. As a matter of contract, our intention is that the person should get the money, so that is where it should end up, and it should not be used to subsidise employers who do not want to pay the full minimum wage.

 I hope that I made it clear in my initial comments that the more simple a law is, the more likely it is that it will be effective. One of the best examples, which is often cited, is the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, which is a very short piece of legislation that lays down a principle. One of the problems that has developed since the 1970s is that employment law has become increasingly complex, whereas we need basic principles. Unfortunately, the legal profession&#151;I say this as someone who used to be involved in that capacity&#151;has attempted to look for loopholes and complex arguments to opt out of basic principles. We should fight for the basic principle that the Government have laid down of a national minimum wage that should apply to all work forces and to all people, irrespective of gender, race, age or other matters, and I therefore commend the Bill to the House.</p>

It also protects disclosures made to prescribed regulatory bodies, whether or not they have been raised internally, when the concern has a substantial basis. It also protects wider disclosures, including to the police, Members of Parliament and the media, when the disclosure is reasonable and justified.

under the rules, information about those cases is on record. However, the rules mean that all information about the other 730 claims&#151;72 per cent. of all whistleblowing claims&#151;remain shrouded in secrecy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80714-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08071416000155">Other than the numerical statistics, which can be obtained only by making a specific request under freedom of information legislation, there is nothing on public record about more than 70 per cent. of whistleblowing claims. There is no information about the nature of the concern, be it a crime, danger, abuse or other wrongdoing. There is no information about who was at risk, be they consumers, passengers, patients, taxpayers, shareholders or fellow workers. There is no information about whom the concern was raised with, be that a manager, a compliance officer, the chief executive officer, the audit committee, a regulator or someone else. There is no information about the employer&#146;s response to the concern, whether it was ignored, investigated or hushed up, and whether it was claimed that it was misconceived, well founded or put right. There is also no information about the alleged reprisal, whether it was carried out by managers or colleagues, and whether it was dismissal or victimisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80714-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08071416000156">That is the case even though the claims are brought in a public forum, at public expense, and under the Public Interest Disclosure Act. Other than the two parties, no one, not even a Minister, is able lawfully to find out from the employment tribunals records whether, for example, a whistleblowing claim has been brought in relation to problems of clostridium difficile or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at a hospital, even though that issue has fuelled public and ministerial anxiety about the NHS and anxiety within it. Additionally, one cannot find out whether a claim relates to a pre-existing problem with the fuel system of the Nimrod aircraft that crashed in Afghanistan with the tragic loss of 14 servicemen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80714-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08071416000157">Such secrecy undermines the public interest and PIDA in two essential ways. It enables and encourages unscrupulous employers to buy off genuine whistleblowers, rather than address the underlying malpractice. The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 expressly encourages employees to raise whistleblowing concerns internally, so that responsible employers can deal with them properly and without delay, so it is not an imaginary problem. Contrary to Parliament&#146;s intention when it passed the Act, the current rules have created a scheme under which crime, company fraud, public dangers and tax evasion can be readily hushed up, contrary to the public interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80714-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08071416000158">That secrecy damages responsible business, as it enables and encourages unscrupulous employees to bring spurious claims. A report in the <i> Financial Times</i> on 18 September 2007 quoted the City firm, Nomura, which warned:</p>
<a name="80714-0012.htm_brev2"><a name="08071416000170"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The whistleblowing legislation was designed to protect employees who, in good faith, raise legitimate concerns of wrongdoing in the workplace. Its growing use by white men as a litigation tactic when in dispute with the City employers, suggests the legislation is being abused.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="80714-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08071416000159">The secrecy that now exists means that it is not possible to assess whether that claim is well founded.

Part of the difficulty is that there have been so many changes of junior Ministers in the Department that the collective memory of the Government or Executive, as opposed to the Administration, is somehow lost. Many undertakings have been given, and it has been said that there was no objection in principle. The Minister for Energy should read the ombudsman&#146;s report, and people in the Department should re-read it, or read it, if they have not yet had the opportunity to do so.

My party recognised that employment agencies play an important role, too, and when we form the next Government we will hopefully pledge to use employment agencies to help people get back into work. Employment agencies are extremely good at helping the economy to flex in response to changes in the market. There can be sudden increases in demand, and employment agencies are very good at identifying a labour pool and filling that demand. Employment agencies are very useful for allowing women who have been out of the workplace for a number of years to re-enter it. They are very useful for placing youngsters in the workplace&#151;yes, in temporary jobs, but jobs that allow them to prove their worth to a future employer.</p>

 The hon. Lady makes a very interesting point, and that was a useful intervention. I will come on to the issue in a moment. As I have said, employment agencies provide a useful route back to work for people who are often hard to place in work, and who struggle to find a permanent job because they have been out of the labour market for too long, or do not have the experience to get into the labour market in a substantive, permanent position.</p>

I do not know for certain that I would have done so, because I was not here, but at the time&#151;as the right hon. Member for Makerfield knows, because I sent him some papers on the subject&#151;my instinct would have been to vote against it. However, I would have been wrong to have done so. The minimum wage has proved to be a step in the right direction. It has allowed people dignity at work, and why should the taxpayer subsidise bad employers?

 Before the hon. Gentleman leaves the subject completely and forgets to answer the question asked by my hon.

If, in the future, a Conservative Government were in a position to sign the European directive on temporary agency workers, would he advocate signing it?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point about the agency workers directive. That directive has been mooted in Europe for about the past 10 years, and for nine of those years his Government have made a very good case on why we should not sign up to it. Their case has been very convincing; they said that we did not need it in this country, and that it would have a negative impact on the labour market and would reduce employability. That must be the case, or  it would have been accepted five years ago. If one were cynical&#151;I am not&#151;one might think that the sudden embracing of the working time directive had more to do with the need to access trade union funding for future political campaigns than with the need to improve the lot of the down-trodden worker. Far be it from me to suggest that. I hope that answers the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s question.</p>

 I probably will not give the hon. Lady the answer that she is looking for, but I fully bought into her Government&#146;s reasons for not signing up to the directive. I was convinced by their arguments on why it would be a bad idea for the UK to sign up to it. I have gone along with those arguments for nine years. The Government have changed their mind, and they need to put forward the arguments, to me and to others, on why the change of course is good.

I know that that is outside the ambit of the debate, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I shall not try your patience by speaking on the issue for more than 30 seconds. The minimum wage gives people a salary of about &#163;11,000 a year, but as soon as they earn &#163;5,000 or &#163;5,500, they start paying tax on their earnings, and then have their money laundered back to them in the form of tax credits. That is not right, and it perhaps robs people of their dignity.</p>

It is disgraceful that when I add &#163;5 or &#163;10 to a bill at a restaurant, and pay on a credit card because I do not have any cash on me, that money can be used to make up the wage of the person serving me. That is wrong, and most people in this country&#151;apart from the few who own restaurants&#151;agree. As the Government struggle to become more popular with the wider electorate, it would be good for them to seize on the issue. The practice is wrong, and they would have the support of the vast majority of the British public if they addressed it. I am not sure whether that would make up the 19 per cent. deficit in the polls, but it would be a good start.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I am sorry if I misled the House and anybody watching by suggesting that if people leave cash it is more likely to find its way into the pockets of the person who served their table. I would hope that the cash would be put in that person&#146;s pocket before the avaricious restaurant owner got his or her hands on it. Any restaurant chain that carries out the practice deserves to be named and shamed.

It was really unpleasant stuff.

rights for those over 65, leaving them the only group without protection from discrimination when it comes to being dismissed. The default retirement age means that older people cannot choose to work beyond the age of 65 unless their employer allows them to do so. They can be forced to retire, if their employer so chooses, without reference to their capability or conduct, without being given a reason and without being able to challenge the dismissal in an employment tribunal.</p>

Scrapping mandatory retirement ages would be popular, and Age Concern polling has found that 80 per cent. of people think that there should be no mandatory retirement ages. Businesses are increasingly recognising MRAs as burdensome, fraught with practical difficulties and liable to create confusion for management. The employers of two out of five workers already manage without MRAs. The Employers Forum on Age now takes the view that the future of MRAs is unsustainable.

Some of the comments we heard from employers were appalling&#151;putting batches of CVs in the bin before they would even interview women who might cause a problem to their business&#151;but I wonder whether the amount of equality legislation we are imposing on businesses is having an adverse effect. Perhaps we could use a lighter touch and persuade employers by using incentives or by using the tax system, with benefit-in-kind tax relief, instead of using heavy-handed, burdensome legislation. As Nicola Brewer said today, it seems to be having the opposite effect, and rather than imposing regulation on business I think that there is another way of achieving a desirable outcome.</p>

Half our GDP comes from small businesses, which feel the cost of regulation more than big corporations do. Having run a small business, I know that owners of small businesses need to maintain their market share, increase their growth, guarantee their employees&#146; security and look for new business. Achieving all those objectives is vital, but when someone has to juggle regulatory reform too, they need additional employees to manage that, which imposes extra cost. If we are going to tinker about with employment regulations again, I would like to see some way of relieving that cost on small businesses and using the Bill to assist them. The Minister will probably talk about that, which is to be welcomed&#151;I know that, in principle, we support it&#151;but there may be another way of doing a bit more for small businesses.</p>

The British Chambers of Commerce estimates that Government regulation has cost British business more than &#163;65 billion since 1998.

 In a former life I was a freelance accountant for many small businesses. I have a very high regard for the FSB, for the support that it gives. However, the FSB, in urging the lowest possible level of regulation&#151;it is quite appropriate for it to do so&#151;is not doing what the hon.

Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker), if I had been here when the House voted on the minimum wage, I would, as someone with an employer&#146;s experience, probably have voted against it, because I have always paid more than the national minimum wage anyway. However, I am aware that there were&#151;and still are&#151;unscrupulous employers, and I think that the national minimum wage is a good thing.</p>

Sometimes it is difficult for skilled employees who deserve more than the minimum wage to find employment where they live, because a wage ceiling in their area makes it difficult for them to get a salary increase. They cannot move anywhere, because all the employers fix their pay at the minimum wage. The minimum wage has had a detrimental effect on some skilled workers. Indeed, I have some experience of that among my constituents working in the borough of Bedford. They cannot move, because the employers all pay the national minimum wage.</p>

Opposition Members support the Bill and we agree with its principle. However, the Government have persistently placed more legislative and regulatory burdens on employers, which has the most detrimental effect on small businesses. It will come as no surprise to the Minister to hear that the Conservative party is committed to reducing regulatory burdens on employers, giving them more power and opportunities in how they run their businesses and encouraging enterprise in all its forms, particularly, I hope, small business. In contrast, the Government have piled extra complexity and burdens on businesses, and I hope that any changes that they make will reduce that burden. If Lord Jones of Birmingham was right that the Blair Government were the most regulatory Government, perhaps this Government can reverse that in the time that they have left and do some good, particularly for small businesses.</p>

Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown) is leaving, which is sad, because I want to give him another history lesson. More or less everybody now seems proud of the minimum wage and nobody wants to see it done away with. Most people would say that it was one of the finest achievements of the Labour Government in the late 1990s. One of the biggest problems is that we first introduced it in the early 1900s, but it took us 90 years to put it in place. One of the saddest things is that the trade unions themselves opposed the national minimum wage when the union of the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries) proposed at the TUC in 1983 that we should have one. Many trade unions, including, sadly, the National Union of Mineworkers, which I was a member of, voted against that. Thankfully, the Labour party and, eventually, the trade unions saw the error of their ways, and we did something that we should rightly be proud of. I am glad that the majority of hon.

I would argue with her&#151;but I think that she has a point&#151;when she says that some employers have made the minimum wage a ceiling, rather than a floor. That is a problem not with the minimum wage, but with rogue employers taking advantage of it, and that is what should be challenged, not the minimum wage itself.</p>

Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark), and I want to use my personal experience. I started work at 15 as a fitter at the National Coal Board. I served a four-year apprenticeship. At 19, I was trained, capable and safe. I was able to look after a coal face, and the men there could have been killed if I did not do my job properly. It would have been absurd for somebody to say, &#147;You can do the job, but we&#146;re not going to pay you the rate for the job for another two years because you&#146;re too young.&#148; We would not do that at the end of somebody&#146;s working life, so why should we do it at the beginning if they are capable, safe and properly trained? We should really look at that in some detail, and I ask the Minister to consider it as we make progress with the Bill.</p>

It is clear that the intent in the Bill is to reduce the amount of regulation and litigation, and I would normally welcome that, but the truth is that where dispute resolution works well and where we have good grievance procedures and good disciplinary procedures, which people know and understand, lay members who probably do not understand such things will have internal protection if they are supported by trade unions or bodies such as the citizens advice bureau. My worry, which has been raised with me by constituents who sit as lay members of tribunals&#151;this has been raised clearly already&#151;is that the proposals are about taking them out of the loop and letting people with a legal background have sole responsibility for deciding cases that they might not be qualified to decide, in the sense that they do not have experience of the workplace from the side of the employer or the employee, even though they will have a legal background. That is a real worry, and we should address it. We should ensure that the proposals that we take forward are not about reducing the number of people with real knowledge and experience who have sat on tribunals for many years, but about doing the job properly.</p>

I understand why the Government feel that they have to come into line with the European Court regulations. It appears that everybody thought that that was fair when the Bill went into the Lords, but the Lords clearly did not think that it was, and they have changed the provisions. It is clear from the TUC brief that many of us have received that the TUC has some major problems with the proposals. One of the main things that I worry about is that we will involve the courts. We should be in no doubt that if the BNP thinks that it can have its day in court, it will not care what it costs or about the legitimacy of its case&#151;it   <br>

Through many years of negotiation and democratic debate, the union came forward with a constitution saying that the union supported the rights of gay people, lesbians, black people, disabled people and women. The BNP does not support those rights; it supports the same things that fascists have supported throughout the years&#151;discrediting people, pulling people down, making people feel different and exploiting differences. We should be clear that the BNP is not wanted in the trade union movement and we should work with the TUC and others to ensure that the legislation that we introduce tightens up the expulsion of the BNP. The truth is that we should not even be talking about the legal position on this; the trade unions should be able to set their own rules and say, &#147;If you&#146;re a fascist, we don&#146;t want you.&#148;</p>

It is curious, then, to consider why it has taken so long to get here. It comprises 22 clauses and is divided into four sections. Clauses 1 to 7 deal with dispute resolution: clause 4 deals particularly with the determination of proceedings without a hearing; clause 5 with the circumstances in which ACAS is obliged to offer conciliation services; and clause 6 repeals section 18 of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996. Clauses 8 to 14 deal with the national minimum wage: clause 13 excludes cadet force adult volunteers from qualifying for the national minimum wage. Clauses 15 to 17 deal with employment agencies and clause 18 relates to trade unions. I intend to say something about all of those provisions.</p>

I was particularly impressed by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire, as what he said, speaking without notes on the basis of his huge experience in employment tribunals, was enormously beneficial to the House. He proved that the Government&#146;s rushed legislation of 2002, introduced by the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) on the basis of his three-step and increasingly legalistic approach, was subsequently shown by the trade unions and others to be not the best way of proceeding with industrial tribunals. The Bill is welcome in that it starts to put right some of what the Government got wrong in 2002. My hon. Friend, along with the hon. Member for Blaydon and others on the left of the Labour party, demonstrated that the experience of members of employment tribunals counted for a great deal. It is a pity that the Government got this wrong in 2002; perhaps the Bill will begin to restore some of what was lost then.</p>

She also quoted from the Federation of Small Businesses, which estimated that about 68 per cent. of its members do not employ anybody because they are fearful of employment legislation&#151;in other words, they are one-man businesses. The Government should note that most of the employers in the small business sector have to deal with the welter of employment legislation on their own because they cannot afford to employ people to do it for them.</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend that all these costs on employers must be taken into account. If we continue to pile regulations on employers, our country will become less competitive. The same applies to the EU, which has lost 10 per cent. of its world trade in the past 10 years. Some experts estimate that if we continue to impose extra regulations and burdens on industry, we will lose 40 per cent. of world trade in the next 20 years. We need to consider that possibility very seriously. It is not a matter of individual pieces of legislation, as I am sure my hon. Friend would agree, but rather the aggregate effect of all legislation that impacts on businesses. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire said, it is not so much the cost, but the burden of administering the regulations and their continually changing nature that causes the problems, as employers have to keep retraining people on the basis of what the newest legislation means.

I particularly welcome the clarification about adult volunteers, because there were fears in my constituency about the possibility that adult volunteer drivers would have to pay all sorts of tax and other charges. I also welcome what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne about employment agencies, which perform a valuable function in returning people to work. We want them to operate properly, but I remain to be convinced that the number of rogue employment agencies out there warrants such draconian legislation.</p>

I think most unbiased people would conclude that in the 1970s, when we experienced the winter of discontent, we got the balance wrong. Some would argue about whether the balance was maintained in the other direction during the 1980s and 1990s. I would say that we should be careful not to place too great a burden on businesses, and not to place trade unions above the law in any respect. I do not want to see the country return to the immunity from prosecution that the trade unions enjoyed, in some respects, in the 1970s and before.</p>

They do not understand civilised political discourse: their raison d&#146;être is intimidation and veiled threats of violence.

 As I said, if the Government legislate not to deal with individuals&#146; or even individual parties&#146; prejudices, but to specify circumstances, which is what the Bill will have to do in order to comply with the ECHR, I would support clause 18, which would allow unions to expel members who behaved in an unacceptable way.

I am sure that my hon.

That is incredibly important, because, as my hon.

 To re-establish my credentials as a socialist, may I ask why, after 11 years of this Government, trade unionists still do not have the same rights that they had after Taff Vale in 1906? Why under this Government can we have events such as Gate Gourmet where people can be sacked on a whim&#146;s notice, having been undermined by agency workers?

 I am happy to take interventions. One comment made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) dealt with the enforcement of the minimum wage. May I remind colleagues, as the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs did at the beginning of the debate, that in November 2006 the then Chancellor announced an increase in the budget for the enforcement and  the monitoring of the minimum wage for the next four years, amounting to some &#163;11.6 million of extra enforcement and monitoring money? I hope that hon. Members would agree that that is helpful. The enhanced budget enables us to respond in a highly effective way to the changing scene, through the recruitment of additional staff, more research and better communication. With the increased budget, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs is recruiting an additional 20 people in 2007-08, the majority of whom are front-line enforcement staff, the remainder being part of the minimum wage technical team, which works on supporting the helpline, for example, and inspectors on more complicated cases. We have also significantly increased our publicity budget, maintaining our focus on hard-to-reach groups. That work includes a radio campaign and, indeed, an outreach campaign.</p>

 That matter was covered in an Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall some weeks ago, when we welcomed the &#163;3 million of additional money, but reflected that at that point in time it had not resulted in an additional number of posts being filled. Vacancies in the department were already being held open, so there has not been the additionality in staffing expected by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer&#151;now the Prime Minister&#151;when he announced that money. I would welcome a letter from the Minister to the Public and Commercial Services Union, which is the union that has raised these points in the debate and still has not received an adequate response.</p>

 The Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs told the House that 1,649 employers were non-compliant on the minimum wage, yet only 59 enforcement notices and 25 penalty notices had been issued. If the regulations are in place, surely it ought to be possible to get to grips with that huge number of non-compliant employers.</p>

 The emphasis has been on compliance. Now there will be an automatic penalty, and I have mentioned the extra money&#151;&#163;11.6 million&#151;that the Chancellor has given the Department for extra enforcement. The hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) implied&#151;I do not blame him; we all get confused by statistics&#151;that only 5 to 10 per cent. of employers will get a penalty. For the record, that is not the case. A civil penalty will be imposed in cases in which an enforcement  <br>

officer identifies that the minimum wage has not been paid correctly to any worker. That contrasts with the current regime, under which a penalty is payable only if an employer fails to comply with an enforcement notice. That supports what I was saying about the emphasis on enforcement. The misunderstanding arises because the 5 to 10 per cent. are those cases in which arrears exceed &#163;5,000, so there is the potential for a Crown court prosecution with unlimited fine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80714-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08071441000191">The hon. Gentleman also asked about the certification officer in relation to trade union powers. The certification officer has important powers to remedy failures by trade unions to follow their own rules. He can order a union to put right a breach of its rules, and that order is enforceable in the same way as a court order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80714-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08071441000192">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of the report by the TUC commission on vulnerable employment, which was issued some weeks ago. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown) also asked about that. The House may be aware that the vulnerable workers enforcement forum has met over the past year, chaired by my hon. Friend the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs. It includes representatives from the TUC, the CBI and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, and from enforcement agencies. It has considered several important issues, such as the fear of reporting abuses, the lack of knowledge of to whom complaints should be reported, the co-ordination of enforcement between different Government agencies, and other issues of enforcement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="80714-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08071441000193">The forum considered the issues and heard evidence from many of the bodies that I have mentioned, including citizens advice bureaux, trade unions and representatives of migrant workers and the construction and hospitality industries. It will report in the near future, perhaps before the summer recess. That is not definite, but is one possibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80714-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08071441000194">The hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather), on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, raised the issue of the enforcement of employment tribunal awards. In most cases, such awards should be paid within 42 days of the judgment, unless the respondent decides to appeal the judgment. The exceptions are discrimination and equal pay cases, in which payment is due the day following the judgment. Unpaid awards may be enforced by application to the courts, in the same way as county court judgments, a system that will be streamlined by the provisions of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. The Ministry of Justice expects to introduce secondary legislation under the Act by April 2009 which will mean that if an award remains unpaid after 42 days claimants can go straight to enforcement in the county court or the High Court by a simplified route. The current Act separately provides for the tribunal to award compensation for the full financial loss in simple monetary terms&#151;for instance, if credit card or mortgage payments fail because of the action of the employers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80714-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08071441000195">Research will be undertaken by the Ministry of Justice to clarify how many claimants do not receive their awards, and the contributing factors to the failure. I should also say that my hon. Friend the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs will be meeting representatives of the citizens advice bureaux on Wednesday to discuss further the evidence from citizens advice bureaux.</p>

 I raised all those points in my speech and acknowledged that the Government had made some changes in the 2007 Act.

 Does my hon. Friend accept that one of the problems with the process is not only the non-payment but the wilful disregard with which some companies treat a former employee? They drag the process out as long as they possibly can, knowing that they will lose, but little can be done because the process has a momentum of its own. That surely is not fair in this day and age.</p>

 I understand that. Indeed, in my own constituency I have had experience of one or two such situations. I understand what my hon. Friend and other colleagues are saying. That is why we are not complacent. We are maintaining the dialogue and, if necessary, we will take further action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80714-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08071441000200">My hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark) raised a point, which was touched on by one or two other colleagues, about mariners. That is a complex matter, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) said. Under current legislation, all resident and non-resident seafarers are entitled to the minimum wage while they are in the UK&#146;s internal waters. A seafarer on a UK-registered ship anywhere in the world is entitled to the national minimum wage unless his employment is wholly outside the UK or he is not ordinarily resident in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80714-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08071441000201">International maritime law, and specifically the right of innocent passage, means that the UK is unable to apply legislation to ships sailing under the flag of another country. That is reciprocal. For example, British ships enjoy that right in the Gulf and when passing close to Saudi Arabia. If the Government were to apply further legislation just to UK flagships they would run the risk of those ships flagging out and diminishing the number of UK ships sailing under the UK flag, something that the Government are committed to preventing. If vessels choose to flag out, not only will the number of UK flagships diminish but the seafarers aboard will miss out on the other entitlements that sailing under the UK flag ensures.</p>

 In view of the fact that the Minister is saying that the Department is considering the subject, even at this early stage&#151;although some of us believe that it is somewhat late in coming&#151;can the Department make it known to those out there who are abusing the system that their days are numbered?</p>

The Bill will allow an appropriate sanction to deal with the small minority of agencies that deliberately flout the law. No business should be allowed to get away with unfairly undercutting legitimate operators by underpaying workers or exploiting vulnerable agency staff. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation, a key industry body, said:</p>

Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries) on the subject. Alongside tougher enforcement the Bill promotes greater flexibility and reduces burdens on business. The hon. Lady asked me directly whether the Bill reduces regulation. Equally directly, I say yes it does. The reforms to workplace dispute resolution contained in clauses 1 to 7 will encourage employers and employees to find ways that make sense to them to sort out their disputes. In place of rigid statutory requirements that cost employers more than &#163;100 million a year, the ACAS code on discipline and grievance will provide guidance both to employers and employees on the principles of natural justice that enable disputes to be resolved effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="80714-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08071441000207">Our reforms enable ACAS conciliation to be even more effective by removing time limitations on when the service can offer help to parties in dispute. To support ACAS, we are investing up to &#163;37 million over the next three years to promote more early conciliation and to improve the ACAS advice line. That will help many people to resolve disputes without the stress and expense of a tribunal hearing.</p>

All of us who heard his speech were impressed by it. Clause 18 is the only  clause in the Bill which deals with trade union law. It appears in the Bill because we are obliged as a matter of policy to amend our law as soon as possible to comply with judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.

know, the clause, as originally drafted, provoked great concern from both sides of that House, including from Lord Morris of Handsworth, former general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union. We amended the clause to deal with those concerns. The amendments were heavily influenced by the views expressed by the Joint Committee on Human Rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80714-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08071441000210">Clause 18 deals with the way that the law balances conflicting human rights&#151;philosophically and legally a difficult and complex matter&#151;principally the rights of freedom of association and the right to freedom of political belief.

The net effect is to create greater freedom for trade unions to set and apply their own membership rules. However, that greater freedom is qualified by the creation of safeguards to prevent potential abuse. We believe that those safeguards are workable, clear and fully compatible with the way that trade unions run their internal affairs. The safeguards should not, therefore, give rise to mischievous litigation, as the TUC fears. We are also clear that the clause will ensure compliance with the European Court&#146;s judgment.</p>

 Absolutely right; I agree with the hon. Gentleman. We are concerned that removing reference to former membership of a political party would provide an avenue by which individuals with extreme political views could infiltrate a trade union. For example, a BNP member could resign his or her party membership on learning of the union&#146;s intention to expel him or her, only to rejoin once the threat of expulsion had passed. The process could continue indefinitely, thus imposing considerable administrative costs on the union and undermining its rights, as determined by the European courts.</p>

 I understand the point that the Minister is making about trade unions and people who have been past members of an organisation that is incompatible with the aims and objectives of a trade union.

 I understand the point, but there will be safeguards to ensure that that eventuality does not arise, and common sense will apply.

I simply but sincerely want to assure him about the Government&#146;s commitment to the three-member panel in all cases where the reasonableness of behaviour is an important element of the tribunal&#146;s consideration.

She talked about her early experience of being supported by her trade union&#151;the Royal College of Nursing&#151;so that, in those dark days, she was able to eat. Nevertheless, she now seems rather sceptical about the legislation that supports the rights of female employees. She did so on the basis of over-burdens, but I noted her concerns. Many hon.

That includes a great advance in female employment, with proper balances, so that people can have the right work-life and work-family balances. An interesting statistic shows that that is now being accepted by women and many employers: the proportion of mothers who change their employer when returning to work has fallen dramatically from 41 per cent. in 2002 to only 14 per cent. in 2007. That shows an acceptance by both the employer and the employee that we are getting the balance right, and it shows that more and more employers are doing the sensible thing of welcoming back, not just for legal reasons, valued female members of staff after they have had their babies.</p>

I still refer to her as my aunt, and she is the sister of one of the people who was killed, Phillip Garry. She was Eileen Garry, and my grandmother is also a Garry. Others have contacted me, and I have had conversations with Patricia Irvine, who is still highly traumatised, all these years later. Her mother was killed, and she has written a number of open letters to one of the bombing team&#151;a man who admitted that he was part of that team&#151;asking him to explain why he did it, and to tell her who the other three men involved were and the name of the person who planted the bomb.

At 8.45 pm on Saturday 4 December 1971, 15 people died as a result of a bomb explosion at McGurk&#146;s bar, 81 to 83 North Queen street, Belfast. I would like to write into the record the names of the innocent victims&#151;people who had no connection with any paramilitary organisation&#151;who were out for a quiet night with their wives or their friends. The people killed were: Francis Bradley, 62 years old; John Colton, 49 years old; James Francis Cromie, 13 years old; Phillip Garry, my uncle Philly, who was 73 years old; Kathleen Irvine, 54 years old, the mother of Patricia Irvine; Edward Laurence Kane, 29 years old; Thomas Kane, 48 years old; Edward Keenan, 69 years old; Sarah Keenan, 58 years old; Elizabeth Philomena McGurk, 46 years old, the wife of the publican who ran the Tramore bar, normally known as McGurk&#146;s bar; Maria McGurk, 14 years of age, the daughter of the McGurks; Thomas McLaughlin, 55 years old; David Milligan, 53 years old; James Patrick Smyth, 58 years old; and Robert Charles Spotswood, 35 years old.

He was a seaman and would entertain all the kids. To me, it is no surprise to find that he was a school crossing patrolman. I can imagine that he was quite a character even then, at 73 years old. I was at university when I heard that he had been blown up by a bomb in Belfast, where the Garry family lived&#151;some of our family had moved to the north and some had come over to work in the steel mills of Lanarkshire, including the husband of my grandmother, Michael Plunkett.</p>

The Gem bar was an IRA pub and was known as one&#151;it was where members of the IRA gathered. When the members of that UVF team got there, they were cowards. They did not try to plant the bomb in a pub that was run by the IRA, so they went to the nearest Catholic pub and bombed innocent people out for a quiet drink.</p>

 It really is a small world. When I was very young I went to the local school, St. Patrick&#146;s, and knew my hon. Friend&#146;s uncle Philly, the school patrolman who used to lead me across the road. My father knew him too, because they used to go to sea together before my hon.

 That was the point&#151;McGurk&#146;s bar was not a pub that was involved in the troubles. The bombing happened in &#146;71. The troubles were bubbling up and there had been a few bombings in the Province, but the attack saw the largest loss of life in one bombing at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="80714-0018.htm_para25"><a name="08071441000697">As far as I am concerned, the perpetrators&#151;Robert Campbell and his friends, the UVF hit men&#151;were cowards. They did not try to bomb the pub that they were sent to, but, according to the evidence that he gave after his trial, they were told, &#147;Don&#146;t come back until the job is done.&#148; The job was never done. The members of that team never bombed the Gem bar. They bombed a pub full of innocent people, putting the bomb inside a porch, which, as it happens, blew the walls out and roof off, killing the two children playing upstairs and 13 people in the public bar downstairs.</p>

The car was never found when it was abandoned, which is interesting. However, I do not care about that. What I care about is the documents in the report, including the situation reports, which were secret until 30 years thereafter. The Pat Finucane centre submitted those reports, having found them, to the historical inquiries team. It is clear from the reports that there was a travesty involving the Army, which said in the report that the bomb was clearly inside the pub, because five men standing around it were blown to smithereens. The Army said that the bombing was clearly an IRA own goal&#151;it said that the bomb was, in effect, in the pub in transit. That was then. The historical inquiries team report says that it was recommended that the Secretary of State answer a question in the House confirming that story.</p>

Protestant paramilitary operation. After that, a terrible, scurrilous article appeared in <i> The Guardian</i>, which had clearly been briefed by the Army, confirming the account in the situation report&#151;a secret document that was never referred to as the source&#151;and repeating the calumny that those innocent people out for a drink were an IRA team. In fact, the people who claimed responsibility&#151;the Empire Loyalists who phoned up&#151;said that they bombed the bar because IRA commanders and units met there, but they knew that to be a lie. Did their operating commander think that they had bombed the Gem bar, courageous soldiers that they were in the fight against the IRA? That possibly is true, because the report was that the pub that was bombed was an IRA hotbed, when it was in fact an innocent place where ordinary people gathered for a quiet night out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="80714-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08071441000700">That calumny ran as the founded story in Ireland until 1977, when Robert Campbell was arrested. I must criticise the historical inquiry&#146;s report for saying that he was arrested for bombing McGurk&#146;s bar as a result of intelligence, because he was not&#151;he was arrested because he shot a Protestant. He thought that he was going to shoot a Catholic, but he shot a Protestant; the Catholic men in the van he was targeting, who worked in a quarry, escaped. He was arrested because his own people shopped him for killing one of their own. He then asked for McGurk&#146;s bar to be taken into account and he admitted his role, saying that what he had done had troubled him ever since. He was a young man at the time of the bombing, but when they arrested him he was a platoon commander in the UVF and had no doubt carried out a number of other crimes in between. He got 20 years, of which he served 16.</p>

 No, I will not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="80714-0019.htm_para2"><a name="08071441000703">For six years, the approach taken in all the police reports&#151;this is clear from the historical inquiry team&#146;s report of the police reports&#151;was to keep trying to turn the evidence to suggest that the Army report was correct. The reports said things such as that the forensics showed there was no doubt that the bomb had been inside the pub. The forensic evidence did not come out until February, but Dr. Hall, who produced it, said that there was no doubt that the bomb had been placed outside the door or adjacent to it&#151;not in the pub at all. However, the police reports still spread the same story, and every single inquiry in the report shows that the police tried to pin the bombing on the people in the bar to show that they had killed themselves and their fellow citizens from the community. That is unforgivable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80714-0019.htm_para3"><a name="08071441000704">Another criticism that I have of the historical inquiry&#146;s report is that page 9, which discusses the killing of an Army major following the bombing, should not have been included, because it is not relevant. It is as if people are still trying to do the same thing&#151;to say that these innocent people were somehow caught up in what happened afterwards, but they had nothing do with it. My uncle Philly and his colleagues and friends had nothing to do with the IRA and other such organisations. If it was not for the Pat Finucane centre, I am not sure whether the historical inquiry&#146;s team would ever have seen the secret documents that are now in the public domain and in its report.</p>

I know that the McLaughlin family are very upset and still accuse people of collusion, and I do not know whether they will ever have reconciliation. However, I am looking for peace and reconciliation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80714-0019.htm_para6"><a name="08071441000707">Mr. Campbell refuses to be interviewed or to give any evidence and says that he wants the right to see his life out in peace and quiet now that he is in his 70s. I do not believe that that man should have that right; he was a coward and he was part of a cowardly team that killed innocent people. He is living here in England, and it behoves him to tell the families who planted the bomb and who his accomplices were. I do not think that he has paid his debt to society.</p>

We are clearly talking about a Government-sponsored, defence-sponsored method of operation, and books have been written about it. To suggest that these innocent people did this to themselves, their colleagues, their friends and their families is unforgivable, and the Government must be prepared to apologise publicly. I am disappointed that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is not replying to this debate. He may have the weight to be able to do what needs to be done. If he does not, I will be coming back to ask someone else further up the tree for an apology on behalf of the people who were killed at McGurk&#146;s bar.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty) on his success in obtaining this debate. It is an important topic for him not only because of the wider public interest but also, as he explained, because a member of his family&#151;Phillip Garry, about whom he has spoken so affectionately&#151;was killed in the indiscriminate and callous bombing of McGurk&#146;s bar in 1971, so I want to express at the outset my deepest sympathy to my hon. Friend and members of his wider family circle. I am also conscious that 14 other people&#151;including a 13-year-old child, James Francis Cromie&#151;were killed and 16 were injured. Thirty seven years on, the pain remains real for their families and friends, too. My hon. Friend spoke about the trauma that people still feel. This bombing   <br>

was, until the terrible bombing in Omagh in August 1998, the largest civilian loss of life in a single incident during the years of the troubles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80714-0019.htm_para8"><a name="08071441000710">We are discussing tonight one of 363 reports produced so far by Northern Ireland&#146;s Historical Enquiries Team. Established in 2005, the HET is part of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, but it is operationally independent and staffed by a mix of people, including former detectives from outside Northern Ireland. Just last week, in its latest report, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee expressed themselves</p>
<a name="80714-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="08071441000778"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;impressed by the personal commitment, sensitivity and professionalism of the Chief Constable, the Director of HET and the other staff involved in HET&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80714-0019.htm_para9"><a name="08071441000711">The HET is tasked with reviewing all 3,268 deaths that occurred as a result of the troubles between 1968 and 1998, with the twofold aim of striving to bring a measure of resolution to families and ensuring that all investigative and evidential opportunities are subject to thorough and exhaustive examination. Its approach is family centred and in its review of the McGurk&#146;s bar bombing, the HET has attempted to answer more than 50 questions from family members. To carry out this work effectively, the HET has developed a five-phase process that includes the collection, assessment and review of all relevant and available material followed by focused reinvestigation and resolution. In this review as in others, the HET accessed witness statements, forensic reports, the original police case papers and intelligence information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80714-0019.htm_para10"><a name="08071441000712">Every one of the deaths that occurred during the troubles is a tragedy, but each case is also unique and families will have different views and perspectives and different questions and issues of concern. Following the McGurk&#146;s bar bombing, the hurt and grief felt by all those directly affected and, indeed, by the wider community was intensified by the inaccurate commentary and reporting that it was the result of a so-called IRA &#147;own goal&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="80714-0019.htm_para11"><a name="08071441000713">In summary, the HET reached the following conclusions. The bomb was located inside McGurk&#146;s bar within a small, enclosed entrance area off Great George&#146;s street, but outside the public bar area where the victims and survivors were mainly located. The original target, as my hon. Friend mentioned, was probably the Gem bar rather than McGurk&#146;s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80714-0019.htm_para12"><a name="08071441000714">The Ulster Volunteer Force was responsible for the bombing and in 1978 Robert James Campbell pleaded guilty to 15 counts of murder and was given a life sentence. The HET found no evidence of collusion by the police or security services with the UVF and confirmed that the Royal Ulster Constabulary allocated substantial resources to the original investigation in 1971. Its assessment, however, was that those carrying out the investigation may have attributed more significance to the potential involvement of republican paramilitaries than the balance of evidence supported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80714-0019.htm_para13"><a name="08071441000715">The HET's report also documents in some detail the media reports of the bombing. It includes the transcript of an interview with an eight-year-old boy, Joseph McClory, who gave a very clear account of how he saw a man place the bomb in the porch of the pub. Even so, there was speculation that one or more of those inside the pub might have been responsible. As my hon. Friend said, the HET report includes a copy of a Ministry of Defence document stating&#151;this is a direct quotation from the document&#151;</p>

Friend the Secretary of State and I are deeply sorry not just for the appalling suffering and loss of life that occurred at McGurk&#146;s bar, but for the extraordinary additional pain caused to both the immediate families and the wider community by the erroneous suggestions made in the immediate aftermath of the explosion about who was responsible. Such perceptions and preconceived ideas should never have been allowed to cloud the actual evidence. My right hon. Friend said at the weekend that</p>
<a name="80714-0019.htm_brev6"><a name="08071441000784"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;one of the things politicians have to get much better at is actually taking on their responsibility and saying, I'm sorry&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80714-0019.htm_para21"><a name="08071441000722">I can tell my hon. Friend&#151;in addition to what I have said about the work of the HET&#151;that the police ombudsman carries responsibility for investigations when a death has been caused by the actions of a police officer, or when there is information that suggests that a police officer may have acted wrongly. Such cases are referred by the HET, and currently total 64. The police ombudsman also investigates cases in which a family, or a representative of a family, makes a complaint about the handling of a case by the police. The ombudsman is currently investigating 57 such cases, and I am aware that one relates directly to the McGurk&#146;s bar bombing. Although the ombudsman&#146;s work and reports are completely independent of the Government, I am informed that a report is expected shortly.</p>

the Independent Monitoring Commission has indicated, the Provisional IRA is now firmly committed to the political path, and Sinn Fein is an active partner in policing and in Government. Devolution last May put schools, hospitals and other public services under local control, and I hope that it will soon be possible to hand back policing and justice powers. This week&#146;s announcement by Bombardier about its new investment is a further sign of Northern Ireland's growing prosperity, building on long-term political stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80714-0019.htm_para23"><a name="08071441000724">However, the murders and conflict that scarred Northern Ireland for 40 years still leave their mark, which is why the work of the Consultative Group on the Past is so important. Trying to find a way of addressing the legacy of Northern Ireland&#146;s violent past in a way that does not overshadow the future remains one of the greatest challenges. The group&#146;s task is to consult widely to see if there is a consensus on how to proceed. Over the past year the group has met with more than 100 organisations, received 245 written submissions and held seven well-attended public meetings. During this process, it heard a wide range of opinions and experiences about the past and what it means for the present. The consultation period closed in January and the group is now reflecting on what it has heard. As part of its reflections, the group has considered the various mechanisms that are currently in place to deal with the past such as the Police Ombudsman, the public inquiries and the work of the HET. Indeed, during this consultation the group met the HET and some of the many families who have been through the HET process. The thoughts that these families have on this process, and all the other mechanisms in place, will be considered in its final report. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I are looking forward to receiving that report later in the year. While it is too soon to speculate on what the recommendations will be or how they can best be taken forward, it is important that any recommendations made are workable and capable of commanding widespread public support.</p>

It is helpful that they recognised publicly the differing views that exist, and that a public debate takes place on some of these very difficult issues.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for giving way, and I fully realise why he is addressing some of the wider issues to do with the past in terms of the broader work of the HET and the Consultative Group on the Past. Returning to the particulars of this debate and McGurk&#146;s bar, however, there is a widespread welcome for the spirit of apology offered by the Secretary of State, but he cannot apologise for everybody else. Does the Minister agree that it would be helpful if the Minister who made the offending and grossly misleading statement in the Stormont Parliament came forward and directly apologised, and will he also  <br>
